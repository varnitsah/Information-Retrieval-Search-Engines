87257272	maruja   by  bret harte     maruja    chapter i  morning was breaking on the high road to san jose  the long lines of dusty level track were beginning to extend their vanishing point in the growing light on either side the awakening fields of wheat and oats were stretching out and broadening to the sky  in the east and south the stars were receding before the coming day in the west a few still glimmered caught among the bosky hills of the canada del raimundo where night seemed to linger  thither some obscure lowflying birds were slowly winging thither a gray coyote overtaken by the morning was awkwardly limping  and thither a tramping wayfarer turned plowing through the dust of the highway still unslaked by the dewless night to climb the fence and likewise seek the distant cover  for some moments man and beast kept an equal pace and gait with a strange similarity of appearance and expression the coyote bearing that resemblance to his more civilized and harmless congener the dog which the tramp bore to the ordinary pedestrians but both exhibiting the same characteristics of lazy vagabondage and semilawlessness the coyotes slouching amble and uneasy stealthiness being repeated in the tramps shuffling step and sidelong glances both were young and physically vigorous but both displayed the same vacillating and awkward disinclination to direct effort  they continued thus half a mile apart unconscious of each other until the superior faculties of the brute warned him of the contiguity of aggressive civilization and he cantered off suddenly to the right fully five minutes before the barking of dogs caused the man to make a detour to the left to avoid entrance upon a cultivated domain that lay before him  the trail he took led to one of the scant watercourses that issued half spent from the canada to fade out utterly on the hot june plain it was thickly bordered with willows and alders that made an arbored and feasible path through the dense woods and undergrowth  he continued along it as if aimlessly stopping from time to time to look at different objects in a dull mechanical fashion as if rather to prolong his useless hours than from any curious instinct and to occasionally dip in the unfrequent pools of water the few crusts of bread he had taken from his pocket even this appeared to be suggested more by coincidence of material in the bread and water than from the promptings of hunger  at last he reached a cuplike hollow in the hills lined with wild clover and thick with resinous odors  here he crept under a manzanitabush and disposed himself to sleep  the act showed he was already familiar with the local habits of his class who used the unfailing dry starlit nights for their wanderings and spent the hours of glaring sunshine asleep or resting in some wayside shadow  meanwhile the light quickened and gradually disclosed the form and outline of the adjacent domain  an avenue cut through a parklike wood carefully cleared of the undergrowth of gigantic ferns peculiar to the locality led to the entrance of the canada  here began a vast terrace of lawn broken up by enormous bouquets of flowerbeds bewildering in color and profusion from which again rose the flowering vines and trailing shrubs that hid pillars veranda and even the long facade of a great and dominant mansion but the delicacy of floral outlines running to the capitals of columns and at times mounting to the pediment of the roof the opulence of flashing color or the massing of tropical foliage could not deprive it of the imperious dignity of size and space much of this was due to the fact that the original casaan adobe house of no mean pretensions dating back to the early spanish occupationhad been kept intact sheathed in a shell of darkred wood and still retaining its patio or inner courtyard surrounded by low galleries while additions greater in extent than the main building had been erectednot as wings and projections but massed upon it on either side changing its rigid square outlines to a vague parallelogram  while the patio retained the spanish conception of al fresco seclusion a vast colonnade of veranda on the southern side was a concession to american taste and its breadth gave that depth of shadow to the inner rooms which had been lost in the thinner shell of the new erection  its cloistered gloom was lightened by the red fires of cardinal flowers dropping from the roof by the yellow sunshine of the jessamine creeping up the columns by billows of heliotropes breaking over its base as a purple sea  nowhere else did the opulence of this climate of blossoms show itself as vividly  even the castilian roses that grew as vines along the east front the fuchsias that attained the dignity of trees in the patio or the four or five monster passionvines that bestarred the low western wall and told over and over again their mystic storypaled before the sensuous glory of the south veranda  as the sun arose that part of the quiet house first touched by its light seemed to waken  a few lounging peons and servants made their appearance at the entrance of the patio occasionally reinforced by an earlier life from the gardens and stables  but the south facade of the building had not apparently gone to bed at all lights were still burning dimly in the large ballroom a tray with glasses stood upon the veranda near one of the open french windows and further on a halfshut yellow fan lay like a fallen leaf  the sound of carriagewheels on the gravel terrace brought with it voices and laughter and the swiftly passing vision of a charabancs filled with muffled figures bending low to avoid the direct advances of the sun  as the carriage rolled away four men lounged out of a window on the veranda shading their eyes against the level beams  one was still in evening dress and one in the uniform of a captain of artillery the others had already changed their gala attire the elder of the party having assumed those extravagant tweeds which the tourist from great britain usually offers as a gentle concession to inferior yet more florid civilization  nevertheless he beamed back heartily on the sun and remarked in a pleasant scotch accent that  did they know it was very extraordinary how clear the morning was so free from clouds and mist and fog  the young man in evening dress fluently agreed to the facts and suggested in idiomatic frenchenglish that one comprehended that the bed was an insult to ones higher nature and an ingratitude to their gracious hostess who had spread out this lovely garden and walks for their pleasure that nothing was more beautiful than the dew sparkling on the rose or the matin song of the little birds  the other young man here felt called upon to point out the fact that there was no dew in california and that the birds did not sing in that part of the country  the foreign young gentleman received this statement with pain and astonishment as to the fact with passionate remorse as to his own ignorance  but still as it was a charming day would not his gallant friend the captain here accept the challenge of the brave englishman and walk him for the glory of his flag and a thousand pounds  the gallant captain unfortunately believed that if he walked out in his uniform he would suffer some delay from being interrogated by wayfarers as to the locality of the circus he would be pleasantly supposed to represent even if he escaped being shot as a rare california bird by the foreign sporting contingent  in these circumstances he would simply lounge around the house until his carriage was ready  much as it pained him to withdraw from such amusing companions the foreign young gentleman here felt that he too would retire for the present to change his garments and glided back through the window at the same moment that the young officer carelessly stepped from the veranda and lounged towards the shrubbery  theyve been watching each other for the last hour  i wonder whats up said the young man who remained  the remark without being confidential was so clearly the first sentence of natural conversation that the scotchman although relieved said eh man a little cautiously  its as clear as this sunshine that captain carroll and garnier are each particularly anxious to know what the other is doing or intends to do this morning  why did they separate then asked the other  thats a mere blind  garniers looking through his window now at carroll and carroll is aware of it  eh said the scotchman with goodhumored curiosity  is it a quarrel  nothing serious i hope  no revolvers and bowieknives man before breakfast eh  no laughed the younger man  no  to do maruja justice she generally makes a fellow too preposterous to fight  i see you dont understand  youre a stranger im an old habitue of the houselet me explain  both of these men are in love with maruja or worse than that they firmly believe her to be in love with them  but miss maruja is the eldest daughter of our hostess is she not said the scotchman and i understood from one of the young ladies that the captain had come down from the fort particularly to pay court to miss amita the beauty  possibly  but that wouldnt prevent maruja from flirting with him  eh but are you not mistaken mr raymond  certainly a more quiet modest and demure young lassie i never met  thats because she sat out two waltzes with you and let you do the talking while she simply listened  the elder mans fresh color for an instant heightened but he recovered himself with a goodhumored laugh  likelylikely shes a capital good listener  youre not the first man that found her eloquent  stanton your banking friend who never talks of anything but mines and stocks says shes the only woman who has any conversation and we can all swear that she never said two words to him the whole time she sat next to him at dinner  but she looked at him as if she had  why man woman and child all give her credit for any grace that pleases themselves  and why  because shes clever enough not to practice any one of themas graces  i dont know the girl that claims less and gets more  for instance you dont call her pretty   wait a bit  yell not get on so fast my young friend im not prepared to say that shes not returned the scotchman with goodhumored yet serious caution  but you would have been prepared yesterday and have said it  she can produce the effect of the prettiest girl here and without challenging comparison  nobody thinks of hereverybody experiences her  youre an enthusiast mr raymond  as an habitue of the house of course you  oh my time came with the rest laughed the young man with unaffected frankness  its about two years ago now  i seeyou were not a marrying man  pardon meit was because i was  the scotchman looked at him curiously  maruja is an heiress  i am a mining engineer  but my dear fellow i thought that in your country  in my country yes  but we are standing on a bit of old spain this land was given to dona maria saltonstalls ancestors by charles v look around you  this veranda this larger shell of the ancient casa is the work of the old salem whaling captain that she married and is all that is american here  but the heart of the house as well as the life that circles around the old patio is spanish  the donas family the estudillos and guitierrez always looked down upon this alliance with the yankee captain though it brought improvement to the land and increased its value fortyfold and since his death ever opposed any further foreign intervention  not that that would weigh much with maruja if she took a fancy to any one spanish as she is throughout in thought and grace and feature there is enough of the old salem witches blood in her to defy law and authority in following an unhallowed worship  there are no sons she is the sole heiress of the house and estatethough according to the native custom her sisters will be separately portioned from the other property which is very large  then the captain might still make a pretty penny on amita said the scotchman  if he did not risk and lose it all on maruja  there is enough of the old spanish jealousy in the blood to make even the gentle amita never forgive his momentary defection  something in his manner made the scotchman think that raymond spoke from baleful experience  how else could this attractive young fellow educated abroad and a rising man in his profession have failed to profit by his contiguity to such advantages and the fact of his being an evident favorite  but with this opposition on the part of the relatives to any further alliances with your countrymen why does our hostess expose her daughters to their fascinating influence said the elder man glancing at his companion  the girls seem to have the usual american freedom  perhaps they are therefore the less likely to give it up to the first man who asks them  but the spanish duenna still survives in the familythe more awful because invisible  its a mysterious fact that as soon as a fellow becomes particularly attached to any oneexcept marujahe receives some intimation from pereo  what the butler  that indianlooking fellow  a servant  pardon methe mayordomo  the old confidential servitor who stands in loco parentis  no one knows what he says  if the victim appeals to the mistress she is indisposed you know she has such bad health  if in his madness he makes a confidante of maruja that finishes him  how  why he ends by transferring his young affections to herwith the usual result  then you dont think our friend the captain has had this confidential butler ask his intentions yet  i dont think it will be necessary said the other dryly  umph  meantime the captain has just vanished through yon shrubbery i suppose thats the end of the mysterious espionage you have discovered  no  deil take it but theres that frenchman popping out of the myrtlebush  how did the fellow get there  and bless me heres our lassie too  yes said raymond in a changed voice its maruja  she had approached so noiselessly along the bank that bordered the veranda gliding from pillar to pillar as she paused before each to search for some particular flower that both men felt an uneasy consciousness  but she betrayed no indication of their presence by look or gesture  so absorbed and abstracted she seemed that by a common instinct they both drew nearer the window and silently waited for her to pass or recognize them  she halted a few paces off to fasten a flower in her girdle  a small youthful figure in a pale yellow dress lacking even the maturity of womanly outline  the full oval of her face the straight line of her back a slight boyishness in the contour of her hips the infantine smallness of her sandaled feet and narrow hands were all suggestive of fresh innocent amiable youthand nothing more  forgetting himself the elder man mischievously crushed his companion against the wall in mock virtuous indignation  eh sir he whispered with an accent that broadened with his feelings  eh but look at the puir wee lassie  will ye no be ashamed o yerself for putting the tricks of a circe on sic a honest gentle bairn  why man youll be seein the sign of a limb of satan in a bit thing with the mothers milk not yet out of her she a flirt speerin at men with that modest downcast air  im ashamed of ye mister raymond  shes only thinking of her breakfast puir thing and not of yon callant another sacrilegious word and ill expose you to her  have ye no pity on youth and innocence  let me up groaned raymond feebly and ill tell you how old she is  hushshes looking  the two men straightened themselves  she had indeed lifted her eyes towards the window  they were beautiful eyes and charged with something more than their own beauty  with a deep brunette setting even to the darkened cornea the pupils were blue as the sky above them  but they were lit with another intelligence  the soul of the salem whaler looked out of the passiondarkened orbits of the mother and was resistless  she smiled recognition of the two men with sedate girlishness and a foreign inclination of the head over the flowers she was holding her straight curveless mouth became suddenly charming with the parting of her lips over her white teeth and left the impress of the smile in a lighting of the whole face even after it had passed then she moved away  at the same moment garnier approached her  come away man and have our walk said the scotchman seizing raymonds arm  well not spoil that fellows sport  no but she will i fear  look mr buchanan if she hasnt given him her flowers to carry to the house while she waits here for the captain  come away scoffer said buchanan goodhumoredly locking his arm in the young mans and dragging him from the veranda towards the avenue and keep your observations for breakfast    chapter ii  in the mean time the young officer who had disappeared in the shrubbery whether he had or had not been a spectator of the scene exhibited some signs of agitation  he walked rapidly on occasionally switching the air with a wand of willow from which he had impatiently plucked the leaves through an alley of ceanothus until he reached a little thicket of evergreens which seemed to oppose his further progress  turning to one side however he quickly found an entrance to a labyrinthine walk which led him at last to an open space and a rustic summerhouse that stood beneath a gnarled and venerable peartree  the summerhouse was a quaint stockade of dark madrono boughs thatched with redwood bark strongly suggestive of deeper woodland shadow  but in strange contrast the floor table and benches were thickly strewn with faded roseleaves scattered as if in some riotous play of children  captain carroll brushed them aside hurriedly with his impatient foot glanced around hastily then threw himself on the rustic bench at full length and twisted his mustache between his nervous fingers  then he rose as suddenly with a few white petals impaled on his gilded spurs and stepped quickly into the open sunlight  he must have been mistaken  everything was quiet around him the faroff sound of wheels in the avenue came faintly but nothing more  his eye fell upon the peartree and even in his preoccupation he was struck with the signs of its extraordinary age  twisted out of all proportion and knotted with excrescences it was supported by iron bands and heavy stakes as if to prop up its senile decay  he tried to interest himself in the various initials and symbols deeply carved in bark now swollen and half obliterated  as he turned back to the summerhouse he for the first time noticed that the ground rose behind it into a long undulation on the crest of which the same singular profusion of roseleaves were scattered it struck him as being strangely like a gigantic grave and that the same idea had occurred to the fantastic dispenser of the withered flowers  he was still looking at it when a rustle in the undergrowth made his heart beat expectantly  a slinking gray shadow crossed the undulation and disappeared in the thicket  it was a coyote  at any other time the extraordinary appearance of this vivid impersonation of the wilderness so near a centre of human civilization and habitation would have filled him with wonder  but he had room for only a single thought now would she come  five minutes passed  he no longer waited in the summerhouse but paced impatiently before the entrance to the labyrinth  another five minutes  he was deceived undoubtedly  she and her sisters were probably waiting for him and laughing at him on the lawn  he ground his heel into the clover and threw his switch into the thicket  yet he would give her oneonly one moment more  captain carroll  the voice had been and was to him the sweetest in the world but even a stranger could not have resisted the spell of its musical inflection he turned quickly  she was advancing towards him from the summerhouse  did you think i was coming that waywhere everybody could follow me she laughed softly  no i came through the thicket over there indicating the direction with her flexible shoulder and nearly lost my slipper and my eyeslook  she threw back the inseparable lace shawl from her blond head and showed a spray of myrtle clinging like a broken wreath to her forehead  the young officer remained gazing at her silently  i like to hear you speak my name he said with a slight hesitation in his breath  say it again  carroll carroll carroll she murmured gently to herself two or three times as if enjoying her own native trilling of the rs its a pretty name  it sounds like a song  don carroll eh  el capitan don carroll  but my first name is henry he said faintly  enrythats not so good  don enrico will do  but el capitan carroll is best of all  i must have it always el capitan carroll  always  he colored like a boy  why not  he was confusedly trying to look through her brown lashes she was parrying him with the steel of her fathers glance come well  captain carroll  it was not to tell me your namethat i knew already was prettycarroll she murmured again caressing him with her lashes it was not for this that you asked me to meet you face to face in thiscoldshe made a movement of drawing her lace over her shoulderscold daylight  that belonged to the lights and the dance and the music of last night  it is not for this you expect me to leave my guests to run away from monsieur garnier who pays compliments but whose name is not prettyfrom mr raymond who talks of me when he cant talk to me they will say this captain carroll could say all that before them  but if they knew said the young officer drawing closer to her with a paling face but brightening eyes if they knew i had anything else to say miss saltonstallsomethingpardon medid i hurt your handsomething for her aloneis there one of them that would have the right to object  do not think me foolish miss saltonstallbuti begi implore you to tell me before i say more  who would have a right said maruja withdrawing her hand but not her dangerous eyes  who would dare forbid you talking to me of my sister i have told you that amita is freeas we all are  captain carroll fell back a few steps and gazed at her with a troubled face  it is possible that you have misunderstood miss saltonstall he faltered  do you still think it is amita that ihe stopped and added passionately do you remember what i told youhave you forgotten last night  last night waslast night said maruja slightly lifting her shoulders  one makes love at nightone marries in daylight  in the music in the flowers in the moonlight one says everything in the morning one has breakfastwhen one is not asked to have councils of war with captains and commandantes  you would speak of my sister captain carrollgo on  dona amita carroll sounds very very pretty i shall not object  she held out both her hands to him threw her head back and smiled  he seized her hands passionately  no no you shall hear meyou shall understand me  i love you marujayou and you alone  god knows i can not help itgod knows i would not help it if i could hear me  i will be calm  no one can hear us where we stand  i am not mad i am not a traitor  i frankly admired your sister  i came here to see her  beyond that i swear to you i am guiltless to herto you  even she knows no more of me than that  i saw you maruja  from that moment i have thought of nothingdreamed of nothing else  that isthree four five days and one afternoon ago  you see i remember  and now you wantwhat  to let me love you and you only  to let me be with you  to let me win you in time as you should be won  i am not mad though i am desperate  i know what is due to your station and mineeven while i dare to say i love you  let me hope maruja i only ask to hope  she looked at him until she had absorbed all the burning fever of his eyes until her ears tingled with his passionate voice and thenshe shook her head  it can not be carrollno never  he drew himself up under the blow with such simple and manly dignity that her eyes dropped for the moment  there is another then he said sadly  there is no one i care for better than you  no  do not be foolish let me go  i tell you that because you can be nothing to meyou understand to me  to my sister amita yes  the young soldier raised his head coldly  i have pressed you hard miss saltonstalltoo hard i know for a man who has already had his answer but i did not deserve this  goodby  stop she said gently  i meant not to hurt you captain carroll if i had it is not thus i would have done  i need not have met you here  would you have loved me the less if i had avoided this meeting  he could not reply  in the depths of his miserable heart he knew that he would have loved her the same  come she said laying her hand softly on his arm do not be angry with me for putting you back only five days to where you were when you first entered our house  five days is not much of happiness or sorrow to forget is it carrollcaptain carroll her voice died away in a faint sigh  do not be angry with me ifknowing you could be nothing morei wanted you to love my sister and my sister to love you  we should have been good friendssuch good friends  why do you say knowing it could he nothing more said carroll grasping her hand suddenly  in the name of heaven tell me what you mean  i mean i can not marry unless i marry one of my mothers race that is my mothers wish and the will of her relations  you are an american not of spanish blood  but surely this is not your determination  she shrugged her shoulders  what would you  it is the determination of my people  but knowing thishe stopped the quick blood rose to his face  go on captain carroll  you would say knowing this why did i not warn you  why did i not say to you when we first met you have come to address my sister do not fall in love with mei can not marry a foreigner  you are cruel maruja  but if that is all surely this prejudice can be removed  why your mother married a foreigneran american  perhaps that is why said the girl quietly  she cast down her long lashes and with the point of her satin slipper smoothed out the soft leaves of the clover at her feet  listen shall i tell you the story of our house  stop some one is coming  dont move remain as you are  if you care for me carroll collect yourself and dont let that man think he has found us ridiculous  her voice changed from its tone of slight caressing pleading to one of suppressed pride  he will not laugh much captain carroll truly no  the figure of garnier bright selfpossessed courteous appeared at the opening of the labyrinth  too wellbred to suggest even in complimentary raillery a possible sentimental situation his politeness went further  it was so kind in them to guide an awkward stranger by their voices to the places where he could not stupidly intrude  you are just in time to interrupt or to hear a story that i have been threatening to tell she said composedly an old spanish legend of this house  you are in the majority now you two and can stop me if you choose  thank you  i warn you it is stupid it isnt new but it has the excuse of being suggested by this very spot  she cast a quick look of subtle meaning at carroll and throughout her recital appealed more directly to him in a manner delicately yet sufficiently marked to partly soothe his troubled spirit  far back in the very old times caballeros said maruja standing by the table in mock solemnity and rapping upon it with her fan this place was the home of the coyote  big and little father and mother senor and senora coyotes and the little muchacho coyotes had their home in the dark canada and came out over these fields yellow with wild oats and red with poppies to seek their prey  they were happy for why  they were the first they had no history you comprehend no tradition  they married as they liked with a glance at carroll nobody objected they increased and multiplied  but the plains were fertile the game was plentiful it was not fit that it should be for the beasts alone  and so in the course of time an indian chief a heathen koorotora built his wigwam here  i beg your pardon said garnier in apparent distress but i caught the gentlemans name imperfectly  fully aware that the questioner only wished to hear again her musical enunciation of the consonants she repeated koorotora with an apologetic glance at carroll and went on  this gentleman had no history or tradition to bother him either whatever senor coyote thought of the matter he contented himself with robbing senor koorotoras wigwam when he could and skulking around the indians camp at night  the old chief prospered and made many journeys round the country but always kept his camp here  this lasted until the time when the holy fathers came from the south and portala as you have all read uplifted the wooden cross on the seacoast over there and left it for the heathens to wonder at koorotora saw it on one of his journeys and came back to the canada full of this wonder  now koorotora had a wife  ah we shall commence now  we are at the beginning  this is better than senora coyota said garnier cheerfully  naturally she was anxious to see the wonderful object  she saw it and she saw the holy fathers and they converted her against the superstitious heathenish wishes of her husband  and more than that they came here  and converted the land also is it not so  it was a lovely site for a mission interpolated garnier politely  they built a mission and brought as many of koorotoras people as they could into the sacred fold  they brought them in in a queer fashion sometimes it is said dragoons from the presidio captain carroll lassoing them and bringing them in at the tails of their horses  all except koorotora  he defied them he cursed them and his wife in his wicked heathenish fashion and said that they too should lose the mission through the treachery of some woman and that the coyote should yet prowl through the ruined walls of the church  the holy fathers pitied the wicked manand built themselves a lovely garden  look at that peartree  there is all that is left of it  she turned with a mock heroic gesture and pointed her fan to the peartree  garnier lifted his hands in equally simulated wonder a sudden recollection of the coyote of the morning recurred to carroll uneasily  and the indians he said with an effort to shake off the feeling they too have vanished  all that remained of them is in yonder mound  it is the grave of the chief and his people  he never lived to see the fulfillment of his prophecy  for it was a year after his death that our ancestor manuel guitierrez came from old spain to the presidio with a grant of twenty leagues to settle where he chose  dona maria guitierrez took a fancy to the canada  but it was a site already in possession of the holy church  one night through treachery it was said the guards were withdrawn and the indians entered the mission slaughtered the lay brethren and drove away the priests the commandant at the presidio retook the place from the heathens but on representation to the governor that it was indefensible for the peaceful fathers without a large military guard the official ordered the removal of the mission to santa cruz and don manuel settled his twenty leagues grant in the canada  whether he or dona maria had anything to do with the indian uprising no one knows but father pedro never forgave them  he is said to have declared at the foot of the altar that the curse of the church was on the land and that it should always pass into the hands of the stranger  and that was long ago and the property is still in the family said carroll hurriedly answering marujas eyes  in the last hundred years there have been no male heirs continued maruja still regarding carroll  when my mother who was the eldest daughter married don jose saltonstall against the wishes of the family it was said that the curse would fall  sure enough caballeros it was that year that the forged grants of micheltorrena were discovered and in our lawsuit your government captain handed over ten leagues of the llano land to the doctor west our neighbor  ah the grayheaded gentleman who lunched here the other day  you are friends then  you bear no malice said garnier  what would you said maruja with a slight shrug of her shoulders he paid his money to the forger  your corregidores upheld him and said it was no forgery she continued to carroll  in spite of the implied reproach carroll felt relieved  he began to be impatient of garniers presence and longed to renew his suit perhaps his face showed something of this for maruja added with mock demureness its always dreadful to be the eldest sister but think what it is to be in the direct line of a curse now theres amitashes free to do as she likes with no family responsibility while poor me  she dropped her eyes but not until they had again sought and halfreproved the brightening eyes of carroll  but said garnier with a sudden change from his easy security and courteous indifference to an almost harsh impatience you do not mean to say mademoiselle that you have the least belief in this rubbish this ridiculous canard  marujas straight mouth quickly tightened over her teeth  she shot a significant glance at carroll but instantly resumed her former manner  it matters little what a foolish girl like myself believes  the rest of the family even the servants and children all believe it it is a part of their religion  look at these flowers around the peartree and scattered on that indian mound  they regularly find their way there on saints days and festas  they are not rubbish monsieur garnier they are propitiatory sacrifices  pereo would believe that a temblor would swallow up the casa if we should ever forego these customary rites  is it a mere absurdity that forced my father to build these modern additions around the heart of the old adobe house leaving it untouched so that the curse might not be fulfilled even by implication  she had assumed an air of such pretty earnestness and passion her satin face was illuminated as by some softly sensuous light within more bewildering than mere color that garnier all devoted eyes and courteous blandishment broke out but this curse must fall harmlessly before the incarnation of blessing miss saltonstall has no more to fear than the angels  she is the one predestined through her charm through her goodness to lift it forever  carroll could not have helped echoing the aspirations of his rival had not the next words of his mistress thrilled him with superstitious terror  a thousand thanks senor  who knows  but i shall have warning when it falls  a day or two before the awful invader arrives a coyote suddenly appears in broad daylight mysteriously near the casa  this midnight marauder now banished to the thickest canyon comes again to prowl around the home of his ancestors  caramba senor captain what are you staring at  you frighten me  stop it i say  she had turned upon him stamping her little foot in quite a frightened childlike way  nothing laughed carroll the quick blood returning to his cheek but you must not be angry with one for being quite carried away with your dramatic intensity  by jove  i thought i could see the whole thing while you were speakingthe old indian the priest and the coyote  his eyes sparkled  the wild thought had occurred to him that perhaps in spite of himself he was the young womans predestined fate and in the very selfishness of his passion he smiled at the mere material loss of lands and prestige that would follow it  then the coyote has always preceded some change in the family fortunes he asked boldly  on my mothers weddingday said maruja in a lower voice after the party had come from church to supper in the old casa my father asked what dog is that under the table  when they lifted the cloth to look a coyote rushed from the very midst of the guests and dashed out across the patio  no one knew how or when he entered  heaven grant that we do not find he has eaten our breakfast said garnier gayly for i judge it is waiting us  i hear your sisters voice among the others crossing the lawn  shall we tear ourselves away from the tombs of our ancestors and join them  not as i am looking now thank you said maruja throwing the lace over her head  i shall not submit myself to a comparison of their fresher faces and toilets by you two gentlemen  go you both and join them  i shall wait and say an ave for the soul of koorotora and slip back alone the way i came  she had steadily evaded the pleading glance of carroll and though her bright face and unblemished toilet showed the inefficiency of her excuse it was evident that her wish to be alone was genuine and without coquetry  they could only lift their hats and turn regretfully away  as the red cap of the young officer disappeared amidst the evergreen foliage the young woman uttered a faint sigh which she repeated a moment after as a slight nervous yawn  then she opened and shut her fan once or twice striking the sticks against her little pale palm and then gathering the lace under her oval chin with one hand and catching her fan and skirt with the other bent her head and dipped into the bushes  she came out on the other side near a low fence that separated the park from a narrow lane which communicated with the high road beyond  as she neared the fence a slinking figure limped along the lane before her  it was the tramp of the early morning  they raised their heads at the same moment and their eyes met  the tramp in that clearer light showed a spare but bent figure roughly clad in a miners shirt and canvas trousers splashed and streaked with soil and half hidden in a ragged blue castoff army overcoat lazily hanging from one shoulder  his thin sunburnt face was not without a certain sullen suspicious intelligence and a look of halfsneering defiance  he stopped as a startled surly animal might have stopped at some unusual object but did not exhibit any other discomposure maruja stopped at the same moment on her side of the fence  the tramp looked at her deliberately and then slowly lowered his eyes im looking for the san jose road hereabouts  ye dont happen to know it he said addressing himself to the top of the fence  it had been said that it was not marujas way to encounter man woman or child old or young without an attempt at subjugation strong in her power and salient with fascination she leaned gently over the fence and with the fan raised to her delicate ear made him repeat his question under the soft fire of her fringed eyes he did so but incompletely and with querulous laziness  lookinforsan jose roadherebouts  the road to san jose said maruja with gentle slowness as if not unwilling to protract the conversation is about two miles from here it is the high road to the left fronting the plain there is another way if  dont want it  mornin  he dropped his head suddenly forward and limped away in the sunlight    chapter iii  breakfast usually a movable feast at la mision perdida had been prolonged until past midday the last of the dance guests had flown and the home partywith the exception of captain carroll who had returned to duty at his distant postwere dispersing some as riding cavalcades to neighboring points of interest some to visit certain notable mansions which the wealth of a rapid civilization had erected in that fertile valley  one of these in particular the work of a breathless millionaire was famous for the spontaneity of its growth and the reckless extravagance of its appointments  if you go to aladdins palace said maruja from the top step of the south porch to a wagonette of guests after youve seen the stables with mahogany fittings for one hundred horses ask aladdin to show you the enchanted chamber inlaid with california woods and paved with gold quartz  we would have a better chance if the princess of china would only go with us pleaded garnier gallantly  the princess will stay at home with her mother like a good girl returned maruja demurely  a bad shot of garniers this time whispered raymond to buchanan as the vehicle rolled away with them  the princess is not likely to visit aladdin again  why  the last time she was there aladdin was a little too persian in his extravagance offered her his house stables and himself  not a bad catchwhy hes worth two millions i hear  yes but his wife is as extravagant as himself  his wife eh  ah are you serious or must you say something derogatory of the lassies admirers too said buchanan playfully threatening him with his cane  another word and ill throw you from the wagon  after their departure the outer shell of the great house fell into a profound silence so hollow and deserted that one might have thought the curse of koorotora had already descended upon it  dead leaves of roses and fallen blossoms from the long line of vinewreathed columns lay thick on the empty stretch of brown veranda or rustled and crept against the sides of the house where the regular breath of the afternoon trades began to arise  a few cardinal flowers fell like drops of blood before the open windows of the vacant ballroom in which the step of a solitary servant echoed faintly  it was marujas maid bringing a note to her young mistress who in a flounced morning dress leaned against the window  maruja took it glanced at it quietly folded it in a long fold and put it openly in her belt captain carroll from whom it came might have carried one of his despatches as methodically the waitingwoman noticed the act and was moved to suggest some more exciting confidences  the dona maruja has without doubt noticed the bouquet on her dressingroom table from the senor garnier  the dona maruja had  the dona maruja had also learned with pain that bribed by judaslike coin faquita had betrayed the secrets of her wardrobe to the extent of furnishing a ribbon from a certain yellow dress to the senor buchanan to match with a chinese fan this was intolerable  faquita writhed in remorse and averred that through this solitary act she had dishonored her family  the dona maruja however since it was so felt that the only thing left to do was to give her the polluted dress and trust that the devil might not fly away with her  leaving the perfectly consoled faquita maruja crossed the large hall and opening a small door entered a dark passage through the thick adobe wall of the old casa and apparently left the present century behind her  a peaceful atmosphere of the past surrounded her not only in the low vaulted halls terminating in grilles or barred windows not only in the square chambers whose dark rich but scanty furniture was only a foil to the central elegance of the lacebordered bed and pillows but in a certain mysterious odor of dried and desiccated religious respectability that penetrated everywhere and made the grateful twilight redolent of the generations of forgotten guitierrez who had quietly exhaled in the old house  a mist as of incense and flowers that had lost their first bloom veiled the vista of the long corridor and made the staring blue sky seen through narrow windows and loopholes glitter like mirrors let into the walls  the chamber assigned to the young ladies seemed half oratory and half sleepingroom with a strange mingling of the convent in the bare white walls hung only with crucifixes and religious emblems and of the seraglio in the glimpses of lazy figures reclining in the deshabille of short silken saya low camisa and dropping slippers  in a broad angle of the corridor giving upon the patio its balustrade hung with brightly colored serapes and shawls surrounded by voluble domestics and relations the mistress of the casa half reclined in a hammock and gave her noonday audience  maruja pushed her way through the clustered stools and cushions to her mothers side kissed her on the forehead and then lightly perched herself like a white dove on the railing  mrs saltonstall a dark corpulent woman redeemed only from coarseness by a certain softness of expression and refinement of gesture raised her heavy brown eyes to her daughters face  you have not been to bed mara  no dear  do i look it  you must lie down presently  they tell me that captain carroll returned suddenly this morning  do you care  who knows  amita does not seem to fancy jose esteban jorge or any of her cousins  she wont look at juan estudillo  the captain is not bad  he is of the government  he is  not more than ten leagues from here said maruja playing with the captains note in her belt  you can send for him dear little mother he will be glad  you will ever talk lightlylike your father  she was not then grievedour amitaeh  she and dorotea and the two wilsons went off with raymond and your scotch friend in the wagonette  she did not cryto raymond  good said mrs saltonstall leaning back in her hammock raymond is an old friend  you had better take your siesta now child to be bright for dinner  i expect a visitor this afternoondr west  again  what will pereo say little mother  pereo said the widow sitting up again in her hammock with impatience pereo is becoming intolerable  the man is as mad as don quixote it is impossible to conceal his eccentric impertinence and interference from strangers who can not understand his confidential position in our house or his long service  there are no more mayordomos child  the vallejos the briones the castros do without them now  dr west says wisely they are ridiculous survivals of the patriarchal system  and can be replaced by intelligent strangers interrupted maruja demurely  the more easily if the patriarchal system has not been able to preserve the respect due from children to parents  no maruja no i am offended  do not touch me  and your hair is coming down and your eyes have rings like owls  you uphold this fanatical pereo because he leaves you alone and stalks your poor sisters and their escorts like the indian whose blood is in his veins  the saints only can tell if he did not disgust this captain carroll into flight  he believes himself the sole custodian of the honor of our familythat he has a sacred mission from this don fulano of koorotora to avert its fate without doubt he keeps up his delusions with aguardiente and passes for a prophet among the silly peons and servants  he frightens the children with his ridiculous stories and teaches them to decorate that heathen mound as if it were a shrine of our lady of sorrows  he was almost rude to dr west yesterday  but you have encouraged him in his confidential position here said maruja  you forget my mother how you got him to duena euriqueta with the colonel brown how you let him frighten the young englishman who was too attentive to dorotea how you set him even upon poor raymond and failed so dismally that i had to take him myself in hand  but if i choose to charge him with explanations that i can not make myself without derogating from the timehonored hospitality of the casa that is another thing  it is not said dona maria with a certain massive dignity that inconsistent as it was with the weakness of her argument was not without impressiveness it is not yet blessed santa maria that we are obliged to take notice ourself of the pretensions of every guest beneath our roof like the matchmaking daughterselling english and americans  and then pereo had tact and discrimination  now he is mad  there are strangers and strangers the whole valley is full of themone can discriminate since the old families year by year are growing less  surely not said maruja innocently  there is the excellent ramierrez who has lately almost taken him a wife from the singinghall in san francisco he may yet be snatched from the fire  there is the youthful jose castro the sole padrono of our national bullfight at soquel the famous horsebreaker and the winner of i know not how many races  and have we not vincente peralta who will run it is said for the american congress  he can read and writetruly i have a letter from him here  she turned back the folded slip of captain carrolls note and discovered another below  mrs saltonstall tapped her daughters hand with her fan  you jest at them yet you uphold pereo  go now and sleep yourself into a better frame of mind  stop  i hear the doctors horse run and see that pereo receives him properly  maruja had barely entered the dark corridor when she came upon the visitora gray hardfeatured man of sixtywho had evidently entered without ceremony  i see you did not wait to be announced she said sweetly  my mother will be flattered by your impatience you will find her in the patio  pereo did not announce me as he was probably still under the effect of the aguardiente he swallowed yesterday said the doctor dryly  i met him outside the tienda on the highway the other night talking to a pair of cutthroats that i would shoot on sight  the mayordomo has many purchases to make and must meet a great many people said maruju  what would you  we can not select his acquaintances we can hardly choose our own she added sweetly  the doctor hesitated as if to reply and then with a grim goodmorning passed on towards the patio  maruja did not follow him her attention was suddenly absorbed by a hitherto unnoticed motionless figure that seemed to be hiding in the shadow of an angle of the passage as if waiting for her to pass  the keen eyes of the daughter of joseph saltonstall were not deceived  she walked directly towards the figure and said sharply pereo  the figure came hesitatingly forward into the light of the grated window  it was that of an old man still tall and erect though the hair had disappeared from his temples and hung in two or three straight long dark elflocks on his neck  his face over which one of the bars threw a sinister shadow was the yellow of a dried tobaccoleaf and veined as strongly  his garb was a strange mingling of the vaquero and the ecclesiasticvelvet trousers open from the knee down and fringed with bullion buttons a broad red sash around his waist partly hidden by a long straight chaqueta with a circular sacerdotal cape of black broadcloth slipped over his head through a slitlike opening braided with gold  his restless yellow eyes fell before the young girls and the stiff varnished hardbrimmed sombrero he held in his wrinkled hands trembled  you are spying again pereo said maruja in another dialect than the one she had used to her mother  it is unworthy of my fathers trusted servant  it is that manthat coyote dona maruja that is unworthy of your father of your mother of you he gesticulated in a fierce whisper i pereo do not spy  i follow follow the track of the prowling stealing brute until i run him down  yes it was i pereo who warned your father he would not be content with the half of the land he stole it was i pereo who warned your mother that each time he trod the soil of la mision perdida he measured the land he could take away  he stopped pantingly with the insane abstraction of a fixed idea glittering in his eyes  and it was you pereo she said caressingly laying her soft hand on his heaving breast you who carried me in your arms when i was a child  it was you pereo who took me before you on your pinto horse to the rodeo when no one knew it but ourselves my pereo was it not he nodded his head violently  it was you who showed me the gallant caballeros the pachecos the castros the alvarados the estudillos the peraltas the vallejos  his head kept time with each name as the fire dimmed in his wet eyes  you made me promise i would not forget them for the americanos who were here  good  that was years ago  i am older now  i have seen many americans  well i am still free  he caught her hand and raised it to his lips with a gesture almost devotional  his eyes softened as the exaltation of passion passed his voice dropped into the querulousness of privileged age ah yesyou the firstborn the heiressof a verity yes  you were ever a guitierrez  but the others  eh where are they now and it was always eh pereo what shall we do today  pereo good pereo we are asked to ride here and there we are expected to visit the new people in the valleywhat say you pereo  who shall we dine today  or enquire me of this or that strange caballeroand if we may speak ah it is but yesterday that amita would say lend me thine own horse pereo that i may outstrip this swaggering americano that clings ever to my side ha ha  or the grave dorotea would whisper convey to this senor presumptuous pomposo that the daughters of guitierrez do not ride alone with strangers  or even the little liseta would say he he  why does the stranger press my foot in his great hand when he helps me into the saddle  tell him that is not the way pereo ha ha  he laughed childishly and stopped  and why does senorita amita nowlookcomplain that pereo old pereo comes between her and this senor raymondthis maquinista  eh and why does she the lady mother the castellana shut pereo from her councils he went on with rising excitement  what are these secret meetings ehwhat these appointments alone with this judaswithout the familywithout me  hearken pereo said the young girl again laying her hand on the old mans shoulder you have spoken trulybut you forgetthe years pass these are no longer strangers old friends have gonethese have taken their place  my father forgave the doctorwhy can not you  for the rest believe in mememarujashe dramatically touched her heart over the international complications of the letters of captain carroll and peralta  i will see that the family honor does not suffer  and now good pereo calm thyself  not with aguardiente but with a bottle of old wine from the mision refectory that i will send to thee  it was given to me by thy friend padre miguel and is from the old vines that were here  courage pereo  and thou sayest that amita complains that thou comest between her and raymond  so  what matter  let it cheer thy heart to know that i have summoned the peraltas the pachecos the estudillos all thy old friends to dine here today thou wilt hear the old names even if the faces are young to thee courage  do thy duty old friend let them see that the hospitality of la mision perdida does not grow old if its mayordomo does  faquita will bring thee the wine  no not that way thou needest not pass the patio nor meet that man again here give me thy hand  i will lead thee  it trembles pereo these are not the sinews that only two years ago pulled down the bull at soquel with thy single lasso  why look  i can drag thee see and with a light laugh and a boyish gesture she half pulled half dragged him along until their voices were lost in the dark corridor  maruja kept her word  when the sun began to cast long shadows along the veranda not only the outer shell of la mision perdida but the dark inner heart of the old casa stirred with awakened life  single horsemen and carriages began to arrive and mingled with the modern turnouts of the home party and the neighboring americans were a few of the cumbrous vehicles and chariots of fifty years ago drawn by gayly trapped mules with bizarre postilions and occasionally an outrider dark faces looked from the balcony of the patio a light cloud of cigarettesmoke made the dark corridors the more obscure and mingled with the forgotten incense  bareheaded pretty women with roses starring their dark hair wandered with childish curiosity along the broad veranda and in and out of the french windows that opened upon the grand saloon scrupulously shaved men with olive complexion stout men with accurately curving whiskers meeting at their dimpled chins lounged about with a certain unconscious dignity that made them contentedly indifferent to any novelty of their surroundings  for a while the two races kept mechanically apart but through the tactful gallantry of garnier the cynical familiarity of raymond and the impulsive recklessness of aladdin who had forsaken his enchanted palace on the slightest of invitations and returned with the party in the hope of again seeing the princess of china an interchange of civilities of gallantries and even of confidences at last took place  jovita castro had heard who had not of the wonders of aladdins palace and was it of actual truth that the ladies had a bouquet and a fan to match their dress presented to them every morning and that the gentlemen had a champagne cocktail sent to their rooms before breakfast  just you come miss and bring your father and your brothers and stay a week and youll see responded aladdin gallantly  hold on  whats your fathers first name  ill send a team over there for you tomorrow  and is it true that you frightened the handsome captain carroll away from amita said dolores briones over the edge of her fan to raymond  perfectly said raymond with ingenuous frankness  i made it a matter of life or death  he was a soldier and naturally preferred the former as giving him a better chance for promotion ah we thought it was maruja you liked best  that was two years ago said raymond gravely  and you americanos can change in that time  i have just experienced that it can be done in less he responded over the fan with bewildering significance  nor were these confidences confined to only one nationality  i always thought you spanish gentlemen were very dark and wore long mustaches and a cloak said pretty little miss walker gazing frankly into the smooth round face of the eldest pachecowhy you are as fair as i am  eaf i tink that i am for ever mizzarable he replied with grave melancholy  in the dead silence that followed he was enabled to make his decorous point  because i shall not ezcape ze fate of narcissus  mr buchanan with the unrestrained and irresponsible enjoyment of a traveler entered fully into the spirit of the scene  he even found words of praise for aladdin whose extravagance had at first seemed to him almost impious  eh but im not prepared to say he is a fool either he remarked to his friend the san francisco banker  those who try to pick him up for one returned the banker will find themselves mistaken  his is the prodigality that loosens others pursestrings besides his own everybody contents himself with criticising his way of spending money but is ready to follow his way of making it  the dinner was more formal and when the mistress of the house massive in black silk velvet and gold embroidery moved like a pageant to the head of her table where she remained like a sacerdotal effigy not even the presence of the practical scotchman at her side could remove the prevailing sense of restraint  for a while the conversation of the relatives might have been brought with them in their antique vehicles of fifty years ago so faded so worn and so springless it was general pico related the festivities at monterey on the occasion of the visit of sir george simpson early in the present century of which he was an eyewitness with great precision of detail  don juan estudillo was comparatively frivolous with anecdotes of louis philippe whom he had seen in paris  farseeing pedro guitierrez was gloomily impressed with a mongolian invasion of california by the chinese in which the prevailing religion would be supplanted by heathen temples and polygamy engrafted on the constitution  everybody agreed however that the vital question of the hour was the settlement of land titlesamericans who claimed under preemption and the native holders of spanish grants were equally of the opinion  in the midst of this the musical voice of maruja was heard saying what is a tramp  raymond on her right was ready but not conclusive  a tramp if he could sing would be a troubadour if he could pray would be a pilgrim friarin either case a natural object of womanly solicitude  but as he could do neither he was simply a curse  and you think that is not an object of womanly solicitude  but that does not tell me what he is  a dozen gentlemen swept in the radius of those softlyinquiring eyes here started to explain  from them it appeared that there was no such thing in california as a tramp and there were also a dozen varieties of tramp in california  but is he always very uncivil asked maruja  again there were conflicting opinions  you might have to shoot him on sight and you might have him invariably run from you  when the question was finally settled maruja was found to have become absorbed in conversation with some one else  amita a taller copy of maruja and more regularly beautiful had built up a little pile of bread crumbs between herself and raymond and was listening to him with a certain shy girlish interest that was as inconsistent with the serene regularity of her face as marujas selfpossessed subtle intelligence was incongruous to her youthful figure  raymonds voice when he addressed amita was low and earnest not from any significance of matter but from its frank confidential quality  they are discussing the new railroad project and your relations are all opposed to it tomorrow they will each apply privately to aladdin for the privilege of subscribing  i have never seen a railroad said amita slightly coloring but you are an engineer and i know they must be some thing very clever  notwithstanding the coolness of the night a full moon drew the guests to the veranda where coffee was served and where mysteriously muffled in cloaks and shawls the party took upon itself the appearance of groups of dominoed masqueraders scattered along the veranda and on the broad steps of the porch in gypsylike encampments from whose cloaked shadow the moonlight occasionally glittered upon a varnished boot or peeping satin slipper  two or three of these groups had resolved themselves into detached couples who wandered down the acacia walk to the sound of a harp in the grand saloon or the occasional uplifting of a thin spanish tenor  two of these couples were maruja and garnier followed by amita and raymond  you are restless tonight maruja said amita shyly endeavoring to make a show of keeping up with her sisters boyish stride in spite of raymonds reluctance  you are paying for your wakefulness today  the same idea passed through the minds of both men  she was missing the excitement of captain carrolls presence  the air is so refreshing away from the house responded maruja with a bright energy that belied any suggestion of fatigue or moral disquietude  im tired of running against those turtledoves in the walks and bushes  let us keep on to the lane  if you are tired mr raymond will give you his arm  they kept on led by the indomitable little figure who for once did not seem to linger over the attentions both piquant and tender with which garnier improved his opportunity  given a shadowy lane a lovers moon a pair of bright and not unkindly eyes a charming and not distant figurewhat more could he want yet he wished she hadnt walked so fast  one might be vivacious audacious brilliant at an indian trot but impassionednever the pace increased they were actually hurrying  more than that maruja had struck into a little trot her lithe body swaying from side to side her little feet straight as an arrow before her accompanying herself with a quaint musical chant which she obligingly explained had been taught her as a child by pereo  they stopped only at the hedge where she had that morning encountered the tramp  there is little doubt that the rest of the party was disconcerted amita whose figure was not adapted to this camillalike exercise raymond who was annoyed at the poor girls discomfiture and garnier who had lost a golden opportunity with the faint suspicion of having looked ridiculous  only marujas eyes or rather the eyes of her lamented father seemed to enjoy it  you are too effeminate she said leaning against the fence and shading her eyes with her fan as she glanced around in the staring moonlight  civilization has taken away your legs  a man ought to be able to trust to his feet all day and to nothing else  in facta tramp suggested raymond  possibly  i think i should like to have been a gypsy and to have wandered about finding a new home every night  and a change of linen on the early morning hedges said raymond but do you think seriously that you and your sister are suitably clad to commence tonight  it is bitterly cold he added turning up his collar  could you begin by showing a pal the nearest haystack or henroost  sybarite  she cast a long look over the fields and down the lane suddenly she started  what is that  she pointed to a tall erect figure slowly disappearing on the other side of the hedge  its pereo only pereo  i knew him by his long serape said garnier who was nearest the hedge complacently  but what is surprising he was not there when we came nor did he come out of that open field  he must have been walking behind us on the other side of the hedge  the eyes of the two girls sought each other simultaneously but not without raymonds observant glance  amitas brow darkened as she moved to her sisters side and took her arm with a confidential pressure that was returned  the two men with a vague consciousness of some contretemps dropped a pace behind and began to talk to each other leaving the sisters to exchange a few words in a low tone as they slowly returned to the house  meanwhile pereos tall figure had disappeared in the shrubbery to emerge again in the open area by the summerhouse and the old peartree the red sparks of two or three cigarettes in the shadow of the summerhouse and the crouching forms of two shawled women came forward to greet him  and what hast thou heard pereo said one of the women  nothing said pereo impatiently  i told thee i would answer for this little primogenita with my life  she is but leading this frenchman a dance as she has led the others and the dona amita and her raymond are but wax in her hands  besides i have spoken with the little ruja today and spoke my mind pepita and she says there is nothing  and whilst thou wert speaking to her my poor pereo the devil of an american doctor was speaking to her mother thy mistressour mistress pereo  wouldst thou know what he said  oh it was nothing  now the curse of koorotora on thee pepita said pereo excitedly speak fool if thou knowest anything  of a verity no  let faquita then speak she heard it  she reached out her hand and dragged marujas maid not unwilling before the old man  good  tis faquita daughter of gomez and a child of the land speak little one  what said this coyote to the mother of thy mistress  truly good pereo it was but accident that befriended me  truly for thy mistresss sake i hoped it had been more  but let that go  come what said he child  i was hanging up a robe behind the curtain in the oratory when pepita ushered in the americano  i had no time to fly  why shouldst thou fly from a dog like this said one of the cigarettesmokers who had drawn near  peace said the old man  when the dona maria joined him they spoke of affairs  yes pereo she thy mistress spoke of affairs to this manay as she might have talked to thee  and could he advise this and could he counsel that and should the cattle be taken from the lower lands and the fields turned to grain and had he a purchaser for los osos  los osos  it is the boundary landthe frontierthe line of the arroyoolder than the mision muttered pereo  ay and he talked of thethei know not what it isthe rrrailrroad  the railroad gasped the old man  i will tell thee what it is it is the cut of a burning knife through la mision perdidaas long as eternity as dividing as death  on either side of that gash life is blasted wherever that cruel steel is laid the track of it is livid and barren it cuts down all barriers leaps all boundaries be they canada or canyon it is a torrent in the plain a tornado in the forest its very pathway is destruction to whoso crosses itman or beast it is the heathenish god of the americanos they build temples for it and flock there and worship it whenever it stops breathing fire and flame like a very moloch  eh  st anthony preserve us said faquita shuddering and yet they spoke of it as shares and stocks and said it would double the price of corn  now judas pursue thee and thy railroad pereo said pepita impatiently  it is not such bagatela that faquita is here to relate go on child and tell all that happened  and then continued faquita with a slight affectation of maiden bashfulness in the closerdrawing circle of cigarettes and then they talked of other things and of themselves and of a verity this graybearded doctor will play the goat and utter gallant speeches and speak of a lifelong devotion and of the time he should have a right to protect  the right girl  didst thou say the right  no thou didst mistake it was not that he meant  thy life to a quarter peso that the little faquita does not mistake said the evident satirist of the household  trust to gomez muchacha to understand a proposal  when the laugh was over and the sparks of the cigarette cleverly whipped out of the speakers lips by faquitas fan had disappeared in the darkness she resumed pettishly i know not what you call it when he kissed her hand and held it to his heart  judas gasped pereo  but he added feverishly she the dona maria thy mistress she summoned thee at once to call me to cast out this dust into the open air thou didst fly to her assistance what thou sawest this and did nothingeh  he stopped and tried to peer into the girls face  no  ah i see i am an old fool  yes it was marujas own mother that stood there  he he he he laughed piteously and she smiled and smiled and broke the cowards heart as maruja might  and when he was gone she bade thee bring her water to wash the filthy judas stain from her hand  santa ana said faquita shrugging her shoulders  she did what the veriest muchacha would have done  when he had gone she sat down and cried  the old man drew back a step and steadied himself by the table then with a certain tremulous audacity he began so that is all you have to tellnothing  bah  a lazy slut sleeps at her duty and dreams behind a curtain  yes dreamsyou understanddreams and for this she leaves her occupations and comes to gossip here come he continued steadily working himself into a passion come enough of this  get you goneyou and pepita and andreas and victorall of youback to your duty  away  am i not master here  off  i say  there was no mistaking the rising anger of his voice  the cowed group rose in a frightened way and disappeared one by one silently through the labyrinth  pereo waited until the last had vanished and then cramming his stiff sombrero over his eyes with an ejaculation brushed his way through the shrubbery in the direction of the stables  later when the full glory of the midnight moon had put out every straggling light in the great house when the long veranda slept in massive bars of shadow and even the tradewinds were hushed to repose pereo silently issued from the stableyard in vaqueros dress mounted and caparisoned  picking his way cautiously along the turfbordered edge of the gravel path he noiselessly reached a gate that led to the lane  walking his spirited mustang with difficulty until the house had at last disappeared in the intervening foliage he turned with an easy canter into a border bridlepath that seemed to lead to the canada  in a quarter of an hour he had reached a low amphitheatre of meadows shut in a half circle of grassy treeless hills  here putting spurs to his horse he entered upon a singular exercise twice he made a circuit of the meadow at a wild gallop with flying serape and loosened rein and twice returned  the third time his speed increased the ground seemed to stream from under him in the distance the limbs of his steed became invisible in their furious action and lying low forward on his mustangs neck man and horse passed like an arrowy bolt around the circle then something like a light ring of smoke upcurved from the saddle before him and slowly uncoiling itself in mid air dropped gently to the ground as he passed  again and once again the shadowy coil sped upward and onward slowly detaching its snaky rings with a weird deliberation that was in strange contrast to the impetuous onset of the rider and yet seemed a part of his fury  and then turning pereo trotted gently to the centre of the circle  here he divested himself of his serape and securing it in a cylindrical roll placed it upright on the ground and once more sped away on his furious circuit  but this time he wheeled suddenly before it was half completed and bore down directly upon the unconscious object  within a hundred feet he swerved slightly the long detaching rings again writhed in mid air and softly descended as he thundered past  but when he had reached the line of circuit again he turned and made directly for the road he had entered  fifty feet behind his horses heels at the end of a shadowy cord the luckless serape was dragging and bounding after him  the old man is quiet enough this morning said andreas as he groomed the sweatdried skin of the mustang the next day  it is easy to see friend pinto that he has worked off his madness on thee    chapter iv  the rancho of san antonio might have been a characteristic asylum for its blessed patron offering as it did a secure retreat from temptations for the carnal eye and affording every facility for uninterrupted contemplation of the sky above unbroken by tree or elevation  unlike la mision perdida of which it had been part it was a level plain of rich adobe half the year presenting a billowy sea of tossing verdure breaking on the faroff horizon line half the year presenting a dry and dusty shore from which the vernal sea had ebbed to the low sky that seemed to mock it with a visionary sea beyond  a row of rough irregular and severely practical sheds and buildings housed the machinery and the fifty or sixty men employed in the cultivation of the soil but neither residential mansion nor farmhouse offered any nucleus of rural comfort or civilization in the midst of this wild expanse of earth and sky  the simplest adjuncts of country life were unknown milk and butter were brought from the nearest town weekly supplies of fresh meat and vegetables came from the same place in the harvest season the laborers and harvesters lodged and boarded in the adjacent settlement and walked to their work  no cultivated flower bloomed beside the unpainted tenement though the fields were starred in early spring with poppies and daisies the humblest garden plant or herb had no place in that prolific soil  the serried ranks of wheat pressed closely round the straggling sheds and barns and hid the lower windows  but the sheds were fitted with the latest agricultural machinery a telegraphic wire connected the nearest town with an office in the wing of one of the buildings where dr west sat and in the midst of the wilderness severely checked his accounts with nature  whether this strict economy of domestic outlay arose from an ostentatious contempt of country life and the luxurious habits of the former landholders or whether it was a purely business principle of dr west did not appear  those who knew him best declared that it was both  certain it was that unqualified commercial success crowned and dignified his method  a few survivors of the old native families came to see his strange machinery that did the work of so many idle men and horses  it is said that he offered to run the distant estate of joaquin padilla from his little office amidst the grain of san antonio some shook their heads and declared that he only sucked the juices of the land for a few brief years to throw it away again that in his fierce haste he skimmed the fatness of ages of gentle cultivation on a soil that had been barely tickled with native oaken plowshares  his own personal tastes and habits were as severe and practical as his business the little wing he inhabited contained only his office his living room or library his bedroom and a bathroom this last inconsistent luxury was due to a certain catlike cleanliness which was part of his nature  his irongray haira novelty in this country of young americanswas always scrupulously brushed and his linen spotless  a slightly professional and somewhat oldfashioned respectability in his black clothes was also characteristic  his one concession to the customs of his neighbors was the possession of two or three of the halfbroken and spirited mustangs of the country which he rode with the fearlessness if not the perfect security and ease of a native  whether the subjection of this lawless and powerful survival of a wild and unfettered nature around him was part of his plan or whether it was only a lingering trait of some younger prowess no one knew but his grim and decorous figure contrasting with the picturesque and flowing freedom of the horse he bestrode was a frequent spectacle in road and field  it was the second day after his visit to la mision perdida  he was sitting by his desk at sunset in the faint afterglow of the western sky which flooded the floor through the open door  he was writing but presently lifted his head with an impatient air and called out harrison  the shadow of dr wests foreman appeared at the door  whos that youre talking to  tramp sir  hire him or send him about his business  dont stand gabbling there  thats just it sir  he wont hire for a week or a day  he says hell do an odd job for his supper and a shakedown but no more  pack him off   stay  whats he like  like the rest of em only a little lazier i reckon  umph  fetch him in  the foreman disappeared and returned with the tramp already known to the reader  he was a little dirtier and grimier than on the morning he had addressed maruja at la mision perdida but he wore the same air of sullen indifference occasionally broken by furtive observation  his lazinessor wearinessif the term could describe the lassitude of perfect physical condition seemed to have increased and he leaned against the door as the doctor regarded him with slow contempt  the silence continuing he deliberately allowed himself to slip down into a sitting position in the doorway where he remained  you seem to have been born tired said the doctor grimly  yes  what have you got to say for yourself  i told him said the tramp nodding his head towards the foreman what id do for a supper and a bed  i dont want anything but that  and if you dont get what you want on your own conditions whatll you do asked the doctor dryly  go  where did you come from  states  where are you going  on  leave him to me said dr west to his foreman  the man smiled and withdrew  the doctor bent his head again over his accounts  the tramp sitting in the doorway reached out his hand pulled a young wheatstalk that had sprung up near the doorstep and slowly nibbled it he did not raise his eyes to the doctor but sat a familiar culprit awaiting sentence without fear without hope yet not without a certain philosophical endurance of the situation  go into that passage said the doctor lifting his head as he turned a page of his ledger and on the shelf youll find some clothing stores for the men  pick out something to fit you  the tramp arose moved towards the passage and stopped  its for the job only you understand he said  for the job answered the doctor  the tramp returned in a few moments with overalls and woolen shirt hanging on his arm and a pair of boots and socks in his hand  the doctor had put aside his pen  now go into that room and change stop first wash the dust from your feet in that bathroom  the tramp obeyed and entered the room  the doctor walked to the door and looked out reflectively on the paling sky  when he turned again he noticed that the door of the bathroom was opened and the tramp who had changed his clothes by the fading light was drying his feet  the doctor approached and stood for a moment watching him  whats the matter with your foot1 he asked after a pause  born so  the first and second toe were joined by a thin membrane  both alike asked the doctor  yes said the young man exhibiting the other foot  what did you say your name was  i didnt say it  its henry guest same as my fathers  where were you born  dentville pike county missouri  what was your mothers name  spalding i reckon  where are your parents now  mother got divorced from father and married again down south somewhere  father left home twenty years ago  hes somewhere in californiaif he aint dead  he isnt dead  how do you know  because i am henry guest of dentville andhe stopped and shading his eyes with his hand as he deliberately examined the tramp added coldlyyour father i reckon  there was a slight pause  the young man put down the boot he had taken up  then im to stay here  certainly not  here my name is only west and i have no son youll go on to san jose and stay there until i look into this thing  you havent got any money of course he asked with a scarcely suppressed sneer  ive got a little returned the young man  how much  the tramp put his hand into his breast and drew out a piece of folded paper containing a single gold coin  five dollars  ive kept it a month it doesnt cost much to live as i do he added dryly  theres fifty more  go to some hotel in san jose and let me know where you are  youve got to live and you dont want to work well you dont seem to be a fool so i neednt tell you that if you expect anything from me you must leave this matter in my hands  i have chosen to acknowledge you today of my own free will i can as easily denounce you as an impostor tomorrow if i choose  have you told your story to any one in the valley  no  see that you dont then  before you go you must answer me a few more questions  he drew a chair to his table and dipped a pen in the ink as if to take down the answers  the young man finding the only chair thus occupied moved the doctors books aside and sat down on the table beside him  the questions were repetitions of those already asked but more in detail and thoroughly practical in their nature  the answers were given straightforwardly and unconcernedly as if the subject was not worth the trouble of invention or evasion  it was difficult to say whether questioner or answerer took least pleasure in the interrogation which might have referred to the concerns of a third party  both however spoke disrespectfully of their common family with almost an approach to sympathetic interest  you might as well be going now said the doctor finally rising you can stop at the fonda about two miles further on and get your supper and bed if you like  the young man slipped from the table and lounged to the door  the doctor put his hands in his pockets and followed him  the young man as if in unconscious imitation had put his hands in his pockets also and looked at him  ill hear from you then when you are in san jose said dr west looking past him into the grain with a slight approach to constraint in his indifference  yesif thats agreed upon returned the young man pausing on the threshold  a faint sense of some purely conventional responsibility in their position affected them both  they would have shaken hands if either had offered the initiative  a sullen consciousness of gratuitous rectitude in the selfish mind of the father an equally sullen conviction of twenty years of wrong in the son withheld them both  unpleasantly observant of each others awkwardness they parted with a feeling of relief  dr west closed the door lit his lamp and going to his desk folded the paper containing the memoranda he had just written and placed it in his pocket  then he summoned his foreman  the man entered and glanced around the room as if expecting to see the doctors guest still there  tell one of the men to bring round buckeye  the foreman hesitated  going to ride tonight sir  certainly i may go as far as saltonstalls  if i do you neednt expect me back till morning  buckeyes mighty fresh tonight boss  regularly bucked his saddle clean off an hour ago and there aint a man dare exercise him  ill bet he dont buck his saddle off with me on it said the doctor grimly  bring him along  the man turned to go  you found the tramp powful lazy didnt ye  i found a heap more in him than in some that call themselves smart said dr west unconsciously setting up an irritable defense of the absent one  hurry up that horse  the foreman vanished  the doctor put on a pair of leather leggings large silver spurs and a broad softbrimmed hat but made no other change in his usual halfprofessional conventional garb  he then went to the window and glanced in the direction of the highway  now that his son was gone he felt a faint regret that he had not prolonged the interview  certain peculiarities in his manner certain suggestions of expression in his face speech and gesture came back to him now with unsatisfied curiosity  no matter he said to himself hell turn up soon againas soon as i want him if not sooner  he thinks hes got a mighty soft thing here and he isnt going to let it go  and theres that same dd sullen dirty pride of his mother for all he doesnt cotton to her wonder i didnt recognize it at first  and hoarding up that five dollars  thats janes brat all over  and of course he added bitterly nothing of me in him  no nothing  well well whats the difference  he turned towards the door with a certain sullen defiance in his face so like the man he believed he did not resemble that his foreman coming upon him suddenly might have been startled at the likeness  fortunately however harrison was too much engrossed with the antics of the irrepressible buckeye which the ostler had just brought to the door to notice anything else  the arrival of the horse changed the doctors expression to one of more practical and significant resistance  with the assistance of two men at the head of the restive brute he managed to vault into the saddle a few wild plunges only seemed to settle him the firmer in his seateach plunge leaving its record in a thin red line on the animals flanks made by the cruel spurs of its rider  any lingering desire of following his sons footsteps was quickly dissipated by buckeye who promptly bolted in the opposite direction and before dr west could gain active control over him they were half a mile on their way to la mision perdida  dr west did not regret it  twenty years ago he had voluntarily abandoned a legal union of mutual unfaithfulness and misconduct and allowed his wife to get the divorce he might have obtained for equal cause  he had abandoned to her the issue of that unionan infant son whatever he chose to do now was purely gratuitous the only hold which this young stranger had on his respect was that he also recognized that fact with a cold indifference equal to his own  at present the halfsavage brute he bestrode occupied all his attention  yet he could not help feeling his advancing years tell upon him more heavily that evening fearless as he was his strength was no longer equal when measured with the untiring youthful malevolence of his unbroken mustang  for a moment he dwelt regretfully on the lazy halfdeveloped sinews of his son for a briefer instant there flashed across him the thought that those sinews ought to replace his own ought to be his to lean uponthat thus and thus only could he achieve the old miracle of restoring his lost youth by perpetuating his own power in his own blood and he whose profound belief in personality had rejected all hereditary principle felt this with a sudden exquisite pain  but his horse perhaps recognizing a relaxing grip took that opportunity to buck  curving his back like a cat and throwing himself into the air with an unexpected bound he came down with four stiff inflexible legs and a shock that might have burst the saddlegirths had not the wily old man as quickly brought the long rowels of his spurs together and fairly locked his heels under buckeyes collapsing barrel  it was the mustangs last rebellions struggle  the discomfited brute gave in and darted meekly and apologetically forward and as it were left all its riders doubts and fears far behind in the vanishing distance    1 this apparent classical plagiarism is actually a fact of identification on record in the california law reports  it is therefore unnecessary for me to add that the attendant circumstances and characters are purely fictitiousb h    chapter v  meanwhile the subject of dr wests meditations was slowly making his way along the highroad towards the fonda  he walked more erect and with less of a shuffle in his gait but whether this was owing to his having cast the old skin of garments adapted to his slouch and because he was more securely shod or whether it was from the sudden straightening of some warped moral quality it would have been difficult to say  the expression of his face certainly gave no evidence of actual and prospective good fortune if anything the lines of discontent around his brow and mouth were more strongly drawn apparently his interview with his father had only the effect of reviving and stirring into greater activity a certain dogged sentiment that through long years had become languidly mechanical  he was no longer a beaten animal but one roused by a chance success into a dangerous knowledge of his power in his honest workmans dress he was infinitely more to be feared than in his rags in the lifting of his downcast eye there was the revelation of a baleful intelligence  in his changed condition civilization only seemed to have armed him against itself  the fonda a long low building with a redtiled roof extending over a porch or whitewashed veranda in which drunken vaqueros had been known to occasionally disport their mustangs did not offer a very reputable appearance to the eye of young guest as he approached it in the gathering shadows  one or two halfbroken horses were securely fastened to the stout crossbeams of some heavy posts driven in the roadway before it and a primitive trough of roughly excavated stone stood near it  through a broken gate at the side there was a glimpse of a grassgrown and deserted courtyard piled with the disused packingcases and barrels of the tienda or general country shop which huddled under the same roof at the other end of the building  the opened door of the fonda showed a lowstudded room fitted up with a rude imitation of an american bar on one side and containing a few small tables at which half a dozen men were smoking drinking and playing cards the faded pictorial poster of the last bullfight at monterey and an american sheriffs notice were hung on the wall and in the doorway  a thick yellow atmosphere of cigarette smoke through which the inmates appeared like brown shadows pervaded the room  the young man hesitated before this pestilential interior and took a seat on a bench on the veranda  after a moments interval the yellow landlord came to the door with a look of inquiry which guest answered by a demand for lodging and supper  when the landlord had vanished again in the cigarette fog the several other guests one after the other appeared at the doorway with their cigarettes in their mouths and their cards still in their hands and gazed upon him  there may have been some excuse for their curiosity  as before hinted guests appearance in his overalls and woolen shirt was somewhat incongruous and for some inexplicable reason the same face and figure which did not look inconsistent in rags and extreme poverty now at once suggested a higher social rank both of intellect and refinement than his workmans dress indicated  this added to his surliness of manner and expression strengthened a growing suspicion in the mind of the party that he was a fugitive from justicea forger a derelict banker or possibly a murderer it is only fair to say that the moral sense of the spectators was not shocked at the suspicion and that a more active sympathy was only withheld by his reticence  an unfortunate incident seemed to complete the evidence against him  in impatiently responding to the landlords curt demand for prepayment of his supper he allowed three or four pieces of gold to escape from his pocket on the veranda  in the quick glances of the party as he stooped to pick them up he read the danger of his carelessness  his sullen selfpossession did not seem to be shaken  calling to the keeper of the tienda who had appeared at his door in time to witness the danaelike shower he bade him approach in english  what sort of knives have you got  knives senor  yes bowieknives or dirks  knives like that he said making an imaginary downward stroke at the table before him  the shopkeeper entered the tienda and presently reappeared with three or four dirks in red leather sheaths  guest selected the heaviest and tried its point on the table  how much  tres pesos  the young man threw him one of his gold pieces and slipped the knife and its sheath in his boot  when he had received his change from the shopkeeper he folded his arms and leaned back against the wall in quiet indifference  the simple act seemed to check aggressive but not insinuating interference  in a few moments one of the men appeared at the doorway  it is fine weather for the road little comrade  guest did not reply  ah the night it ess splendid he repeated in broken english rubbing his hands as if washing in the air  still no reply  you shall come from sank hosay  i shaant  the stranger muttered something in spanish but the landlord who reappeared to place guests supper on a table on the veranda here felt the obligation of interfering to protect a customer apparently so aggressive and so opulent  he pushed the inquisitor aside with a few hasty words and after guest had finished his meal offered to show him his room  it was a dark vaulted closet on the groundfloor gaining light from the stableyard through a barred iron grating  at the first glimpse it looked like a prison cell looking more deliberately at the black tresseled bed and the votive images hanging on the wall it might have been a tomb  it is the best said the landlord  the padre vincento will have none other on his journey  i suppose god protects him said guest that door dont  he pointed to the wormeaten door without bolt or fastening  ah what matter  are we not all friends  certainly responded guest with his surliest manner as he returned to the veranda  nevertheless he resolved not to occupy the cell of the reverend padre not from any personal fear of his disreputable neighbors though he was fully alive to their peculiarities but from the nomadic instinct which was still strong in his blood  he felt he could not yet bear the confinement of a close room or the propinquity of his fellowman  he would rest on the veranda until the moon was fairly up and then he would again take to the road  he was half reclining on the bench with the slowly closing and opening lids of some tired but watchful animal when the sound of wheels voices and clatter of hoofs on the highway arrested his attention and he sat upright  the moon was slowly lifting itself over the limitless stretch of grainfields before him on the other side of the road and dazzling him with its level lustre  he could barely discern a cavalcade of dark figures and a large vehicle rapidly approaching before it drew up tumultuously in front of the fonda  it was a pleasure party of ladies and gentlemen on horseback and in a fourhorsed charabancs returning to la mision perdida buchanan raymond and garnier were there amita and dorotea in the body of the charabancs and maruja seated on the box  much to his own astonishment and that of some others of the party captain carroll was among the riders  only maruja and her mother knew that he was recalled to refute a repetition of the gossip already circulated regarding his sudden withdrawal only maruja alone knew the subtle words which made that call so potent yet so hopeless  marujas quick eyes observant of everything even under the double fire of captain carroll and garnier instantly caught those of the erect figure on the bench in the veranda  surely that was the face of the tramp she had spoken to and yet there was a change not only in the dress but in the general resemblance  after the first glance guest withdrew his eyes and gazed at the other figures in the charabancs without moving a muscle  marujas whims and caprices were many and original and when after a sudden little cry and a declaration that she could stand her cramped position no longer she leaped from the box into the road no one was surprised  garnier and captain carroll quickly followed  i should like to look into the fonda while the horses are being watered she said laughingly just to see what it is that attracts pereo there so often  before any one could restrain this new caprice she was already upon the veranda  to reach the open door she had to pass so near guest that her soft white flounces brushed his knees and the flowers in her girdle left their perfume in his face  but he neither moved nor raised his eyes when she had passed he rose quietly and stepped into the road  on her nearer survey maruja was convinced it was the same man she remained for an instant with a little hand on the doorpost what a horrid place and what dreadful people she said in audible english as she glanced quickly after guest  really pereo ought to be warned against keeping such company  come let us go  she contrived to pass guest again in regaining the carriage but in the few moments further delay he walked on down the road before them and by the time they were ready to start he was slowly sauntering some hundred yards ahead  they passed him at a rapid trot but the next moment the charabancs was suddenly pulled up  my fan cried maruja  blessed santa mariamy fan  a small black object seen distinctly in the moonlight was lying on the road directly in the track of the sauntering stranger garnier attempted to alight carroll reined in his horse  stop all of you said maruja that man will bring it to me  it seemed as if he would  he stopped and picked it up and approached the carriage  maruja stood up in her seat with her veil thrown back her graceful hand extended her eyes and mouth tremulous with an irresistible smile  the stranger came nearer singled out captain carroll tossed the fan to him with a slight nod and passed on the other side  one moment said maruja almost harshly to the driver  one moment she continued drawing her purse from her pocket brusquely let me reward this civil gentleman of the road  here sir but before she could continue carroll wheeled to her side and interposed pray collect yourself miss saltonstall he said hurriedly you can not tell who this man may be  he does not seem to be one who would insult you or whom you would insult gratuitously  give me the fan captain carroll she said with a soft and caressing smile  thank you  she took it and breaking it through the middle between her gloved hands tossed it into the highway  you are rightit smells of the fondaand the road thank you again  you are so thoughtful for me captain carroll she murmured raising her eyes gently to his and then suddenly withdrawing them with a half sigh but i am keeping you all  go on  the carriage rolled away and guest returned from the hedge to the middle of the road  san jose lay in the opposite direction from the disappearing cavalcade but on leaving the fonda he had determined to lead his inquisitors astray by doubling and making a circuit of the hostelry through the fields hidden in the tall grain  this he did securely passing them within sound of their voices and was soon well on his way again  he avoided the highway and striking a trail through the meadows diverged to the right where the low towers and brown walls of a ruined mission church rose above the plain  this would enable him to escape any direct pursuit on the high road besides from its slight elevation giving him a more extended view of the plain  as he neared it he was surprised to see that although it was partly dismantled and the roof had fallen in the central aisle a part of it was still used as a chapel and a light was burning behind a narrow opening partly window and partly shrine  he was almost upon it when the figure of a man who had been kneeling beneath with his back towards him rose crossed himself devoutly and stood upright before he could turn guest disappeared round the angle of the wall and the tall erect figure of the solitary worshiper passed on without heeding him  but if guest had been successful in evading the observation of the man he had come so suddenly upon he was utterly unconscious of another figure that had been tracking him for the last ten minutes through the tall grain and had even succeeded in gaining the shadow of the wall behind him and it was this figure and not his own that eventually attracted the attention of the tall stranger the pursuing figure was rapidly approaching the unconscious guest in another moment it would have been upon him when it was suddenly seized from behind by the tall devotee  there was a momentary struggle and then it freed itself with the exclamation pereo  yespereo said the old man panting from his exertions  and thou art miguel  so thou wouldst murder a man for a few pesos he said pointing to the knife which the desperado had hurriedly hid in his jacket and callest thyself a californian  tis only an americanoa runaway with some illgotten gold said miguel sullenly yet with unmistakable fear of the old man besides it was only to frighten him the braggart  but since thou fearest to touch a hair of those interlopers  fearest said pereo fiercely clutching him by the throat and forcing him against the wall  fearest sayest thou  i pereo fear dost thou think i would soil these hands that might strike a higher quarry with blood of thy game  forgive me padrono gasped miguel now thoroughly alarmed at the old mans awakened passion pardon i meant that since thou knowest him  i know him repeated pereo scornfully contemptuously throwing miguel aside who at once took that opportunity to increase his distance from the old mans arm  i know him  thou shalt see come hither child he called beckoning to guest  come hither thou hast nothing to fear now  guest who had been attracted by the sound of altercation behind him but who was utterly unconscious of its origin or his own relation to it came forward impatiently  as he did so miguel took to his heels the act did not tend to mollify guests surly suspicions and pausing a few feet from the old man he roughly demanded his business with him  pereo raised his head with the dignity of years and habits of command the face of the young man confronting him was clearly illuminated by the moonlight  pereos eyes suddenly dilated his mouth stiffened he staggered back against the wall  who are you he gasped in uncertain english  believing himself the subject of some drunkards pastime guest replied savagely one who has enough of this dd nonsense and will stand no more of it from any one young or old and turned abruptly on his heel  stay one moment senor for the love of god  some keen accent of agony in the old mans voice touched even guests selfish nature  he halted  you area stranger herefaltered pereo  yes  i am  you do not live hereyou have no friends  i told you i am a stranger  i never was here before in my life said guest impatiently  true i am a fool said the old man hurriedly to himself  i am madmad  it is not his voice  no  it is not his look now that his face changes  i am crazy  he stopped and passed his trembling hands across his eyes  pardon senor he continued recalling himself with a humility that was almost ironical in its extravagance  pardon pardon  yet perhaps it is not too much to have wanted to know who was the man one has saved  saved repeated guest with incredulous contempt  ay said pereo haughtily drawing his figure erect ay saved senor  he stopped and shrugged his shoulders  but let it passi saylet it pass  take an old mans advice friend show not your gold hereafter to strangers lightly no matter how lightly you have come by it  goodnight  guest for a moment hesitated whether to resent the old mans speech or to let it pass as the incoherent fancy of a brain maddened by drink then he ended the discussion by turning his back abruptly and continuing his way to the highroad  so said pereo looking after him with abstracted eyes so it was only a fancy  and yeteven now as he turned away i saw the same cold insolence in his eye  caramba  am i madmadthat i must keep forever before my eyes night and day the image of that dog in every outcast every ruffian every wayside bully that i meet  no no good pereo  softly this is mere madness good pereo he murmured to himself thou wilt have none of it none good pereo  come come he let his head fall slowly forward on his breast and in that action seeming to take up again the burden of a score more years upon his shoulders he moved slowly away  when he entered the fonda half an hour later the awe in which he was held by the half superstitious ruffians appeared to have increased whatever story the fugitive miguel had told his companions regarding pereos protection of the young stranger it was certain that it had its full effect  obsequious to the last degree the landlord was so profoundly touched when pereo not displeased with this evidence of his power over his countrymen condescendingly offered to click glasses with him that he endeavored to placate him still further  it is a pity your worship was not here earlier he began with a significant glance at the others to have seen a gallant young stranger that was here  a spice of wickedness about him trulya kind of don caesarbut bearing himself like a very caballero always  it would have pleased your worship who likes not those canting puritans such as our neighbor yonder  ah said pereo reflectively warming under the potent fires of flattery and aguardiente possibly i have seen him  he was like  like none of the dogs thou hast seen about san antonio interrupted the landlord  scarcely did he seem americano though he spoke no spanish  the old man chuckled to himself viciously  and thou thou old fool pereo must needs see a likeness to thine enemy in this poor runaway childthis fugitive don juan  he he  nevertheless he still felt a vague terror of the condition of mind which had produced this fancy and drank so deeply to dispel his nervousness that it was with difficulty he could mount his horse again  the exaltation of liquor however appeared only to intensify his characteristics his face became more lugubrious and melancholy his manner more ceremonious and dignified and erect and stiff in his saddle from the waist upwards but leaning from side to side with the motion of his horse like the tall mast of some laboring sloop he loped away towards the house of the lost mission  once or twice he broke into sentimental song strangely enough his ditty was a popular spanish refrain of some matadors aristocratic inamorata       do you see my black eyes      i am manuels duchess  sang pereo with infinite gravity  his horses hoofs seemed to keep time with the refrain and he occasionally waved in the air the long leather thong of his bridlerein  it was quite late when he reached la mision perdida  turning into the little lane that led to the stableyard he dismounted at a gate in the hedge which led to the summerhouse of the old mision garden and throwing his reins on his mustangs neck let the animal precede him to the stables  the moon shone full on the inclosure as he emerged from the labyrinth  with uncovered head he approached the indian mound and sank on his knees before it  the next moment he rose with an exclamation of terror and his hat dropped from his trembling hand  directly before him a small gray wolfishlooking animal had stopped halfway down the mound on encountering his motionless figure  frightened by his outcry and unable to retreat the shadowy depredator had fallen back on his slinking haunches with a snarl and bared teeth that glittered in the moonlight  in an instant the expression of terror on the old mans ashen face turned into a fixed look of insane exaltation  his white lips moved he advanced a step further and held out both hands towards the crouching animal  so  it is thouat last  and comest thou here thy tardy pereo to chide  comest thou too to tell the poor old man his heart is cold his limbs are feeble his brain weak and dizzy that he is no longer fit to do thy masters work  ay gnash thy teeth at him curse himcurse him in thy throat  but listenlisten good friendi will tell thee a secretay good gray friar a secretsuch a secret a plan all minefresh from this old gray head ha haall mine  to be wrought by these poor old arms ha ha all mine  listen  he stealthily made a step nearer the affrighted animal  with a sudden sidelong snap it swiftly bounded by his side and vanished in the thicket and pereo turning wildly with a moan sank down helplessly on the grave of his forefathers    chapter vi  to the open chagrin of most of the gentlemen and the unexpected relief of some of her own sex maruja after an evening of more than usual caprice and willfulness retired early to her chamber here she beguiled enriquita a younger sister to share her solitude for an hour and with a new and charming melancholy presented her with mature counsel and some younger trinkets and adornments  thou wilt find them but folly riquita but thou art young and wilt outgrow them as i have  i am sick of the indian beads everybody wears them but they seem to suit thy complexion  thou art not yet quite old enough for jewelry but take thy choice of these  ruja replied enriquita eagerly surely thou wilt not give up this necklace of carved amber that was brought thee from manillait becomes thee so everybody says it  all the caballeros raymond and victor swear that it sets off thy beauty like nothing else  when thou knowest men better responded maruja in a deep voice thou wilt care less for what they say and despise what they do  besides i wore it todayandi hate it  but what fan wilt thou keep thyself  the one of sandalwood thou hadst today continued enriquita timidly eying the pretty things upon the table  none responded maruja didactically but the simplest which i shall buy myself  truly it is time to set ones self against this extravagance  girls think nothing of spending as much upon a fan as would buy a horse and saddle for a poor man  but why so serious tonight my sister said the little enriquita her eyes filling with ready tears  it grieves me responded maruja promptly to find thee like the rest giving thy soul up to the mere glitter of the world  however go child take the heads but leave the amber it would make thee yellower than thou art which the blessed virgin forbid goodnight  she kissed her affectionately and pushed her from the room nevertheless after a moments survey of her lonely chamber she hastily slipped on a pale satin dressinggown and darting across the passage dashed into the bedroom of the youngest miss wilson haled that sentimental brunette from her night toilet dragged her into her own chamber and enwrapping her in a huge mantle of silk and gray fur fed her with chocolates and chestnuts and reclining on her sympathetic shoulder continued her arraignment of the world and its follies until nearly daybreak  it was past noon when maruja awoke to find faquita standing by her bedside with illconcealed impatience  i ventured to awaken the dona maruja she said with vivacious alacrity for news  terrible news  the american dr west is found dead this morning in the san jose road  dr west dead repeated maruja thoughtfully but without emotion  surely deadvery dead  he was thrown from his horse and dragged by the stirrupshow far the blessed virgin only knows  but he is found deadthis dr westhis foot in the broken stirrup his hand holding a piece of the bridle  i thought i would waken the dona maruja that no one else should break it to the dona maria  that no one else should break it to my mother repeated maruja coldly  what mean you girl  i mean that no stranger should tell her stammered faquita lowering her bold eyes  you mean said maruja slowly that no silly staring tonguewagging gossip should dare to break upon the morning devotions of the lady mother with openmouthed tales of horror  you are wise faquita  i will tell her myself  help me to dress  but the news had already touched the outer shell of the great house and little groups of the visitors were discussing it upon the veranda for once the idle badinage of a pleasureseeking existence was suspended stupid people with facts came to the fore practical people with inquiring minds became interesting servants were confidentially appealed to the local expressman became a hero and it was even noticed that he was intelligent and goodlooking  what makes it more distressing said raymond joining one of the groups is that it appears the doctor visited mrs saltonstall last evening and left the casa at eleven  sanchez who was perhaps the last person who saw him alive says that he noticed his horse was very violent and the doctor did not seem able to control him  the accident probably happened half an hour later as he was picked up about three miles from here and from appearances must have been dragged with his foot in the stirrup fully half a mile before the girth broke and freed the saddle and stirrup together the mustang with nothing on but his broken bridle was found grazing at the rancho as early as four oclock an hour before the body of his master was discovered by the men sent from the rancho to look for him  eh but the man must have been clean daft to have trusted himself to one of those savage beasts of the country said mr buchanan and he was no so young eitherabout sixty i should say  it didna look even respectable i remember when we met him the other day careering over the country for all the world like one of those crazy mexicans  and yet he seemed steady and sensible enough when he didna let his schemes of improvements run away with him like yon furious beastie  eh well puir manit was a sudden ending and his familyeh  i dont think he has oneat least here said raymond  you cant always tell in california  i believe he was a widower  ay man but the heirs there must be considerable property said buchanan impatiently  oh the heirs  if hes made no will which doesnt look like so prudent and practical a man as he wasthe heirs will probably crop up some day  probably crop up some day repeated buchanan aghast  yes  you must remember that we dont take heirs quite as much into account as you do in the old country  the loss of the man and how to replace him is much more to us than the disposal of his property now doctor west was a power far beyond his actual possessionsand we will know very soon how much those were dependent upon him  what do you mean asked buchanan anxiously  i mean that five minutes after the news of the doctors death was confirmed your friend mr stanton sent a messenger with a despatch to the nearest telegraphic office and that he himself drove over to catch aladdin before the news could reach him  buchanan looked uneasy so did one or two of the native californians who composed the group and who had been listening attentively  and where is this same telegraphic office asked buchanan cautiously  ill drive you over there presently responded raymond grimly therell be nothing doing here today  as dr west was a near neighbor of the family his death suspends our pleasureseeking until after the funeral  mr buchanan moved away  captain carroll and garnier drew nearer the speaker  i trust it will not withdraw from us the society of miss saltonstall said garnier lightlyat least that she will not be inconsolable  she did not seem to be particularly sympathetic with dr west the other day said captain carroll coloring slightly with the recollection of the morning in the summerhouse yet willing in his hopeless passion even to share that recollection with his rival  did you not think so monsieur garnier  very possibly and as miss saltonstall is quite artless and childlike in the expression of her likes and dislikes said raymond with the faintest touch of irony you can judge as well as i can  garnier parried the thrust lightly  you are no kinder to our follies than you are to the grand passions of these gentlemen confess you frightened them horribly  you arewhat is calleda beareh  you depreciate in the interests of business  raymond did not at first appear to notice the sarcasm  i only stated he said gravely that which these gentlemen will find out for themselves before they are many hours older  dr west was the brain of the county as aladdin is its lifeblood  it only remains to be seen how far the loss of that brain affects the county  the stock exchange market in san francisco will indicate that today in the shares of the san antonio and soquel railroad and the west mills and manufacturing co  it is a matter that may affect even our friends here  whatever wests social standing was in this house lately he was in confidential business relations with mrs saltonstall  he raised his eyes for the first time to garnier as he added slowly it is to be hoped that if our hostess has no social reasons to deplore the loss of dr west she at least will have no other  with a lovers instinct conscious only of some annoyance to maruja in all this carroll anxiously looked for her appearance among the others he was doomed to disappointment however  his halftimid inquiries only resulted in the information that maruja was closeted with her mother  the penetralia of the casa was only accessible to the family yet as he wandered uneasily about he could not help passing once or twice before the quaint low archway with its grated door that opened from the central hall  his surprise may be imagined when he suddenly heard his name uttered in a low voice and looking up he beheld the soft eyes of maruja at the grating  she held the door partly open with one little hand and made a sign for him to enter with the other  when he had done so she said come with me and preceded him down the dim corridor  his heart beat thickly the incense of this sacred inner life with its faint suggestion of dead roseleaves filled him with a voluptuous languor his breath was lost as if a soft kiss had taken it away his senses swam in the light mist that seemed to suffuse everything  his step trembled as she suddenly turned aside and opening a door ushered him into a small vaulted chamber  in the first glance it seemed to be an oratory or chapel  a large gold and ebony crucifix hung on the wall  there was a priedieu of heavy dark mahogany in the centre of the tiled floor there was a low ottoman or couch covered with a mantle of dark violet velvet like a pall there were two quaintly carved stiff chairs a religious almost ascetic air pervaded the apartment but no dreamy eastern seraglio could have affected him with an intoxication so profoundly and mysteriously sensuous  maruja pointed to a chair and then with a peculiarly feminine movement placed herself sideways upon the ottoman half reclining on her elbow on a high cushion her deep billowy flounces partly veiling the funereal velvet below  her oval face was pale and melancholy her eyes moist as if with recent tears an expression as of troubled passion lurked in their depths and in the corners of her mouth scarcely knowing why carroll fancied that thus she might appear if she were in love and the daring thought made him tremble  i wanted to speak with you alone she said gently as if in explanation but dont look at me so  i have had a bad night and now this calamityshe stopped and then added softly i want you to do a favor formy mother  captain carroll with an effort at last found his voice  but you are in trouble you are suffering  i had no idea this unfortunate affair came so near to you  nor did i said maruja closing her fan with a slight snap  i knew nothing of it until my mother told me this morning  to be frank with you it now appears that dr west was her most intimate business adviser  all her affairs were in his hands  i cannot explain how or why or when but it is so  and is that all said carroll with boyish openness of relief and you have no other sorrow  in spite of herself a tender smile such as she might have bestowed on an impulsive boy broke on her lips  and is that not enough  what would you  nosit where you are  we are here to talk seriously  and you do not ask what is this favor my mother wishes  no matter what it is it shall be done said carroll quickly i am your mothers slave if she will but let me serve at your side  only he paused i wish it was not businessi know nothing of business  if it were only business captain carroll said maruja slowly i would have spoken to raymond or the senor buchanan if it were only confidence pereo our mayordomo would have dragged himself from his sickbed this morning to do my mothers bidding  but it is more than thatit is the functions of a gentlemanand my mother captain carroll would like to say ofa friend  he seized her hand and covered it with kisses  she withdrew it gently  what have i to do he asked eagerly  she drew a note from her belt  it is very simple  you must ride over to aladdin with that note  you must give it to him alonemore than that you must not let any one who may be there think you are making any but a social call  if he keeps you to dineyou must stayyou will bring back anything he may give you and deliver it to me secretly for her  is that all asked carroll with a slight touch of disappointment in his tone  no said maruja rising impulsively  no captain carrollit is not all  and you shall know all if only to prove to you how we confide in youand to leave you free after you have heard it to do as you please  she stood before him quite white opening and shutting her fan quickly and tapping the tiled floor with her little foot  i have told you dr west was my mothers business adviser  she looked upon him as moreas a friend  do you know what a dangerous thing it is for a woman who has lost one protector to begin to rely upon another well my mother is not yet old dr west appreciated herdr west did not depreciate himselftwo things that go far with a woman captain carroll and my mother is a woman  she paused and then with a light toss of her fan said well to make an end but for this excellent horse and this too ambitious rider one knows not how far the old story of my mothers first choice would have been repeated and the curse of koorotora again fallen on the land  and you tell me thisyou marujayou who warned me against my hopeless passion for you  could i foresee this she said passionately and are you mad enough not to see that this very act would have made your suit intolerable to my relations  then you did think of my suit maruja he said grasping her hand  or any ones suit she continued hurriedly turning away with a slight increase of color in her cheeks  after a moments pause she added in a gentler and halfreproachful voice do you think i have confided my mothers story to you for this purpose only  is this the help you proffer  forgive me maruja said the young officer earnestly  i am selfish i knowfor i love you  but you have not told me yet how i could help your mother by delivering this letter which any one could do  let me finish then said maruja  it is for you to judge what may be done  letters have passed between my mother and dr west my mother is imprudent i know not what she may have written or what she might not write in confidence  but you understand they are not letters to be made public nor to pass into any hands but hers  they are not to be left to be bandied about by his american friends to be commented upon by strangers to reach the ears of the guitierrez  they belong to that grave which lies between the past and my mother they must not rise from it to haunt her  i understand said the young officer quietly  this letter then is my authority to recover them  partly though it refers to other matters  this mr prince whom you americans call aladdin was a friend of dr west they were associated in business and he will probably have access to his papers  the rest we must leave to you  i think you may said carroll simply  maruja stretched out her hand  the young man bent over it respectfully and moved towards the door  she had expected him to make some protestationperhaps even to claim some reward  but the instinct which made him forbear even in thought to take advantage of the duty laid upon him which dominated even his miserable passion for her and made it subservient to his exaltation of honor this epaulet of the officer and blood of the gentleman this simple possession of knighthood not laid on by perfunctory steel but springing from withinall this i grieve to say was partly unintelligible to maruja and not entirely satisfactory  since he had entered the room they seemed to have changed their situations he was no longer the pleading lover that trembled at her feet  for one base moment she thought it was the result of his knowledge of her mothers weakness but the next instant meeting his clear glance she colored with shame  yet she detained him vaguely a moment before the grated door in the secure shadow of the arch  he might have kissed her there he did not  in the gloomy stagnation of the great house it was natural that he should escape from it for a while and the saddling of his horse for a solitary ride attracted no attention  but it might have been noticed that his manner had lost much of that nervous susceptibility and anxiety which indicates a lover and it was with a return of his professional coolness and precision that he rode out of the patio as if on parade  erect observant and selfpossessed he felt himself on duty and putting spurs to his horse cantered along the highroad finding an inexpressible relief in motion  he was doing something in the interest of helplessness and of her  he had no doubt of his right to interfere  he did not bother himself with the rights of others like all selfcontained men he had no plan of action except what the occasion might suggest  he was more than two miles from la mision perdida when his quick eye was attracted by a saddleblanket lying in the roadside ditch a recollection of the calamity of the previous night made him rein in his horse and examine it  it was without doubt the saddleblanket of dr wests horse lost when the saddle came off after the doctors body had been dragged by the runaway beast  but a second fact forced itself equally upon the young officer  it was lying nearly a mile from the spot where the body had been picked up  this certainly did not agree with the accepted theory that the accident had taken place further on and that the body had been dragged until the saddle came off where it was found  his professional knowledge of equitation and the technique of accoutrements exploded the idea that the saddle could have slipped here the saddleblanket fallen and the horse have run nearly a mile hampered by the saddle hanging under him  consequently the saddle blanket and unfortunate rider must have been precipitated together and at the same moment on or near this very spot captain carroll was not a detective he had no theory to establish no motive to discover only as an officer he would have simply rejected any excuse offered on those terms by one of his troopers to account for a similar accident he troubled himself with no further deduction  without dismounting he gave a closer attention to the marks of struggling hoofs near the edge of the ditch which had not yet been obliterated by the daily travel in doing so his horses hoof struck a small object partly hidden in the thick dust of the highway  it seemed to be a leather letter or memorandum case adapted for the breast pocket  carroll instantly dismounted and picked it up  the name and address of dr west were legibly written on the inside  it contained a few papers and notes but nothing more  the possibility that it might disclose the letters he was seeking was a hope quickly past  it was only a corroborative fact that the accident had taken place on the spot where he was standing  he was losing time he hurriedly put the book in his pocket and once more spurred forward on his road    chapter vii  the exterior of aladdins palace familiar as it already was to carroll struck him that afternoon as looking more than usually unreal ephemeral and unsubstantial  the moorish arches of the thinnest white pine the arabesque screens and lattices that looked as if made of pierced cardboard the golden minarets that seemed to be glued to the shelllike towers and the hollow battlements that visibly warped and cracked in the fierce sunlightall appeared more than ever like a theatrical scene that might sink through the ground or vanish on either side to the sound of the prompters whistle  recalling raymonds cynical insinuations he could not help fancying that the house had been built by a conscientious genie with a view to the possibility of the lamp and the ring passing with other effects into the hands of the sheriff  nevertheless the servant who took captain carrolls horse summoned another domestic who preceded him into a small waitingroom off the gorgeous central hall which looked not unlike the private barroom of a firstclass hotel and presented him with a sherry cobbler  it was a peculiarity of aladdins palace that the host seldom did the honors of his own house but usually deputed the task to some friend and generally the last newcomer  carroll was consequently not surprised when he was presently joined by an utter stranger who again pressed upon him the refreshment he had just declined  you see said the transitory host im a stranger myself here and havent got the ways of the regular customers but call for anything you like and ill see it got for you  jim the actual christian name of aladdin is headin a party through the stables  would you like to join emthey aint more than half through nowor will you come right to the billiardroomthe latest thing out in stained glass and ironez pretty as fresh paint or will you meander along to the bridal suite and see the bamboo and silver dressingroom and the white satin and crystal bed that cost fifteen thousand dollars as it stands  or he added confidentially would you like to cut the whole cussed thing and ill get out jims 232 trotter and his spiderlegged buggy and well take a spin over to the springs afore dinner  it was however more convenient to carrolls purpose to conceal his familiarity with the aladdin treasures and to politely offer to follow his guide through the house  i reckon jims pretty busy just now continued the stranger what with old doc west going under so suddent just ez hed got things boomin with that railroad and his manufactory company the stocks went down to nothing this morning and twixt you and me the boys say he added mysteriously sinking his voice it was jest the tightest squeeze there whether there wouldnt be a general burstup all round  but jim was over at san antonio afore the doctors body was laid out just ran that telegraph himself for about two hours had a meeting of trustees and directors afore the coroner came had the doctors books and papers brought over here in a buggy and another meeting before luncheon  why by the time the other fellows began to drop in to know if the doctor was really dead jim prince had discounted the whole affair two years ahead  why bless you nearly everybody is in it  that spanish woman over there with the pretty daughterthat hightoned greaser with the big houseyou know who i mean   i dont think i do said carroll coldly  i know a lady named saltonstall with several daughters  thats her thought id seen you there once  well the doctors got her into it up to the eyes  i reckon shes mortgaged everything to him  it required all carrolls trained selfpossession to prevent his garrulous guide from reading his emotion in his face  this then was the secret of marujas melancholy  poor child how bravely she had borne up under it and he in his utter selfishness had never suspected it  perhaps that letter was her delicate way of breaking the news to him for he should certainly now hear it all from aladdins lips  and this man who evidently had succeeded to the control of dr wests property doubtless had possession of the letters too  humph he shut his lips firmly together and strode along by the side of his innocent guide erect and defiant  he did not have long to wait  the sound of voices the opening of doors and the trampling of feet indicated that the other party were being shown over that part of the building carroll and his companion were approaching  theres jim and his gang now said his cicerone ill tell him youre here and step out of this show business myself so long  i reckon ill see you at dinner  at this moment prince and a number of ladies and gentlemen appeared at the further end of the hall his late guide joined them and apparently indicated carrolls presence as with a certain lounging offduty officerlike way the young man sauntered on  aladdin like others of his class objected to the military theoretically and practically but he was not above recognizing their social importance in a country of no society and of even being fascinated by carrolls quiet and secure selfpossession and selfcontentment in a community of restless ambition and aggressive assertion  he came forward to welcome him cordially he introduced him with an air of satisfaction he would have preferred if he had been in uniform but he contented himself with the fact that carroll like all men of disciplined limbs carried himself equally well in mufti  you have shown us everything said carroll smiling except the secret chamber where you keep the magic lamp and ring  are we not to see the spot where the incantation that produces these marvels is held even if we are forbidden to witness the ceremony  the ladies are dying to see your sanctumyour studyyour workshopwhere you really live  youll find it a mere den as plain as my bedroom said prince who prided himself on the spartan simplicity of his own habits and was not averse to the exhibition  come this way  he crossed the hall and entered a small plainly furnished room containing a table piled with papers some of which were dusty and wornlooking carroll instantly conceived the idea that these were dr wests property  he took his letter quietly from his pocket and when the attention of the others was diverted laid it on the table with the remark in an undertone audible only to prince from mrs saltonstall  aladdin had that sublime audacity which so often fills the place of tact  casting a rapid glance at carroll he cried hallo and wheeling suddenly round on his following guests with a bewildering extravagance of playful brusqueness actually bundled them from the room  the incantation is on he cried waving his arms in the air the genie is at work  no admittance except on business follow miss wilson he added clapping both hands on the shoulders of the prettiest and shyest young lady of the party with an irresistible paternal familiarity  shes your hostess  ill honor her drafts to any amount and before they were aware of his purpose or that carroll was no longer among them aladdin had closed the door that shut with a spring lock and was alone with the young man  he walked quickly to his desk took up the letter and opened it  his face of dominant selfsatisfied goodhumor became set and stern without taking the least notice of carroll he rose and stepping to a telegraph instrument at a side table manipulated half a dozen ivory knobs with a sudden energy  then he returned to the table and began hurriedly to glance over the memoranda and indorsements of the files of papers piled upon it  carrolls quick eye caught sight of a small packet of letters in a writing of unmistakable feminine delicacy and made certain they were the ones he was in quest of  without raising his eyes mr prince asked almost rudely  who else has she told this to  if you refer to the contents of that letter it was written and handed to me about three hours ago  it has not been out of my possession since then  humph  whos at the casa  theres buchanan and raymond and victor guitierrez eh  i think i can say almost positively that mrs saltonstall has seen no one but her daughter since the news reached her if that is what you wish to know said carroll still following the particular package of letters with his eyes as mr prince continued his examination  prince stopped  are you sure  almost sure  prince rose this time with a greater ease of manner and going to the table ran his fingers over the knobs as if mechanically one would like to know at once all there is to know about a transaction that changes the front of four millions of capital in about four hours eh captain he said for the first time really regarding his guest just four hours ago in this very room we found out that the widow saltonstall owed dr west about a million tied up in investments and we calculated to pull her through with perhaps the loss of half  if shes got this assignment of the doctors property that she speaks of in her letter as collateral security and its all regular and sheso to speaksteps into dr wests place by gd sir we owe him about three millions and weve got to settle with herand thats all about it  youve dropped a little bombshell in here captain and the splinters are flying around as far as san francisco now  i confess it beats me regularly  i always thought the old man was a little keen over there at the casabut she was a woman and he was a man for all his sixty years and that combination i never thought of  i only wonder she hadnt gobbled him up before  captain carrolls face betrayed no trace of the bewilderment and satisfaction at this news of which he had been the unconscious bearer nor of resentment at the coarseness of its translation  there does not seem to be any memorandum of this assignment continued prince turning over the papers  have you looked here said carroll taking up the packet of letters  nothey seem to me some private letters she refers to in this letter and that she wants back again  let us see said carroll untying the packet  there were three or four closely written notes in spanish and english  loveletters i reckon said princethats why the old girl wants em back  she dont care to have the wheedling that fetched the doctor trotted out to the public  let us look more carefully said carroll pleasantly opening each letter before prince yet so skillfully as to frustrate any attempt of the latter to read them  there does not seem to be any memorandum here  they are evidently only private letters  quite so said prince  captain carroll retied the packet and put it in his pocket  then ill return them to her he said quietly  hulloherei say said prince starting to his feet  i said i would return them to her repeated carroll calmly  but i never gave them to you  i never consented to their withdrawal from the papers  im sorry you did not said carroll coldly it would have been more polite  polite  dn it sir  i call this stealing  stealing mr prince is a word that might be used by the person who claims these letters to describe the act of any one who would keep them from her  it really can not apply to you or me  once for all do you refuse to return them to me said prince pale with anger  decidedly  very well sir  we shall see  he stepped to the corner and rang a bell  i have summoned my manager and will charge you with the theft in his presence  i think not  and why sir  because the presence of a third party would enable me to throw this glove in your face which as a gentleman i couldnt do without witnesses  steps were heard along the passage prince was no coward in a certain way neither was he a fool  he knew that carroll would keep his word he knew that he should have to fight him that whatever the issue of the duel was the cause of the quarrel would be known and scarcely redound to his credit  at present there were no witnesses to the offered insult and none would be wiser  the letters were not worth it  he stepped to the door opened it said no matter and closed it again  he returned with an affectation of carelessness  you are right i dont know that im called upon to make a scene here which the law can do for me as well elsewhere  it will settle pretty quick whether youve got the right to those letters and whether youve taken the right way to get them sir  i have no desire to evade any responsibility in this matter legal or otherwise said carroll coldly rising to his feet  look here said prince suddenly with a return of his brusque frankness you might have asked me for those letters you know  and you wouldnt have given them to me said carroll  prince laughed  thats so  i say captain  did they teach you this sort of strategy at west point  they taught me that i could neither receive nor give an insult under a white flag said carroll pleasantly  and they allowed me to make exchanges under the same rule  i picked up this pocketbook on the spot where the accident occurred to dr west  it is evidently his  i leave it with you who are his executor  the instinct of reticence before a man with whom he could never be confidential kept him from alluding to his other discovery  prince took the pocketbook and opened it mechanically  after a moments scrutiny of the memoranda it contained his face assumed something of the same concentrated attention it wore at the beginning of the interview  raising his eyes suddenly to carroll he said quickly  you have examined it  only so far as to see that it contained nothing of importance to the person i represent returned carroll simply  the capitalist looked at the young officers clear eyes  something of embarrassment came into his own as he turned them away  certainly  only memoranda of the doctors business  quite important to us you know  but nothing referring to your principal  he laughed  thank you for the exchange  i saytake a drink  thank youno returned carroll going to the door  well goodby  he held out his hand  carroll with his clear eyes still regarding him passed quietly by the outstretched hand opened the door bowed and made his exit  a slight flush came into princes cheek  then as the door closed he burst into a halflaugh  had he been a dramatic villain he would have added to it several lines of soliloquy in which he would have rehearsed the fact that the opportunity for revenge had come at last that the haughty victor who had just left with his illgotten spoil had put into his hands the weapon of his friends destruction that the hour had come and possibly he might have said ha ha  but being a practical goodnatured selfish rascal not much better or worse than his neighbors he sat himself down at his desk and began to carefully consider how he could best make use of the memoranda jotted down by dr west of the proofs of the existence of his son and the consequent discovery of a legal heir to his property    chapter viii  when faquita had made sure that her young mistress was so securely closeted with dona maria that morning as to be inaccessible to curious eyes and ears she saw fit to bewail to her fellowservants this further evidence of the decay of the old feudal and patriarchal mutual family confidences  time was thou rememberest pepita when an affair of this kind was openly discussed at chocolate with everybody present and before us all when joaquin padilla was shot at monterey it was the dona herself who told us who read aloud the letters describing it and the bulletholes in his clothes and made it quite a galadayand he was a firstcousin of guitierrez  and now when this american goat of a doctor is kicked to death by a mule the family must shut themselves up that never a question is asked or answered  ay responded pepita and as regards that sanchez there knows as much as they do for it was he that almost saw the whole affair  howsawest it inquired faquita eagerly  why was it not he that was bringing home pereo who had been lying in one of his trances or visionsblessed st antonio preserve us said pepita hastily crossing herselfon kooratoras grave when the doctors mustang charged down upon them like a wild bull and the doctors foot half out of the stirrups and he not yet fast in his seat  and pereo laughs a wild laugh and says watch if the coyote does not drag yet at his mustangs heels and sanchez ran and watched the doctor out of sight careering and galloping to his deathay as pereo prophesied for it was only half an hour afterward that sanchez again heard the tramp of his hoofsas if it were hereand knowing it two miles awaythou understandest he said to himself it is over  the two women shuddered and crossed themselves  and what says pereo of the fulfillment of his prophecy asked faquita hugging herself in her shawl with a certain titillating shrug of fascinating horror  it is even possible he understands it not  thou knowest how dazed and dumb he ever is after these visionsthat he comes from them as one from the grave remembering nothing  he has lain like a log all the morning  ay but this news should awaken him if aught can  he loved not this sneaking doctor  let us seek him mayhap sanchez may be there  come the mistress lacks us not just now the guests are provided for  come  she led the way to the eastern angle of the casa communicating by a low corridor with the corral and stables  this was the old gatekeep or quarters of the mayordomo who among his functions was supposed to exercise a supervision over the exits and entrances of the house  a large stewards room or office beyond it a room of general assembly half guardroom half servants hall and pereos sleepingroom constituted his domain  a few peons were gathered in the hall near the open door of the apartment where pereo lay  stretched on a low pallet his face yellow as wax a light burning under a crucifix near his head and a spray of blessed palm popularly supposed to avert the attempts of evil spirits to gain possession of his suspended faculties pereo looked not unlike a corpse  two muffled and shawled domestics who sat by his side might have been mourners but for their voluble and incessant chattering  so thou art here faquita said a stout virago  it is a wonder thou couldst spare time from prayers for the repose of the american doctors soul to look after the health of thy superior poor pereo is it then true that dona maria said she would have naught more to do with the drunken brute of her mayordomo  the awful fascination of pereos upturned face did not prevent faquita from tossing her head as she replied pertly that she was not there to defend her mistress from lazy gossip  nay but what said she asked the other attendant  she said pereo was to want for nothing but at present she could not see him  a murmur of indignation and sympathy passed through the company it was followed by a long sigh from the insensible man  his lips move said faquita still fascinated by curiosity  hush he would speak  his lips move but his soul is still asleep said sanchez oracularly  thus they have moved since early morning when i came to speak with him and found him lying here in a fit upon the floor  he was half dressed thou seest as if he had risen to go forth and had been struck down so  hush  i tell thee he speaks said faquita  the sick man was faintly articulating through a few tiny bubbles that broke upon his rigid lips  hedaredme  hesaidi was oldtoo old  who dared thee  who said thou wast too old asked the eager faquita bending over him  he koorotora himself in the shape of a coyote  faquita fell back with a little giggle half of shame half of awe  it is ever thus said sanchez sententiously it is what he said last night when i picked him up on the mound  he will sleep nowthou shalt see  he will get no further than koorotora and the coyoteand then he will sleep  and to the awe of the group and the increased respect for sanchezs wisdom pereo seemed to fall again into a lethargic slumber  it was late in the evening when he appeared to regain perfect consciousness ahwhat is this he said roughly sitting up in bed and eying the watchers around him some of whom had succumbed to sleep and others were engaged in playing cards caramba are ye mad  thou sanchez here who shouldst be at thy work in the stables  thou pepita is thy mistress asleep or dead that thou sittest here  blessed san antonio would ye drive me mad  he lifted his hand to his head with a dull movement of pain and attempted to rise from the bed  softly good pereo lie still said sanchez approaching him thou hast been illso ill  these thy friends have been waiting only for this moment to be assured that thou art better  for this idleness there is no blametruly none  the dona maria has said that thou shouldst lack no care and truly since the terrible news there has been little to do  the terrible news repeated pereo  sanchez cast a meaning glance upon the others as if to indicate this coaffirmation of his diagnosis  ay terrible news  the doctor west was found this morning dead two miles from the casa  dr west dead repeated pereo slowly as if endeavoring to master the real meaning of the words  then seeing the vacuity of his question reflected on the faces of those around him he added hurriedly with a feeble smile oaydead  yes  i remember and he has been illvery ill eh  it was an accident  he was thrown from his horse and so killed returned sanchez gravely  killedby his horse sayest thou said pereo with a sudden fixed look in his eye  ay good pereo  dost thou not remember when the mustang bolted with him down upon us in the lane and then thou didst say he would come to evil with the brute  he didblessed san antoniowithin half an hour  howthou sawest it  nay for the mustang was running away and i did not follow bueno it happened all the same  the alcalde coroner who knows all about it has said so an hour ago  juan brought the news from the rancho where the inquest was  there will be a funeral the day after tomorrow and so it is that some of the family will go fancy pereo a guitierrez at the funeral of the americano doctor nay i doubt not that the dona maria will ask thee to say a prayer over his bier  peace fool and speak not of thy lady mistress thundered the old man sitting upright  begone to the stables  dost thou hear me  go  now by the mother of miracles said sanchez hastening from the room as the gaunt figure of the old man rose like a sheeted spectre from the bed that was his old self again  blessed san antonio  pereo has recovered  the next day he was at his usual duties with perhaps a slight increase of sternness in his manner  the fulfillment of his prophecy related by sanchez added to the superstitious reputation in which he was held although faquita voiced the opinions of a growing skeptical party in the statement that it was easy to prophesy the doctors accident with the spectacle of the horse actually running away before the prophets eyes  it was even said that dona marias aversion to pereo since the accident arose from a belief that some assistance might have been rendered by him  but it was pointed out by sanchez that pereo had a few moments before fallen under one of those singular epilepticlike strokes to which he was subject and not only was unfit but even required the entire care of sanchez at the time  he did not attend the funeral nor did mrs saltonstall but the family was represented by maruja and amita accompanied by one or two darkfaced cousins captain carroll and raymond  a number of friends and business associates from the neighboring towns aladdin and a party from his house the farm laborers and a crowd of working men from his mills in the foothills swelled the assemblage that met in and around the rude agricultural sheds and outhouses which formed the only pastoral habitation of the rancho of san antonio  it had been a characteristic injunction of the deceased that he should be buried in the midst of one of his most prolific grain fields as a grim return to that nature he was impoverishing with neither mark nor monument to indicate the spot and that even the temporary mound above him should at the fitting season of the year be leveled with the rest of the field by the obliterating plowshares  a grave was accordingly dug about a quarter of a mile from his office amidst a volunteer crop so dense that the large space mown around the narrow opening to admit of the presence of the multitude seemed like a golden amphitheatre  a distinguished clergyman from san francisco officiated  a man of tact and politic adaptation he dwelt upon the blameless life of the deceased on his practical benefit for civilization in the county and even treated his grim pantheism in the selection of his grave as a formal recognition of the text dust to dust  he paid a not ungrateful compliment to the business associates of the deceased and without actually claiming in the usual terms a continuance of past favors for their successors managed to interpolate so strong a recommendation of the late doctors commercial projects as to elicit from aladdin the expressive commendation that his sermon was as good as five per cent in the stock  maruja who had been standing near the carriage languidly silent and abstracted even under the tender attentions of carroll suddenly felt the consciousness of another pair of eyes fixed upon her  looking up she was surprised to find herself regarded by the man she had twice met once as a tramp and once as a wayfarer at the fonda who had quietly joined a group not far from her  at once impressed by the idea that this was the first time that he had really looked at her she felt a singular shyness creeping over her until to her own astonishment and indignation she was obliged to lower her eyes before his gaze  in vain she tried to lift them with her old supreme power of fascination if she had ever blushed she felt she would have done so now  she knew that her face must betray her consciousness and at last shemaruja the selfpoised and allsufficient goddessactually turned in halfhysterical and girlish bashfulness to carroll for relief in an affected and exaggerated absorption of his attentions  she scarcely knew that the clergyman had finished speaking when raymond approached them softly from behind  pray dont believe he said appealingly that all the human virtues are about to be buriedi should say sownin that wheatfield  a few will still survive and creep about above the doctors grave  listen to a story just told me and disbelieveif you darein human gratitude  do you see that picturesque young ruffian over there  maruja did not lift her eyes  she felt herself breathlessly hanging on the speakers next words  why thats the young man of the fonda who picked up your fan said carroll isnt it  perhaps said maruja indifferently  she would have given worlds to have been able to turn coldly and stare at him at that moment with the others but she dared not  she contented herself with softly brushing some dust from captain carrolls arm with her fan and a feminine suggestion of tender care which thrilled that gentleman  well continued raymond that robert macaire over yonder came here some three or four days ago as a tramp in want of everything but honest labor  our lamented friend consented to parley with him which was something remarkable in the doctor still more remarkable he gave him a suit of clothes and it is said some money and sent him on his way  now more remarkable than all our friend on hearing of his benefactors death actually tramps back here to attend his funeral the doctor being dead his executors not of a kind to emulate the doctors spasmodic generosity and there being no chance of future favors the act must be recorded as purely and simply gratitude  by jove i dont know but that he is the only one here who can be called a real mourner  im here because your sister is here carroll comes because you do and you come because your mother can not  and who tells you these pretty stories asked maruja with her face still turned towards carroll  the foreman harrison who with an extensive practical experience of tramps was struck with this exception to the general rule  poor man one ought to do something for him said amita compassionately  what said raymond with affected terror and spoil this perfect story  never  if i should offer him ten dollars id expect him to kick me if he took it id expect to kick him  he is not so badlooking is he maruja asked amita of her sister but maruja had already moved a few paces off with carroll and seemed to be listening to him only  raymond smiled at the pretty perplexity of amitas eyebrows over this pronounced indiscretion  dont mind them he whispered you really cannot expect to duena your elder sister  tell me would you actually like me to see if i could assist the virtuous tramp  you have only to speak  but amitas interest appeared to be so completely appeased with raymonds simple offer that she only smiled blushed and said no  marujas quick ears had taken in every word of these asides and for an instant she hated her sister for her aimless declination of raymonds proposal  but becoming consciousunder her eyelidsthat the stranger was moving away with the dispersing crowd she rejoined amita with her usual manner  the others had reentered the carriage but maruja took it into her head to proceed on foot to the rude building whence the mourners had issued  the foreman harrison flushed and startled by this apparition of inaccessible beauty at his threshold came eagerly forward  i shall not trouble you now mr harrrrison she said with a polite exaggeration of the consonants but some day i shall ride over here and ask you to show me your wonderful machines  she smiled and turned back to seek her carriage  but before she had gone many yards she found that she had completely lost it in the intervening billows of grain  she stopped with an impatient little spanish ejaculation  the next moment the stalks of wheat parted before her and a figure emerged  it was the stranger  she fell back a step in utter helplessness  he on his side retreated again into the wheat holding it back with extended arms to let her pass  as she moved forward mechanically without a word he moved backward making a path for her until she was able to discern the coachmans whip above the bending heads of the grain just beyond her  he stopped here and drew to one side his arms still extended to give her free passage  she tried to speak but could only bow her head and slipped by him with a strange feelingsuggested by his attitudethat she was evading his embrace but the next moment his arms were lowered the grain closed around him and he was lost to her view  she reached the carriage almost unperceived by the inmates and pounced upon her sister with a laugh  blessed virgin said amita where did you come from  from there said maruja with a slight nervous shiver pointing to the clustering grain  we were afraid you were lost  so was i said maruja raising her pretty lashes heavenwards as she drew a shawl tightly round her shoulders  has anything happened  you look strange said carroll drawing closer to her  here eyes were sparkling but she was very pale  nothing nothing she said hastily glancing at the grain again  if it were not that the haste would have been absolutely indecent i should say that the late doctor had made you a ghostly visit said raymond looking at her curiously  he would have been polite enough not to have commented on my looks said maruja  am i really such a fright  carroll thought he had never seen her so beautiful  her eyelids were quivering over their fires as if they had been brushed by the passing wing of a strong passion  what are you thinking of said carroll as they drove on  she was thinking that the stranger had looked at her admiringly and that his eyes were blue  but she looked quietly into her lovers face and said sweetly nothing i fear that would interest you    chapter ix  the news of the assignment of dr wests property to mrs saltonstall was followed by the still more astonishing discovery that the doctors will further bequeathed to her his entire property after payment of his debts and liabilities  it was given in recognition of her talents and business integrity during their late association and as an evidence of the confidence and undying affection of the testator nevertheless after the first surprise the fact was accepted by the community as both natural and proper under that singular instinct of humanity which acquiesces without scruple in the union of two large fortunes but sharply questions the conjunction of poverty and affluence and looks only for interested motives where there is disparity of wealth  had mrs saltonstall been a poor widow instead of a rich one had she been the doctors housekeeper instead of his business friend the bequest would have been strongly criticisedif not legally tested  but this combination which placed the entire valley of san antonio in the control of a single individual appeared to be perfectly legitimate  more than that some vague rumor of the doctors past and his early entanglements only seemed to make this eminently practical disposition of his property the more respectable and condoned for any moral irregularities of his youth  the effect upon the collateral branches of the guitierrez family and the servants and retainers was even more impressive  for once it seemed that the fortunes and traditions of the family were changed the female guitierrez instead of impoverishing the property had augmented it the foreigner and intruder had been despoiled the fate of la mision perdida had been changed the curse of koorotora had proved a blessing his prophet and descendant pereo the mayordomo moved in an atmosphere of superstitious adulation and respect among the domestics and common people  this recognition of his power he received at times with a certain exaltation of grandiloquent pride beyond the conception of any but a spanish servant and at times with a certain dull pained vacancy of perception and an expression of frightened bewilderment which also went far to establish his reputation as an unconscious seer and thaumaturgist  thou seest said sanchez to the partly skeptical faquita he does not know more than an infant what is his power  that is the proof of it  the dona maria alone did not participate in this appreciation of pereo and when it was proposed that a feast or celebration of rejoicing should be given under the old peartree by the indians mound her indignation was long remembered by those that witnessed it  it is not enough that we have been made ridiculous in the past she said to maruja by the interference of this solemn fool but that the memory of our friend is to be insulted by his generosity being made into a triumph of pereos idiotic ancestor  one would have thought those coyotes and koorotoras bones had been buried with the cruel gossip of your relationsit had been the recent habit of dona maria to allude to the family as being particularly related to maruja aloneover my poor friend  let him beware that his ancestors mound is not uprooted with the peartree and his heathenish temple destroyed  if as the engineer says a branch of the new railroad can be established for la mision perdida i agree with him that it can better pass at that point with less sacrifice to the domain it is the one uncultivated part of the park and lies at the proper angle  you surely would not consent to this my mother said maruja with a sudden impression of a newly found force in her mothers character  why not child said the relict of mr saltonstall and the mourner of dr west coldly  i admit it was discreet of thee in old times to have thy sentimental passages there with caballeros who like the guests of the hidalgo that kept a skeleton at his feast were reminded of the mutability of their hopes by koorotoras bones and the legend but with the explosion of this idea of a primal curse like eves on the property added the dona maria with a slight bitterness thou mayest have thy citaselsewhere  thou canst scarcely keep this captain carroll any longer at a distance by rattling those bones of koorotora in his face  and of a truth child since the affair of the letters and his discreet and honorable conduct since i see not why thou shouldst  he has thy mothers reputation in his hands  he is a gentleman my mother said maruja quietly  and they are scarce child and should be rewarded and preserved that is what i meant silly one this captain is not richbut then thou hast enough for both  but it was amita that first brought him here said maruja looking down with an air of embarrassed thoughtfulness which dona maria chose to instantly accept as exaggerated coyness  do not think to deceive me or thyself child with this folly thou art old enough to know a mans mind if not thine own besides i do not know that i shall object to her liking for raymond  he is very clever and would be a relief to some of thy relatives  he would be invaluable to us in the emergencies that may grow out of these mechanical affairs that i do not understandsuch as the mill and the railroad  and you propose to take a few husbands as partners in the business said maruja who had recovered her spirits  i warn you that captain carroll is as stupid as a gentleman could be  i wonder that he has not blundered in other things as badly as he has in preferring me to amita he confided to me only last night that he had picked up a pocketbook belonging to the doctor and given it to aladdin without a witness or receipt and evidently of his own accord  a pocketbook of the doctors repeated dona maria  ay but it contained nothing of thine said maruja  the poor child had sense enough to think of that  but i am in no hurry to ask your consent and your blessing yet little mother  i could even bear that amita should precede me to the altar if the exigencies of thy business require it  it might also secure captain carroll for me nay look not at me in that cheapening commercial waywith compound interest in thine eyes  i am not so poor an investment truly of thy original capital  thou art thy fathers child said her mother suddenly kissing her and that is saying enough the blessed virgin knows  go now she continued gently pushing her from the room and send amita hither she watched the disappearance of marujas slightly rebellious shoulders and added to herself and this is the child that amita really believes is pining with lovesickness for carroll so that she can neither sleep nor eat  this is the girl that faquita would have me think hath no longer any heart in her dress or in her finery  soul of joseph saltonstall ejaculated the widow lifting her shoulders and her eyes together thou hast much to account for  two weeks later she again astonished her daughter  why dost thou not join the party that drives over to see the wonders of aladdins palace today  it would seem more proper that thou shouldst accompany thy guests than raymond and amita  i have never entered his doors since the day he was disrespectful to my mothers daughter said maruja in surprise  disrespectful repeated dona maria impatiently  thy fathers daughter ought to know that such as he may be ignorant and vulgar but can not be disrespectful to her  and there are offenses child it is much more crushing to forget than to remember  as long as he has not the presumption to apologize i see no reason why thou mayst not go he has not been here since that affair of the letters  i shall not permit him to be uncivil over thatdost thou understand  he is of use to me in business  thou mayst take carroll with thee he will understand that  but carroll will not go said maruja  he will not say what passed between them but i suspect they quarreled  all the better then that thou goest alone  he need not be reminded of it  fear not but that he will be only too proud of thy visit to think of aught else  maruja who seemed relieved at this prospect of being unaccompanied by captain carroll shrugged her shoulders and assented  when the party that afternoon drove into the courtyard of aladdins palace the announcement that its hospitable proprietor was absent and would not return until dinner did not abate either their pleasure or their curiosity  as already intimated to the reader mr princes functions as host were characteristically irregular and the servants suggestion that mr princes private secretary would attend to do the honors created little interest and was laughingly waived by maruja there really is not the slightest necessity to trouble the gentleman she said politely  i know the house thoroughly and i think i have shown it once or twice before for your master  indeed she added turning to her party i have been already complimented on my skill as a cicerone after a pause she continued with a slight exaggeration of action and in her deepest contralto ahem ladies and gentlemen the ball and court in which we are now standing is a perfect copy of the court of lions at the alhambra and was finished in fourteen days in white pine gold and plaster at a cost of ten thousand dollars  a photograph of the original structure hangs on the wall you will observe ladies and gentlemen that the reproduction is perfect  the alhambra is in granada a province of spain which it is said in some respects to resemble california where you have probably observed the spanish language is still spoken by the old settlers  we now cross the stableyard on a bridge which is a facsimile in appearance and dimensions of the bridge of sighs at venice connecting the doges palace with the state prison  here on the contrary instead of being ushered into a dreary dungeon as in the great original a fresh surprise awaits us  allow me ladies and gentlemen to precede you for the surprise  we open a door thusandpresto  she stopped speechless on the threshold the fan fell from her gesticulating hand  in the centre of a brilliantlylit conservatory with golden columns a young man was standing  as her fan dropped on the tessellated pavement he came forward picked it up and put it in her rigid and mechanical fingers  the party who had applauded her apparently artistic climax laughingly pushed by her into the conservatory without noticing her agitation  it was the same face and figure she remembered as last standing before her holding back the crowding grain in the san antonio field  but here he was appareled and appointed like a gentleman and even seemed to be superior to the garish glitter of his new surroundings  i believe i have the pleasure of speaking to miss saltonstall he said with the faintest suggestion of his former manner in his halfresentful sidelong glance  i hear that you offered to dispense with my services but i knew that mr prince would scarcely be satisfied if i did not urge it once more upon you in person  i am his private secretary  at the same moment amita and raymond attracted by the conversation turned towards him  their recognition of the man they had seen at dr wests was equally distinct  the silence became embarrassing  two pretty girls of the party pressed to amitas side with halfaudible whispers  what is it  whos your handsome and wickedlooking friend  is this the surprise  at the sound of their voices maruja recovered herself coldly ladies she said with a slight wave of her fan this is mr princes private secretary  i believe it is hardly fair to take up his valuable time  allow me to thank you sir for picking up my fan  with a single subtle flash of the eye she swept by him taking her companions to the other end of the conservatory  when she turned he was gone  this was certainly an unexpected climax said raymond mischievously did you really arrange it beforehand  we leave a picturesque tramp at the edge of a grave we pass over six weeks and a bridge of sighs and hey presto we find a private secretary in a conservatory  this is quite the regular aladdin business  you may laugh said maruja who had recovered her spirits but if you were really clever youd find out what it all means  dont you see that amita is dying of curiosity  let us fly at once and discover the secret then said raymond slipping amitas arm through his  we will consult the oracle in the stables  come  the others followed leaving maruja for an instant alone  she was about to rejoin them when she heard footsteps in the passage they had just crossed and then perceived that the young stranger had merely withdrawn to allow the party to precede him before he returned to the other building through the conservatory which he was just entering in turning quickly to escape the black lace of her overskirt caught in the spines of a snakylooking cactus  she stopped to disengage herself with feverish haste in vain  she was about to sacrifice the delicate material in her impatience when the young man stepped quietly to her side  allow me  perhaps i have more patience even if i have less time he said stooping down  their ungloved hands touched maruja stopped in her efforts and stood up  he continued until he had freed the luckless flounce conscious of the soft fire of her eyes on his head and neck  there he said rising and encountering her glance  as she did not speak he continued you are thinking miss saltonstall that you have seen me before are you not  wellyou have i asked you the road to san jose one morning when i was tramping by your hedge  and as you probably were looking for something betterwhich you seem to have foundyou didnt care to listen to my directions said maruja quickly  i found a manalmost the only one who ever offered me a gratuitous kindnessat whose grave i afterwards met you  i found another man who befriended me herewhere i meet you again  she was beginning to be hysterically nervous lest any one should return and find them together  she was conscious of a tingling of vague shame  yet she lingered  the strange fascination of his halfsavage melancholy and a reproachfulness that seemed to arraign her with the rest of the world at the bar of his vague resentment held the delicate fibres of her sensitive being as cruelly and relentlessly as the thorns of the cactus had gripped her silken lace  without knowing what she was saying she stammered that she was glad he connected her with his better fortune and began to move away  he noticed it with his sidelong lids and added with a slight bitterness  i dont think i should have intruded here again but i thought you had gone  but iiam afraid you have not seen the last of me it was the intention of my employer mr prince to introduce me to you and your mother  i suppose he considers it part of my duties here  i must warn you that if you are here when he returns he will insist upon it and upon your meeting me with these ladies at dinner  perhaps sohe is my mothers friend said maruja but you have the advantage of usyou can always take to the road you know  the smile with which she had intended to accompany this speech did not come as readily in execution as it had in conception and she would have given worlds to have recalled her words  but he said thats so quietly and turned away as if to give her an opportunity to escape  she moved hesitatingly towards the passage and stopped  the sound of the returning voices gave her a sudden courage  mr  guest said the young man  if we do conclude to stay to dinner as mr prince has said nothing of introducing you to my sister you must let me have that pleasure  he lifted his eyes to hers with a sudden flush  but she had fled  she reached her party displaying her torn flounce as the cause of her delay and there was a slight quickness in her breathing and her speech which was attributed to the same grave reason  but only listen said amita weve got it all out of the butler and the grooms  its such a romantic story  what is said maruja suddenly  why the private tramps  the peripatetic secretary suggested raymond  yes continued amita mr prince was so struck with his gratitude to the old doctor that he hunted him up in san jose and brought him here since then prince has been so interested in himit appears he was somebody in the states or has rich relationsthat he has been telegraphing and making all sorts of inquiries about him and has even sent out his own lawyer to hunt up everything about him  are you listening  yes  you seem abstracted  i am hungry  why not dine here its an hour earlier than at home  aladdin would fall at your feet for the honor  do  maruja looked at them with innocent vagueness as if the possibility were just beginning to dawn upon her  and clara wilson is just dying to see the mysterious unknown again say yes little maruja  little maruja glanced at them with a large maternal compassion we shall see  mr prince on his return an hour later was unexpectedly delighted with marujas gracious acceptance of his invitation to dinner  he was thoroughly sensible of the significance which his neighbors had attached to the avoidance by the saltonstall heiress of his various parties and gorgeous festivities ever since a certain act of indiscretionnow alleged to have been produced by the exaltation of winehad placed him under ban  whatever his feelings were towards her mother he could not fail to appreciate fully this act of the daughter which rehabilitated him  it was with more than his usual extravaganceshown even in a certain exaggeration of respect towards marujathat he welcomed the party and made preparations for the dinner  the telegraph and mounted messengers were put into rapid requisition  the bridal suite was placed at the disposal of the young ladies for a dressingroom  the attendant genii surpassed themselves the evening dresses of maruja amita and the misses wilson summoned by electricity from la mision perdida and dispatched by the fleetest conveyances were placed in the arms of their maids smothered with bouquets an hour before dinner  an operatic concert troupe passing through the nearest town were diverted from their course by the slaves of the ring to discourse hidden music in the musicroom during dinner bite my finger sweetlips said miss clara wilson who had a neat taste for apt quotation to maruja that i may see if i am awake its the arabian nights all over again  the dinner was a marvel even in a land of gastronomic marvels the dessert a miracle of fruits even in a climate that bore the products of two zones  maruja from her seat beside her satisfied host looked across a bank of yellow roses at her sister and raymond and was timidly conscious of the eyes of young guest who was seated at the other end of the table between the two misses wilson  with a strange haunting of his appearance on the day she first met him she stole glances of halffrightened curiosity at him while he was eating and was relieved to find that he used his knife and fork like the others and that his appetite was far from voracious  it was his employer who was the first to recall the experiences of his past life with a certain enthusiasm and the air of a host anxious to contribute to the entertainment of his guests youd hardly believe miss saltonstall that that young gentleman over there walked across the continentand two thousand odd miles wasnt itall alone and with not much more in the way of traps than hes got on now  tell em harry how the apaches nearly gobbled you up and then let you go because they thought you as good an injun as any one of them and how you lived a week in the desert on two biscuits as big as that  a chorus of entreaty and delighted anticipation followed the suggestion  the old expression of being at bay returned for an instant to guests face but lifting his eyes he caught a look of almost sympathetic anxiety from marujas who had not spoken  it became necessary for me some time ago said guest half explanatorily to maruja to be rather explicit in the details of my journey here and i told mr prince some things which he seems to think interesting to others  that is all  to save my life on one occasion i was obliged to show myself as good as an indian in his own way and i lived among them and traveled with them for two weeks  i have been hungry as i suppose others have on like occasions but nothing more  nevertheless in spite of his evident reticence he was obliged to give way to their entreaties and with a certain grim and uncompromising truthfulness of statement recounted some episodes of his journey  it was none the less thrilling that he did it reluctantly and in much the same manner as he had answered his fathers questions and as he had probably responded to the later crossexamination of mr prince  he did not tell it emotionally but rather with the dogged air of one who had been subjected to a personal grievance for which he neither asked nor expected sympathy  when he did not raise his eyes to marujas he kept them fixed on his plate  well said prince when a longdrawn sigh of suspended emotion among the guests testified to his powers as a caterer to their amusement what do you say to some music with our coffee to follow the story  its more like a play said amita to raymond  what a pity captain carroll who knows all about indians isnt here to have enjoyed it but i suppose maruja who hasnt lost a word will tell it to him  i dont think she will said raymond dryly glancing at maruja who lost in some intricate pattern of her chinese plate was apparently unconscious that her host was waiting her signal to withdraw  at last she raised her head and said gently but audibly to the waiting prince  it is positively a newer pattern the old one had not that delicate straw line in the arabesque  you must have had it made for you  i did said the gratified prince taking up the plate  what eyes you have miss saltonstall  they see everything  except that im keeping you all waiting she returned with a smile letting the eyes in question fall with a halfparting salutation on guest as she rose  it was the first exchange of a common instinct between them and left them as conscious as if they had pressed hands  the music gave an opportunity for some desultory conversation in which mr prince and his young friend received an invitation from maruja to visit la mision and the party by common consent turned into the conservatory where the genial host begged them each to select a flower from a few especially rare exotics  when maruja received hers she said laughingly to prince will you think me very importunate if i ask for another  take what you likeyou have only to name it he replied gallantly  but thats just what i cant do responded the young girl unless she added turning to guest unless you can assist me  it was the plant i was examining today  i think i can show it to you said guest with a slight increase of color as he preceded her towards the memorable cactus near the door but i doubt if it has any flower  nevertheless it had  a bright red blossom like a spot of blood drawn by one of its thorns  he plucked it for her and she placed it in her belt  you are forgiving he said admiringly  you ought to know that she returned looking down  iwhy  you were rude to me twice  twice  yesonce at the mision of la perdida once in the road at san antonio  his eyes became downcast and gloomy  at the mision that morning i a wretched outcast only saw in you a beautiful girl intent on overriding me with her merciless beauty  at san antonio i handed the fan i picked up to the man whose eyes told me he loved you  she started impatiently  you might have been more gallant and found more difficulty in the selection she said pertly  but since when have you gentlemen become so observant and so punctilious  would you expect him to be as considerate of others  i have few claims that any one seems bound to respect he returned brusquely  then in a softer voice he added looking at her gently  you were in mourning when you came here this afternoon miss saltonstall  was i  it was for dr westmy mothers friend  it was very becoming to you  you are complimenting me  but i warn you that captain carroll said something better than that he said mourning was not necessary for me i had only to put my eyelashes at halfmast  he is a soldier you know  he seems to be as witty as he is fortunate said guest bitterly  do you think he is fortunate said maruja raising her eyes to his there was so much in this apparently simple question that guest looked in her eyes for a suggestion  what he saw there for an instant made his heart stop beating  she apparently did not know it for she began to tremble too  is he not said guest in a low voice  do you think he ought to be she found herself whispering  a sudden silence fell upon them  the voices of their companions seemed very far in the distance the warm breath of the flowers appeared to be drowning their senses they tried to speak but could not they were so near to each other that the two long blades of a palm served to hide them  in the midst of this profound silence a voice that was like and yet unlike marujas said twice go go but each time seemed hushed in the stifling silence  the next moment the palms were pushed aside the dark figure of a young man slipped like some lithe animal through the shrubbery and maruja found herself standing pale and rigid in the middle of the walk in the full glare of the light and looking down the corridor toward her approaching companions  she was furious and frightened she was triumphant and trembling without thought sense or reason she had been kissed by henry guest andhad returned it  the fleetest horses of aladdins stud that night could not carry her far enough or fast enough to take her away from that moment that scene and that sensation  wise and experienced confident in her beauty secure in her selfishness strong over others weaknesses weighing accurately the deeds and words of men and women recognizing all there was in position and tradition seeing with her fathers clear eyes the practical meaning of any divergence from that conventionality which as a woman of the world she valued she returned again and again to the trembling joy of that intoxicating moment  she though of her mother and sisters of raymond and garnier of aladdinshe even forced herself to think of carrollonly to shut her eyes with a faint smile and dream again the brief but thrilling dream of guest that began and ended in their joined and parted lips  small wonder that hidden and silent in her enwrappings as she lay back in the carriage with her pale face against the cold starry sky two other stars came out and glistened and trembled on her passionfringed lashes    chapter x  the rainy season had set in early  the last three weeks of summer drought had drained the great valley of its lifeblood the dead stalks of grain rustled like dry bones over dr wests grave  the desiccating wind and sun had wrought some disenchanting cracks and fissures in aladdins palace and otherwise disjoined it so that it not only looked as if it were ready to be packed away but had become finally untenable in the furious onset of the southwesterly rains  the gorgeous furniture of the receptionrooms was wrapped in mackintoshes the conservatory was changed into an aquarium the bridge of sighs crossed an actual canal in the stableyard  only the billiardroom and mr princes bedroom and office remained intact and in the latter one stormy afternoon mr prince himself sat busy over his books and papers  his stationwagon splashed and streaked with mud stood in the courtyard just as it had been driven from the station and the smell of the smoke of newlylit fires showed that the house had been opened only for this hurried visit of its owner  the tramping of horse hoofs in the courtyard was soon followed by steps along the corridor and the servant ushered captain carroll into the presence of his master  the captain did not remove his military overcoat but remained standing erect in the centre of the room with his forage cap in his hand  i could have given you a lift from the station said prince if you had come that way  ive only just got in myself  i preferred to ride said carroll dryly  sit down by the fire said prince motioning to a chair and dry yourself  i must ask you first the purport of this interview said carroll curtly before i prolong it further  you have asked me to come here in reference to certain letters i returned to their rightful owner some months ago  if you seek to reclaim them again or to refer to a subject which must remain forgotten i decline to proceed further  it does refer to the letters and it rests with you whether they shall be forgotten or not  it is not my fault if the subject has been dropped  you must remember that until yesterday you have been absent on a tour of inspection and could not be applied to before  carroll cast a cold glance at prince and then threw himself into a chair with his overcoat still on and his long military boots crossed before the fire  sitting there in profile prince could not but notice that he looked older and sterner than at their last interview and his cheeks were thinned as if by something more than active service  when you were here last summer began prince leaning forward over his desk you brought me a piece of news that astounded me as it did many others  it was the assignment of dr wests property to mrs saltonstall  that was something there was no gainsaying it was a purely business affair and involved nobodys rights but the assignor but this was followed a day or two after by the announcement of the doctors will making the same lady the absolute and sole inheritor of the same property  that seemed all right too for there were apparently no legal heirs since then however it has been discovered that there is a legal heirnone other than the doctors only son now as no allusion to the sons existence was made in that willwhich was a great oversight of the doctorsit is a fiction of the law that such an omission is an act of forgetfulness and therefore leaves the son the same rights as if there had been no will at all  in other words if the doctor had seen fit to throw his scapegrace son a hundred dollar bill it would have been legal evidence that he remembered him as he did not its a fair legal presumption that he forgot him or that the will is incomplete  this seems to be a question for mrs saltonstalls lawyersnot for her friends said carroll coldly  excuse me that remains for you to decidewhen you hear all  you understand at present then that dr wests property both by assignment and will was made over in the event of his death not to his legal heirs but to a comparative stranger  it looked queer to a good many people but the only explanation was that the doctor had fallen very much in love with the widowthat he would have probably married herhad he lived  with an unpleasant recollection that this was almost exactly marujas explanation of her mothers relations to dr west carroll returned impatiently if you mean that their private relations may be made the subject of legal discussion in the event of litigation in regard to the property that again is a matter for mrs saltonstall to decideand not her friends  it is purely a matter of taste  it may be a matter of discretion captain carroll  of discretion repeated carroll superciliously  well said prince leaving his desk and coming to the fireplace with his hands in his pockets what would you call it if it could be found that dr west on leaving mrs saltonstalls that night did not meet with an accident was not thrown from his horse but was coolly and deliberately murdered  captain carrolls swift recollection of the discovery he himself had made in the road and its inconsistency with the accepted theory of the accident unmistakably showed itself in his face  it was a moment before he recovered himself  but even if it can be proved to have been a murder and not an accident what has that to do with mrs saltonstall or her claim to the property  only that she was the one person directly benefited by his death  captain carroll looked at him steadily and then rose to his feet do i understand that you have called me here to listen to this infamous aspersion of a lady  i have called you here captain carroll to listen to the arguments that may be used to set aside dr wests will and return the property to the legal heir  you are to listen to them or not as you choose but i warn you that your opportunity to hear them in confidence and convey them to your friend will end here  i have no opinion in the case  i only tell you that it will be argued that dr west was unduly influenced to make a will in mrs saltonstalls favor that after having done so it will be shown that just before his death he became aware of the existence of his son and heir and actually had an interview with him that he visited mrs saltonstall that evening with the records of his sons identity and a memorandum of his interview in his pocketbook and that an hour after leaving the house he was foully murdered  that is the theory which mrs saltonstall has to consider  i told you i have no opinion  i only know that there are witnesses to the interview of the doctor and his son there is evidence of murder and the murderer is suspected there is the evidence of the pocketbook with the memorandum picked up on the spot which you handed me yourself  do you mean to say that you will permit this pocketbook handed you in confidence to be used for such an infamous purpose said carroll  i think you offered it to me in exchange for dr wests letters to mrs saltonstall returned prince dryly  the less said about that the less is likely to be said about compromising letters written by the widow to the doctor which she got you to recoverletters which they may claim had a bearing on the case and even lured him to his fate  for an instant captain carroll recoiled before the gulf which seemed to open at the feet of the unhappy family  for an instant a terrible doubt possessed him and in that doubt he found a new reason for a certain changed and altered tone in marujas later correspondence with him and the vague hints she had thrown out of the impossibility of their union  i beg you will not press me to greater candor she had written and try to forget me before you learn to hate me  for an instant he believedand even took a miserable comfort in the beliefthat it was this hideous secret and not some coquettish caprice to which she vaguely alluded  but it was only for a moment the next instant the monstrous doubt passed from the mind of the simple gentleman with only a slight flush of shame at his momentary disloyalty  prince however had noticed it not without a faint sense of sympathy look here he said with a certain brusqueness which in a man of his character was less dangerous than his smoothness i know your feelings to that familyat least to one of themand if ive been playing it pretty rough on you its only because you played it rather rough on me the last time you were here  lets understand each other  ill go so far as to say i dont believe that mrs saltonstall had anything to do with that murder but as a business man im bound to say that these circumstances and her own indiscretion are quite enough to bring the biggest pressure down on her  i wouldnt want any better bear on the market value of her rights than this  take it at its best  say that the coroners verdict is set aside and a charge of murder against unknown parties is made  one moment mr prince said carroll  i shall be one of the first to insist that this is done and i have confidence enough in mrs saltonstalls honest friendship for the doctor to know that she will lose no time in pursuing his murderers  prince looked at carroll with a feeling of half envy and half pity i think not he said dryly for all suspicion points to one man as the perpetrator and that man was mrs saltonstalls confidential servantthe mayordomo pereo  he waited for a moment for the effect of this announcement on carroll and then went on you now understand that even if mrs saltonstall is acquitted of any connivance with or even knowledge of the deed she will hardly enjoy the prosecution of her confidential servant for murder  but how can this be prevented  if as you say there are actual proofs why have they not been acted upon before  what can keep them from being acted upon now  the proofs have been collected by one man have been in possession of one man and will only pass out of his possession when it is for the benefit of the legal heirwho does not yet even know of their existence  and who is this one man  myself  youyou said carroll advancing towards him  then this is your work  captain carroll said prince without moving but drawing his lips tightly together and putting his head on one side i dont propose to have another scene like the one we had at our last meeting  if you try on anything of that kind i shall put the whole matter into a lawyers hands  i dont say that you wont regret it i dont say that i shant be disappointed too for i have been managing this thing purely as a matter of business with a view to profiting by it  it so happens that we can both work to the same end even if our motives are not the same i dont call myself an officer and a gentleman but i reckon ive run this affair about as delicately as the best of them and with a dd sight more horse sense  i want this thing hushed up and compromised to get some control of the property again and to prevent it depreciating as it would in litigation you want it hushed up for the sake of the girl and your future motherinlaw i dont know anything about your laws of honor but ive laid my cards on the table for you to see without asking what youve got in your hand  you can play the game or leave the board as you choose  he turned and walked to the windownot without leaving on carrolls mind a certain sense of firmness truthfulness and sincerity which commanded his respect  i withdraw any remark that might have seemed to reflect on your business integrity mr prince said carroll quietly  i am willing to admit that you have managed this thing better than i could and if i join you in an act to suppress these revelations i have no right to judge of your intentions  what do you propose to have me do  to state the whole case to mrs saltonstall and to ask her to acknowledge the young mans legal claim without litigation  but how do you know that she would not do this withoutexcuse mewithout intimidation  i only reckon that a woman clever enough to get hold of a million would be clever enough to keep itagainst others  i hope to show you are mistaken  but where is this heir  here  here  yes  for the last six months he has been my private secretary  i know what you are thinking of captain carroll  you would consider it indelicateeh  well thats just where we differ  by this means i have kept everything in my own handsprevented him from getting into the hands of outsidersand i intend to dispose of just as much of the facts to him as may be necessary for him to prove his title  what bargain i make with himis my affair  does he suspect the murder  no  i did not think it necessary for his good or mine  he can be an ugly devil if he likes and although there wasnt much love lost between him and the old man it wouldnt pay to have any revenge mixed up with business  he knows nothing of it  it was only by accident that looking after his movements while he was here i ran across the tracks of the murderer  but what has kept him from making known his claim to the saltonstalls are you sure he has not said carroll with a sudden thought that it might account for marujas strangeness  positive  hes too proud to make a claim unless he could thoroughly prove it and only a month ago he made me promise to keep it dark hes too lazy to trouble himself about it much anywayas far as i can see  dd if i dont think his being a tramp has made him lose his taste for everything  dont worry yourself about him  he isnt likely to make confidences with the saltonstalls for he dont like em and never went there but once instinctively or not the widow didnt cotton to him and i fancy miss maruja has some old grudge against him for that fan business on the road  she isnt a girl to forgive or forget anything as i happen to know he added with an uneasy laugh  carroll was too preoccupied with the danger that seemed to threaten his friends from this surly pretender to resent princes tactless allusion he was thinking of marujas ominous agitation at his presence at dr wests grave  do they suspect him at allhe asked hurriedly  how should they  he goes by the name of guestwhich was his fathers real name until changed by an act of legislation when he first came here  nobody remembers it  we only found it out from his papers  it was quite legal as all his property was acquired under the name of west  carroll rose and buttoned his overcoat  i presume you are able to offer conclusive proofs of everything you have asserted  perfectly  i am going to the mision perdida now said captain carroll quietly tomorrow i will bring you the answerpeace or war he walked to the door lifted his hand to his cap with a brief military salutation and disappeared    chapter xi  as captain carroll urged his horse along the miry road to la mision perdida he was struck with certain changes in the landscape before him other than those wrought by the winter rains  there were the usual deep gullies and trenches halffilled with water in the fields and along the road but there were ominous embankments and ridges of freshly turned soil and a scattered fringe of timbers following a cruel undeviating furrow on the broad grazing lands of the mision but it was not until he had crossed the arroyo that he felt the full extent of the late improvements  a quick rumbling in the distance a light flash of steam above the willow copse that drifted across the field on his right and he knew that the railroad was already in operation  captain carroll reined in his frightened charger and passed his hand across his brow with a dazed sense of loss  he had been gone only four monthsyet he already felt strange and forgotten  it was with a feeling of relief that he at last turned from the highroad into the lane  here everything was unchanged except that the ditches were more thickly strewn with the sodden leaves of fringing oaks and sycamores  giving his horse to a servant in the courtyard he did not enter the patio but crossing the lawn stepped upon the long veranda  the rain was dripping from its eaves and striking a minute spray from the vines that clung to its columns his footfall awoke a hollow echo as he passed as if the outer shell of the house were deserted the formal yews and hemlocks that in summer had relieved the dazzling glare of six months sunshine had now taken gloomy possession of the garden and the evening shadows thickened by rain seemed to lie in wait at every corner  the servant who had with oldfashioned courtesy placed the keys and the disposition of that wing of the house at his service said that dona maria would wait upon him in the salon before dinner  knowing the difficulty of breaking the usual rigid etiquette and trusting to the happy intervention of marujathough here again custom debarred him from asking for herhe allowed the servant to remove his wet overcoat and followed him to the stately and solemn chamber prepared for him  the silence and gloom of the great house so grateful and impressive in the ardent summer began to weigh upon him under this shadow of an overcast sky  he walked to the window and gazed out on the cloisterlike veranda  a melancholy willow at an angle of the stables seemed to be wringing its hands in the rising wind  he turned for relief to the dim fire that flickered like a votive taper in the vaultlike hearth and drew a chair towards it  in spite of the impatience and preoccupation of a lover he found himself again and again recurring to the story he had just heard until the vengeful spirit of the murdered doctor seemed to darken and possess the house  he was striving to shake off the feeling when his attention was attracted to stealthy footsteps in the passage  could it be maruja  he rose to his feet with his eye upon the door  the footsteps ceasedit remained closed  but another door which had escaped his attention in the darkened corner slowly swung on its hinges and with a stealthy step pereo the mayordomo entered the room  courageous and selfpossessed as captain carroll was by nature and education this malevolent vision and incarnation of the thought uppermost in his mind turned him cold  he had half drawn a derringer from his breast when his eye fell on the grizzled locks and wrinkled face of the old man and his hand dropped to his side but pereo with the quick observation of insanity had noticed the weapon and rubbed his hands together with a malicious laugh  good good good he whispered rapidly in a strange bodiless voice t will serve t will serve  and you are a soldier tooand know how to use it  good it is a providence  he lifted his hollow eyes to heaven and then added come come  carroll stepped towards him  he was alone and in the presence of an undoubted madmanone strong enough in spite of his years to inflict a deadly injury and one whom he now began to realize might have done so once before  nevertheless he laid his hand on the old mans arm and looking him calmly in the eye said quietly come  where pereo  i have only just arrived  i know it whispered the old man nodding his head violently  i was watching them when you rode up  that is why i lost the scent but together we can track them stillwe can track them  eh captain eh come  come and he moved slowly backward waving his hand towards the door  track whom pereo said carroll soothingly  whom do you seek  whom said the old man startled for a moment and passing his hand over his wrinkled forehead  whom  eh  why the dona maruja and the little black cather maidfaquita  yes but why seek them  why track them  why said the old man with a sudden burst of impotent passion you ask me why  because they are going to the rendezvous again they are going to seek him  do you understandto seek himthe coyote  carroll smiled a faint smile of reliefsothe coyote  ay said the old man in a confidential whisper the coyote but not the big oneyou understandthe little one  the big one is deaddeaddead  but the little one lives yet  you shall do for him what i pereolisten he glanced around the room furtivelywhat ithe good old pereo did for the big one  good it is a providence come  of the terrible thoughts that crossed carrolls mind at this unexpected climax one alone was uppermost  the trembling irresponsible wretch before him meditated some vague crimeand maruja was in danger  he did not allow himself to dwell upon any other suspicion suggested by that speech he quickly conceived a plan of action  to have rung the bell and given pereo into the hands of the servants would have only exposed to them the lunatics secretif he had anyand he might either escape in his fury or relapse into useless imbecility  to humor him and follow him and trust afterwards to his own quickness and courage to avert any calamity seemed to be the only plan  captain carroll turned his clear glance on the restless eyes of pereo and said without emotion let us go then and quickly  you shall track them for me but remember good pereo you must leave the rest to me  in spite of himself some accidental significance in this ostentatious adjuration to lull pereos suspicions struck him with pain but the old mans eyes glittered with gratified passion as he said ay good  i will keep my word  thou shalt work thy will on the little one as i have said  truly it is a providence  come seeing captain carroll glance round for his overcoat he seized a poncho from the wall wrapped it round him and grasped his hand carroll who would have evaded this semblance of disguise had no time to parley and they turned together through the door by which pereo had entered into a long dark passage which seemed to be made through the outer shell of the building that flanked the park following his guide in the profound obscurity perfectly conscious that any change in his madness might be followed by a struggle in the dark where no help could reach them they presently came to a door that opened upon the fresh smell of rain and leaves  they were standing at the bottom of a secluded alley between two high hedges that hid it from the end of the garden  its grassgrown walk and untrimmed hedges showed that it was seldom used carroll still keeping close to pereos side felt him suddenly stop and tremble  look he said pointing to a shadowy figure some distance before them look tis maruja and alone  with a dexterous movement carroll managed to slip his arm securely through the old mans and even to throw himself before him as if in his eagerness to discern the figure  tis marujaand alone said pereo trembling  alone  eh  and the coyote is not here  he passed his hand over his staring eyes so suddenly he turned upon carroll  ah do you not see it is a trick the coyote is escaping with faquita  come  nay thou wilt not  then will i  with an unexpected strength born of his madness he freed his arm from carroll and darted down the alley the figure of maruja evidently alarmed at his approach glided into the hedge as pereo passed swiftly by intent only on his one wild fancy  without a further thought of his companion or even the luckless faquita carroll also plunged through the hedge to intercept maruja  but by that time she was already crossing the upper end of the lawn hurrying towards the entrance to the patio carroll did not hesitate to follow  keeping in view the lithe dark active little figure now hidden by an intervening cluster of bushes now fading in the gathering evening shadows he nevertheless did not succeed in gaining upon her until she had nearly reached the patio  here he lost ground as turning to the right instead of entering the courtyard she kept her way toward the stables  he was near enough however to speak  one moment miss saltonstall he said hurriedly there is no danger  i am alone  but i must speak with you  the young girl seemed only to redouble her exertions  at last she stopped before a narrow door hidden in the wall and fumbled in her pocket for a key  that moment carroll was upon her  forgive me miss saltonstallmaruja but you must hear me  you are safe but i fear for your maid faquita  a little laugh followed his speech the door yielded and opened to her vanishing figure  for an instant the lace shawl muffling her face was lifted as the door closed and locked behind her  carroll drew back in consternation  it was the laughing eyes and saucy face of faquita    chapter xii  when captain carroll turned from the highroad into the lane an hour before maruja and faquita had already left the house by the same secret passage and gardendoor that opened afterwards upon himself and pereo  the young women had evidently changed dresses maruja was wearing the costume of her maid faquita was closely veiled and habited like her mistress but it was characteristic that while faquita appeared awkward and overdressed in her borrowed plumes marujas short saya and trim bodice with the striped shawl that hid her fair head looked infinitely more coquettish and bewitching than on its legitimate owner  they passed hurriedly down the long alley and at its further end turned at right angles to a small gate half hidden in the shrubbery it opened upon a venerable vineyard that dated back to the occupation of the padres but was now given over to the chance cultivation of peons and domestics  its long broken rows of low vines knotted and overgrown with age reached to the thicketed hillside of buckeye that marked the beginning of the canada  here maruja parted from her maid and muffling the shawl more closely round her head hastily passed between the vine rows to a ruined adobe building near the hillside  it was originally part of the refectory of the old mision but had been more recently used as a vinaderos cottage  as she neared it her steps grew slower until reaching its door she hesitated with her hand timidly on the latch  the next moment she opened it gently it was closed quickly behind her and with a little stifled cry she found herself in the arms of henry guest  it was only for an instant the pleading of her white hands disengaged from his neck where at first they had found themselves and uplifted before her face touched him more than the petitioning eyes or the sweet voiceless mouth whose breath even was forgotten letting her sink into the chair from which he had just risen he drew back a step with his hands clasped before him and his dark halfsavage eyes bent earnestly upon her  well might he have gazed  it was no longer the conscious beauty proud and regnant seated before him but a timid frightened girl struggling with her first deep passion  all that was wise and gentle that she had intended to say all that her clear intellect and experience had taught her died upon her lips with that kiss  and all that she could do of womanly dignity and highbred decorum was to tuck her small feet under her chair in the desperate attempt to lengthen her short skirt and beg him not to look at her  i have had to change dresses with faquita because we were watched she said leaning forward in her chair and drawing the striped shawl around her shoulders  i have had to steal out of my mothers house and through the fields as if i was a gypsy  if i only were a gypsy harry and not  and not the proudest heiress in the land he interrupted with something of his old bitterness  true i had forgot  but i never reminded you of it she said lifting her eyes to his i did not remind you of it on that dayininin the conservatory nor at the time you first spoke ofoflove to menor from the time i first consented to meet you here  it is you harry who have spoken of the difference of our condition you who have talked of my wealth my family my positionuntil i would gladly have changed places with faquita as i have garments if i had thought it would make you happier  forgive me darling he said dropping on one knee before her and bending over the cold little hand he had taken until his dark head almost rested in her lap  forgive me  you are too proud maruja to admit even to yourself that you have given your heart where your hand and fortune could not follow  but others may not think so  i am proud too and will not have it said that i have won you before i was worthy of you  you have no right to be more proud than i sir she said rising to her feet with a touch of her old supreme assertion  nodont harryplease harrythere  nevertheless she succumbed and when she went on it was with her head resting on his shoulder  its this deceit and secrecy that is so shameful harry  i think i could bear everything with you if it were all knownif you came to woo me likelikethe others  even if they abused youif they spoke of your doubtful originof your povertyof your hardships  when they aspersed you i could fight them when they spoke of your having no father that you could claim i could even lie for you i think harry and say that you had if they spoke of your poverty i would speak of my wealth if they talked of your hardships i should only be proud of your enduranceif i could only keep the tears from my eyes  they were there now  he kissed them away  but if they threatened you  if they drove me from the house  i should fly with you she said hiding her head in his breast  what if i were to ask you to fly with me now he said gloomily  now she repeated lifting her frightened eyes to his  his face darkened with its old look of savage resentment  hear me maruja he said taking her hands tightly in his own  when i forgot myselfwhen i was mad that day in the conservatory the only expiation i could think of was to swear in my inmost soul that i would never take advantage of your forgiveness that i would never tempt you to forget yourself your friends your family for me an unknown outcast  when i found you pitied me and listened to my lovei was too weak to forego the one ray of sunshine in my wretched lifeand thinking that i had a prospect before me in an idea i promised to reveal to you later i swore never to beguile you or myself in that hope by any act that might bring you to repent itor myself to dishonor  but i taxed myself too much maruja  i have asked too much of you  you are right darling this secrecythis deceitis unworthy of us  every hour of itblest as it has been to meevery momentsweet as it isblackens the purity of our only defense makes you false and me a coward it must end heretoday  maruja darling my precious one  god knows what may be the success of my plans  we have but one chance now  i must leave here today never to return or i must take you with me do not start marujabut hear me out  dare you risk all  dare you fly with me now tonight to the old padre at the ruined mision and let him bind us in those bonds that none dare break  we can take faquita with usit is but a few milesand we can return and throw ourselves at your mothers feet  she can only drive us forth together or we can fly from this cursed wealth and all the misery it has entailedforever  she raised her head and with her two hands on his shoulders gazed at him with her fathers searching eyes as if to read his very soul  are you mad harrythink what you propose  is this not tempting me think again dearest she said half convulsively seizing his arm when her grasp had slipped from his shoulder  there was a momentary silence as she stood with her eyes fixed almost wildly on his set face  but a sudden shock against the bolted door and an inarticulate outcry startled them  with an instinctive movement guest threw his arm round her  its pereo she said in a hurried whisper but once more mistress of her strength and resolution  he is seeking you  fly at once  he is mad harry a raving lunatic  he watched us the last time  he has tracked us here  he suspects you  you must not meet him  you can escape through the other door that opens upon the canada  if you love mefly  and leave you exposed to his furyare you mad  no  fly yourself by the other door lock it behind you and alarm the servants  i will open this door to him secure him here and then be gone  do not fear for me  there is no dangerand if i mistake not he added with a strange significance he will hardly attack me  but he may have already alarmed the household  hark  there was the noise of a struggle outside the door and then the voice of captain carroll calm and collected rose clearly for an instant you are quite safe miss saltonstall  i think i have him secure but perhaps you had better not open the door until assistance comes  they gazed at each other without a word  a grim challenge played on guests lips  maruja lifted her little hands deliberately and clasped them round his defiant neck  listen darling she said softly and quietly as if only the security of silence and darkness encompassed them  you asked me just now if i would fly with youif i would marry you without the consent of my familyagainst the protest of my friendsand at once  i hesitated harry for i was frightened and foolish  but i say to you now that i will marry you when and where you likefor i love you harry and you alone  then let us go at once he said passionately seizing her we can reach the road by the canada before assistance comesbefore we are discovered  come  and you will remember in the years to come harry she said still composedly and with her arms still around his neck that i never loved any but youthat i never knew what love was before and that since i have loved youi have never thought of any other will you not  i willand now  and now she said with a superb gesture towards the barrier which separated them from carroll open the door    chapter xiii  with a swift glance of admiration at maruja guest flung open the door the hastilysummoned servants were already bearing away the madman exhausted by his efforts  captain carroll alone remained there erect and motionless before the threshold  at a sign from maruja he entered the room  in the flash of light made by the opening door he had been perfectly conscious of her companion but not a motion of his eye or the movement of a muscle of his face betrayed it  the trained discipline of his youth stood him in good service and for the moment left him master of the situation  i think no apology is needed for this intrusion he said with cool composure  pereo seemed intent on murdering somebody or something and i followed him here  i suppose i might have got him away more quietly but i was afraid you might have thoughtlessly opened the door  he stopped and added i see now how unfounded was the supposition  it was a fatal addition  in the next instant the maruja who had been standing beside guest consciousstricken and remorseful in the presence of the man she had deceived and calmly awaiting her punishment changed at this luckless exhibition of her own peculiar womanly weapons  the old maruja supreme ready undaunted and passionless returned to the fray  you were wrong captain she said sweetly fortunately mr guestwhom i see you have forgotten in your absencewas with me and i think would have felt it his duty to have protected me  but i thank you all the same and i think even mr guest will not allow his envy of your good fortune in coming so gallantly to my rescue to prevent his appreciating its full value  i am only sorry that on your return to la mision perdida you should have fallen into the arms of a madman before extending your hands to your friends  their eyes met  she saw that he hated herand felt relieved  it may not have been so entirely unfortunate he said with a coldness strongly in contrast with his gradually blazing eyes for i was charged with a message to you in which this madman is supposed by some to play an important part  is it a matter of business said maruja lightly yet with a sudden instinctive premonition of coming evil in the relentless tones of his voice  it is business miss saltonstallpurely and simply business said carroll dryly under whatever other name it may have been since presented to you  perhaps you have no objection to tell it before mr guest said maruja with an inspiration of audacity it sounds so mysterious that it must be interesting  otherwise captain carroll who abhors business would not have undertaken it with more than his usual enthusiasm  as the business does interest mr guest or mr west or whatever name he may have decided upon since i had the pleasure of meeting him said carrollfor the first time striking fire from the eyes of his rivali see no reason why i should not even at the risk of telling you what you already know  briefly then mr prince charged me to advise you and your mother to avoid litigation with this gentleman and admit his claim as the son of dr west to his share of the property  the utter consternation and bewilderment shown in the face of maruja convinced carroll of his fatal error  she had received the addresses of this man without knowing his real position  the wild theory that had seemed to justify his resentmentthat she had sold herself to guest to possess the propertynow recoiled upon him in its utter baseness  she had loved guest for himself alone by this base revelation he had helped to throw her into his arms  but he did not even yet know maruja  turning to guest with flashing eyes she said is it trueare you the son of dr west andshe hesitatedkept out of your inheritance by us  i am the son of dr west he said earnestly though i alone had the right to tell you that at the proper time and occasion believe me that i have given no one the rightleast of all any tool of princeto trade upon it  then said carroll fiercely forgetting everything in his anger perhaps you will disclaim before this young lady the charge made by your employer that pereo was instigated to dr wests murder by her mother  again he had overshot the mark  the horror and indignation depicted in guests face was too plainly visible to maruja as well as himself to permit a doubt that the idea was as new as the accusation  forgetting her bewilderment at these revelations her wounded pride a torturing doubt suggested by guests want of confidence in herindeed everything but the outraged feelings of her lover she flew to his side  not a word she said proudly lifting her little hand before his darkening face  do not insult me by replying to such an accusation in my presence  captain carroll she continued turning towards him i cannot forget that you were introduced into my mothers house as an officer and a gentleman  when you return to it as such and not as a man of business you will be welcome  until then farewell  she remained standing erect and passionless as carroll with a cold salutation stepped back and disappeared in the darkness and then she turned and with tottering step and a little cry fell upon guests breast  o harryharrywhy have you deceived me  i thought it for the best darling he said lifting her face to his you know now the prospect i spoke ofthe hope that buoyed me up  i wanted to win you myself alone without appealing to your sense of justice or even your sympathies  i did win you  god knows if i had not you would never have learned through me that a son of dr west had ever lived  but that was not enough  when i found that i could establish my right to my fathers property i wanted you to marry me before you knew it so that it never could be said that you were influenced by anything but love for me  that was why i came here today  that was why i pressed you to fly with me  he ceased  she was fumbling with the buttons of his waistcoat harry she said softly did you think of the property whenwhenyou kissed me in the conservatory  i thought of nothing but you he answered tenderly  suddenly she started from his embrace  but pereoharrytell me quickno onenobody can think that this poor demented old man couldthat dr west wasthatits all a trickisnt it harryspeak  he was silent for a moment and then said gravely there were strange men at the fonda that night andmy father was supposed to carry money with him  my own life was attempted at the mision the same evening for the sake of some paltry gold pieces that i had imprudently shown  i was saved solely by the interference of one man  that man was pereo your mayordomo  she seized his hand and raised it joyfully to her lips  thank you for those words  and you will come to him with me at once and he will recognize you and we will laugh at those lies wont we harry  he did not reply  perhaps he was listening to a confused sound of voices rapidly approaching the cottage  together they stepped out into the gathering night  a number of figures were coming towards them among them faquita who ran a little ahead to meet her mistress  oh dona maruja he has escaped  who  not pereo  truly  and on his horse  it was saddled and bridled in the stable all day  one knew it not  he was walking like a cat when suddenly he parted the peons around him like grain before a mad bulland behold he was on the pintos back and away  and alas there is no horse that can keep up with the pinto  god grant he may not get in the way of the rrrailroad that in his very madness he will even despise  my own horse is in the thicket whispered guest hurriedly in marujas ear  i have measured him with the pinto before now give me your blessing and i will bring him back if he be alive  she pressed his hand and said go  before the astonished servants could identify the strange escort of their mistress he was gone  it was already quite dark  to any but guest who had made the topography of la mision perdida a practical study and who had known the habitual circuit of the mayordomo in his efforts to avoid him the search would have been hopeless  but rightly conjecturing that he would in his demented condition follow the force of habit he spurred his horse along the highroad until he reached the lane leading to the grassy amphitheatre already described which was once his favorite resort  since then it had participated in the terrible transformation already wrought in the valley by the railroad  a deep cutting through one of the grassy hills had been made for the line that now crossed the lower arc of the amphitheatre  his conjecture was justified on entering it by the appearance of a shadowy horseman in full career round the circle and he had no difficulty in recognizing pereo  as there was no other exit than the one by which he came the other being inaccessible by reason of the railroad track he calmly watched him twice make the circuit of the arena ready to ride towards him when he showed symptoms of slackening his speed  suddenly he became aware of some strange exercise on the part of the mysterious rider and as he swept by on the nearer side of the circle he saw that he was throwing a lasso  a horrible thought that he was witnessing an insane rehearsal of the murder of his father flashed across his mind  a faroff whistle from the distant woods recalled him to his calmer senses at the same moment that it seemed also to check the evolutions of the furious rider  guest felt confident that the wretched man could not escape him now  it was the approaching train whose appearance would undoubtedly frighten pereo toward the entrance of the little valley guarded by him  the hillside was already alive with the clattering echoes of the oncoming monster when to his horror he saw the madman advancing rapidly towards the cutting  he put spurs to his horse and started in pursuit but the train was already emerging from the narrow passage followed by the furious rider who had wheeled abreast of the engine and was for a moment or two madly keeping up with it guest shouted to him but his voice was lost in the roar of the rushing caravan  something seemed to fly from pereos hand  the next moment the train had passed rider and horse crushed and battered out of all life were rolling in the ditch while the murderers empty saddle dangled at the end of a lasso caught on the smokestack of one of the murdered mans avenging improvements                                                 the marriage of maruja and the son of the late dr west was received in the valley of san antonio as one of the most admirably conceived and skillfully matured plans of that lamented genius there were many who were ready to state that the doctor had confided it to them years before and it was generally accepted that the widow saltonstall had been simply made a trustee for the benefit of the prospective young couple  only one person perhaps did not entirely accept these views it was mr james priceotherwise known as aladdin  in later years he is said to have stated authoritatively that the only combination in business that was uncertainwas man and woman
