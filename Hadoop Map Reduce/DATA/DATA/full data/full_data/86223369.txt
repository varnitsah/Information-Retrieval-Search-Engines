86223369	man on the ocean a book about boats and ships by rm ballantyne    chapter one  treats of ships in general  there is perhaps no contrivance in the wide world more wonderful than a shipa fullrigged wellmanned gigantic ship  those who regard familiar objects in art and nature as mere matters of course and do not trouble themselves to wander out of the beaten track of everyday thought may not at first feel the force or admit the truth of this statement  let such folk endeavour to shake themselves vigorously out of this beaten track of everyday thought  let them knit their brows and clench their teeth and gaze steadfastly into the fire or up at the sky and try to realise what is involved in the idea ofa ship  what would the men of old have said if you had told them that you intended to take yonder large wooden house launch it upon the sea and proceed in it out of sight of land for a few days  poor fellow they would have replied you are mad  ah many a wise philosopher has been deemed mad not only by men of old but by men of modern days  this mad idea has long since been fulfilled for what is a ship but a wooden house made to float upon the sea and sail with its inmates hither and thither at the will of the guiding spirit over a trackless unstable ocean for months together  it is a selfsustaining movable hotel upon the sea  it is an oasis in the desert of waters so skilfully contrived as to be capable of advancing against wind and tide and of outliving the wildest stormsthe bitterest fury of winds and waves  it is the residence of a community whose country for the time being is the ocean or as in the case of the great eastern steamship it is a town with some thousands of inhabitants launched upon the deep  ships are as it were the electric sparks of the world by means of which the superabundance of different countries is carried forth to fill reciprocally the voids in each  they are not only the media of intercourse between the various families of the human race whereby our shores are enriched with the produce of other lands but they are the bearers of inestimable treasures of knowledge from clime to clime and of gospel light to the uttermost ends of the earth  but for ships we should never have heard of the wonders of the coral isles and the beauties of the golden south or the phenomena and tempests of the icy north  but for ships the stirring adventures and perils of magellan drake cook etcetera had never been encountered and even the farfamed robinson crusoe himself had never gladdened and saddened and romantically maddened the heart of youth with his escapes his fights his parrots and his philosophy as he now does and as he will continue to do till the end of time  some account then of ships and boats with anecdotes illustrative of the perils to which they are frequently exposed cannot fail we think to prove interesting to all especially to boys for whose particular edification we now write  boys of all creatures in this world are passionately fond of boats and ships they make them of every shape and size with every sort of tool and hack and cut their fingers in the operation as we know from early personal experience  they sail them and wet their garments in so doing to the wellknown sorrow of all rightminded mammas  they lose them too and break their hearts almost at the calamity  they make little ones when they are little and big ones when they grow big and when they grow bigger they not unfrequently forsake the toy for the reality embark in some noble craft and wed the stormy sea  a word in your ear reader at this point  do not think that because you fall in love with a ship you will naturally and necessarily fall in love with the sea  some do and some dont with those who do it is well with those who dont and yet go to sea it is remarkably ill think philosophically about going to sea my lads  try honestly to resist your own inclination as long as possible and only go if you find that you cant help it  in such a case you will probably find that you are cut out for itnot otherwise  we love the sea with a true and deep affection and often have we tossed upon her foamtopped waves but we dont wish to be a sailorby no manner of means  and now boys come along and we will conduct you as pleasantly and profitably as we can from a ships cradle through all her stormy existence to her grave    chapter two  the earliest days of watertravelling  once upon a time there were no ships  men did not know the meaning of the word they did not want them and for many many centuries the seagulls had the ocean all to themselves  but boats are of very ancient date  doubtless the first boats must have been constructed by the first men who dwelt on the earth  they consisted probablyfor we are now in the land of conjectureof stumps of fallen trees or bundles of rushes seated astride of which the immediate descendants of our first parents ferried themselves over small lakes and across rivers  wet feet are not agreeable under any circumstances  we can conceive that prolonged voyages performed in this fashionsay several hundred yards or a milerendered those primitive mariners so uncomfortable that they resolved to improve their condition and after much earnest thought hit upon the plan of fastening several logs together by means of twigs and thus they formed rafts  as time progressed and men began to display wisdom in making tools of stone and in the moulding of metal we can imagine that they soon bethought themselves of flattening the surface of their rafts and then finding them unwieldy and difficult to manage no doubt they hit upon the idea of hollowing out the logs  adzes were probably not invented at that time so they betook themselves to the element of firewhich is at the present day used by savage nations for the same purposeand burned out the insides of their logs  thus canoes sprang into being  but such canoes were clumsy and heavy besides being liable to split men therefore bethought themselves of constructing a light framework of wood which they covered with bark or skin  then artificers in iron invented saws logs were ripped up planks were formed pitch oozed ready to hand from the trees with grass perchance they caulked the seamsand soon the first boat floated on the waterclumsy and tublike no doubt but serviceable withaland youths of a hundred years old and fullgrown men of two or three hundred capered and shouted on the shore with delight at the great invention while venerable patriarchs of seven or eight hundred summers gazed in wonder with almost prophetic solemnity and exclaimed that they had never before seen the like of that in all the course of their long long lives  those times are old nowso old that men can scarcely get their minds to realise how old they are nevertheless the craft that were used then are used even now and that not only among the savages of distant lands but by men living at our very doors  the coracle a basketboat of the most primitive description is still occasionally met with in south wales  it is neither more nor less than a large wicker basket covered with a hide and is tubshaped and clumsy to a degree  when the romans invaded britain this species of boat was in common use  like the canoe of the north american indian it is easily upset and we should think must be rather unmanageable but as we are not likely ever again to be reduced to it in this country we can afford to regard its faults with indifference  from little boats to big boats there is but a step and no doubt rivers were soon navigated and new countries explored while those who lived near the seacoast dared even to launch their boats upon the ocean but they hugged the shore undoubtedly and seldom ventured to proceed at night unless the stars shone brightly in the sky  years rolled on and dwellers on the seacoast became more and more venturous in their voyages along the shore  it behoved them to have larger boats or barges with numerous rowers who would naturally carry weapons with them to guard themselves from foes  wargalleys sprang into being  strong winds sometimes carried these offshore and out of sight of land  ah reader who can conceive the feelings of the first mariners who saw the solid land sink on the horizon and beheld nothing substantial in all the waste of waters save their own tiny bark that reeled beneath them on the heaving billows  perchance these first adventurers on the deep found their way back to land and afterwards tried the bold experiment of steering by the stars  perhaps not but at length it did come about that ships were built and men were found bold enough to put to sea in them for days and weeks together  the ark is the first ship of which we have any authentic account  we now leave the region of conjecture for the ark was built by noah under the immediate direction of the almighty and we have a minute account of it in the bible  more than two thousand three hundred years before our lord and saviour jesus christ came to earth mans wickedness had attained to such a height that god resolved to destroy the inhabitants of the world by a deluge  but in the midst of wrath god remembered mercy  he spared noah and his family and saved them from destruction by placing them in the ark along with pairs of the lower animals  every reader of the bible knows the story of the deluge but everyone may not be aware that traditions of this deluge are found in every part of the earth  east west north and southcivilised and savageall men tell us of a great flood which once covered the world and from which only one family was saved in a boat or a canoe or an ark  what the barbarous and savage nations know dimly from tradition we know certainly and fully from the inspired word of god  the ark was built the flood came noah with his family and two of every living creature entered into it and for months the first ship floated on a sea whose shoreless waves flowed round and round the world  what the arks form was we cannot precisely tell but we know its dimensions pretty accurately  although it was not intended for voyaging the ark must necessarily have been a perfect model of a vessel meant to float upon the waters  to some extent too it must have been fitted to ride upon turbulent billows for it went upon the face of the waters for upwards of seven months and before it rested finally on the top of mount ararat god made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters assuaged  in regard to its size the most interesting way to consider it perhaps will be to compare it with the great eastern the largest ship that has yet been built by man  assuming a cubit to be about 18 inches the length of the ark was about 450 feet its breadth about 75 feet and its depth about 45 feet  the great easterns length is 680 feet its breadth 83 feet and its depth from deck to keel 60 feet  the ark was built of gopherwood which is thought by some to be pine by others cedar  it consisted of three stories and had a window and a door and was pitched within and without  but it had neither masts nor rudder and it is evident that although it was mans refuge the ark was not designed to be managed by man for after noah and his family had entered in god took on himself the guidance and preservation of their vessel  thus our saviourof whom the ark was a typespecially guides and protects those who flee to him for refuge  but although we have noticed the ark as being the first ship we cannot with propriety place it in the front of the history of navigation after the flood the ark seems to have been soon forgotten or at least imperfectly remembered and men reverted to their little canoes and clumsy boats which sufficed for all their limited wants  it was not until about a thousand years later in the worlds history that men built ships of considerable size and ventured on prolonged coasting voyages for the purposes of discovery and commerce  navigation had been practised and the art of shipbuilding had made very considerable progress long before men dared to lose sight of the shore and venture out upon the mysterious bosom of the great unknown sea  to the ancients the mediterranean was the ocean and among its bays and creeks and islands maritime enterprise sprang into being and rose into celebrity  among the phoenicians the egyptians and hebrews we find the earliest traces of navigation and commerce  the first of these nations occupying the narrow slip of land between mount lebanon and the mediterranean rose into fame as mariners between the years 1700 and 1100 before christthe renowned city of sidon being their great seaport whence their ships put forth to trade with cyprus and rhodes greece sardinia sicily gaul and spain  little is known of the state of trade in those days or of the form or size of ancient vessels homer tells us in his account of the trojan war that the phoenicians supplied the combatants with many articles of luxury and from scripture we learn that the same enterprising navigators brought gold to solomon from ophir in the year 1000 bc  a short time previous to this the phoenicians ventured to pass through the strait of gibraltar and for the first time beheld the great atlantic ocean  proceeding along the coast of spain they founded cadiz and not long after creeping down the western coast of africa established colonies there  but their grandest feat was achieved about 600 years bc when they sailed down the red sea and the eastern coast of africa doubled the cape of good hope sailed up the western coast and returned home by the strait of gibraltar  bartholomew diaz must hide his diminished head before this fact for although he gets all the credit the phoenicians of old doubled the cape at least twenty centuries before him  that long voyages were made by the men of old before authentic history began seems highly probable  the expedition of the argonauts to colchis in the year 1250 bc in search of the golden fleece is the first ancient voyage that lays claim to authenticity  what the golden fleece was is uncertain some think it was a term used to symbolise the mines of precious metals near the black sea  whatever it was the argonauts went in search of it whether or not they found it is unrecorded in history  jason son of the king of thessaly was the leader of this expedition which consisted of one ship and fifty men  a man named argus built the ship which from him was named the argo hence the name of argonauts  in treating of ancient vessels we may as well proceed on the principle suggested by a sagacious child who when his mother was about to tell him a story usually begged of her to bedin at the bedinning  we shall begin at the beginning    chapter three  rafts and canoes  rafts as we have already remarked must undoubtedly have been the beginning of navigation  but they have not like many other species of ancient craft been altogether superseded by modern inventions  true we do not nowadays carry on war on rafts but we still carry on trade with them in many parts of the world  how the rafts of ancient times were formed we cannot tell precisely though we can easily guess but one thing we know and that is that the first improvement made in such craft was the thrusting of a few thick planks down into the water to the depth of three or four feet between the logs which composed the raft  these acted the part of a keel and by pressing against the water sideways when a side wind blew prevented the raft from making much of what is called leewaythat is drifting in the direction in which the wind happened to be blowing  some sorts of dutch vessels use leeboards for this purpose at the present time  the rafts now in use on the great rivers of america are exceedingly curious in many respects  one peculiarity of many of them is that they float themselves not goods to marketthe pine logs of which they are constructed being the marketable commodity  some of these lumberrafts as they are called are of great size and as their navigators have often to spend many weeks on them slowly floating down the rivers they build huts or little cottages on them cook their provisions on board and in short spend night and day in their temporary floatinghomes as comfortably as if they were on the land  when these rafts approach a waterfall or a rapid they unfasten the lashings and allow several logs tied together to run down at a time after the rapid is passed the loose logs are collected together the raft is reconstructed and the voyage down to the sea continued  of course huts are built only on rafts which navigate the largest rivers and are not thus liable to be taken to pieces  when the logs reach the sea they are shipped to various parts of the world where timber is scarce  large quantities are imported into great britain from canada and other parts of america  a bold thing has occasionally been done  instead of shipping the logs in vessels enterprising and ingenious men built them into a solid ship leaving a small space to serve as a cabin and a hold for provisions then erecting masts they hoisted sail and in this singular craft crossed the atlantic  on arriving at port they broke up their raftship and sold it  the immense size of the rafts which are floated down some of the great rivers of the world may be gathered from the following engraving which represents a raft on the dwina one of the great rivers of russia  rafts however have not been confined to the purposes of traffic  they have frequently been the means of saving the lives of shipwrecked mariners but too often they have been the means only of prolonging the wretched existence of those who have ultimately perished at sea    turning now from the consideration of rafts we shall describe canoes  canoes must we think have been invented after rafts  they were formed as we have said out of logs of bark and of skins stretched upon frames of wood  of ancient canoes we can say little  but it is probable that they were similar in most respects to the canoes used by savage nations at the present time for man in his lowest or most savage condition is necessarily the same now that he was in ancient times  we shall therefore take a glance at the canoes of savage nations now existing and thus shall form a good idea we doubt not of what canoes were in days of old  simplest among them all perhaps are the canoes of the north american indians  these are built of thin laths and ribs of wood and are covered with the bark of the birchtree  the sheets of bark are not a quarter of an inch thick  several sheets are used in the covering of one canoe  they are sewed together with the long pliant roots of the pine and the seams are rendered tight with gum procured from the same tree  so light are these canoes that two men can carry on their shoulders one capable of holding eight or ten men with their provisions etcetera for a voyage of many months  they are of various sizesfrom the hunting canoe which holds one indian to the largest canoe that carries fourteen  they are propelled by short paddles instead of oars  many and terrible are the risks run by voyageurs who travel through the lakes and rivers of north america in these canoes  the following anecdote is related of a narrow escape made by some furtraders while descending one of the rivers in the backwoods of the hudson bay territoryone fine evening in autumn a northcanoe was gliding swiftly down one of the noble bends in the river referred to new beautiful and everchanging scenes were being constantly opened up to the view of the voyageurs whose plaintive and beautiful canoesongs were rolling over the waters  suddenly the song ceased as the distant roar of a waterfall struck their ears and the steersmen for there are usually two one in the bow and one in the sternprepared to land and make a portagethat is carry the canoe and lading past the falls by land and relaunch and reload in the smooth water below  the approach to the landingplace at the head of the fall was somewhat difficult owing to a point of rock which projected into the stream in the direction of the fall and round which point it was necessary to steer with some dexterity in order to avoid being drawn into the strong current  the fearless guides however had often passed the place in former years in safety and accordingly dashed at the point with reckless indifference their paddles flinging a circle of spray over their heads as they changed from side to side with graceful but vigorous rapidity  the swift stream carried them quickly round the point of danger and they had almost reached the quiet eddy near the landingplace when the stem of the canoe was caught by the current which instantly whirled it out from the shore and carried it down stream like an arrow  another moment and the gushing water dragged them to the verge of the fall which thundered and foamed among frightful chasms and rocks many feet below  it was the work of a moment  the stern of the canoe almost overhung the abyss and the voyageurs plied their paddles with the desperation of men who felt that their lives depended on the exertions of the next awful minute  for a few seconds the canoe remained stationary and seemed to tremble on the brink of destruction the strength of the water and the power of the men being almost equally balancedthen inch by inch it began slowly to ascend the stream  the danger was past  a few nervous strokes and the canoe shot out of the current like an arrow and floated in safety in the still water below the point  the whole thing from beginning to end occurred in a few seconds but who can describe or comprehend the tumultuous gush of feeling aroused during those brief moments in the bosoms of the voyageurs  the sudden electric change from tranquil safety to the verge of what appeared certain destructionand then deliverance  it was one of those thrilling incidents which frequently occur to those who thread the wildernesses of this world and is little thought of by them beyond the moment of danger yet it was one of those solemn seasons more or less numerous in the history of all men when the almighty speaks to his careless creatures in a voice that cannot be mistaken however much it may be slighted awakening them with a rough grasp to behold the slender cord that suspends them over the abyss of eternity  the canoes used by the eskimos who inhabit the polar regions are made of a light framework of wood which is covered entirely over with sealskina round hole being left in the centre in which the eskimo sits  round this hole there is a loose piece of skin which is drawn up by the man and fastened round his waist  the machine is thus completely watertight  no waves can dash into although they can sweep over it and if by chance it should upset the eskimo can turn it and himself up into the proper position by one dexterous sweep of his long doublebladed paddle  the paddle which varies from ten to fifteen feet is simply a pole with a blade at each end  it is grasped in the centre and each end dipped alternately on either side of the kayak as this canoe is called  eskimo kayaks are firstrate seaboats  they can face almost any sort of weather  they are extremely light and are propelled by the natives very swiftly  in these frail canoes the natives of the polar regions pursue seals and whales and even venture to attack the walrus in his native element  the kayak is used exclusively by the men  the oomiak or womens canoe is of much larger and clumsier construction somewhat like a boat  it is open above and can hold a large family of women and children  like the kayak it is a framework of wood covered with sealskin and is propelled by means of short paddles of the spoon form  the famous rob roy canoe which is now so much in vogue among boys and young men of aquatic tendency is constructed and managed on precisely the same principles with the eskimo kayak the only difference between the two being that the rob roy canoe is made of thin wood instead of skin and is altogether a more elegant vessel  an account of it will be found in our chapter on boats  the south sea islanders also use a canoe which they propel with a doublebladed paddle similar to that of the eskimos  they are wonderfully expert and fearless in the management of this canoe as may be seen from the annexed woodcut  in order to show that the paddle of the canoe is more natural to man than the oar we present a picture of the canoe used by the indians of the amazon in south america  here we see thar the savages of the south like their brethren of the north sit with their faces to the bow and urge their bark forward by neans of short paddles without using the gunwale as a fulcrum  the oar is decidedly a more modern and a more scientific instrument than the paddle but the latter is better suited to some kinds of navigation than the former  very different indeed from the light canoes just described are the canoes of the south sea islanders  some are large and some are small some long some short a few elegant a few clumsy and one or two peculiarly remarkable  most of them are narrow and liable to upset in order to prevent which catastrophe the natives have ingeniously though clumsily contrived a sort of outrigger or plank which they attach to the side of the canoe to keep it upright  they also fasten two canoes together to steady them  one of these double canoes is thus described by cheever in his island world of the pacifica double canoe is composed of two single ones of the same size placed parallel to each other three or four feet apart and secured in their places by four or five pieces of wood curved just in the shape of a bitstock  these are lashed to both canoes with the strongest cinet made of cocoanut fibre so as to make the two almost as much one as same of the double ferryboats that ply between brooklyn and new york  a flattened arch is thus made by the bowlike crosspieces over the space between the canoes upon which a board or a couple of stout poles laid lengthwise constitute an elevated platform for passengers and freight while those who paddle and steer sit in the bodies of the canoes at the sides  a slender mast which may be unstepped in a minute rises from about the centre of this platform to give support to a very simple sail now universally made of white cotton cloth but formerly of mats  the double canoes belonging to the chiefs of the south sea islanders are the largestsome of them being nearly seventy feet long yet they are each only about two feet wide and three or four feet deep  the sterns are remarkably highfifteen or eighteen feet above the water  the war canoes are also large and compactly built the stern being low and covered so as to afford shelter from stones and darts  a rude imitation of a head or some grotesque figure is usually carved on the stern while the stem is elevated curved like the neck of a swan and terminates frequently in the carved figure of a birds head  these canoes are capable of holding fifty warriors  captain cook describes some as being one hundred and eight feet long  all of them whether single or double mercantile or war canoes are propelled by paddles the men sitting with their faces in the direction in which they are going  as may be supposed these canoes are often upset in rough weather but as the south sea islanders are expert swimmers they generally manage to right their canoes and scramble into them again  their only fear on such occasions is being attacked by sharks  ellis in his interesting book polynesian researches relates an instance of this kind of attack which was made upon a number of chiefs and peopleabout thirtytwowho were passing from one island to another in a large double canoethey were overtaken by a tempest the violence of which tore their canoes from the horizontal spars by which they were united it was in vain for them to endeavour to place them upright again or to empty out the water for they could not prevent their incessant overturning  as their only resource they collected the scattered spars and boards and constructed a raft on which they hoped they might drift to land  the weight of the whole number who were collected on the raft was so great as to sink it so far below the surface that they stood above their knees in water  they made very little progress and soon became exhausted by fatigue and hunger  in this condition they were attacked by a number of sharks  destitute of a knife or any other weapon of defence they fell an easy prey to these rapacious monsters one after another was seized and devoured or carried away by them and the survivors who with dreadful anguish beheld their companions thus destroyed saw the number of their assailants apparently increasing as each body was carried off until only two or three remained  the raft thus lightened of its load rose to the surface of the water and placed them beyond the reach of the voracious jaws of their relentless destroyers  the tide and current soon carried them to the shore where they landed to tell the melancholy fate of their fellowvoyagers  captain cook refers to the canoes of new zealand thus  the ingenuity of these people appears in nothing more than in their canoes  they are long and narrow and in shape very much resemble a new england whaleboat  the larger sort seem to be built chiefly for war and will carry from forty to eighty or a hundred armed men  we measured one which lay ashore at tolaga she was sixtyeight and a half feet long five feet broad and three and a half feet deep  the bottom was sharp with straight sides like a wedge and consisted of three lengths hollowed out to about two inches or one inch and a half thick and well fastened together with strong plaiting  each side consisted of one entire plank sixtythree feet long ten or twelve inches broad and about one inch and a quarter thick and these were fitted and lashed to the bottom part with great dexterity and strength  a considerable number of thwarts were laid from gunwale to gunwale to which they were securely lashed on each side as a strengthening to the boat  the ornament at the head projected five or six feet beyond the body and was about four and a half feet high  the ornament at the stern was fixed upon that end as the sternpost of a ship is upon her keel and was about fourteen feet high two broad and one inch and a half thick  they both consisted of boards of carved work of which the design was much better than the execution  all their canoes except a few at opoorage or mercury bay which were of one piece and hollowed by fire are built after this plan and few are less than twenty feet long some of the smaller sort have outriggers and sometimes two are joined together but this is not common  the carving upon the stern and head ornaments of the inferior boats which seemed to be intended wholly for fishing consists of the figure of a man with the face as ugly as can be conceived and a monstrous tongue thrust out of the mouth with the white shells of seaears stuck in for eyes  but the canoes of the superior kind which seem to be their menofwar are magnificently adorned with openwork and covered with loose fringes of black feathers which had a most elegant appearance  the gunwale boards were also frequently carved in a grotesque taste and adorned with tufts of white feathers placed upon black ground  the paddles are small and neatly made  the blade is of an oval shape or rather of a shape resembling a large leaf pointed at the bottom broadest in the middle and gradually losing itself in the shaft the whole length being about six feet  by the help of these oars they push on their boats with amazing velocity  mr ellis to whose book reference has already been made and who visited the south sea islands nearly half a century later than cook tells us that the single canoes used by some of the islanders are far safer than the double canoes for long voyages as the latter are apt to be torn asunder during a storm and then they cannot be prevented from constantly upsetting  single canoes are not so easily separated from their outrigger nevertheless they are sometimes upset in rough seas but the natives dont much mind this  when a canoe is upset and fills the natives who learn to swim like ducks almost as soon as they can walk seize hold of one end of the canoe which they press down so as to elevate the other end above the sea by which means a great part of the water runs out they then suddenly loose their hold and the canoe falls back on the water emptied in some degree of its contents  swimming along by the side of it they bale out the rest and climbing into it pursue their voyage  europeans however are not so indifferent to being overturned as are the savages  on one occasion mr ellis accompanied by three ladies mrs orsmond mrs barff and his wife with her two children and one or two natives were crossing a harbour in the island of huahine  a female servant was sitting in the forepart of the canoe with mr elliss little girl in her arms  his infant boy was at its mothers breast and a native with a long light pole was paddling or pushing the canoe along when a small buhoe with a native youth sitting in it darted out from behind a bush that hung over the water and before they could turn or the youth could stop his canoe it ran across the outrigger  this in an instant went down the canoe was turned bottom upwards and the whole party precipitated into the sea  the sun had set soon after they started from the opposite side and the twilight being very short the shades of evening had already thickened round them which prevented the natives on shore from seeing their situation  the native woman being quite at home in the water held the little girl up with one hand and swam with the other towards the shore aiding at the same time mrs orsmond who had caught hold of her long hair which floated on the water behind her  mrs barff on rising to the surface caught hold of the outrigger of the canoe that had occasioned the disaster and calling out loudly for help informed the people on shore of their danger and speedily brought them to their assistance  mrs orsmonds husband happening to be at hand at the time rushed down to the beach and plunged at once into the water  his wife on seeing him quitted her hold of the native woman and grasping her husband would certainly have drowned both him and herself had not the natives sprung in and rescued them  mahinevahine the queen of the island leaped into the sea and rescued mrs barff mr ellis caught hold of the canoe and supported his wife and their infant until assistance came  thus they were all saved  the south sea islanders of whose canoes we have been writing aresome of them at leastthe fiercest savages on the face of the earth  they wear little or no clothing and practise cannibalismthat is maneatingfrom choice  they actually prefer human flesh to any other  of this we are informed on most unquestionable authority  doubtless the canoes which we have described are much the same now as they were a thousand years ago so that by visiting those parts of the earth where the natives are still savage we may as it were leap backward into ancient times and behold with our own eyes the state of marine architecture as it existed when our own forefathers were savages and paddled about the thames and the clyde on logs and rafts and wickerwork canoes    chapter four  ancient ships and navigators  everything must have a beginning and however right and proper things may appear to those who begin them they generally wear a strange sometimes absurd aspect to those who behold them after the lapse of many centuries  when we think of the trimbuilt ships and yachts that now cover the ocean far and wide we can scarce believe it possible that men really began the practice of navigation and first put to sea in such grotesque vessels as that represented on page 55  in a former chapter reference has been made to the rise of commerce and maritime enterprise to the fleets and feats of the phoenicians egyptians and hebrews in the mediterranean where commerce and navigation first began to grow vigorous  we shall now consider the peculiar structure of the ships and boats in which their maritime operations were carried on  boats as we have said must have succeeded rafts and canoes and big boats soon followed in the wake of little ones  gradually as mens wants increased the magnitude of their boats also increased until they came to deserve the title of little ships  these enormous boats or little ships were propelled by means of oars of immense size and in order to advance with anything like speed the oars and rowers had to be multiplied until they became very numerous  in our own day we seldom see a boat requiring more than eight or ten oars  in ancient times boats and ships required sometimes as many as four hundred oars to propel them  the forms of the ancient ships were curious and exceedingly picturesque owing to the ornamentation with which their outlines were broken and the high elevation of their bows and sterns  we have no very authentic details of the minutiae of the form or size of ancient ships but antiquarians have collected a vast amount of desultory information which when put together enables us to form a pretty good idea of the manner of working them while ancient coins and sculptures have given us a notion of their general aspect  no doubt many of these records are grotesque enough nevertheless they must be correct in the main particulars  homer who lived 1000 bc gives in his odyssey an account of shipbuilding in his time to which antiquarians attach much importance as showing the ideas then prevalent in reference to geography and the point at which the art of shipbuilding had then arrived  of course due allowance must be made for homers tendency to indulge in hyperbole  ulysses king of ithaca and deemed on of the wisest greeks who went to troy having been wrecked upon an island is furnished by the nymph calypso with the means of building a shipthat hero being determined to seek again his native shore and return to his home and his faithful spouse penelope    forth

thy loom calypso for the future sails   supplied the cloth capacious of the gales   with stays and cordage last he rigged the ship   and rolled on levers launched her on the deep  the ships of the ancient greeks and romans were divided into various classes according to the number of ranks or banks that is rows of oars  monoremes contained one bank of oars biremes two banks triremes three quadriremes four quinqueremes five and so on but the two latter were seldom used being unwieldy and the oars in the upper rank almost unmanageable from their great length and weight  ptolemy philopator of egypt is said to have built a gigantic ship with no less than forty tiers of oars one above the other  she was managed by 4000 men besides whom there were 2850 combatants she had four rudders and a double prow  her stern was decorated with splendid paintings of ferocious and fantastic animals her oars protruded through masses of foliage and her hold was filled with grain  that this account is exaggerated and fanciful is abundantly evident but it is highly probable that ptolemy did construct one ship if not more of uncommon size  the sails used in these ships were usually square and when there was more than one mast that nearest the stern was the largest  the rigging was of the simplest description consisting sometimes of only two ropes from the mast to the bow and stern  there was usually a deck at the bow and stern but never in the centre of the vessel  steering was managed by means of a huge broad oar sometimes a couple at the stern  a formidable beak was affixed to the forepart of the ships of war with which the crew charged the enemy  the vessels were painted black with red ornaments on the bows to which latter homer is supposed to refer when he writes of redcheeked ships  ships built by the greeks and romans for war were sharper and more elegant than those used in commerce the latter being round bottomed and broad in order to contain cargo  the corinthians were the first to introduce triremes into their navy about 700 years bc and they were also the first who had any navy of importance  the athenians soon began to emulate them and ere long constructed a large fleet of vessels both for war and commerce  that these ancient ships were light compared with ours is proved by the fact that when the greeks landed to commence the siege of troy they drew up their ships on the shore  we are also told that ancient mariners when they came to a long narrow promontory of land were sometimes wont to land draw their ships bodily across the narrowest part of the isthmus and launch them on the other side  moreover they had a salutary dread of what sailors term blue water that is the deep distant seaand never ventured out of sight of land they had no compass to direct them and in their coasting voyages of discovery they were guided if blown out to sea by the stars  the sails were made of linen in homers time subsequently sailcloth was made of hemp rushes and leather  sails were sometimes dyed of various colours and with curious patterns  huge ropes were fastened round the ships to bind them more firmly together and the bulwarks were elevated beyond the frame of the vessels by wickerwork covered with skins  stones were used for anchors and sometimes crates of small stones or sand but these were not long of being superseded by iron anchors with teeth or flukes  the romans were not at first so strong in naval power as their neighbours but in order to keep pace with them they were ultimately compelled to devote more attention to their navies  about 260 bc they raised a large fleet to carry on the war with carthage  a carthaginian quinquereme which happened to be wrecked on their coast was taken possession of by the romans used as a model and one hundred and thirty ships constructed from it  these ships were all built it is said in six days but this appears almost incredible  we must not however judge the power of the ancients by the standard of present times  it is well known that labour was cheap then and we have recorded in history the completion of great works in marvellously short time by the mere force of myriads of workmen  the romans not only succeeded in raising a considerable navy but they proved themselves ingenious in the contrivance of novelties in their wargalleys  they erected towers on the decks from the top of which their warriors fought as from the walls of a fortress  they also placed small cages or baskets on the top of their masts in which a few men were placed to throw javelins down on the decks of the enemy a practice which is still carried out in principle at the present day men being placed in the tops of the masts of our menofwar whence they fire down on the enemy  it was a bullet from the top of one of the masts of the enemy that laid low our greatest naval hero lord nelson  from this time the romans maintained a powerful navy  they crippled the maritime power of their african foes and built a number of ships with six and even ten ranks of oars  the romans became exceedingly fond of representations of seafights and julius caesar dug a lake in the campus martius specially for these exhibitions  they were not by any means sham fights  the unfortunates who manned the ships on these occasions were captives or criminals who fought as the gladiators did to the deathuntil one side was exterminated or spared by imperial clemency  in one of these battles no fewer than a hundred ships and nineteen thousand combatants were engaged  such were the people who invaded britain in the year 55 bc under julius caesar and such the vessels from which they landed upon our shores to give battle to the then savage natives of our country  it is a curious fact that the crusades of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were the chief cause of the advancement of navigation after the opening of the christian era  during the first five hundred years after the birth of our lord nothing worthy of notice in the way of maritime enterprise or discovery occurred  but about this time an event took place which caused the foundation of one of the most remarkable maritime cities in the world  in the year 476 italy was invaded by the barbarians  one tribe the veneti who dwelt upon the northeastern shores of the adriatic escaped the invaders by fleeing for shelter to the marshes and sandy islets at the head of the gulf whither their enemies could not follow by land owing to the swampy nature of the ground nor by sea on account of the shallowness of the waters  the veneti took to fishing then to making salt and finally to mercantile enterprises  they began to build too on those sandy isles and soon their cities covered ninety islands many of which were connected by bridges  and thus arose the farfamed city of the watersbeautiful venice the bride of the sea  soon the venetians and their neighbours the genoese monopolised the commerce of the mediterranean  the crusades now began and for two centuries the christian warred against the turk in the name of him who they seem to have forgotten if indeed the mass of them ever knew is styled the prince of peace  one of the results of these crusades was that the europeans engaged acquired a taste for eastern luxuries and the fleets of venice and genoa pisa and florence ere long crowded the mediterranean laden with jewels silks perfumes spices and such costly merchandise  the normans the danes and the dutch also began to take active part in the naval enterprise thus fostered and the navy of france was created under the auspices of philip augustus  the result of all this was that there was a great moving and to some extent commingling of the nations  the knowledge of arts and manufactures was interchanged and of necessity the knowledge of various languages spread  the west began constantly to demand the products of the east wealth began to increase and the sum of human knowledge to extend  shortly after this era of opening commercial prosperity in the mediterranean the hardy northmen performed deeds on the deep which outrival those of the great columbus himself and were undertaken many centuries before his day  the angles the saxons and the northmen inhabited the borders of the baltic the shores of the german ocean and the coasts of norway  like the nations on the shores of the mediterranean they too became famous navigators but unlike them war and piracy were their chief objects of pursuit  commerce was secondary  in vessels resembling that of which the above is a representation those nations went forth to plunder the dwellers in more favoured climes and to establish the anglosaxon dominion in england and their celebrated king alfred became the founder of the naval power of britain which was destined in future ages to rule the seas  it was the northmen who in huge open boats pushed off without chart or compass for neither existed at that time into the tempestuous northern seas and in the year 863 discovered the island of iceland in 983 the coast of greenland and a few years later those parts of the american coast now called long island rhode island massachusetts nova scotia and newfoundland  it is true they did not go forth with the scientific and commercial views of columbus neither did they give to the civilised world the benefit of their knowledge of those lands  but although their purpose was simply selfish we cannot withhold our admiration of the bold daring spirit displayed by those early navigators under circumstances of the greatest possible disadvantage with undecked or halfdecked boats meagre supplies no scientific knowledge or appliances and the stars their only guide over the trackless waste of waters  in the course of time one or two adventurous travellers pushed into asia and men began to ascertain that the world was not the insignificant disc or cylinder or ball they had deemed it  perhaps one of the chief among those adventurous travellers was marco polo a venetian who lived in the latter part of the thirteenth century  he made known the central and eastern portions of asia japan the islands of the indian archipelago part of the continent of africa and the island of madagascar and is considered the founder of the modern geography of asia  the adventures of this wonderful man were truly surprising and although he undoubtedly exaggerated to some extent in his account of what he had seen his narrations are for the most part truthful  he and his companions were absent on their voyages and travels twentyone years  marco polo died but the knowledge of the east opened up by him his adventures and his wealth remained behind to stir up the energies of european nations  yet there is no saying how long the world would have groped on in this twilight of knowledge and mariners would have continued to hug the shore as in days gone by had not an event occurred which at once revolutionised the science of navigation and formed a new era in the history of mankind  this was the invention of the mariners compass    chapter five  the mariners compassportuguese discoveries  what is the compass every philosophical youth of inquiring disposition will naturally ask  we do not say that all youths will make this inquiry  many there are who will at once say oh i know  its a needle with a card on the top of itsometimes a needle with a card under itwhich always points to the north and shows sailors how to steer their ships  very well explained indeed my selfsufficient friend but you have not answered the question  you have told us what a compass is like and one of the uses to which it is applied but you have not yet told what it is  a man who had never heard of a compass might exclaim what a needle  is it a darning needle or a knitting needle or a drawingthrough needle  and which end points to the norththe eye or the point  and if you lay it on the table the wrong end to the north will it turn round of its own accord  you laugh perhaps and explain but it would have been better to have explained correctly at first  thus  the mariners compass is a small flat bar of magnetised steel which when balanced on a pivot turns one of its ends persistently towards the north polethe other of course towards the south pole and it does this in consequence of its being magnetised  a card is fixed above sometimes below this bar of steel which is called the needle whereon are marked the cardinal pointsnorth south east and westwith their subdivisions or intermediate points by means of which the true direction of any point can be ascertained  aha you exclaim mr author but you yourself have omitted part of the explanation  why is it that the magnetising of the needle causes it to turn to the north  i answer humbly i cannot tell but further i assert confidently neither can anybody else  the fact is known and we see its result but the reason why magnetised steel or iron should have this tendency this polarity is one of the mysteries which man has not yet been able to penetrate and probably never will  having explained the nature of the compass as far as explanation is possible we present our reader with a picture of one  it will be seen that there are four large pointsn s e and wthe cardinal points above referred to and that these are subdivided by twelve smaller points with one little black triangular point between each and a multitude of smaller points round the outer circle  to give these points their correct names is called boxing the compassa lesson which all seamen can trip off their tongues like a b c and which most boys could learn in a few hours  for the sake of those who are anxious to acquire the knowledge we give the following explanation let us begin with north  the large point midway between n and e to the right is northeast  the corresponding point midway between n and w to the left is northwest  a glance will show that the corresponding points towards the south are respectively southeast and southwest usually written se and sw as the two former points are written ne and nw  now to read off the compass with this amount of knowledge is very simple  thus north northeast east southeast south southwest west northwest north  but be it observed that in the language of the sea the th is thrown overboard except when the words north and south occur alone  when conjoined with other points they are pronounced thus noreast soueast and so on  to come now to the smaller subdivisions it will suffice to take a quarter of the circle  the point midway between ne and n is nornoreast nne and the corresponding one between ne and e is east noreast ene  these points are again subdivided by little black points which are thus namedthe first next the n is north by east n by e the corresponding one next the e is east by north e by n  the second black point from n is noreast by north ne by n and the corresponding onenamely the second black point from eastis noreast by east ne by e  thus in reading off the compass we saybeginning at north and proceeding to east north north by east nornoreast noreast by north noreast noreast by east east noreast east by north eastand so on with the other quarters of the circle  so much for boxing the compass  the manner in which it is used on board ship and the various instruments employed in connection with it in the working of a vessel at sea will be explained shortly but first let us glance at the history of the compass  it is a matter of great uncertainty when where and by whom the mariners compass was invented  flavio gioia a neapolitan captain or pilot who lived about the beginning of the fourteenth century was generally recognised throughout europe as the inventor of this useful instrument but time and research have thrown new light on this subject probably the neapolitan pilot was the first who brought the compass into general notice in europe but long before 1303 the year in which it was said to have been invented the use of the magnetic needle was known to the chinese  loadstone that mineral which has the mysterious power of attracting iron and also of imparting to iron its own attractive power was known to the chinese before the year 121 in which year a famous chinese dictionary was completed wherein the word magnet is defined as the name of a stone which gives direction to a needle  this proves not only that they knew the attractive properties of the loadstone and its power of imparting these properties to metal but also that they were aware of the polarity of a magnetised needle  another chinese dictionary published between the third and fourth centuries speaks of ships being guided in their course to the south by means of the magnet and in a medical work published in china in 1112 mention is made of the variation of the needle showing that the chinese had not only used the needle as a guide at sea but had observed this one of its wellknown peculiaritiesnamely the tendency of the needle to point in a very slight degree away from the true north  in the thirteenth century too we find mention made of the needle by a poet and by two other writers so that whatever flavio gioia may have done and it is probable he did much in the way of pushing the compass into notice in europe he cannot be said to be the inventor of it  that honour doubtless belongs to the chinese  be this as it may the compass was invented and in the fourteenth century it began that revolution in maritime affairs to which we have alluded  the first compasses were curiously formed  the chinese used a magnetised needle which they placed in a bit of rush or pith which was floated in a basin of water and thus allowed to move freely and turn towards the poles  they also made needles in the form of iron fish  an arabian author of the thirteenth century thus writesi heard it said that the captains in the indian seas substitute for the needle and reed a hollow iron fish magnetised so that when placed in the water it points to the north with its head and to the south with its tail  the reason that the iron fish does not sink is that metallic bodies even the heaviest float when hollow and when they displace a quantity of water greater than their own weight  the use of the compass at sea is so simple that after what has been said it scarcely requires explanation  when a ship sets sail for any port she knows first of all the position of the port from which she sets sail as well as that to which she is bound  a straight line drawn from the one to the other is her true course supposing that there is deep unobstructed water all the way and if the compass be placed upon that line the point of the compass through which it passes is the point by which she ought to steer  suppose that her course ran through the east point of the compass the ships head would at once be turned in that direction and she would continue her voyage with the needle of the compass pointing straight across the deck and the east and west points straight along it  but various causes arise in the actual practice of navigation to prevent a ship keeping her true course  winds may be contrary and currents may drive her either to the one side or the other of it while land promontories islands and shallowscompel her to deviate from the direct line  a vessel also makes what is called leeway which means that when the wind blows on her side she not only advances forward but also slides through the water sidewise  thus in the course of a day she may get a considerable distance off her true coursein sea parlance make a good deal of leeway  to perform the voyage correctly and safely in the face of these obstacles and hindrances is the aim and end of navigation and the manner of proceeding is as follows  the hour is carefully noted on setting sail and from that moment night and day to the end of the voyage certain observations are made and entered in the ships journal called the log  every hour the rate at which the ship is going is ascertained and carefully noted  the point of the compass towards which the ship is to be steered is given by the captain or officer in command to the steersman who stands at the wheel with a compass always before him in a box called the binnacle  the course is never changed except by distinct orders from those in command and when it is changed the hour when the change is made and the new course to be steered are carefully noted down  thus at the end of the day or at any other time if desired the position of the ship can be ascertained by her course being drawn upon a chart of the ocean over which she is sailingcorrect charts or maps being provided by the captain before starting  the estimate thus made is however not absolutely correct  it is called the deadreckoning and is only an approximation to the truth because allowance has to be made for leeway which can only be guessed at  allowance has also to be made for variations in the rate of sailing in each hour for the winds do not always blow with exactly the same force during any hour of the day  on the contrary they may vary several times within an hour both in force and in direction  those variations have to be watched and allowed for but such allowance may be erroneous in a greater or less degree  currents too may have exerted an unseen influence on the ship thus rendering the calculation still less correct  nevertheless deadreckoning is often the only guide the sailor has to depend upon for days at a time when storms and cloudy skies prevent him from ascertaining his true position by other means of which we shall speak presently  of course in the early days of navigation there were no charts of the ocean  the navigator knew not whither he was hurrying over the wild waste of waters but by observing the relative position of some of the fixed stars to his course while sailing out to sea he could form a rough idea of the proper course to steer in order to return to the port whence he had started  the compass then shows the sailor the course he has been going and the log of which more presently enables him to ascertain the rate at which he has proceeded while his chronometers or timekeepers tell him the time during which the course and rate of sailing have been kept up  and many a long cruise on the unknown deep has been successfully accomplished in days of old by bold seamen with this method of deadreckoning and many a mariner at the present day depends almost entirely on it while all are during thick stormy weather dependent on it for days and sometimes weeks together  the log to which we have referred is the instrument by which is determined the rate at which a ship is progressing  it is a very simple contrivance a triangular piece of wood about the size of a large saucer with a piece of stout cord fastened to each corner the ends of the cords being tied together so that when held up the log as it is called resembles one of a pair of scales  one of the cords however is only temporarily attached to its corner by means of a peg which when violently pulled comes out  one edge of the triangle is loaded with lead  the whole machine is fastened to the loglinea stout cord many fathoms long which is wound on a large reel  heaving the log as we have said takes place every hour  one sailor stands by with a sandglass which runs exactly half a minute  another holds the wooden reel and a third heaves the log overboard and pays out line as fast as he can make the reel spin  the instant it is thrown the first sailor turns the sandglass  the log being loaded on one side floats perpendicularly in the water remaining stationary of course while the man who hove it watches sundry knots on the line as they pass over the stern of the ship each knot representing a mile of rate of speed in the hour  as the last grain of sand drops to the bottom of the glass the first sailor gives a sharp signal and the second clutches and checks the line examines the knot nearest his hand and thus knows at once how many knots or miles the ship is sailing at that time  the sudden stoppage of the line jerks the peg before referred to out of the log thereby allowing the other two fixed cords to drag it flat and unresisting over the surface of the sea when the line is reeled up and put by  the flight of another hour calls for a repetition of the heaving of the log  as scientific knowledge advanced instruments of peculiar and more complicated form were devised to enable navigators to ascertain more correctly their position on the surface of the sea but they did not and never will supersede the method by deadreckoningfor this reason that the latter can be practised at all times while the former are useless unless the sun moon or stars be visible which in some latitudes they are not for many days and weeks when clouds and fogs shroud the bright sky from view  the quadrant is the chief of those instruments  it is represented on next page  to give a succinct account of this would take up more space than we can spare  it may suffice the general reader to say that by observing the exact position of the sun at noon or of the moon or a star in relation to the horizon the precise latitude of a shipthat is her distance north or south of the equatoris ascertained  the method of taking an observation is complicated and difficult to explain and understand  we refer those who are curious on the point to treatises on navigation  chronometers are exceedingly delicate and perfect timekeepers or watches which are very carefully set at the commencement of a voyage thus the time at the meridian whence a vessel starts is kept up during the voyage  by means of an observation of the sun with the quadrant or sextant a somewhat similar instrument the true time at any particular point in the voyage may be ascertained  a difference is found to exist between the time at the spot where the observation is taken and the time of the chronometer  a calculation founded on this difference gives the ships longitudethat is her distance east or west of the meridian that passes through greenwich  that meridian is an imaginary line drawn round the world longitudinally and passing through the north and south poles as the equator is a line passing round it latitudinally  when a ships latitude and longitude have been ascertained and a line drawn through the first parallel to the equator and another line through the second parallel to the first meridian the point where these two lines intersect is the exact position of the ship upon the sea  the size and form of ships having gradually improved the compass and other scientific appliances having been discovered cannon also and gunpowder having been invented seamen became more courageous and venturesome and at last the portuguese nation began that career of maritime enterprise which won for it the admiration of the world  about the beginning of the fourteenth century 1330 the canary islands lying off the west coast of africa were rediscovered by the accident of a french ship being blown off the coast in a storm and finding shelter amongst them  this group had been known to the ancients under the name of the fortunate islands but had been forgotten for more than a thousand years  during the course of the century the spaniards plucked up courage to make discoveries and settlements upon them although by so doing they were compelled to undergo that muchdreaded ordealsailing out of sight of their once fondly hugged land  in the beginning of the next century arose a prince don henry son of john the first of portugal whose anxiety to promote discovery and to find a passage by sea round the coast of africa to india induced him to send out many expeditions all of which accomplished something and many of which added very extensively to the geographical knowledge of the world at that time  navigators sent out by him from time to time discovered the madeira islands sailed along the western coast of africa a considerable distance ascertained the presence of golddust among the savages on the gulf of guinea discovered the azores besides numerous other islands and lands crossed the equator and approached to within about eighteen hundred miles of the southmost cape of africa  the discovery of golddust stirred up the energies of the portuguese in a remarkable degree and caused them cheerfully to undertake ventures which without that inducement they would probably never have undertaken at all  moreover they had now learned to quail less at the idea of losing sight of land and towards the end of the fifteenth century 1486 bartholomew diaz an officer of the household of john the second achieved the grand object which had long been ardently desired by the portuguesehe doubled the great southern cape of africa which king john named the cape of good hope although diaz had named it the cape of tempests  the circumstance is thus alluded to by a poet of that period    at lisboas court they told their dread escape   and from her raging tempests named the cape   thou southmost point the joyful king exclaimed   cape of good hope be thou for ever named    chapter six  boats modelboat making etcetera  leaving the subject of ancient ships and navigation we shall now turn our attention to the more recent doings of man on the ocean and before entering into the details of ships and shipbuilding devote a little time and space to the consideration of boats  there are great varieties of boatsas regards shape size material and useso that it is not easy to decide on which we shall first fix our attention  there are large and small long and short boats flat round sharp and bluff onessome clumsy others elegant  certain boats are built for carrying cargo others for purposes of war  some are meant for sailing some for rowing and while many kinds are devoted to business others are intended solely for pleasure  before we refer to any of these perhaps our young readers will not object to be told how to construct  a model boat  we need scarcely say that it is not expedient for a boy to attempt to build a model boat in the same manner as a regular boatbuilder constructs one for actual service  it would be undertaking an unnecessary amount of labour to lay a keel and form ribs and nail on planks in the orthodox fashion because for all practical purposes a boat cut out of a solid block of wood is quite as useful and much more easily made  the first thing you have to do my young boatbuilder then is to go and visit a harbour or beach where varieties of boats are to be found and having settled in your mind which of them you intend to copy make a careful drawing in outline of its form in four different positions first a side view as in figure 1  then the stern with the swelling sides of the boat visible as in figure 2  the bow as in figure 3 and a birdseye view as in figure 4  the last drawing can be made by mounting on some neighbouring eminence such as a bank or a larger boat or if that is impossible by getting upon the stern of the boat itself and thus looking down on it  these four drawings will be of great service in enabling you to shape your model correctly for as you proceed with the carving you can by holding the model up in the same position with any of the drawings ascertain whether you are progressing properly and if you get the correct form of your boat in these four positions you will be almost certain to make a good boat  if on the other hand you go to work without drawings the probability is that your boat will be lopsided which will prevent it from floating evenly or crooked which will tend to check its speed in sailing besides being clumsy and not shipshape as the sailors have it  figure 1 will keep you right in regard to relative length and depth figure 2 in regard to shape of stern and bulge of the sides figure 3 secures correct form of the bow and figure 4 enables you to proportion the breadth to the length  the next thing to be done is to procure a block of firwood with as few knots in it as possible and straight in the grain  the size is a matter of choiceany size from a foot to eighteen inches will do very well for a model boat  before beginning to carve this it should be planed quite smooth and even on all sides and the ends cut perfectly square to permit of the requisite pencildrawings being made on it  the tools required are a small tenonsaw a chisel two or three gouges of different sizes a spokeshave and a file with one side flat and the other round  a rough raspfile and a pair of compasses will also be found useful  all of these ought to be exceedingly sharp  the gouges and the spokeshave will be found the most useful of these implements  begin by drawing a straight line with pencil down the exact centre of what will be the deck continue it down the part that will be the stern then carry it along the bottom of the block where the keel will be and up the front part or bow  if this line has been correctly drawn the end of it will exactly meet the place where you began to draw it  on the correctness of this line much will depend therefore it is necessary to be careful and precise in finding out the centre of each surface of the block with the compasses  next draw a line on each side of this centre line as in the accompanying diagram which will give the thickness of the keel and sternpost  then on the upper surface of the block draw the form of the boat to correspond with the birdseye view figure 4 on page 82 already referred to  then draw onehalf of the stern on a piece of thin cardboard and when satisfied that it is correct cut it out with scissors apply it to the model first on one side and then on the other side of the sternpost  by thus using a pattern of only onehalf of the stern exact uniformity of the two sides is secured  treat the bow in the same way  of course the pattern of the bow will at first be drawn on the flat surface of the block and it will represent not the actual bow but the thickest part of the hull as seen in the position of figure 3 on page 82  after this turn the side of the block and draw the form represented in figure 1 page 82 thereon and mark on the keel the point where the stem and keel join and also where the stern and keel join  this is necessary because in carving the sides of the boat these lines will be among the first to be cut away  the next proceeding is to cut away at the sides and bottom of the block until looking at it in the proper positions the bow resembles figure 3 and the stern figure 2 above referred to  this will be done chiefly with the gouge the chisel and spokeshave being reserved for finishing  then saw off the parts of the bow and stern that will give the requisite slope to these parts being guided by the marks made on the keel  in cutting away the upper parts of the bow and stern be guided by the curved lines on the deck and in forming the lower parts of the same portions keep your eye on your drawing which is represented by figure 1  it is advisable to finish one side of the boat first so that by measurement and comparison the other side may be made exactly similar those who wish to be very particular on this point may secure almost exact uniformity of the two sides by cutting out several moulds three will be sufficient in cardboard  these moulds must be cut so as to fit three marked points on the finished side as represented by three dotted lines on figure 1 and then the unfinished side must be cut so as to fit the moulds at the corresponding points  if the two sides are quite equal at these three points it is almost impossible to go far wrong in cutting away the wood between themthe eye will be a sufficient guide for the rest  the accompanying diagram shows the three moulds referred to one of them being nearly applied to the finished part of the hull to which it belongs  thusa represents the unfinished side of the boat b the finished side c is the mould or card cut to correspond with the widest part of the finished side near the centre of the boat d is the mould for the part near the bow e for that near the stern  these drawings are roughly given to indicate the plan on which you should proceed  the exact forms will depend on your own taste or fancy as formed by the variouslyshaped boats you have studied  and it may be remarked here that all we have said in regard to the cutting out of model boats applies equally to model ships  the outside of your boat having been finished the bow having been fashioned somewhat like that represented in the accompanying cut and the stern having been shaped like that shown in the illustration given below the next thing to be done is to hollow out the hull  care must be taken in doing this not to cut away too much wood from one part or to leave too much at another a little more than half an inch of thickness may be left everywhere  next fix in the thwarts or seats as in the foregoing cut attach a leaden keel and the boat is completed  the keel may be formed by running melted lead into a groove cut in a piece of wood or better still into a groove made in nearly dry clay by driving four or five nails well greased into the groove before pouring in the melted lead holes may be formed in the keel by simply withdrawing the nails after it is cold  a mast and sail however are still wanted  the best kind of sail is the lug which is an elongated square sailshown in the accompanying illustration  most of our fishingboats are provided with lugsails and on this account are styled luggers  these boats are of all sizes some of them being fifty tons burden and carrying crews of seven or ten men each  a picture of a lugger is given on the next page  great numbers of fishingboats may be seen at great yarmouth and all along the coasts of norfolk and suffolk  they are employed in the herringfishery and use nets which are let down in deep water corks floating the upper edges of the nets and the lower edges being sunk by leads so that they remain in the water perpendicularly like walls and intercept the shoals of herring when they chance to pass  thousands of these glittering silvery fish get entangled in the meshes during night then the nets are drawn up and the fish taken out and thrown into a well whence they are removed as quickly as possible and salted and packed in lockers while the nets are let down again into the sea these boats remain out usually a week at a time  most of them return to port on saturday in order to spend sunday as a day of rest  some howeverregardless of the fact that he who gives them the fish with such liberal hand also gave them the command remember the sabbath daycontinue to prosecute the fishing on that day  but many a good man among the fishermen has borne testimony to the fact that these do not gain additional wealth by their act of disobedience while they lose in the matter of nets which suffer from want of frequent drying and in the matter of health which cannot be maintained so well without a weekly day of rest while there can be no doubt that they lose the inestimable blessing of a good conscience  so true is it that godliness is profitable for the life which now is as well as for that which is to come  a model boat should be rigged with only one mast and lugsail or with two masts and sails at the most  three are unnecessary and cumbrous each sail should be fixed to a yard which should be hoisted or hauled down by means of a block or pulley fastened near the top of the mast the positions of these yards and the form of the sails may be more easily understood by a glance at our woodcut than by reading many pages of description  spritsails are sometimes used in boats  these are foreandaft sails which are kept distended by a sprit instead of a yard  the sprit is a long pole one end of which is fixed to the lowest innermost corner near the mast and the other end extending to the highest outermost corner thus it lies diagonally across the sail  it is convenient when a boat tacks or goes aboutin other words when it goes round frequently and sails now leaning on one side and at the next tack on the other side  in this case the sprit requires little shifting or attention  but it is dangerous in squally weather because although the sheet or line which holds the lower and outer end of a sail may be let go for the sake of safety the upper part remains spread to the wind because of the sprit  the best rig of all for a model boat and indeed for a pleasureboat is that which comprises a mainsail in form like that of a sloop or a cutter omitting the boom or lower yard and a triangular foresail extending from near the mast to the bow of the boat or to the end of the bowspritsomewhat like a sloops jib  both of the sails referred to may be seen at the part of this book which treats of sloops and cutters and they are the same in form with but slight modification when applied to boats  racingboats are long low narrow and light  some are so narrow as to require iron rowlocks extending a considerable distance beyond the sides of the boat for the oars to rest in  many of these light craft may be seen on the thames and clyde and other rivers throughout the kingdom the larger sort do not require what we may call the outrigger rowlocks  the rob roy canoe has of late years come much into fashion as a racing and pleasure boat  whatever the advantages of this craft may be it has this disadvantage that it can hold only one person so that it may be styled an unsocial craft the company of one or more friends being impossible unless indeed one or more canoes travel in company  this species of canoe became celebrated some years ago in consequence of an interesting and adventurous voyage of a thousand miles through germany switzerland and france and subsequently through part of norway and sweden made by mr macgregor in a craft of this kind to which he gave the name of rob roy  since the craft became popular numerous and important improvements have been made in the construction of its hull and several parts but its distinctive features remain unaltered  the rob roy canoe is in fact almost identical with the eskimo kayak except in regard to the material of which it is madethe former being composed wholly of wood the latter of a framework of wood covered with skin  there is the same long low fishlike form the same deck almost on a level with the water the same hole in the centre for the admission of the man the same apron to keep out water and the same long doublebladed paddle which is dipped on each side alternately  the rob roy has however the addition of a small mast a lugsail and a jib  it has also a backboard to support the back of the canoeman the paddle too is somewhat shorter than that of the eskimo canoe and the whole affair is smarter and more in accordance with the tastes and habits of the civilised men who use it  in his various voyages which we might almost style journeys the originator of the rob roy canoe proved conclusively that there were few earthly objects which could form a barrier to his progress  when his canoe could not carry him he carried it  waterfalls could not stop him because he landed below them and carried his canoe and small amount of baggage to the smooth water above the falls  in this he followed the example of the furtraders and indians of north america who travel over any number of miles of wilderness in this manner shallows could not stop him because his little bark drew only a few inches of water  turbulent water could not swamp him because the waves washed harmlessly over his smooth deck and circled innocently round his protective apron  even long stretches of dry land could not stop him because barrows or carts or railways could transport his canoe hither and thither with perfect ease to any distance so that when the waters of one river failed him those of the next nearest were easily made available  in conclusion it may be said that the rob roy canoe is a most useful and pleasant craft for boys and young men especially at those wateringplaces which have no harbour or pier and where in consequence of the flatness of the beach boats cannot easily be used  it would be an almost endless as well as unprofitable task to go over the names and characteristics of all our various kinds of boats in detail  of heavysterned and clumsy river craft we have an innumerable fleet  there are also torbay trawlers which are cutters of from twenty to fifty tons and the herringboats of scotland and cobbles which are broad bluff little boats and barges which are broad bluff large ones and skiffs and scows and many others  in foreign lands many curious boats are to be met with  the most graceful of them perhaps are those which carry lateen sailsenormous triangular sails of which kind each boat usually carries only one  indiarubber boats there are which can be inflated with a pair of bellows and when full can support halfadozen men or more while when empty they can be rolled up and carried on the back of one man or in a barrow  one boat of this kind we once saw and paddled in  it was made in the form of a cloak and could be carried quite easily on ones shoulders  when inflated it formed a sort of oval canoe which was quite capable of supporting one person  we speak from experience having tried it some years ago on the serpentine and found it to be extremely buoyant but a little given to spin round at each stroke of the paddle owing to its circular shape and want of cutwater or keel    of all the boats that swim the lifeboat is certainly one of the most interesting perhaps it is not too much to add that it is also one of the most useful  but this boat deserves a chapter to itself    chapter seven  lifeboats and lightships  when our noble lifeboat institution was in its infancy a deed was performed by a young woman which at once illustrates the extreme danger to which those who attempt to rescue the shipwrecked must expose themselves and the great need there was thirty years ago for some better provision than existed at that time for the defence of our extensive seaboard against the dire consequences of storm and wreck it is not we think inappropriate to begin our chapter on lifeboats with a brief account of the heroic deed of  grace darling  there are not many women who like joan of arc put forth their hands to the work peculiarly belonging to the male sex and achieve for themselves undying fame  and among these there are very few indeed who in thus quitting their natural sphere and assuming masculine duties retain their feminine modesty and gentleness  such a one however was grace darling  she did not indeed altogether quit her station and follow a course peculiar to the male sex but she did once seize the oar and launch fearlessly upon the raging sea and perform a deed which strong and daring men might have been proud of which drew forth the wondering admiration of her country and has rendered her name indissolubly connected with the annals of heroic daring in the saving of human life from vessels wrecked upon our rockbound shores  grace darling was born in november 1815 at bamborough on the northumberland coast  her father was keeper of the lighthouse on the longstone one of the farne islands lying off that coast and here on a mere bit of rock surrounded by the ocean and often by the howling tempests and the foaming breakers of that dangerous spot our heroine spent the greater part of her life cut off almost totally from the joys and pursuits of the busy world  she and her mother managed the domestic economy of the lighthouse on the little islet while her father trimmed the lantern that sent a blaze of friendly light to warn mariners off that dangerous coast  in personal appearance grace darling is described as having been fair and comely with a gentle modest expression of countenance about the middle size and with nothing in the least degree masculine about her she had reached her twentysecond year when the wreck took place in connection with which her name has become famous  the farne islands are peculiarly dangerous  the sea rushes with tremendous force between the smaller islands and despite the warning light wrecks occasionally take place among them  in days of old when men had neither heart nor head to erect lighthouses for the protection of their fellows many a noble ship must have been dashed to pieces there and many an awful shriek must have mingled with the hoarse roar of the surf round these rent and weatherworn rocks  a gentleman who visited the longstone rock in 1838 describes it thus  it was like the rest of these desolate isles all of dark whinstone cracked in every direction and worn with the action of winds waves and tempests since the world began  over the greater part of it was not a blade of grass nor a grain of earth it was bare and ironlike stone crusted round all the coast as far as highwater mark with limpet and still smaller shells  we ascended wrinkled hills of black stone and descended into worn and dismal dells of the same into some of which where the tide got entrance it came pouring and roaring in raging whiteness and churning the loose fragments of whinstone into round pebbles and piling them up in deep crevices with seaweeds like great round ropes and heaps of fucus  over our heads screamed hundreds of hovering birds the gull mingling its hideous laughter most wildly  one wild and stormy night in september 1838such a night as induces those on land to draw closer round the fire and offer up perchance a silent prayer for those who are at seaa steamer was battling at disadvantage with the billows off saint abbs head  she was the forfarshire a steamer of three hundred tons under command of mr john humble and had started from hull for dundee with a valuable cargo a crew of twentyone men and fortyone passengers  it was a fearful night  the storm raged furiously and would have tried the qualities of even a stout vessel but this one was in very bad repair and her boilers were in such a state that the engines soon became entirely useless and at last they ceased to work  we cannot conceive the danger of a steamer left thus comparatively helpless in a furious storm and dark night off a dangerous coast  in a short time the vessel became quite unmanageable and drifted with the direction of the tide no one knew whither  soon the terrible cry arose breakers to leeward and immediately after the farne lights became visible  a despairing attempt was now made by the captain to run the ship between the islands and the mainland but in this he failed and about three oclock she struck heavily on a rock bow foremost  the scene of consternation that followed is indescribable  immediately one of the boats was lowered and with a freight of terrorstricken people pushed off but not before one or two persons had fallen into the sea and perished in their vain attempts to get into it  this party in the boat nine in number survived the storm of that awful night and were picked up the following morning by a montrose sloop  of those left in the illfated ship some remained in the afterpart a few stationed themselves near the bow thinking it the safest spot  the captain stood helpless his wife clinging to him while several other females gave vent to their agony of despair in fearful cries  meanwhile the waves dashed the vessel again and again on the rock and at last a larger billow than the rest lifted her up and let her fall down upon its sharp edge  the effect was tremendous and instantaneous the vessel was literally broken in two pieces and the afterpart with the greater number of the passengers in the cabin was swept away through the fifa gut a tremendous current which is considered dangerous even in good weather  among those who thus perished were the captain and his wife  the forepart of the steamer with the few who had happily taken refuge upon it remained fast on the rock  here eight or nine of the passengers and crew clung to the windlass and a woman named sarah dawson with her two little children lay huddled together in a corner of the forecabin exposed to the fury of winds and waves all the remainder of that dreadful night  for hours each returning wave carried a thrill of terror to their hearts for the shattered wreck reeled before every shock and it seemed as if it would certainly be swept away into the churning foam before daybreak  but daylight came at last and the survivors on the wreck began to sweep the dim horizon with straining eyeballs as a faint hope at last began to arise in their bosoms  nor were these trembling hopes doomed to disappointment  at the eleventh hour god in his mercy sent deliverance through the glimmering dawn and the driving spray the lighthousekeepers daughter from the lonely watchtower descried the wreck which was about a mile distant from the longstone  from the mainland too they were observed and crowds of people lined the shore and gazed upon the distant speck to which by the aid of telescopes the survivors were seen clinging with the tenacity of despair  but no boat could live in that raging sea which still lashed madly against the riven rocks although the violence of the storm had begun to abate  an offer of 5 pounds by the steward of bamborough castle failed to tempt a crew of men to launch their boat  one daring heart and willing hand was there however  grace darling fired with an intense desire to save the perishing ones urged her father to launch their little boat  at first he held back  there was no one at the lighthouse except himself his wife and his daughter  what could such a crew do in a little open boat in so wild a sea  he knew the extreme peril they should encounter better than his daughter and very naturally hesitated to run so great a risk  for besides the danger of swamping and the comparatively weak arm of an inexperienced woman at the oar the passage from the longstone to the wreck could only be accomplished with the ebbtide so that unless the exhausted survivors should prove to be able to lend their aid they could not pull back again to the lighthouse  but the earnest importunities of the heroic girl were not to be resisted  her father at last consented and the little boat pushed off with the man and the young woman for its crew  it may be imagined with what a thrill of joy and hope the people on the wreck beheld the boat dancing an the crested waves towards them and how great must have been the surprise that mingled with their other feelings on observing that one of the rowers was a woman  they gained the rock in safety but here their danger was increased tenfold and it was only by the exertion of great muscular power coupled with resolute courage that they prevented the boat being dashed to pieces against the rock  one by one the sufferers were got into the boat  sarah dawson was found lying in the forecabin with a spark of life still trembling in her bosom and she still clasped her two little ones in her arms but the spirits of both had fled to him who gave them  with great difficulty the boat was rowed back to the longstone and the rescued crew landed in safety  here owing to the violence of the sea they were detained for nearly three days along with a boats crew which had put off to their relief from north sunderland and it required some ingenuity to accommodate so large a party within the narrow limits of a lighthouse grace gave up her bed to poor mrs dawson most of the others rested as they best could upon the floor  the romantic circumstances of this rescue the isolated position of the girl her youth and modesty and the selfdevoting heroism displayed upon this occasion thrilled through the length and breadth of the country like an electric shock and the name of grace darling became for the time as well known as that of the greatest in the land while the lonely lighthouse on the longstone became a point of attraction to thousands of warm admirers among whom were many of the rich and the noble  letters and gifts flowed in upon grace darling continually  the public seemed unable to do enough to testify their regard  the duke of northumberland invited her over to alnwick castle and presented her with a gold watch  a public subscription to the amount of 700 pounds was raised for her  the humane society presented her with a handsome silver teapot and a vote of thanks for her courage and humanity portraits of her were sold in the printshops all over the land and the enthusiasm which at first was the natural impulse of admiration for one who had performed a noble and heroic deed at last rose to a species of mania in the heat of which not a few absurdities were perpetrated  among others several of the proprietors of the metropolitan theatres offered her a large sum nightly on condition that she would appear on the stage merely to sit in a boat during the performance of a piece illustrative of the incident of which she was the heroine  as might have been expected of one whose spirit was truly noble she promptly declined all such offers  god seems to have put his arm tenderly round grace darling and afforded her special strength to resist the severe temptations to which she was exposed  all proposals to better her condition were rejected and she returned to her home on the island rock where she remained with her father and mother till within a few months of her death  the fell destroyer alas claimed her while yet in the bloom of womanhood  she died of consumption on the 20th of october 1842 leaving an example of selfdevoting courage in the hour of danger and selfdenying heroism in the hour of temptation that may well be admired and imitated by those whose duty it is to man the lifeboat and launch to the rescue on the stormy waves in all time to come  lifeboats  a lifeboatthat is to say the lifeboat of the present timediffers from all other boats in four particulars  it is almost indestructible it is insubmergible it is selfrighting it is selfemptying  in other words it can hardly be destroyed it cannot be sunk it rights itself if upset it empties itself if filled  the first of these qualities is due to the unusual strength of the lifeboat not only in reference to the excellence of the materials with which it is made but also to the manner in which the planks are laid on  these cross one another in a diagonal manner which cannot be easily described or explained to ordinary readers but it is sufficient to say that the method has the effect of binding the entire boat together in a way that renders it much stronger than any other species of craft  the second qualitythat of insubmergibilityis due to airchambers fixed round the sides of the boat under the seats and at the bow and stern  these aircases are sufficiently buoyant to float the boat even if she were filled to overflowing with water and crowded to her utmost capacity with human beings  in short to use an expression which may appear paradoxical she can carry more than she can holdhas floating power sufficient to support more than can be got into her  the thirdher selfrighting qualityis also due to airchambers in connection with a heavy keel  there are two large and prominent aircases in the lifeboatone in the bow the other in the stern these rise considerably above the gunwale insomuch that when the boat is turned upsidedown it rests upon them as upon two pivots  of course it cannot remain stationary on them for a moment but must necessarily fall over to the one side or the other  this is the first motion in selfrighting then the heavy keel comes into play and pulls the boat quite round  being full of water the lifeboat would be comparatively useless but for its fourth qualitythat of selfemptying  this is accomplished by means of six large holes which run through the floor and bottom of the boat  the floor referred to is airtight and is so placed that when fully manned and loaded with passengers it is a very little above the level of the sea  on this fact the acting of the principle depends  between the floor and the bottom of the boata space of upwards of a foot in depththere is some light ballast of cork or of wood and some parts of the space are left empty  the six holes abovementioned are tubes of six inches in diameter which extend from the floor through the bottom of the boat  now it is one of natures laws that water must find its level  for instance take any boat and bore large holes in its bottom and suppose it to be supported in its ordinary floating position so that it cannot sink even though water runs freely into it through the holes  then fill it suddenly quite full of water  of course the water inside will be considerably above the level of the water outside but it will continue to run out at the holes until it is exactly on a level with the water outside  now water poured into a lifeboat acts exactly in the same way but when it has reached the level of the water outside it has also reached the floor so that there is no more water to run out  such are the principal qualities of the splendid lifeboat now used on our coasts and of which it may be said that it has reached a state of almost absolute perfection  the accompanying sections of the lifeboat exhibit the position of the aircases and discharging tubes  in figure 1 the shaded parts give a side view of the aircases  the line a a indicates the deck or floor which lies a little above the level of the water when the boat is loaded b b is the watertight space containing ballast c c c are three of the six discharging holes or tubes the dotted line d d shows the level of the sea  figure 2 gives a birdseye view of the boat  the shaded parts indicate the aircases and the position of the six discharging tubes is more clearly shown than in figure 1  there are three covered openings in the floor which permit of a free circulation of air when the boat is not in use and in one of these is a small pump to clear the ballastspace of leakage  it will be observed that the boat draws little water in fact there is much more of her above than below water and she is dependent for stability on her great breadth of beam and her heavy keel  these four qualities in the lifeboat are illustrated every year by many thrilling incidents of wreck and rescue  let us glance at a few of these  first then as to the almost indestructible quality  take the following evidence  on a terrible night in the year 1857 a portuguese brig struck on the goodwin sands not far from the lightship that marks the northern extremity of those fatal shoals  a shot was fired and a rocket sent up from the lightship as a signal to the men on shore that a vessel had got upon the sands  no second signal was needed  anxious eyes had been on the watch that night  instantly the ramsgate men jumped into their lifeboat which lay alongside the pier  it was deadly work that had to be donethe gale was one of the fiercest of the seasonnevertheless the gallant men were so eager to get into the boat that it was overmanned and the last two who jumped in were obliged to go ashore  a small but powerful steamer is kept to attend upon this boat  in a few minutes it took her in tow and made for the mouth of the harbour  they staggered out right in the teeth of tide and tempest and ploughed their way through a heavy crosssea that swept again and again over them until they reached the edge of the goodwins  here the steamer cast off the boat and waited for her while she dashed into the surf and bore the brunt of the battle alone  with difficulty the brig was found in the darkness  the lifeboat cast anchor when within about forty fathoms and veered down under her lee at first they were in hopes of getting the vessel off and hours were spent in vain endeavours to do this  but the storm increased in fury the brig began to break up she rolled from side to side and the yards swung wildly in the air  a blow from one of these yards would have stove the boat in so the portuguese crewtwelve men and a boywere taken from the wreck and the boatmen endeavoured to push off  all this time the boat had been floating in a basin worked in the sand by the motion of the wreck but the tide had been falling and when they tried to pull up to their anchor the boat struck heavily on the edge of this basin  the men worked to get off the shoals as only those can work whose lives depend on their efforts  they succeeded in getting afloat for a moment but again struck and remained fast  meanwhile the brig was lifted by each wave and let fall with a thundering crash her timbers began to snap like pipestems and as she worked nearer and nearer it became evident that destruction was not far off  the heavy seas caused by the increasing storm flew over the lifeboat so that those in her could only hold on to the thwarts for their lives  at last the brig came so near that there was a stir among the men they were preparing for the last strugglesome of them intending to leap into the rigging of the wreck and take their chance but the coxswain shouted stick to the boat boys stick to the boat and the men obeyed  at that moment the boat lifted a little on the surf and grounded again new hope was infused by this  the men pulled at the hawser and shoved might and main with the oars they succeeded in getting out of immediate danger but still could not pull up to the anchor in teeth of wind and tide  the coxswain then saw plainly that there was but one resource leftto cut the cable and drive right across the goodwin sands  but there was not yet sufficient water on the sands to float them over so they held on intending to ride at anchor until the tide which had turned should rise  very soon however the anchor began to drag  this compelled them to hoist sail cut the cable sooner than they had intended and attempt to beat off the sands  it was in vain  a moment more and they struck with tremendous force  a breaker came rolling towards them filled the boat caught her up like a plaything on its crest and hurling her a few yards onwards let her fall again with a shock that wellnigh tore every man out of her  each successive breaker treated her in this way  those who dwell by the seashore know well the familiar ripples that mark the sands when the tide is out  on the goodwins these ripples are gigantic steps to be measured by feet not by inches  from one to another of these banks this splendid boat was thrown  each roaring surf caught it by the bow or stern and whirling it right round sent it crashing on the next ledge  the portuguese sailors appeared to give up all hope and clung to the thwarts in silent despair but the crew eighteen in numberdid not lose heart altogether  they knew their boat well had often gone out to battle in her and hoped that they might yet be saved if she should only escape striking on the pieces of old wrecks with which the sands were strewn  thus literally yard by yard with a succession of shocks that would have knocked any ordinary boat to pieces did that lifeboat drive during two hours over two miles of the goodwin sands  at last they drove into deep water the sails were set and soon after through gods mercy they landed the rescued crew in safety in ramsgate harbour  what further evidence need we that the lifeboat is almost if not altogether indestructible  that the lifeboat is insubmergible has been proved to some extent by the foregoing incident  no better instance could be adduced to prove the buoyancy of the life boat than that of the tynemouth boat named the constance at the wreck of the stanley in the year 1864  in this case while the boat was nearing the wreck a billow broke over the bow of the stanley and falling into the constance absolutely overwhelmed her  referring to this the coxswain of the lifeboat says the sea fell over the bows of the stanley and buried the lifeboat  every oar was broken at the gunwale of the boat and the outer ends swept away the men made a grasp for the spare oars three were gonetwo only remained  now it is to be observed that the coxswain here speaks of the boat as being buried sunk by the waves and immediately as he says the men made a grasp for the spare oars  the sinking and leaping to the surface seem to have been the work almost of the same moment  and this is indeed the case for when the force that sinks a lifeboat is removed she rises that instant to the surface like a cork  in order to prove the value of the selfrighting quality and the superiority of those lifeboats which possess it over those which are destitute of it we will briefly cite three casesthe last of which will also prove the value of the selfemptying quality  on the 4th of january 1857 the point of ayr lifeboat when under sail in a gale upset at a distance from land  the accident was seen from the shore but no help could be rendered and the whole boats crew thirteen in numberwere drowned  now this was deemed a good lifeboat but it was not a selfrighting one and two of her crew were seen clinging to the keel for twenty minutes by which time they became exhausted and were washed off  take another case of a nonselfrighting boat  in february 1858 the southwold lifeboat a large sailingboat and esteemed one of the finest in the kingdom went out at the quarterly period of exercise in rough weather and was running before a heavy sea with all sail set when she suddenly ran on the top of a wave broached to and upset  the crew in this case were fortunately near the land had on their cork belts and were dragged ashore though with difficulty but three amateurs who were without belts perished  these two cases occurred in the daytime  the third case happened at nighton a very dark stormy night in october 1858  a wreck had been seen about three miles off dungeness and the lifeboat at that placea small selfrighting and selfemptying one belonging to the royal national lifeboat institutionput off with eight stout men of the coastguard for a crew  on reaching the wreck soon after midnight it was found that the crew had deserted her the lifeboat therefore returned towards the shore  on nearing it she got into a channel between two shoals where she was caught up and struck by three heavy seas in succession  the coxswain lost command of the rudder she was carried away before the sea broached to and upset throwing her crew out of her  immediately she righted herself cleared herself of water and the anchor having fallen out brought her up the crew meanwhile having on cork belts floated regained the boat clambered into it by means of the lifelines hung round her sides cut the cable and returned to shore in safety  so much for the nature and capabilities of our lifeboats  we cannot afford space to say more in regard to them than that they are the means under god of saving many hundreds of human lives every year on the coasts of the united kingdom besides a large amount of shipping and property which but for them would inevitably be lost  the noble institution which manages them was founded in 1824 and is supported entirely by voluntary contributions  along with the lifeboat we may appropriately describe here another species of vessel which if it does not directly rescue lives at all events prevents disaster by giving timely warning of danger  we refer to  lightships  these floating beacons are anchored in the immediate vicinity of the numerous sandbanks which lie off the mouths of some of the principal ports of the kingdom especially in england and on other parts of our shores  there are numerous floating lights around our coasts marking shoals on which lighthouses could not easily be erected  their importance to shipping is inconceivably great  the accompanying illustration shows a vessel passing the lightship at the nore  the impossibility of shipping getting safely into or out of the port of london without the guiding aid of lightships as well as of buoys and beacons may be made clear by a simple statement of the names of some of the obstructions which lie in the mouth of the thames  there are the knock shoals the east and west barrows the john the sunk the girdler and the long sands all lying like so many ground sharks waiting to arrest and swallow up passing vessels which unfortunately they too often accomplish despite the numerous precautions taken to rob them of their prey  most people know the appearance of buoys but we dare say few have seen a buoy or beacon resembling the one in our engraving which is a sort of cage fastened to a buoy with a bell inside that rings by the action of the waves  it must have been something of this sort that was used at the famous bell rock in days of yore  lightships are usually clumsylooking redpainted vessels having one strong mast amidships with a ball at the top about six feet in diameter made of light laths  this ball is a very conspicuous object and clearly indicates a lightship to the passing vessel during the day at night a huge lantern traverses on and is hoisted to nearly the top of the same mast  it is lighted by a number of argand lamps with powerful reflectors  some lightships have two masts and some three with a ball and a lantern on each  some of these lanterns contain fixed others revolving lightsthese differences being for the purpose of indicating to seamen the particular light which they happen to be passing  thus the goodwin sands which are upwards of ten miles in length are marked by three lightships  the one on the north has three masts and three fixed lights  the one on the south has two masts and two fixed lights  the one that lies between the twooff ramsgate and named the gullhas one mast and one revolving light  the crew of a lightship consists of about nine or ten men each of whom does duty for two months on board and one month on shore taking their turn by rotation so that the number of men always on board is about seven  while on shore they attend to the buoys anchors chaincables and other stores of the trinity house which has charge of all the lights buoys and beacons in england  they also assist in laying down new buoys and sinkers and removing old ones etcetera  lightships run considerable risk for besides being exposed at all times to all the storms that rage on our shores they are sometimes run into by ships in foggy weather  the gull lightship above referred to occupies a peculiar and interesting position  being in the very centre of all the shipping which passes through the downs she has frequent narrow escapes and has several times been damaged by collisions  the marvel is that considering her position she does not oftener come to grief  she also signals for the ramsgate lifeboat by means of guns and rockets when a ship is observed by her crew to have got upon the dreaded goodwin sands  we had the pleasure of spending a week on board of the gull lightship not long ago and one night witnessed a very stirring scene of calling out the lifeboat  we shall conclude this subject by quoting the following letter which we wrote at the time giving a detailed account of it                                                 ramsgate march 26 1870 the eyewitness of a battle from an unusual point of view may without presumption believe that he has something interesting to tell  i therefore send you an account of what i saw in the gull lightship off the goodwin sands on the night of thursday last when the germania of bremen was wrecked on the southsandhead  having been an inhabitant of the gull lightship for a week and cut off from communication with the shore for several days i have been unable to write sooner  our neverending warfare with the storm is well known  here is one specimen of the manner in which it is carried on  a little before midnight on thursday last the 24th while i was rolling uneasily in my bunk contending with sleep and seasickness and moralising on the madness of those who choose the sea for a profession i was rousedand sickness instantly curedby the watch on deck suddenly shouting down the hatchway to the mate southsandhead light is firing sir and sending up rockets  the mate sprang from his bunk and was on the cabin floor before the sentence was well finished  i followed suit and pulled on coat nether garments and shoes as if my life depended on my own speed  there was unusual need for clothing for the night was bitterly cold  a coat of ice had formed even on the saltwater spray which had blown into the boats  on gaining the deck we found the two men on duty actively at work the one loading the lee gun the other adjusting a rocket to its stick  a few hurried questions from the mate elicited all that it was needful to know  the flash of a gun from the southsandhead lightship about six miles distant had been seen followed by a rocket indicating that a vessel had got upon the fatal goodwins  while the men spoke i saw the bright flash of another gun but heard no report owing to the gale carrying the sound to leeward  a rocket followed and at the same moment we observed the light of the vessel in distress just on the southern tail of the sands  by this time our gun was charged and the rocket in position  look alive jack get the poker cried the mate as he primed the gun  jack dived down the companion hatch and in another moment returned with a redhot poker which the mate had thrust into the cabin fire at the first alarm  jack applied it in quick succession to the gun and the rocket  a blinding flash and deafening crash were followed by the whiz of the rocket as it sprang with a magnificent curve far away into the surrounding darkness  this was our answer to the southsandhead light which having fired three guns and three rockets to attract our attention now ceased firing  it was also our note of warning to the lookout on the pier of ramsgate harbour thats a beauty said our mate referring to the rocket get up another jack sponge her well out  jacobs well give em another shot in a few minutes  loud and clear were both our signals but four and a half miles of distance and a fresh gale neutralised their influence the lookout did not see them  in less than five minutes the gun and rocket were fired again  still no answering signal came from ramsgate load the weather gun said the mate  jacobs obeyed and i sought shelter under the lee of the weather bulwarks for the wind appeared to be composed of penknives and needles  our third gun thundered forth and shook the lightship from stem to stern but the rocket struck the rigging and made a low wavering flight  another was therefore sent up but it had scarcely cut its bright line across the sky when we observed the answering signala rocket from ramsgate pier  thats all right now sir our work is done said the mate as he went below and divesting himself of his outer garments quietly turned in while the watch having sponged out and recovered the gun resumed their active perambulation of the deck  i confess that i felt somewhat disappointed at this sudden termination of the noise and excitement  i was told that the ramsgate lifeboat could not well be out in less than an hour  it seemed to my excited spirit a terrible thing that human lives should be kept so long in jeopardy and of course i began to think is it not possible to prevent this delay  but excited spirits are not always the best judges of such matters although they have an irresistible tendency to judge  there was nothing for it however but patience so i turned in all standing as sailors have it with orders that i should be called when the lights of the tug should come in sight  it seemed but a few minutes after when the voice of the watch was again heard shouting hastily lifeboat close alongside sir didnt see it till this moment  she carries no lights  i bounced out and minus coat hat and shoes scrambled on deck just in time to see the broadstairs lifeboat rush past us before the gale  she was close under our stern and rendered spectrally visible by the light of our lantern  what are you firing for shouted the coxswain of the boat ship on the sands bearing south replied jack at the full pitch of his stentorian voice  the boat did not pause  it passed with a magnificent rush into darkness  the reply had been heard and the lifeboat shot straight as an arrow to the rescue  we often hear and read of such scenes but vision is necessary to enable one to realise the full import of all that goes on  a strange thrill ran through me as i saw the familiar blue and white boat leaping over the foaming billows often had i seen it in model and in quiescence in its boathouse ponderous and ungainly but now i saw it for the first time endued with life  so i fancy warriors might speak of our heavy cavalry as we see them in barracks and as they saw them at alma  again all was silent and unexciting on board of the gull  i went shivering below with exalted notions of the courage and endurance of lifeboat men  soon after the watch once more shouted tugs in sight sir and once again the mate and i went on deck  on this occasion the tug aid had made a mistake  some one on shore had reported that the guns and rockets had been seen flashing from the gull and northsandhead lightships whereas the report should have been from the gull and southsandhead vessels  the single word was allimportant  it involved an unnecessary run of about twelve miles and an hour and a halfs loss of time  but we mention this merely as a fact not as a complaint  accidents will happen  the ramsgate lifeboat service is admirably regulated and for once that an error of this kind can be pointed out we can point to dozensay hundredsof cases in which the steamer and lifeboat have gone straight as the crow flies to the rescue and have done good service on occasions when all other lifeboats would have failed so great is the value of steam in such matters  on this occasion however the tug appeared late on the scene and hailed us when the true state of the case was ascertained the course was directed aright and full steam let on  the ramsgate lifeboat bradford was in tow far astern  as she passed us the brief questions and answers were repeated for the benefit of the coxswain of the boat  i observed that every man in the boat lay flat on the thwarts except the coxswain no wonder  it is not an easy matter to sit up in a gale of wind with freezing spray and sometimes green seas sweeping over one  they were doubtless wide awake and listening but as far as vision went that boat was manned with ten oilskin coats and souwesters  a few seconds took them out of sight and thus as far as the gull lightship was concerned the drama ended  there was no possibility of our ascertaining more at least during that night for whatever might be the result of these efforts the floating lights had no chance of hearing of them until the next visit of their tender  i was therefore obliged to turn in once more at three am  next forenoon we saw the wreck bottom up high on the goodwin sands  on friday morning the alerttender to the lightships of this district under command of the trinity superintendent captain vaile came off to us and we learned the name of the vessel that she was a total wreck and that the crew seven men had taken to their boat and succeeded in reaching the southsandhead lightship whence they were almost immediately after taken by the deal lifeboat and safely landed at deal  it is to be carefully observed here that although in this case much energy was expended unnecessarily it does not follow that it is often so expended  oftentoo oftenall the force of lifeboat service on this coast is insufficient to meet the demands on it  the crews of the various boats in the vicinity of the goodwin sands are frequently called out more than once in a night and they are sometimes out all night visiting various wrecks in succession  in all this work the value of the steamtug is very conspicuous  for it can tow its boat again and again to windward and renew the effort to save life in cases where unaided lifeboats would be compelled to give in  embarking in the alert i sailed round the wreck at low water and observed that the deal luggers were swarming round her like flies the crews stripping her bottom of copper and saving her stores while apparently hundreds of men were busy upon her deck dismantling her shattered hull  this after all is but an insignificant episode of wreck on the goodwins  many wrecks there are every year much more worthy of record but this is sufficient to give a general idea of the manner in which our great war with the storm is conductedthe promptitude with which relief is rendered and the energy with which our brave seamen are ready to imperil their lives almost every night all round the coast and all the year round    chapter eight  docks and shipbuilding  having in the previous chapters treated of the subjects of ancient navigation and ships and given some account of the boats of the present time we now proceed to write about modern ships  in doing so let us turn our attention first to  the dockyard  if we were a maker of riddles we would ask our reader why is a ship like a human being and having added dye give it up would reply because it commences life in a cradle but not being a fabricator of riddles we dont ask our reader that question  we merely draw his attention to the fact that ships like men have not only an infancy but also have cradlesof which more hereafter  let us enter one of those naval nurseriesthe dockyardwhere ships may be seen commencing their career  what a scene it is  what sawing and thumping and filing and grinding and clinching and hammering without intermission from morn till noon and from noon till dewy eve what a babel of sounds and chaos of indescribable material  that little boy whom you observe standing under the shadow of yonder hullhis hands in his pockets of course his mouth open probably and his eyes gazing up fixedly at the workmen who cluster like bees on the ribs and timbers of yonder infant ship has stood there for more than an hour and he will stand there or thereabout for many hours to come for it happens to be a holiday with him and he dotes on harbours and dockyards  his whole being is wrapped up in them  and this is natural enough  most boys delight to gaze on incomprehensible and stupendous works  let usyou and i reader follow this urchins example keeping our mouths shut however save when we mean to speak and our eyes open  there are ships here of every shape and sizefrom the little coastingvessel to the great east indiaman which in its unfinished condition looks like the skeleton of some dire megatherium of the antediluvian world  some of these infant ships have an enormous shed over them to protect them from the weather others are destitute of such protection for ships like men it would seem are liable to vicissitudes of fortune  while the great ones of the dockyard world are comfortably housed the small ones are not unfrequently exposed to the fitful buffeting of the rude elements even from their birth  there are ships here too in every state of progression  there just beside you is a little one that was born yesterday  the keel has just been laid on the blocks and it will take many a long day of clinching and sawing and hammering ere that infant assumes the bristling appearance of an antediluvian skeleton  yonder is the hull of a ship almost completed  it is a gigantic infant and has the aspect of a very thriving child  it evidently has a robust constitution and a sturdy frame  perhaps we may revisit the dockyard tomorrow and see this vessel launched  besides these two there are ships with their ribs partially up and ships with their planking partially on and in a more distant part of the yard there are one or two old ships hauled up high and dry to have their bottoms repaired and their seams repitched after many a rough and bravelyfought battle with the ocean waves  now that we have gazed our fill at the general aspect of the dockyard let us descend a little more to particulars  we shall first tell of the  nature and use of docks  there are two kinds of docksdry and wet  a drydock is usually constructed with gates to admit or shut out the tide  when a ship arrives from a long voyage and needs repair to the lower part of her hull she must be got out of the water somehow or other  this object is frequently attained in regard to small vessels by simply running them gently on the flat sand or mud beach of a bay or harbour so that when the tide retires they shall be left dry  but it would be dangerous as well as inconvenient to do this with large ships therefore drydocks have been constructed for this purpose  they are so built that when the tide is full the drydocks are also full  when thus full of water the gates of a drydock are opened and the large ship is dragged slowly in after which the gates are shut  the tide then retires leaving it in this basin of water  the ship is then propped up on all sides with timbers in such a way that she stands upright upon an even keel and thus the pressure on her hull being equally distributed she is not damaged  then the water is let out by means of sluices in the gates or it is pumped out and the ship left dry  when the tide returns the gates and sluices are all shut and its entrance into the dock prevented until such time as the ship is repaired when water is let slowly in  as the vessel floats the props and supports fall away the gates of her hospital are opened and off she goes again in all the vigour of recruited health to wing her way over the billows of the great deep  a wetdock is somewhat similar to a drydock the chief difference being that ships while in it are kept floating in water  docks are not only used however for repairing and building ships they are also used for loading and unloading them and as ships are entering and departing from them almost constantly the busy bustling active scene they present is always agreeable  the principal docks in the united kingdom are as follows  docks on the thamesnamely east and west india docks london docks saint katherines docks commercial docks victoria docks  southampton docks  liverpool and bristol docks  hull docks  glasgow docks  dundee docks  leith docks  birkenhead docks  so much for docks in passing  let us now turn our attention to the process of  building a ship  as we think it highly improbable that any of our readers intend to become either shipcarpenters or shiparchitects we will not worry them with technical explanations  to give an easily understood and general idea of the manner of building a ship is all we shall attempt  the names of those parts only that are frequently or occasionally referred to in general literature shall be given  the term ship is employed in two significations  in familiar language it denotes any large or small vessel that navigates the ocean with sails  in nautical language it refers solely to a vessel having three masts each consisting of a lowermast a topmast and a topgallantmast  at present we use the term ship in the familiar sense  elaborate and complicated drawings having been prepared the shipbuilder begins his work  the keel is the first part of a ship that is laid  it is the beam which runs along the bottom of a boat or ship from one end to the other in large ships the keel consists of several pieces joined together its uses are to cause the ship to preserve a direct course in its passage through the water to check the leeway which every vessel has a tendency to make and to moderate the rolling motion  the keel is also the groundwork or foundation on which the whole superstructure is reared and is therefore immensely strong and solid  the best wood for keels is teak as it is not liable to split  having laid the keel firmly on a bed of wooden blocks in such a position that the ship when finished may slide into the water stern foremost the shipbuilder proceeds next to erect the stem and stern posts  the stempost rises from the front end of the keel not quite perpendicularly from it but sloping a little outwards  it is formed of one or more pieces of wood according to the size of the ship but no matter how many pieces may be used it is always a uniform single beam in appearance  to this the ends of the planks of the ship are afterwards fastened  its outer edge is called the cutwater and the part of the ship around it is named the bow  the sternpost rises from the opposite end of the keel and also slopes a little outwards  to it are fastened the ends of the planking and the framework of the stern part of the ship  to it also is attached that little but most important part of a vessel the rudder  the rudder or helm is a small piece of timber extending along the back of the sternpost and hung movably upon it by means of what may be called large iron hooksandeyes  by means of the rudder the mariner guides the ship in whatever direction he pleases  the contrast between the insignificant size of the rudder and its immense importance is very striking  its power over the ship is thus referred to in scripturebehold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small helm whithersoever the governor listeth  the rudder is moved from side to side by a huge handle or lever on deck called the tiller but as in large ships the rudder is difficult to move by so simple a contrivance several ropes or chains and pulleys are attached to it and connected with the drum of a wheel at which the steersman stands  in the largest ships two and in rough weather four men are often stationed at the wheel  the ribs of the ship next rise to view  these are curved wooden beams which rise on each side of the keel and are bolted firmly to it they serve the same purpose to a ship that bones do to the human framethey support and give strength to it as well as form  the planks follow the ribs  these are broad and vary in thickness from two to four inches  they form the outer skin of the ship and are fastened to the ribs keel stempost and sternpost by means of innumerable pins of wood or iron called treenails  the spaces between the planks are caulkedthat is stuffed with oakum which substance is simply the untwisted tow of old and tarry ropes  a figurehead of some ornamental kind having been placed on the top and front of the stempost just above the cutwater and a flat ornamental stern with windows in it to light the cabin the hull of our ship is complete  but the interior arrangements have yet to be described although of course they have been progressing at the same time with the rest  the beams of a ship are massive wooden timbers which extend across from side to side in a series of tiers  they serve the purpose of binding the sides together of preventing them from collapsing and of supporting the decks as well as of giving compactness and great strength to the whole structure  the decks are simply plank floors nailed to the beams and serve very much the same purposes as the floors of a house  they also help to strengthen the ship longitudinally  all ships have at least one complete deck most have two with a halfdeck at the stern called the quarterdeck and another at the bow called the forecastle  but the decks of large ships are still more numerous  those of a firstrate manofwar are as followswe begin with the lowest which is considerably under the surface of the sea  the orlopdeck the gundeck the middledeck the upperdeck the quarterdeck and the poopthe latter deck being the highest deck of all a very small one at the stern  thus a manofwar is a floating house with six storiesthe poop being the garret and the orlopdeck the cellars  the upper decks are lighted by skylights those farther down by portholes or gunholes and windows the lowest of all by candles or lamps daylight being for ever banished from those gloomy submarine regions  the bulwarks rise above the upperdeck all round the ship and serve the purposes of protecting the upperdeck from the waves and supporting the belayingpins to which the ropes are fastened  in ships of war the top of the bulwarks forms a sort of trough all round the ship in which the hammocks the swingingbeds of the men are stowed away every morning  this trough is termed the hammocknettings and the hammocks are placed there to be well aired  in action the bulwarks serve to protect the crew from musketry  the wheel which has been already referred to stands usually at the stern of the ship on the quarterdeck but it is sometimes placed on an elevated platform amidships so that the steersman may see more clearly where he is going  the binnacle stands directly in front of the wheel  it is a species of box firmly fixed to the deck in which is placed the compass  it is completely covered in having a glass window through which the man at the wheel can observe the course he is steering  the capstan stands on the maindeck sometimes near the centre of the vessel at other times near the bow or the stern  it is a massive block of timber moving on a pivot which is turned round by wooden levers called capstan bars or handspikes and is used for any purpose that requires great tractive powerthe drawing in of the cable for instance or warping the ship which means that a rope is fixed on shore or by an anchor to the bottom of the sea and the other end of it is coiled round the capstan so that when the capstan is forced round by the handspikes the rope coils on to it and the ship is slowly dragged forward  the windlass is simply a horizontal instead of a perpendicular capstan  its sole purpose is for heaving up the anchor and it is placed close to the bow of the ship  the galley or cookinghouse is usually near to the windlass in the front part of the vessel  here the cook reigns supreme but this nautical kitchen is wonderfully small  it is just big enough to hold the fireplace and coppers with a small shelf on which the cook always a man and often a negro performs the duties of his office  the various decks below are partitioned off by means of plank walls which are called bulkheads into a variety of berths and apartments and the greater part of the centre of the vessel in merchantmen is called the hold and is reserved for cargo  the hull of the ship being finished now gets a coat of tar all over it which preserves the wood from the action of the weather and helps to render the seams watertight  some vessels are sheathed from the keel to a short way above their waterline with thin sheets of copper to preserve them more effectually from tear and wear and especially to defend them against those barnacles and marine insects that would otherwise fasten to them  being now ready to be launched from her cradle into the seaher future homewe will proceed in our next chapter to describe the process of launching    chapter nine  the launch etcetera  ships begin life with a retrograde movement they imitate the crabs in other words they are launched stern foremost  whether great or small long or short whether clothed in patrician copper or smeared with plebeian tar they all start on their first voyage with their sternposts acting the part of cutwater and also without masts or sails  these necessary adjuncts and a host of others are added after they have been clasped to the bosom of their native sea  one notable exception there is to this rule the launch of the farfamed great eastern which monster of the deep was forced into her element sidewise of which a full account will be found in another part of this volume  the cradles on which ships are launched are wooden frameworks so constructed as to slide down an inclined plane called the ways bearing their burdens along with them into the water  when a ship is ready for launching the shores or supports that have kept her so long in position are knocked away one by one until the entire weight of the ship rests on the cradle  the ways are then well greased and it only remains to knock away one or two remaining checks to allow the vessel to seek her future home by means of her own weight  but before this last act is done a day must be fixed for the launch friends of the owners must be invited to go on board during this her first voyage a fair maiden must be asked to go through the ceremony of giving the ship her name and paragraphs must go the round of the newspapers  as the hour draws near crowds of human beings young and old male and female must hurry to the spot to witness the great event and hundreds of little boys must beg leave from school if they can in short a great stir must be made and a great day must dawn before the last shores are knocked away and the noble structure be permitted to rush down that inclined plane and for the first time cleave the waves  and now having shown how the launching of our ship is accomplished let us turn to consider the next step towards completion for there is yet much to be done ere she is able to brave the tempest  rigging a ship  although fittingin the lowermasts of a ship cannot well be deemed a part of the rigging we will nevertheless describe the operation here  as the lowermasts of a large ship are from five to six feet in circumference it is manifest that some powerful mechanical contrivance is required to raise them over the bulwarks and put them in an upright position into their appointed places  such contrivances in the form of enormous cranes are fixed in some of the larger docks but the most useful method is to have the masts put in by means of  the shear hulk  this is a strongly built hull of a ship moored in a part of a river or harbour that will afford depth of water to float vessels of any size alongside  it has one stout mast with two immense beams attached to it near the deck and sloping outwards over the bulwarks in such a way that their ends overhang the deck of the vessel into which masts are to be placed  these sloping beams are prevented from falling overboard altogether and their slope is regulated by blocks and tackles from the mast of the hulk  by means of this contrivance which is just a gigantic floating crane the ponderous lowermasts of large ships are raised and lowered into their places  when these are fixed the rigging of the ship commences  the method of putting it up cannot prove interesting to general readers not even to boys for when they take to rigging model ships they do not require the mechanical contrivances that are necessary in rigging large vessels but all readers of sea stories and nautical history will find it of the utmost advantage to their clear understanding of what they read to have a general idea of the names and uses of the principal parts of a ships rigging  we shall therefore devote a small space to the explanation of this subject  and first let us examine the masts  these vary in size form and number in different ships but in all they serve the same purposeto support the sails  lower masts of large vessels are never formed out of one tree  they are found to be stronger when built up of several pieces which are fastened together by strong iron hoops  masts sometimes consist of three distinct parts  the lowermast topmast and topgallantmast  in most large ships there are three masts each having three parts  the centre mast being the largest is the mainmast the front one which is next in size is the foremast and the one next the stern the smallest is called the mizzen  although we have spoken of lowermasts for the sake of clearness the name is never used  the name of the mast itself designates the lower part of it  to name the masts in order we have the foremast mainmast  mizzenmast  foretopmast  maintopmast mizzentopmast  foretopgallantmast  maintopgallantmast mizzentopgallantmast  the parts of the different masts are connected and secured by means of crosstrees and caps which are named after the mast and part of the mast to which they belong  thus we have the foretop the foretopmast crosstrees the maintop and maintopmast crosstrees etcetera  observe particularly that the foretop maintop and mizzentop are the platforms or crosstrees at the tops of the lowermasts and notas might well be supposed by landsmenthe extreme tops of these masts  the buttonlike objects on the summits of the masts are called the trucks which besides forming a sort of finish to them are fitted with small pulleys through which signalhalyards or cords for hoisting the flags are rove  in firstrate menofwar the tops are so large that a number of men can be stationed on them  besides their other purposes they are very frequently used as a place of punishment for the midshipmen or middies the boy officers who are often sent there to air themselves and profit if they can by calm reflection in exalted solitude  shrouds and stays are the thick ropes that keep the masts firmly in position  they form part of what is termed the standing gear of a shipin other words the ropes that are fixturesto distinguish them from the running gearthose movable ropes by means of which the sails boats flags etcetera are hoisted  nearly all the ropes of a ship are named after the mast or yard or sail with which they are connected  thus we have the main shrouds the maintopmast shrouds and the maintopgallant shrouds the main backstay the maintopgallant backstay and so onthose of the other masts being similarly named with the exception of the first word which of course indicates the particular mast referred to  the shrouds rise from the chains which are a series of blocks called dead eyes fixed to the sides of the ship  to these the shrouds are fixed and also to the masts near the tops they serve the purpose of preventing the masts from falling sideways  backstays prevent them from falling forward and forestays prevent them from falling backward or aft  besides this shrouds have little cross ropes called ratlines attached to them by means of which ropeladders the sailors ascend and descend the rigging to furl that is tie up or unfurl that is to untie or shake out the sails  our cut represents a sailorboy ascending the mizzentopmast shrouds he grasps the shrouds and stands on the ratlines  yards are the heavy wooden crosspoles or beams to which the sails are attached  reefpoints are the little ropes which may be observed hanging in successive rows on all sails by means of which parts of the sails are gathered in and tied round the yards thus reducing their size in stormy weather  hence such nautical expressions as taking in a reef or a double reef and close reefingwhich last implies that a sail is to be reduced to its smallest possible dimensions  the only further reduction possible would be folding it up altogether close to the yard which would be called furling it and which would render it altogether ineffective  in order to furl or reef sails the men have to ascend the masts and layout upon the yards  it is very dangerous work in stormy weather  many a poor fellow while reefing sails in a dark tempestuous night has been blown from the yard into the sea and never heard of more  all the yards of a ship except the three largest can be hoisted and lowered by means of halyards  the topgallant masts can also be lowered but the lowermasts of course are fixtures  the bowsprit of a ship is a mast which projects out horizontally or at an angle from the bow  it is sometimes in two or three pieces sometimes only in one  to it are attached the jibsail and the flyingjib besides a variety of ropes and stays which are connected with and support the foremast  the cat heads are two short beams which project from the bows on either side and support the ships anchors  miscellaneousthe openings in the decks are called hatches the staircases which descend to the cabins are called companions  the pulleys by which sails etcetera are hoisted are named blocks braces are the ropes by which sails are fixed tightly in any position hauling a rope taut means hauling it tight  the weather side of a ship means the side which happens to be presented to the wind the lee side that which is away from the wind and therefore sheltered  the starboard side means the right side the larboard signifies the left but as the two words resemble each other the word port is always used for larboard to prevent mistakes in shouting orders heaving the lead is the act of throwing a heavy leaden plummet with a line attached into the sea to ascertain its depth  it is thrown from the chains as far as possible ahead of the ship so that it may reach the bottom and be perpendicularly beneath the man who heaves it when the ship comes up to the spot where it entered the water  a peculiar and musical cry is given forth by the heaver of the lead each time he throws it  the forecastle is the habitat of the ordinary sailors and is usually in nautical parlance termed the fogesl  most of what we have just described applies more or less to every ship but this will be seen in future chapters  meanwhile we would seriously recommend all those who have found this chapter a dry one to turn back to the heading entitled rigging a ship and from that point read it all over again with earnest attention    chapter ten  coasting vessels  the coastingtrade of the british islands is replete with danger yet it is carried on with the utmost vigour and there are always plenty of hands as seamen are called when spoken of in connection with ships to man the vessels  the traffic in which they are engaged is the transporting of the goods peculiar to one part of our island to another part where they are in demand  in describing these vessels we shall begin with the smallest  sloops  like all other vessels sloops vary in size but none of them attain to great magnitude  as a class they are the smallest decked vessels we have  from 40 to 100 tons burden is a very common size  a sloop of 40 tons burden is what we ordinarily call a little ship and one of 100 tons is by no means a big one  the hull of such a vessel being intended exclusively to carry cargo very little space is allowed for the crew the cabins of the smallersized sloops are seldom high enough to permit of an ordinary man standing erect  they are usually capable of affording accommodation to two in the cabin and three or four in the forecastleand such accommodation is by no means ample  the class to which vessels belong is determined chiefly by the number of their masts and by the arrangement and the form of their sails  the distinctive peculiarity of the sloop is that it has but one mast and its rig is nautically speaking foreandaftthat is to say the sails are spread with their surfaces parallel to the sides of the vessel not stretched upon yards across the vessel  the term foreandaft is derived from the forward part and the after part of the ship  foreandaft sails then are such as are spread upon yards which point fore and aft not across the ship  we conceive this elaborate explanation to be necessary for some readers and therefore dont apologise for making it  a ship whose sails are spread across the hull is said to be squarerigged  sometimes however a sloop carries one and even two square sails  the masts yards and sails of a sloop are as followsas has been already said one of the distinctive peculiarities of a sloop is that it has only one mast  this mast is sometimes formed of one stick sometimes of two the second or topmast being fastened to the top of the lower mast by crosstrees and cap in such a way that it may be hoisted or lowered at pleasure  a sloop has usually four sailsa mainsail foresail gaff and jib  the mainsail is behind the lower mast  it reaches from within a few feet of the deck to the top of the lower mast and spreads out upon two yards towards the stern or after part of the ship over which it projects a few feet  the lower yard of the mainsail is called the boom and the upper the mainsail yard this is by far the largest sail in the sloop  above it is spread the gaff which is comparatively a small sail and is used when the wind is not very strong  the foresail is a triangular sheet which traverses on the forestay that is the strong rope which runs from the lower masthead to the bow or front part of the sloop  on the bowsprit is stretched the jib another triangular sail which reaches nearly to the top of the lower mast  the only sail that rises above the lower mast is the gaff  in stormy weather this sail is always taken down  if the wind increases to a gale the jib is lowered and lashed to the bowsprit  should the gale increase a reef is taken in the mainsail  one two three and sometimes four reefs are taken in according to the violence of the storm when the last reef is taken in the sloop is under closereefed mainsail  increased violence in the storm necessitates the taking in of the mainsail and lyingto under the foresail or a part of it  lyingto is putting the sloops head to the wind and placing the helm in such a position that it tends to turn the vessel in one direction while the gale acting on the foresail tends to force it in another and thus it remains stationary between the two opposing forces  many vessels thus lieto and ride out the severest storm sometimes however a dreadful hurricane arises and compels vessels to take in all sails and scud under bare polesthat is drive before the wind without any sails at all and it is at such seasons that man is forced to feel his utter helplessness and his absolute dependence on the almighty  of course there are slight variations in the rig of sloopssome have a squaresail and some have a flyingjib but these are not distinctive sails and they are seldom used in small craft  doubtless those of our readers who have dwelt on the seacoast must have observed that boats and vessels frequently sail in precisely opposite directions although acted upon by the same wind  this apparent paradox may be explained thus  suppose a vessel with the bow and stern sharp and precisely alike so that it might sail backwards or forwards with equal facility  suppose also that it has two masts exactly the same in all respectsone near the bow the other near the stern  suppose further a square sail stretched between the two masts quite flat and remember that this would be a foreandaft sailnamely one extending along the length not across the breadth of the vessel  well now were a breeze to blow straight against the side of such a vessel it would either blow it over flat on its side or urge it slowly sideways over the water after the fashion of a crab  now remove one of these mastssay the stern oneand erect it close to the leeside of the vessel that is away from the windwardside still keeping the sail extended  the immediate effect would be that the sail would no longer present itself flatly against the wind but diagonally  the wind therefore after dashing against it would slide violently off in the direction of the mast that had been removed that is towards the stern  in doing so it would of course give the vessel a shove in the opposite direction on the very same principle that a boy when he jumps violently off a chair not only sends his body in one direction but sends the chair in the opposite direction  so when the wind jumps off the sail towards the stern it sends the ship in the opposite directionnamely forward  reverse this bring back the mast you removed to its old place in the centre of the deck and shift the front mast near to the leebulwarks  the wind will now slide off the sail towards the bow and force our vessel in the opposite direction namely backward so that with the same side wind two ships may sail in exactly opposite directions  by means of the rudder and placing the sails in various positions so as to cause them to press against the masts in a particular manner vessels can be made to sail not only with a side wind but with a breeze blowing a good deal against themin nautical phraseology they can be made to sail close to the wind  in short they can sail in every direction except directly in the teeth of the wind  some ships sail closer to the wind than others their powers in this respect depending very much on the cut of their sails and the form of their hulls  the lighter is a small rough clumsy species of coastingvessel usually of the sloop rig  it is used for discharging cargoes of large vessels in harbours and off coasts where the depth of water is not great  lighters are usually picturesquelooking craft with dingy sails and they seldom carry topsails of any kind  being seldom decked they are more properly huge boats than little ships  but lighters are not classed according to their rigthey may be of any rig though that of the sloop is most commonly adopted  the cutter  this species of vessel is similar in nearly all respects to the sloop the only difference being that it is better and more elegantly built gentlemens pleasure yachts are frequently cutters but yachts may be of any form or rigthat is they may belong to any class of vessels without changing their name of yacht  cutteryachts are much more elegantly moulded and rigged than the sloops that we have just described  they are clipperbuiltthat is the hull is smoothly and sharply shaped the cutwater in particular is like a knife and the bow wedgelike  in short although similar in general outline a cutteryacht bears the same relation to a tradingsloop that a racer does to a carthorse  their sails also are larger in proportion and they are fastsailing vessels but on this very account they are not such good seaboats as their clumsy brethren whose bluff or rounded bows rise on the waves while the sharp vessels cut through them and often deluge the decks with spray  in our engraving we have several cutterrigged yachts sailing with a light side wind with mainsail gaff foresail and jib set  the schooner  this is the most elegant and for small craft the most manageable vessel that floats  its proportions are more agreeable to the eye than those of any other species of craft and its rig is in favour with owners of yachtsespecially with those whose yachts are large  the schooners distinctive peculiarities are that it carries two masts which usually rake aft or lean back a good deal and its rig is chiefly foreandaft like the sloop  of the two masts the after one is the mainmast  the other is termed the foremast  the sails of a schooner arethe mainsail and the gaff on the mainmast the foresail foretopsail and foretopgallantsail the two last being square sails on the foremast  in front of the foremast are the staysail the jib and the flyingjib these last are triangular sails  if a schooner were cut in two in the middle crosswise the front portion would be in all respects a sloop with a square topsail the stern part would also be a sloop minus the bowsprit and the triangular sails before the mast  schooners sometimes carry a large squaresail which is spread when the wind is dead aft  they are much used in the coastingtrade and one of their great advantages is that they can be worked with fewer hands than sloops of the same size  the brig  advancing step by step in our investigation of the peculiar rig and build of ships we come to the brig  this species of craft is usually but not necessarily larger than those that have been described it is generally built on a larger scale than the schooner and often approaches in magnitude to the fullsized threemasted ship  the distinctive features of the brig are that it has two masts both of which are squarerigged  it is a particularly serviceable species of craft and when of large size is much used in foreign trade  the advantage of the squarerig over the foreandaft rig is that the sails being smaller and more numerous are more easily managed and require fewer men or hands to work them  thus as we increase the size of our vessel the more necessity is there that it should be squarerigged  the huge mainsail of the sloop and schooner could not be applied to large vessels so that when men came to construct ships of several hundred tons burden they were compelled to increase the number of masts and sails and diminish the size of them hence probably brigs were devised after schooners  the mainmast of a brig is the aft one  the sails are named after the masts to which they are fastenednamely the mainsail above that the maintopsail above that the maintopgallantsail and sometimes a very small sail named the royal is spread above all  behind the mainsail there is a small foreandaft sail similar to the mainsail of a schooner which is called the boommainsail  on the foremast is a similar sail which is called the trysail  attached to the respective yards of squarerigged ships there are smaller poles or arms which can be pushed out at pleasure and the yard lengthened in order to receive an additional little sailor wing on each side  these wings are called studdingsails or stunsails and are used only when the wind is fair and light  they are named after the sails to which they are fastened thus there are the mainstunsails the maintopstunsails and the maintopgallantstunsails etcetera the foremast of a brig is smaller than the mainmast  it carries a foresail foretopsail foretopgallantsail and foreroyal between it and the bowsprit are the forestaysail jib and flyingjib  the three last sails are nearly similar in all vessels all the yards etcetera are hoisted and shifted and held in their position by a complicated arrangement of cordage which in the mass is called the runningrigging in contradistinction to the standingrigging which as we have said is fixed and keeps the masts etcetera immovably in position  yet every rope in what seems to a landsmans eye a bewildering mass of confusion has its distinctive name and specific purpose  brigs and schooners being light and handy craft are generally used by pirates and smugglers in the prosecution of their lawless pursuits and many a deed of bloodshed and horror has been done on board such craft by those miscreants  the brigantine  the rig of this vessel is a mixture of that of the sloop and brig  the brigantine is squarerigged on the foremast and slooprigged on its after or mizzen mast  of its two masts the front one is the larger and therefore is the mainmast  in short a brigantine is a mixed vessel being a brig forward and a sloop aft  such are our coastingvessels but it must be borne in mind that ships of their class are not confined to the coast  when built very large they are intended for the deep ocean trade and many schooners approach in size to fullrigged ships    chapter eleven  vessels of large size  we now come to speak of ships of large size which spread an imposing cloud of canvas to the breeze and set sail on voyages which sometimes involve the circumnavigation of the globe  the barque  this vessel is next in size larger than the brig  it does not follow however that its being larger constitutes it a barque  some brigs are larger than barques but generally the barque is the larger vessel the difference between a barque and a brig is that the former has three masts the two front ones being squarerigged and the mizzen being foreandaft rigged  the centre mast is the main one  the rigging of a barques two front masts is almost exactly similar to the rigging of a brig that of the mizzen is similar to a sloop  if you were to put a foreandaft rigged mizzenmast into the after part of a brig that would convert it into a barque  the term clipper simply denotes that peculiar sharpness of build and trimness of rig which insure the greatest amount of speed and does not specify any particular class  there are clipper sloops clipper yachts clipper ships etcetera  a clipper barque therefore is merely a fastsailing barque  the peculiar characteristics of the clipper build are knifelike sharpness of the cutwater and bow and exceeding correctness of cut in the sails so that these may be drawn as tight and flat as possible too much bulge in a sail is a disadvantage in the way of sailing indeed flatness is so important a desideratum that experimentalists have more than once applied sails made of thin planks of wood to their clippers but we do not know that this has turned out to be much of an improvement  the masts of all clippers except those of the sloop or cutter rig generally rake aft a good dealthat is they lean backwards a position which is supposed to tend to increase speed merchant vessels are seldom of the clipper build because the sharpness of this peculiar formation diminishes the available space for cargo very much  the ship  the largest class of vessel that floats upon the sea is the fullrigged ship the distinctive peculiarity of which is that its three masts are all squarerigged together with the addition of one or two foreandaft sails  as the fore and main masts of a ship are exactly similar to those of a barque which have been already described we shall content ourself with remarking that the mizzenmast is similar in nearly all respects to the other two except that it is smaller  the sails upon it arethe spanker a foreandaft sail projecting over the quarterdeck the mizzentopsail and mizzentopgallantsail both of which are square sails  above all these a ship sometimes puts up small squaresails called the royals and above these skysails    chapter twelve  wooden and iron walls  the birth of the british navy may be said to have taken place in the reign of king alfred  that great and good king whose wisdom and foresight were only equalled by his valour had a fleet of upwards of one hundred ships  with these he fought the danes to the death not always successfully not always even holding his own for the danes at this early period of their history were a hardy race of seawarriors not less skilful than courageous  but to king alfred with his beaked oared warships is undoubtedly due the merit of having laid the foundation of englands maritime ascendency  england under the normans does not seem to have greatly desired to excel in maritime enterprise but it was otherwise during the plantagenet period  henry the second possessed a most formidable fleet numbering some five hundred vessels of war  during the reign of his successor a novel artifice in naval warfare was resorted to by the english which merits notice  the english admiral caused a number of barrels of unslaked lime to be placed in his ships  having brought his fleet to windward of the enemythe frenchhe ordered water to be poured on the lime  this of course raised a great and dense smoke which being blown by the wind into the very faces of the french prevented the latter from seeing on what quarter they were being attacked  a panic arose and spread among the french vessels and the victory fell easily to the english  the navy of edward the third numbered eleven hundred ships when he undertook the invasion of france  but the great majority of these were not properly menofwarin fact there were only five fully equipped warships the rest were for the most part merchant vessels converted into fighting ships and transports for the time being  the navy of king philip of france though numerically weaker far surpassed that of the english king in point of equipment  of the four hundred ships of which it consisted no fewer than one hundred had been built purposely for war according to the best principles of naval architecture then known bows catapults javelins and weapons of a like description were the engines of offence used on both sides and with these much havoc was wrought at close quarters  the english were victorious notwithstanding the more scientific equipment of their foes  the french ships were boarded and the flower of king philips naval force must that day have perished  henry the seventh did much for the improvement of the english navy  it was during his reign that the great harry was built which was really the first large ship built directly for the royal navy  hitherto the vessels employed by england for national defence or offence had been supplied by certain maritime towns but the great harry was the property of the people  she was built in 1488 and had portholes for cannon in the lower deck being the first vessel thus constructed  the great harry was subsequently far surpassed by another of king henrys ships the grace de dieu which was no less than one thousand tons burden and carried seven hundred men and one hundred and twentytwo guns some writers mention only eighty guns the largest of which were but eighteenpounders  the grace de dieu was a fourmasted vessel and was built in 1515  an epoch in englands maritime history which was in some respects the most brilliant and momentous now falls to be mentioned a period when englands name became a synonym on the seas for everything that was most intrepid and successful in maritime enterprise an era of daring adventure and splendid achievement which at length established england as the first naval power among the nations of europe  not without long and fierce struggle however was this supremacy won the french spanish and dutch each and all in turn disputed englands claim to the sovereignty of the seas  it is unnecessary to repeat here the ofttold tale of the defeat of the spanish armada nor yet the almost as familiar story of our frequent naval encounters with the dutch in the days of admiral blake and the great dutch admiral van tromp long and desperate those conflicts were and nothing but indomitable courage and stubborn perseverance could have secured the victory for the english ships for in almost every instance our foes were numerically the stronger  in the thrice famous days of nelson it was still our wooden walls which carried the flag of england on from triumph to triumph  at the battle of trafalgar the victory and the french ship the redoubtable were brought up close alongside of each other and in this position poured volley after volley upon each others bulwarks until water had to be thrown over the ships sides to prevent them igniting  the victory was a grand ship in her time yet she was not more than two thousand tons burden and her guns were but one hundred and two in number  but at last the day arrived when it became manifest that the glory of our wooden walls had set  in the prime of his intellectual and physical strength the emperor louis napoleon was a man of active and subtle brain and it was to his ingenious invention that the first ironclad ship of war owed its birth  floating batteries protected with iron plates were first employed during the crimean war  it was becoming manifest that the great strides which were being made in the manufacture of cannon must necessitate an improved system of defensive armour for ships of war  no wooden vessel that could be constructed could be proof against the new guns that were now coming rapidly into use  the french as has been just indicated were the first in the field with the new style of warships  la gloire was built and was quickly followed by our own warrior  the frame of la gloire was constructed of wood but covered with an iron plating four and a half inches in thickness  the warrior was built on an iron frame and her armourplating is of the same thickness as that of la gloire the lining is of solid teak eighteen inches thick which is again backed by an inner coating of iron  the length of the warrior is three hundred and eighty feet but only about twothirds of this is ironplated  at this timethe early days of ironcladsthe heaviest shot that could be thrown by any gun was a sixtyeight pounder  guns of this calibre the warrior and her class were proof against  but the guns increased rapidly in size and power and the thickness of the armour with which the ships were protected had to be increased in proportion  the class of warvessels which succeeded the warrior were entirely cased with iron plates whose thickness has from time to time been increased since the first ironclad was built then a contestfor only such it can be calledhas been going on between the cannonmaker and the shipbuilder the one striving to construct a gun which shall pierce the thickest armour which the ship can carry the other adding inch upon inch to his armour plates to the end that they may be shotproof and this contest may be said to be going on at this hour  will there ever be the same romance about the warships of the present daywhat those of the future will be like we do not care to speculateand the old wooden walls whose prowess on the high seas founded englands maritime glory  will a dibdin ever arise to sing a devastation or a glatton  can a devastation or a glatton ever inspire poetic thoughts and images  one would say that the singer must be endowed in no ordinary degree with the sacred fire whom such a theme as a modern ironclad turretship should move to lyric utterance  it has been said that all the romance of the road died out with the old coaching days and certainly a locomotive engine with its long black train of practicallooking cars makes hardly so picturesque a feature in the landscape as one of the old stagecoaches with its redcoated driver hornblowing guard and team of mettled greys but a railway train is an embodiment of poetry compared with a turretship  but if it be true that poetry and romance must more and more cease to be associated with our navy we must just accept the fact for nothing is more certain than that whatever the warships of the future may be we can never again return to the days of the old wooden ships  several opposing difficulties have now to be met in the construction of ironclads  invulnerability as regards the enemys guns protection to the men on board speed and the quality of being easily managed at seaall these points have to be carefully considered and the difficulty is that one quality wars against another  a ship might be built which was proof against any guns that could be devised and then might be found utterly unmanageable and unsafe at sea  a balance of qualities has therefore to be struck and this perfect equipoise has by no means been as yet attained  every yearwe might say every month witnesses the birth of some new type of armourplated warship built in every case at an enormous cost  the new seamonster looks formidable enough in all conscience but the question that arises the instant she quits the dock is is she seaworthy  and with the fate of the captain and the vanguard in our memories the question may well arise  the story of modern warships has up to this been one of mingled success and failure  does not the epigram on our warshipsour submarine fleetowe its point and sting in a measure to its truth  of the various types of modern warvessels the most formidable yet devised are undoubtedly the steamrams and turretships  the steamram is armed with a strong steel beak with which it charges an enemy in much the same way as the wargalleys of ancient times charged a foe or as a swordfish attacks its adversary  the turretship carries one or more shotproof circular turrets in which one or more guns are worked by the crew the guns being capable of being turned and pointed in any direction  both turretships and steamrams are of course iron plated  vessels of this description were first employed by the americans in the great civil war  the careers of the merrimac and monitor may be said to have become a part of american national history  the merrimac was the first ironplated steamram  she was originally a wooden frigate was cut down coated with iron and furnished with a ram  in her famous encounter with the congress and the cumberland two wooden frigates of the federals she steamed alongside the former delivered a raking fire and then turning upon the cumberland attacked that vessel with her ram  of the cumberland she made quick work for having torn a gaping rent in her side she poured a damaging fire into the gap hanging on by the sharp iron beak with which steamrams are furnished  then withdrawing to a short distance she again charged her adversary and delivered a second terrible fire until the cumberland finally sank  the merrimac then turned her attention to the congress whose fate she sealed in about half an hour  the first shot caused fearful destruction killing every man at one of the guns blowing away the bulkheads strewing the deck with a carnage too horrible to dwell upon and finally setting the ship on fire  the congress at last struck her colours but during the night she blew up  this formidable vessel had subsequently to haul down her colours before the monitorin a figurative sense that is for she did not actually surrender but retreated after a contest of some hours  in this notable struggle the merrimac sustained much damage without succeeding in inflicting on her enemy anything like the same amount of injury in fact the monitor came out of the action scathless  the changes that are taking place in the construction of warships are so various and so rapid that we cannot attempt to do more here than take note of a few of the principal and even what are mentioned as novelties now before these pages appear may have ceased to be novelties  iron is now employed in almost every part of a warship the masts themselves being in many cases of ironhollow tubes through which the running rigging may be let down when there is danger of its being damaged by the enemys fire  the majority of modern ironclads are built in compartments with this advantage that if damage is sustained in one part of the vessel and the water rush in through the gap made by shot or any other cause the ship will still float until the water can be let out again  the american ironclad turretship monitor has given her name to a whole class of vessels built within recent years for the english navy but in many respects our vessels are superior to their american prototype  all these shipswhich are characterised by low freeboards and absence of masts and sailsfight their guns from turrets  they are sometimes known as coastdefence ships from the circumstance that they were constructed mainly for home service  of these english monitors fourthe cyclops gorgon hecate and hydraare built on identically similar principles  in appearance they may be best compared to a raft with a battery on top of it from which fortress or battery rise various funnels and a flagstaff  the deck is but three feet and a half above the level of the sea  while the ships are in port the deck is roofed in with an awning and railed round but both awning and railing are removed when the vessels put to sea  the battery or fortress is in the centre of the ship and fills up about onethird of her length and threefourths of her breadth  the surrounding deck is flush its surface being broken only by the skylights which are three in number  the skylights allow but a scant and dim light to penetrate to the officers and seamens quarters below but even this is wanting in time of action when a shotproof shield takes the place of the glass windows  the deck of the dass of warships we are describing is composed of twinlayers of iron plating half an inch each in thickness supported on iron beams and of two layers of solid teak lining four inches thick the sides of the ships are protected by iron plating of eightinch thickness amidships which is an inch more of iron than the armour possessed by the majority of our masted seagoing ironclads many of which are twice or thrice the size of the cyclops and her sisterships  it will thus be seen that these turretships are practically stronger in defensive equipment than any other class of ironclad cruisers  the battery of these vessels is surrounded by a breastwork six feet in height plated with nineinch armour  entrance is gained to the turrets themselves from inside this breastwork  in the centre of the turret there are two cylinders the one fitting over the other in a manner which keeps the whole steady even in rough weather  small steamengines placed inside the breastwork serve to turn the turrets which however can also be worked by manual labour should necessity demand it  the ports present a striking contrast to those in the old wooden ships by reason of their greatly diminished size  they just admit of the muzzle of the gun peeping through and no more being oval in shape and about three feet in diameter lengthways  there can be little doubt that these small ports are an advantage since they must afford greater protection to the gunners during action  when it is desired to alter the direction of the guns the change is not effected by moving them in the ports but by revolving the turret itself  should it ever happen in action that the free movement of the turret should become impeded from some cause then the only means of changing the direction of the guns would be to turn the whole ship  the turrets are armed with two twentyfive ton guns carrying four hundred pound shot  the deck being flush as has been mentioned the guns can be fired straight ahead and astern and command all sides less than one minute is needed to revolve the whole turret  this class of ships is believed to be able to keep up a constant steady fire whether in chase or in retreat  abaft the funnel in these ships there is an upright oval tube rising some seventeen feet above the level of the main deck plated with iron the upper plate is pierced with several small horizontal slits from which the tube has received the name of the conninghouse for through these openings the captain can con or note whatever is going on outside without himself being exposed to danger  this circular box just allows the captain to turn himself about in and here must he stand in time of action directing and governing the whole conduct of his ship by mechanical telegraphs  of the many curious and remarkable features in these ships one of the most remarkable is the extensive use made of machinery for every purpose  engines revolve the turrets raise the ashes from the enginerooms turn the capstans work the ruddersengines do everything  three monitors similar to those just described were built for the defence of several of our colonies  the colony of victoria we believe purchased their ironclad the cerberus from the home government at any rate the people maintain her at their own cost  before the cerberus could make the voyage out to melbourne her sides had to be built up with thin iron plating for nearly her whole length  in the same way the cyclops and her companionships might be made fit to face any sea or weather  it may occur to the reader to ask why not have seagoing masted vessels at once  to which it may be answered first that the masted ships must inevitably draw more water than those of which the cyclops and hecate are types  turretships like the monarch or broadsideships like the hercules and sultan draw about twentyfive feet of water the smaller ships only sixteen while at the same time they are more heavily armoured  thus the latter if close pressed by an enemys seagoing ironcladsthe only class from which they have much to fear could take shelter up a river out of their reach  in action near the land these monitors moreover could be handled with greater ease  secondly from their much smaller size the coastdefence ships are built at a much less costan important consideration in days when a firstclass ironclad costs about as much as a small fleet of bygone days  the vessels we have been describing are of rather more than two thousand tons burden as compared with the five thousand tons of the larger seagoing ships and speaking roughly the expense of construction is proportionate to the tonnage  the glatton turretship has several characteristics in which it differs from the above class of monitors  it has but a single turret and its guns throw six hundred pound shot carrying three miles and a half  her waterdraught is about six feet more than that of the cyclops and hecate and her armourplates three inches thicker though she carries fewer guns the glatton is a much more powerful vessel than the other monitors  note the above description of english monitors is adapted and abridged from an article in chamberss journal  we shall now briefly describe the devastation one of the largest and most powerful of all our ironclads  the devastation in her afterpart rises but four feet and a half above the water but to meet bad weather she is furnished with an armourplated halfraised forecastle so that forward she is nine feet out of the water  the freeboard amidships is still higher being at this point level with the platform on which the two turrets are placed  in the centre of the ship rises a circular iron erection on the top of which is the hurricanedeck  through this structure runs a passage in which are situated the entrances to the hatchways and to the hurricanedeck overhead  from the hurricanedeck rise the ships two funnels and here also are the captains fighting box already alluded to in describing the coastdefence ships the fireproof shield for protecting the steering gear and the boats  in a gale the hurricanedeck is the only safe place in ships of this kindthe only place where one would not get speedily washed overboard  as for the below part of the ship it is there almost impossible to breathe even when air has been pumped in from above which is the only means of ventilating this portion of the vessel  the devastation carries two guns in each of her turrets placed side by side each weighing thirtyfive tons  the turrets directly the guns have been fired can be wheeled rapidly round thus turning the exposed parts away from the enemy  ships such as the devastation the thunderer and the fury do not at first sight strike one as particularly well adapted for rough weather to put it in the mildest phrase  nevertheless the devastation has been fairly well tested in this way having encountered some pretty rough weather and it is affirmed behaved satisfactorily  the great danger about all ships of this class is that they may not rise to the seas but that the waves breaking over them may press them down and founder them  the thunderer has been known to have her forecastle which is somewhat lower than that of the devastation completely submerged and this too when no very high sea was running  these ships are designed not for home service and coast defence merely but for general action in midocean  to attempt to describe even a single specimen of each type of modern warships would to a certainty weary the reader for to any but an expert there would inevitably be a sense of repetition in the perusal of such a narrative  but in order to place before our readers something like an approximate idea at any rate of the present state of our navy we shall examine briefly one other firstclass ironclad the inflexible which may be regarded as a leading example of ironclad ships and at the time of writing as one of the highest achievements of modern naval architecture  the inflexible is the vast size of 11400 tons burden her horsepower being 8000  the length is 320 feet her armourplating from 16 to 24 inches thick with an inner lining of wood from 17 to 25 inches in thickness  she is divided into 135 compartments and her engines are placed at such a distance from each other that should one be disabled from any cause the other would still be in working order  the chief characteristic of the inflexible is the position of the turrets  the majority of ships of this description have their turrets in the middle line from which it results that only one half of their guns can be directed on an enemy whether ahead or astern  the inflexible has her turrets on each sidethe foreturret on the portside the afterturret on the starboard  she can thus use the whole of her guns against an enemy at the same time whether it be ahead or astern  it will be seen that the thickness of the armourplating with which the inflexible is protected is enormous and yet this thickness of iron has been pierced  the question then that immediately suggests itself is can a vessel be constructed to carry much heavier armourplating than this  a recent writer in the times declares not  so far as the exigencies of the navy are concerned he says the limit of weight seems to have already been reached for the simple reason that the buoyancy of our ironclads cannot with safety be further diminished by the burden of heavier armour and armaments  the following very graphic description of the interior of a turretship was written by an eyewitness of the scene described  it is an extract from a narrative supplied to the author of the sea its stirring story of adventure and peril from which we take it  the vessel described was the miantonoma an american ironclad turretship  you ascend again through a trapdoor and find yourself in a circular room some twelve feet in diameter padded from top to bottom like the interior of a carriage  by your side is a huge mass of iron  you are inside the turret  a glimmering lamp sheds its feeble light on the moving forms around you and from below comes the faint whispering of the men until the trap is shut and you are again in utter silence  prepare  the gunners mate stands on your toes and tells you to lean forward and thrust your tongue out of your mouth  you hear the creaking of machinery  it is a moment of intense suspense  gradually a glimmer of lightan incha flood  the shield passes from the opening the gun runs out  a flash a roara mad reeling of the senses and crimson clouds flitting before your eyesa horrible pain in your ears a sense of oppression on your chest and the knowledge that you are not on your feeta whispering of voices blending with the concert in your earsa darkness before your eyesand you feel yourself plump up against the padding whither you have been thrown by the violence of the concussion  before you have recovered sufficiently to note the effects i have endeavoured to describe the shield is again in its place and the gun ready for reloading  they tell you that the best part of the sound has escaped through the porthole otherwise there would be no standing it and our gunners mate whispers in your ears its all werry well but they busts out bleeding from the chest and ears after the fourth discharge and has to be taken below  you have had enough of it too and are glad that they dont ask you to witness another shot fired  it must be stated that since the miantonoma was built a new and improved principle of turretfiring has been introduced  electricity is now employed in discharging the guns and there is thus no necessity for anyone being in the turret which is of course a great advantage  at the close of the civil war america possessed a fine fleet of monitors of which scarcely any now remain  for the time they seemed all but impregnable to shot and shell but they were built by contract of unseasoned wood and in the course of ten or twelve years yielded to natural decay  but the brooklyn and the ohio both fine examples of naval architecture still survive to maintain in so far as two ships can americas maritime prestige  a chapter treating of ironclads would we think be incomplete without allusion made to the loss of the captain whose terrible fate in 1870 has caused a mournful interest to be attached to that vessel  the captain was 320 feet in length and 53 feet broad  her armourplating reached to five feet below the waterline  opposite the turrets her plating was eight inches in thickness and seven inches in other parts  the ship was furnished with two screws placed side by side  the screws were available for steering and thus the vessel could be governed without the rudder  the captain was fully rigged and could carry a large spread of canvas  the special characteristic of the ship was her revolving turrets  each turret was 27 feet in diameter on the outside and 22 feet 6 inches on the inside  the walls of the turrets were therefore 2 feet 3 inches thick and one half of this thickness was composed of iron  the turrets were revolved by separate engines but they could also be turned if occasion required by handlabour  two armstrong twentyfive ton guns throwing six hundred pound shot were placed in each turret  the ship was built after designs by captain colesthe architect also of the monarch  on her first seavoyage the captain showed apparently such excellent seagoing qualities that her architect and the contractors the messrs laird were quite satisfied as to her safety in midocean  in the autumn of 1870 she accompanied the fleet on a cruise and on the 6th of september shortly after midnight foundered off cape finisterre  the whole crew were lost with the exception of nineteen men and among those who perished was captain coles himself captain burgoyne the commander of the ship and a son of the then first lord of the admiraltymr childers  it is unnecessary to recall to the memory of the adult among my readers the deep feeling of pity and gloom spread by this awful disaster throughout great britain  the night on which the captain foundered was no doubt a somewhat rough one with squalls and a heavy sea on but it was not merely the force of the storm which overwhelmed the vessel  mr james may a surviving gunner of the illfated ship gave a sufficiently clear account of the foundering of the vessel  soon after midnight he was awakened from sleep by a noise and a feeling that the ship was uneasy  rising and taking with him a lamp he proceeded to the afterturret to see if the guns were all right  everything was secure enough there but he had hardly finished his examination when he felt the vessel heel steadily over a heavy sea struck her on the weatherport the water rushed into the turret and may presently found himself in the water  he swam to the pinnace which he perceived floating bottom upwards and there he was presently joined by captain burgoyne and several others of the crew  then he beheld the vessel turn over and go down stern first the whole catastrophe being over in a few minutes  the launch was drifting a few yards off and may called out to his comrades jump men it is our last chance  may with three others succeeded in reaching the boat in which fifteen of the remainder of the crew also found a refuge  it is uncertain whether poor captain burgoyne remained in the pinnace or failed to reach the launch  the nineteen survivors after a hard row of twelve hours without food or drink landed at cape finisterre where they were hospitably received and cared for by the people  a courtmartial was held in due course to investigate the cause of the disaster  into the details of the evidence it is impossible here to enter but it was sufficiently proved that there were grave faults in the captains constructionfaults which as is unfortunately too often the case were not discovered by such calculations as were made before the ship started on what may be said to have been her first as it was her last cruise  it had however been noticed by some that the vessel was about a foot and a half deeper in the water than she should have beenthat her freeboard in a word instead of being eight feet above the water as was designed was only six feet six inches and it needs but a very slight knowledge of marine matters to understand how this difference would materially prejudice the stability of such a vessel as the captain  if it has been the readers chance as it has been ours to visit anyone of our great naval arsenalsespecially portsmouth or plymouthhe cannot have failed of being struck with the gallant and splendid appearance presented by many of our ships of war but he must likewise have been affected with feelings the reverse of admiration by more than one type of modern ironclads  no one who admires a real ship be it of wood or of irona stately frigate in full sail before a favouring windcan at the same time admire a monitor  many persons in truth will refuse to regard a turretship as a ship at all  it overturns our every notion of what a ship should look like  a low black mastless raftlike cruellooking machine without the faintest pretension to form or comeliness a turretship is simply a fightingengine a floating batteryan ingenious and formidable instrument of death and destruction no doubt but nothing more  yet these are among the leading warships of the present and as far as can at present be seen of the immediate future and on these we must depend for the protection of our shores should they ever be threatened  and yet great as is the annual cost of our navy and great as is the amount of ingenuity spent in the construction of new and novel ships of wareach designed to be more impregnable and more formidable than its predecessorour navy is at this moment in somewhat of an unsettled and transitory state  changes in the construction of ironclads are every year taking place and considerable difference of opinion exists among our highest naval authorities upon important points in marine architecture  ships of war have now to contend with such formidable enemies in the shape of guns torpedoes and other engines of terribly destructive power that it is difficult to say at present which will eventually triumph  one of the old wooden ships placed beside a modern ironclad is as a childs toy battery compared with gibraltar and yet it can hardly be said that the nation has the same feeling of confidence and security in our present ships which it reposed in the vessels which nelson so often led to victory for it must be long ere the fate of the captain and the vanguard is entirely forgotten  of this however we may we think at least rest assured that however dubious we may be in regard to some of the novelties and presumed improvements that are being from time to time introduced in naval architecture england is well abreast of the age in maritime matters if her ships be not absolutely perfect and proof against every form of danger they are at least equal to those of any other nation  we need a strong a very strong navy and as a fact our naval resources are nearly equal to the combined naval strength of europe  a somewhat different condition of things will need to come about from that which at present exists among the nations of the world ere england can afford to decrease her naval armaments and until the great powers of the world agree to settle their disputes by some other means than by wager of battle and are resolved to war no more probably the best and only way for her is to keep herself as strongly and perfectly armed as possible  it is this that has probably helped at any rate to secure so long and uninterrupted peace for our shores and to try a different and opposite course would to say the least be a risk  it is upon her navy as all the world knows that england depends for defence and security  to be weak in our navy would be to be weak throughout all our armour  our navy is at present we would fain hope a peaceweapon in our handsa shield not a sword and while it is such the stronger and more flawless it is the better for us and perhaps for the world at large  this may strike the reader as a somewhat vainglorious spreadeagle way of putting the case but if he look at the matter fairly and impartially we think he will admit that there is some truth in our statement  before closing this chapter a word or two must be said descriptive of that fell foe to ships of war the torpedo though space demands that our reference should be brief  almost all modern ships of war are constructed with false bottoms designed especially to protect them against torpedoes  there are many different forms of torpedoes employed in a variety of ways  a torpedo may be described as a submarine exploding apparatus  it may contain from thirty to as much as five hundred pounds of gunpowder and the explosion is effected either by means of electricity or by a spring and a detonating substance when the engine comes in contact with a ship  some kinds of torpedoes rest on the bottom of the sea while others are anchored and float suspended in the water  if a vessel strikes against one of these terrible engines she is either at once blown to splinters or a rent is made in her bottom which causes her rapidly to sink  one type of torpedoes resembles somewhat a fish and is impelled rapidly through the water by a screw and other machinery  torpedoes are so constructed as to be able to rise and strike a vessel just at the right moment  when not filled with gunpowder or guncotton dynamite and other explosive substances are used instead for charging these submarine warengines  various methods have been devised to secure ships from torpedoes  nets are sometimes extended in front of the ship which catch the torpedoes before they can come in contact with the vessels bottom  this safeguard was adopted in many instances with success by the federal warships when entering confederate harbours  but a great deal may be done to secure a ship against these terrible engines of destruction by precaution simply as was proved in the crimean war when the russian torpedoes did little or no damage to our ships by reason of the unceasing watchfulness maintained on board  during the late war between russia and turkey one of the most daring exploits of the campaign was an attack by a russian squadron of torpedoboats on the turkish monitor hifse rahman  the flotilla comprised four ships the czarevich the xenia the czarevna and the djirid  the two first named began the attack the czarevna and the djirid holding themselves in reserve until their assistance should be wanted  the launches were equipped with strong iron awnings which shielded their crews from the enemys fire  each boat was armed with two torpedoes fastened to the end of long spars projected over the bulwarks and working on pivots  the torpedoes could be detached from the spars when occasion demanded while long chains were secured to the missiles by which they were attached to the enemys vessel as well as to the wire of a galvanic battery fastened round the waist of the commander of the launch  this battery was the means by which the torpedo was exploded  the flotilla left the roumanian side of the danube on the 25th of june 1877 at about midnight and in something less than an hour the hifse rahman loomed in sight a shadowy mass on the dark waters  the approach of the torpedoboats was almost noiseless and the croaking of the frogs was said to have further favoured the russians by drowning the sound of the engines so that those on board the monitor were not aware of their enemys propinquity until the launches were almost alongside  the sentry at once challenged when lieutenant doubarsoff the commander of the czarevich answered friends  but his speech betrayed him the alarm was spread and the hifse rahman opened a sharp fire upon the launches  but lieutenant doubarsoff succeeded in attaching his torpedochain to a rope hanging at the monitors bows and then rapidly backed his little vessel and fired the torpedo  a tremendous explosion a column of water shot up into the air and the launch was nearly swamped  a breach had however been made in the hifse rahmans bulwarks  the other monitors were now thoroughly alive to their danger and the russian launches had to sustain a deadly cannonade upon which lieutenant doubarsoff ordered lieutenant schestakoff to bring up his launch the xenia and apply a second torpedo which the latter was able to do attaching the missile amidships of the turkish vessel  the fate of the hifse rahman was now sealed and in a few minutes she sank  the russian launches succeeded in getting clear of their enemy again without losing a single man and thus ended the first torpedo expedition ever made against an enemys ironclads but which may as a writer describing the event says end in completely revolutionising our present system of monster iron walls  the grand cross of saint george was awarded to lieutenants doubarsoff and schestakoff for this intrepid and successful exploit  space is not left us to do more than revert for a moment to what is perhaps the deadliest weapon of offensive naval warfare yet devised rams  some experts maintain that nothing can match the power of the ram of a modern ironclad skilfully handled and a wellknown naval authority has declared that the use of the guns in a naval action should be merely preliminary to that of the ramin other words that all effort should be concentrated upon making an opportunity of using the ram  we close this chapter by recalling the readers attention to a feature in modern warships already alluded to and which indeed the whole course of our remarks upon this subject points tothe almost universal use of machinery in modern naval tactics  most assuredly in modern seawarfare it may be said in the laureates wordsused by him of course with a very different sensethat the individual dwindles so that the prediction which some of our readers may remember was once made by a first lord of the admiralty seems not unlikely one day to become sober factthat the time will come when we shall no longer require sailors because all that our warships will need will be stokers and artillerymen  whether this is a consummation to be desired we are not careful here to pronounce    chapter thirteen  origins of steamshipsoceansteamers etcetera  as we have been led in writing about ships of the navy to refer to steam we turn aside at this point to treat of that tremendous motivepower  one night in the year 1807 a terrible sight was witnessed by the inhabitants of the banks of the river hudson in america  men love what is marvellous and they will go a long distance out of their way to see that which is terrific and horrible but on the night in question there was no need to go far  the farmers had only to look out of their windows and the sailors of the shipping had only to lift their heads above the bulwarks to behold a sight that appalled the stoutest hearted and caused the very hair on the craniums of the timid to stand on end  the object that created so much consternation wasa monster of the deep  at some parts of the river men could not tell what it was like for the night was dark when it passed but a dark shadowy idea they obtained by the light of the fire which the creature vomited from its jaws and they formed a tremendous conception of its size and power from the speed at which it travelled the splashing which it made and the hideous groans with which it burdened the nightair  this fiery monster of the deep was the first riversteamer the clermont  before going further into the details of this the first of a class of ships which have within the last fifty years almost completely changed the whole system of navigation let us take a cursory glance at the first attempts made to propel ships by means of steam  the subject has occupied mankind much longer than many people suppose so long ago as the year 1543 a naval captain of spain applied an engine to a ship of about two hundred tons and succeeded in moving it at the rate of about two miles an hour  the nature of his engine the captain kept secret but it was noted that part of it consisted of a caldron of boiling water  this we are told by thomas gonzales the director of the royal archives of simancas but his veracity is now called in questionat any rate nothing further was afterwards heard of the discovery  the first authentic record we have of steam navigation occurs in a work written by the marquis of worcester in 1665 in which allusion is made to the application of engines to boats and ships which would draw them up rivers against the stream and if need be pass london bridge against the current at lowwater  many attempts more or less successful were made by ingenious men from time to time  papin of france in 1690 constructed a steamboat the success of which may be gathered from the fact that it was ultimately broken up by enraged and jealous watermen  jonathan hulls in 1736 and m genevois in 1759 were each successful to a certain extent in constructing working models but nothing definite resulted from their labours  yet we would not be understood to undervalue the achievements of such men  on the contrary it is by the successive discoveries of such inquiring and philosophical men that grand results are at last attained  the magnificent structures that crowd the ocean were not the creations of one era or the product of one stupendous mind  they are the result of the labours of thousands of men whose names have never been known to fame  the men who working upon the materials supplied by preceding generations brought the propulsion of boats by steam nearest to perfection just before the commencement of navigation were mr miller of dumfries mr taylor his friend and tutor in his family and mr symington  all of these were in a very important degree instrumental in ushering in the great event  symington in 1788 fitted an engine to a large boat in which he attained the speed of seven miles an hour  the man to whom the credit belongs of introducing steam navigation is undoubtedly mr fulton of america  this gentleman who was contemporary with those just mentioned visited france and england in the former of which countries he endeavoured unsuccessfully to carry out his projects while in the latter he met with symington and obtained much valuable information from him  we have no sympathy whatever with those who seem to rake in to the credit of their own country every discovery and invention they possibly or plausibly can  we did much towards the commencement of steam navigation but we did not begin it  we pushed considerably in advance of other nations in the invention of apparatus by which boats might be propelled by steam we constructed models tried it on a small scale and found the thing to answer admirably but we rested there meanwhile an enterprising american came and saw our achievements ordered an engine in england carried it across the atlantic and commenced the era of steam navigation on the river hudson by building and launching  the first steamer  robert fulton in conjunction with chancellor livingston of america planned built and launched a boat in the spring of 1807 which they named the clermont  it was propelled by steam and averaged the rate of five miles an hour on its first voyage from new york to albany a distance of nearly one hundred and fifty miles  all discoveries and novelties great and small are treated with ridicule at first by the mass of mankind so it is not a matter of wonder that the crowds which flocked to the wharf to see the clermont start on her first trip were somewhat satirical and jocose in their remarks  but when the steam was turned on and they heard the first of that series of snorts that was destined ere long to shake the trembling air of land and sea and saw the great uncouth paddlewheels revolve powerfully in the water and churn it into foam a shout tinged doubtless with prophetic fervour greeted the triumphant engineer as his little steamboat darted from the shore  colden in his life of fulton speaks thus of the clermonts first voyage  she excited the astonishment of the inhabitants of the shores of the hudson many of whom had not heard even of an engine much less of a steamboat  there were many descriptions of the effects of her first appearance upon the people of the banks of the river  some of these were ridiculous but some of them were of such a character as nothing but an object of real grandeur could have excited she was described by some who had indistinctly seen her passing in the night as a monster moving on the waters defying the winds and tide and breathing flames and smoke  she had the most terrific appearance from other vessels which were navigating the river when she was making her passage  the first steamboat as others yet do used dry pine wood for fuel which sends forth a column of ignited vapour many feet above the flue and whenever the fire is stirred a galaxy of sparks fly off which in the night have a very brilliant and beautiful appearance  this uncommon light first attracted the attention of the crews of other vessels  notwithstanding the wind and tide which were adverse to its approach they saw with astonishment that it was rapidly coming towards them and when it came so near that the noise of the machinery and paddles was heard the crewsif what was said in the newspapers of the time be truein some instances shrank beneath their decks from the terrific sight and left their vessels to go on shore whilst others prostrated themselves and besought providence to protect them from the approaches of the horrible monster which was marching on the tide and lighting its path by the fires that it vomited  the clermont became a regular passenger boat on the hudson and the progress of steam navigation continued to advance until nearly all the navigable rivers of the world and the great ocean itself were covered with these clanking ships of commerce which have added more to the comfort the wealth and the power of manthe power of doing good as well as evil than the feeble human mind can conceive  the comet  it was not until five years after the americans set us the example that we launched our first passenger steamboat the comet a vessel of about twentyfive tons with engines of three horsepower  this little vessel was started by henry bell of helensburgh on the clyde  it began its career in 1812 and plied regularly for two years  like her predecessor the clermont she was regarded with no small degree of scepticism and with a large amount of surprise by the thousands who saw her set forth  nevertheless she soon proved her value became a successful speculation to her owners and was ere long followed by many other vessels of a similar kind  the argyle afterwards named the thames  in 1813 the argyle was launched  this vessel was the first european steamer that pushed out into the more dangerous navigation of the open seacoast  she was purchased by a company in london  on her passage up she was as nearly as possible wrecked on a leeshore but by her steampower was enabled to go straight against the wind at the rate of three and a half knots an hour and so escaped  one of the passengers has left us an interesting account of this interesting voyage from which we cull one or two paragraphs  the weather had now become so stormy and bad that our captain determined to put in to the port of wexford his great object being to navigate the vessel safely to london rather than by using great despatch to expose her to unnecessary risk  we put to sea again at two oclock pm on may 30th and steered for saint davids head the most westerly point of wales  during our passage across saint georges channel one of the blades of the starboard paddlewheel became out of order the engine was stopped and the blade cut away  some hours afterwards a similar accident happened to the other wheel which was remedied in the same manner  about twooclock in the afternoon twelve hours after leaving wexford we reached the pass of ramsay  we remained there for three hours to oil the engine and to give the stoker who had not quitted his post an instant since leaving wexford a little rest  in a short time several boats were seen coming to our assistance the idea prevailing here as at wexford that our vessel was on fire  we landed on the island of ramsay a most desolate spot containing only one habitation we however procured some bread butter milk cheese and ale with which we returned to the vessel and commenced steaming through the straits and across saint brides bay  the weather had now become unfavourable and the sea ran alarmingly high in the bay  on the south side of saint brides bay between skomar island and the mainland is a nasty passage called jack sound  our pilot warned us of the danger of attempting this passage excepting at highwater and with a favourable wind as there were several formidable whirlpools which would seize the vessel and carry her on the rocks captain dodd however who knew the power of his engine insisted on going through the sound in order to save five hours and another night at sea  the pilot repeated his remonstrances at the same time trembling for fear but we passed through all the whirlpools with the greatest ease  nothing however can be conceived more frightful than the aspect of some of the rocks and especially of those called the bishop and his clerks  had we been in a sailing vessel our position would have been most perilous but our steam was allpowerful and brought us safely to milford haven  we put to sea again late on the evening of the 31st and on friday morning we were in the middle of the bristol channel with no land visible but towards evening we discovered the high coast that terminates england in the west  as the weather however again assumed a gloomy aspect our new pilot judged that it would be imprudent that night to double lands end so we shaped our course towards saint ives  on approaching the shore we perceived a crowd of small vessels making towards us with all possible rapidity by means of oars and sails here as elsewhere the alarm was taken on seeing a vessel judged to be on fire steering towards the town and all the disposable craft immediately put to sea  all the rocks commanding saint ives were covered with spectators and when we entered the harbour the aspect of our vessel appeared to occasion as much surprise amongst the inhabitants as the ships of captain cook must have produced on his first appearance amongst the islanders of the south seas  another night passed a night of storm and danger but the little thames the vessel had been renamed by the new company who purchased her behaved nobly and next day reached plymouth  here continues the narrative the harbourmaster who had never seen a steamvessel before was as much struck with astonishment when he boarded the thames as a child is on getting possession of a new plaything  he steered the vessel and we passed round several ships of war in the sound  the sailors ran in crowds to the sides of their vessels as we passed them and mounting the rigging gave vent to their observations in a most amusing manner  we left plymouth at noon on the following day and steamed without interruption to portsmouth where we arrived on friday june 9th having accomplished one hundred and fifty miles in twentythree hours  at portsmouth astonishment and admiration were if possible more strongly evinced than elsewhere  tens of thousands of spectators were assembled to gaze on the thames and the number of vessels that crowded around us was so great that it became necessary to request the admiral to give us a guard to preserve some degree of order  we entered the harbour in the most brilliant style steaming in with the assistance of wind and tide at the rate of from twelve to fourteen miles an hour  a courtmartial was at the time sitting on board the gladiator frigate but the novelty of our steamboat presented an irresistible attraction and the whole court came off to us excepting the president who was obliged by etiquette to retain his seat until the court was regularly adjourned  on saturday june 10th the portadmiral sent his band and a guard of marines at an early hour on board and soon afterwards he followed accompanied by three admirals eighteen postcaptains and a large number of ladies  the morning was spent in steaming amongst the fleet and running over to the isle of wight  from portsmouth we proceeded to margate which we reached on sunday morning here we remained until the following day when we embarked for our final trip at halfpast eight in the morning and about six in the evening arrived at limehouse where we moored  we have entered thus at considerable length into this voyage because besides being the first steam seavoyage it serves to exhibit very distinctly how great and how rapid has been the progress of steamnavigation within the last fifty years  in reading such an account as this in these days of ocean mailsteamers and great easterns we can scarcely believe that in it reference is made not to the middle ages but to the year 1813  oceansteamers  after that momentous era when steam was first successfully applied to useful purposes human progress and improvement in all departments of science and art seemed to have been hooked on to it and to have thenceforth rushed roaring at its tail with truly railroad speed towards perfection  scarce had the first model steamboat splashed with its ungainly blades the waters of a pond than river traffic by means of steamboats began and no sooner had this been proved to be a decided success than daring schemes were laid to rush over the ocean itself on wheels  men were not long about it after the first start was made  their intellectual steam was up and the whirl of inventive effort racked the brains of engineers as the wheels of their steamboats tortured the waters of the deep  and here again the name of fulton comes into notice  early in 1814 he conceived the idea of constructing a steamvessel of war which should carry a strong battery with furnaces for redhot shot  congress authorised the building of such a ship and before the end of the same year it was launched  fulton died the following year but the fame of that enterprising engineer will never die  the new vessel received the rather quaint title of fulton the first she consisted of two boats joined together  those who were appointed by congress to examine her and report gave the following account of this curious manofwar  she is a structure resting on two boats and keels separated from end to end by a channel fifteen feet wide and sixtysix feet long  one boat contains the caldrons of copper to prepare her steam the cylinder of iron its piston lever and wheels occupy part of the other  the waterwheel revolves in the space between them  the main or gundeck supports the armament and is protected by a parapet four feet ten inches thick of solid timber pierced by embrasures  through thirty portholes as many thirtytwo pounders are intended to fire redhot shot which can be heated with great safety and convenience  her upper or spardeck upon which several thousand men might parade is encompassed by a bulwark which affords safe quarters  she is rigged with two stout masts each of which supports a large lateen yard and sails  she has two bowsprits and jibs and four ruddersone at each extremity of each boat so that she can be steered with either end foremost  her machinery is calculated for the addition of an engine which will discharge an immense column of water which it is intended to throw upon the decks and through the portholes of the enemy and thereby deluge her armament and ammunition  if in addition to all this we suppose her to be furnished according to mr fultons intention with hundredpound columbiads two suspended from each bow so as to discharge a ball of that size into an enemys ship ten or twelve feet below her waterline it must be allowed that she has the appearance at least of being the most formidable engine for warfare that human ingenuity has contrived  she certainly was and even at the present time the fulton the first would cut no insignificant figure if placed alongside our gunboats floatingbatteries and steamfrigates  it is not easy to get intelligent men to believe in things that savour of the marvellous yet there seems to be a point past which if once a man be got he will go on to believe almost anything no matter how absurd  in those days few people in europe would credit the truth of this ships proportions but when in the course of time and from indubitable testimony they were compelled to believe they flew to the opposite extreme of incredulity and believed anything as the following curiously comical paragraph will show  it is said to have appeared in a scotch treatise on steamships and is intended for a full true and particular account of this monstrous american manofwar steamer after giving her dimensions three times larger than they were in reality the author continuesthe thickness of her sides is thirteen feet of alternate oak plank and cork wood  she carries fortyfour guns four of which are hundred pounders quarterdeck and forecastle guns fortyfour pounders and further to annoy an enemy attempting to board can discharge one hundred gallons of boiling water in a minute and by mechanism brandishes three hundred cutlasses with the utmost regularity over her gunwales works also an equal number of heavy iron spikes of great length darting them from the sides with prodigious force and withdrawing them every quarter of a minute  this vessel although probably intended for an oceansteamer was never used as such  but not long after a vessel propelled by steam ventured to cross the atlantic and thus became the parent of commercial steam navigation  this vessel was  the savannah steamer  unfortunately little information as to this the first oceansteamer has been chronicled  she was launched at new york on the 22nd of august 1818 and in the following year made her first voyage to savannah from which she sailed for liverpool soon after and crossed the atlantic in twentyfive days during eighteen of which she used her engines  the savannah was about 350 tons burden and was on this occasion commanded by captain moses rodgers  she was fitted with machinery for taking in her wheels in stormy weather which was found to work admirably and she is mentioned as having been seen on the ocean going at the rate of nine or ten knots  from liverpool this steamer went to saint petersburg and afterwards returned to savannah in safety  this was the insertion of the wedge  our own country did not follow the lead until 1838 when the good people of new york were thrown into a state of excitement by the arrival of two steamers the sirius and the great western from england  so long a time had elapsed since the voyage of the savannah that men had wellnigh forgotten it and were disposed to regard these vessels as the first oceansteamers  indeed some narrowminded and ungenerous writers have asserted that they were the firsttotally ignoring the prior claim of the savannah  from that period oceansteamers began to run frequently across the atlantic  they now do so regularly as well as to nearly all other parts of the world  ocean mailsteamers  the improvements which have taken place during recent years in oceangoing steamships have been great and rapid  the speed attained by some of these magnificent vessels is little short of marvellous  many persons still living can recollect the time when the voyage to australia in a sailing vessel lasted six months  what is now the state of matters  by more than one line of steamships the traveller may reach sydney or melbourne within forty days  a recent voyage of the orient one of the latest and finest additions to ocean steamships merits more than a passing notice  the lusitania which belongs to the same line steamed from england to australia in less than forty days and the feat was regarded as a great one  but the lusitania has been far outmatched by her sistership the orient which has actually accomplished the same voyage in thirtyfive days fifteen hours and fortysix minutes  from plymouth to the cape of good hope took the orient only seventeen days twentyone hours  this is the fastest speed on record  whether it is the maximum rate possible to ocean steamships or whether it is destined to be surpassed by a still higher degree of speed remains to be seen  many persons are of opinion that the increased facilities of speed which are now within reach of travellers on long voyages will gradually lead to the total disuse of sailing ships for passenger traffic  it may be so but there are still not a few who would prefer a sailing to a steam ship for a long sea voyage notwithstanding its so greatly inferior rate of speed  but nowadays everything must be sacrificed to time  time flies is at present the motto of most instant and potent power with the world but the day is perhaps not far off when the fiat thus far and no farther must be pronounced not only on the speed of steamships but on the breathless rush and hurry of the age in general  the czars yacht livadia  undoubtedly one of the most remarkable craft afloat is the russian czars steamyacht the livadia  to a scotch shipbuilding firm belongs the credit of having constructed this unique and splendid vessel and it is certainly a feather in the cap of messrs elder and company the wellknown glasgow shipbuilders from whose yard the livadia was launched in july 1880  one would imagine that the highest point of comfort and luxuriousness has been reached in the accommodation offered by the livadia but this is far from being the only or even the chief respect in which the vessel is remarkable  she is notable from a purely nautical point of view being the outcome of principles that may be said almost to revolutionise all preexisting ideas of shipbuilding though something like the same principle may be found in the circular ironclads of admiral popoff  hitherto the plan which naval architects have followed where the desideratum was exceptional speed was to give the vessel in course of construction length in combination with as fine lines and as perfect proportion as possible  but in the case of an imperial pleasureboat like the livadia it was an object to obtain an ampler and more drawingroom like accommodation than is compatible with length narrowness of beam and fine lines and the constructors of the czars new yacht have succeeded in securing not only this internal spaciousness and comfort but also a satisfactory degree of speed  it was to the united exertions of admiral popoff of the russian navy and dr tideman of the royal dockyard amsterdam that the design of the livadia was due  it is not easy in words to convey a distinct impression of this curiouslyshaped craft but our description will we hope give the reader a pretty correct idea of the vessel  the constructors of the livadia it is believed chose a turbot as their model for the hull and in thus taking a flat fish as a suggestion for their vessel the builders as a recent writer on the subject points out followed no extravagant though certainly a novel fancy  in broad terms the livadia may be described as a wide and shallow oval in shape half submerged while over this turbotshaped raft a superstructure is erected somewhat similar in appearance to an ordinary vessel and comprising large lofty and sumptuous saloons and other apartments  the livadia is 260 feet long 150 feet broad and 50 feet deep  she is 11609 tons burden and her displacement 4000  the two leading merits of the livadia due to its peculiar construction arefirst that its frame can support a superstructure of almost palatial proportions such as would founder any other vessel and second that its great breadth of beam keeps the ship as steady as a ship can possibly be while at the same time its lower lines secure a very good degree of speed  the livadia possesses powerful propelling engines  there are three sets of these each with three cylinders the diameter being sixty inches for the high pressure and seventyeight inches for the low with a stroke of three feet three inches  as much strength and lightness as possible have been secured for the propellers by constructing them of manganese iron while steel has been largely employed for the engines and boilers which are for their weight the most powerful possessed by any vessel  the estimated horsepower is 10500 and the ship under favourable conditions can make fifteen knots an hour  the double watertight bottom of the livadia is three feet six inches deep at the centre and two feet nine inches at each end  in this turbotlike lower part is the machinery and it is the receptacle also for coals and stores of all kinds  the twofold bottom of the ship comprises forty compartments and the whole is sufficiently strong it is believed to withstand the heaviest weather to which the yacht is likely to be exposed as well as the strain of her powerful machinery  the entire length of the upper part of the ship in which are the imperial apartments and the quarters of the officers and crew is 260 feet and the breadth 110 feet  the crew all told numbers 260  the private apartments of the czar himself are forward on the maindeck well away from the heat of the engines and the smell of the machinery a visitor to the ship is chiefly struck perhaps by the height to which the decks rise above the hull the uppermost compartment of all being fitted out as a reception saloon in the centre of which a little fountain rises out of a bed of flowers  this portion of the vessel is forty feet above the level of the sea  the apartment is luxuriously appointed in the fashion of the reign of louis xvi  the drawingroom is furnished in a style of equal sumptuousness in the crimean tartar style but the rest of the imperial apartments are in a simpler order of decoration  behind the funnels there is another deckhouse containing the captains quarters and rooms for the grand duke constantine  it will thus be seen that the livadia is literally a floating palace equipped and decorated with that almost eastern love of sumptuous display which characterises the russians as a people  all the three screws with which the livadia is furnished are wholly submerged in the wateranother novelty in the construction of the vessel  one or even two of these screws might suffer serious injury and the ship still remain manageable  it is not wonderful that the launch of a craft at once so splendid and so curious should have caused much interest and excitement in the neighbourhood in which it took place  a distinguished company witnessed the ceremony while the crowd which lined the banks of the river clyde numbered 10000  a short service was conducted by three priests of the greek church and the bows of the vessel were then sprinkled with holy water  after the conclusion of this ceremony the yacht received her name from the duchess of hamilton and was then launched  the launch was a complete success the livadia taking the water in gallant style though the task was one of more than ordinary difficulty from the circumstance of the great breadth of the ships keelless bottom which much increased the friction to be overcome  at the luncheon which concluded the days proceedings mr pearce the chairman who represented the firm of elder and company stated that the principle adopted in the building of the livadia would probably be more useful in the case of ships of war than of merchant vessels but that builders of the latter might also derive valuable hints from the construction of the new ship  whether this will prove to be the case time has yet to show  a most interesting discovery of a norse warship has recently been made at sandefjord in norway  the vessel there can be no doubt is one of the kind in which those formidable buccaneers the norsemen used to harry the coasts of great britain and france ten hundred years ago  it was found buried in the ground and seems to have been the sepulchre of some great viking chieftain who had probably many a time sailed forth in it to the terror and detriment of some less warlike and powerful neighbour  the ship is unusually large and very completely equipped  its length is about seventyfive feet and sails rigging a number of shields and other instruments of battle were found on board    chapter fourteen  the great eastern  the great eastern steamship deserves to be regarded as the eighth wonder of the world beyond all question  she is at present by far the largest vessel in the world and is the most magnificent creation of naval architecture that was ever launched upon the sea  the substance of the following account of this interesting ship has been gathered principally from the times and the illustrated london news for 1859 the year in which the great eastern was launched and from a pamphlet which was sold on board by permission of the proprietors  the great eastern was intended for the indian and australian route by the cape of good hope  the result of large experience in steam navigation has proved that the size of the ship when steam is used ought to be in proportion to the length of the voyage  mr brunel the talented engineer to whose genius and perseverance this monster ship owes her existence acting on this principle calculated that the voyage to australia and back being 22500 milesa vessel of 22500 tons burden or a ton burden for every mile to be steamed would require to be built capable of carrying fuel for the entire voyage it being impossible without incurring enormous expense to procure coal for such a vessel at intermediate ports  the eastern steam navigation company undertook the herculean work  the total cost of construction was estimated at 804522 pounds  mr brunel prepared the designs  a spot of ground was chosen on the banks of the thames in the buildingyard of the company at millwall and the building was commenced on the lines laid down by mr scott russell on the 1st of may 1854  every minute detail of the arrangements and building of this wonder of the world is fraught with interest  the mere preparing of the ground to receive her enormous weight was calculated to fill the minds of men with astonishment  her supports and scaffoldings and the machinery by which she was ultimately launched taxed the skill of her engineers even more than her construction  a very town of workshops foundries and forges sprang into being round her hull and as this rose foot by foot in all its gigantic proportions the surrounding edifices dwindled down into insignificance and the busy population of artificers clustered upon her like ants upon a prostrate monarch of the foresttrees  the hull of the great eastern is built entirely of iron and is 680 feet in length 83 feet in breadth and 60 feet in height from keel to deck  it is divided transversely into ten separate compartments of 60 feet each rendered perfectly watertight by bulkheads having no openings whatever lower than the second deck whilst two longitudinal walls of iron 36 feet apart traverse 350 feet of the length of the ship  the mind will be better able to realise the magnitude of these dimensions if we add that the great eastern is six times the size of the duke of wellington lineofbattle ship that her length is more than three times the height of the monument while her breadth is equal to the width of pall mall and a promenade round the deck affords a walk of more than a quarter of a mile  there is no keel properly so called but in its place a flat keelplate of iron about two feet wide and one inch thick which runs the entire length from stem to stern  this is the base upon which all the rest is reared plates and girders alike  the iron plates which form her planking are threequarters of an inch thick  up to the watermark the hull is constructed with an inner and outer skin two feet ten inches apart both skins being made of threequarter inch plates except at the bottom where the plates are an inch thick and between these at intervals of six feet run horizontal webs of iron plates which bind the two skins together and thus it may be said that the lower part of the hull is two feet ten inches thick  this mode of construction adds materially to the safety of the vessel for in the event of a collision at sea the outer skin might be pierced while the inner might remain intact  this space may also at any time be filled with water and thus ballast to the amount of 2500 tons be obtained  some idea of the magnitude and weight of the vessel may be formed from the fact that each iron plate weighs about the third of a ton and is fastened with a hundred iron rivets  about thirty thousand of these plates were used in her construction and three million rivets  the fastening of these rivets was one among the many curious operations performed in course of building  the riveting men were arranged in gangs each gang consisting of two riveters one holderup and three boys  two boys were stationed at the fire or portable forge and one with the holderup  this boys duty was to receive the redhot rivet with his pincers from the boy at the forge and insert it in the hole destined for its reception the point protruding about an inch  the holderup immediately placed his heavy hammer against the head of the rivet and held it firmly there while the two riveters assailed it in front with alternate blows until the countersunk part of the hole was filled up after which the protruding head was cut off smooth with the plate the whole operation scarce occupying a minute  in riveting the double part of the ship the holderup and his boy were necessarily in the interior part of the tubes and passed the whole day in the narrow space between of two feet ten inches wide in comparative darkness having only the glimmer afforded by a single dip candle and being immediately under the deafening blows of the riveters  the deck of the great eastern is double or cellular after the plan of the britannia tubular bridge  the upper deck runs flush and clear from stem to stern and he who takes four turns up and down it from stem to stern walks upwards of a mile  the strength of this deck is so enormous that if the ship were taken up by its two extremities with all its cargo passengers coals and provisions on board it would sustain the whole  the deck has been covered with teak planking and has been planed and scrubbed to manofwar whiteness  not even a stray ropes end breaks the wonderful effect produced by its immense expanse  her fleet of small boats which are about the size of sailing cutters hang at the davits ten on each side  there are six masts and five funnels the three centre squarerigged masts are of iron  they were made by mr finch of chepstow and are the finest specimens of masts of the kind that were ever manufactured  each is made of hollow wrought iron in eightfeet lengths strengthened inside by diaphragms of the same material  between the joints as they were bolted together was placed a pad of vulcanised indiarubber which gives a spring and buoyancy to the whole spar greater than wood while at the same time it retains all the strength of the iron  the other masts are made of wood and the canvas that can be spread is no less than 6500 square yards  on deck are four small steam winches or engines each of which works a pair of cranes on both sides of the vessel and with these five thousand tons of coals can be hoisted into the vessel in twentyfour hours  the engines and boilers are of immense power and magnitude  there are both screw and paddle engines the former being capable of working up to 6500 horsepower the latter to 5000  there are ten boilers and one hundred and twelve furnaces  the paddle engines which were made by messrs scott russell and company stand nearly 40 feet high  each cylinder weighs about 28 tons and each paddlewheel is 58 feet in diameter or considerably larger than the ring in astleys circus  the screw engines were manufactured by messrs watt and company of birmingham  they consist of four cylinders of 84 inches diameter and 4 feet stroke  the screw propeller is 24 feet in diameter and 37 feet pitch and the engineshaft is 160 feet long or 12 feet longer than the height of the duke of yorks column  the paddles and screw when working together at their highest pitch exert a force equal to 11500 horsepower which is sufficient to drive all the cottonmills in manchester  the consumption of coal to produce this force is estimated at about 250 tons per day  besides these engines there are also several auxiliary engines for pumping water into the boilers etcetera  the passenger accommodation in the great eastern is very extensive namely 800 firstclass from 2000 to 4000 secondclass and about 1200 thirdclass passengers or if troops alone were taken it could accommodate 10000 men  the saloons are fitted up in the most elaborate and costly manner the chief saloon is magnificently furnished  it is said that the mirrors gilding carpeting and silk curtains for this apartment alone cost 3000 pounds  in the berths of course no attempt is made at costly decoration of this kind though the fittings are good and sufficiently luxurious  the berths are arranged in three classes those for parties of six or eight and these are large rooms those for parties of four and the rest in the usual style of double cabins  all are very roomy as cabins govery lofty well lit and those on the outer sides exceedingly well ventilated  on the lower deck the berths are even larger loftier and more commodious than those on the upper both the berths and saloons here are in fact almost unnecessarily high having very nearly fifteen feet in the clear  the kitchens pantries and sculleries are all on the same extensive scale and fitted with all the large culinary requisites of firstclass hotels  the icehouse holds upwards of 100 tons of ice and the lofty winevaultsfor such in fact they arecontain wine enough to form a good freight for an oporto trader  miscellaneain addition to the boats of the great eastern twenty in number she carries two small screwsteamers each 100 feet long 16 feet broad 120 tons burden and 40 horsepower suspended aft of the paddleboxes  as the captains voice could not be heard halfway to the bow even with the aid of the ancient speakingtrumpet that instrument is supplanted by semaphore signals by day and coloured lamps by night the electric telegraph is also used in connection with the enginerooms there are ten anchors four of them being trotmans patent weighing seven tons each  the cables are each 400 fathoms long and their united weight is 100 tons  the tonnage of the great eastern is 18500 tons register and 22500 tons builders measurement  the crew at first consisted of thirteen officers seventeen engineers a sailingmaster and a purser four hundred men and two or three surgeons all under the command of the late captain w harrison formerly of the cunard line  the launch of this leviathan was a most formidable undertaking and was accomplished by means of powerful hydraulic rams which propelled the vessel down the launching ways  the ship rested on two gigantic cradles and was forced sideways down the inclined plane until she floated on the river  by a complication of ingenious contrivances the great ship was regulated in her descent so as to proceed slowly and regularly down the ways  several unsuccessful attempts were made to launch her and several of the hydraulic rams broke down ere she floated on the bosom of old father thames and the cost of this operation alone is said to have been nearly 100000 pounds  the trial of the engines both screw and paddle took place for the first time on the 8th of august 1859 when the completion of the vessel was celebrated by a banquet on board  the first movement of the gigantic cranks and cylinders of the paddle engines was made precisely at halfpast one when the great masses slowly rose and fell as noiselessly as the engines of a greenwich boat but exerting in their revolutions what seemed to be an almost irresistible power  there was no noise no vibration nor the slightest sign of heating  the tremendous frame of ironwork sprang at once into life and motion with as much ease as if every rod and crank had been worked for the last ten years  the trial trip of the great eastern was an event that excited intense interest all over the kingdom  for the first time she cast off her moorings on wednesday morning the 7th september and reached the nore on thursday where she anchored for the night before proceeding to sea  on friday morning at ten minutes past nine she started on her first saltwater voyage  a conviction of the extreme steadiness of the vessel must speedily have seized everyone on board  there was no perceptible motion of any kind  the giant ship was speedily surrounded by yachts tugs fishingsmacks and indeed by a representative of almost every kind of vessel which is prevalent at the nore  these accompanied her as far on her way as their limited sailing powers would permit  although there were sharp squalls and a chopping sea nearly all through the trip not the slightest inconvenience was felt by any of the visitors not even among the fairer portion of the passengers  the morning which was rather fine at starting suddenly became clouded and the shifting squalls increased in violence  though the squally state of the weather damped the pleasure of all on board yet it afforded an opportunity of trying the properties of the ship now under paddle as well as screw and it was the wish of mr scott russell and all on board to meet a good gale of wind  at a moderate computation the distance from the deck to the water could not be much less than forty feet while the vessel is nearly seven hundred feet long  this area would of course present an enormous surface to the force of the wind and formed the subject of considerable discussion as to the effect it would have on her seagoing qualities  the ship was as stiff and steady as though she still remained on her cradles in the isle of dogs and her course was as calm and true as though she were on a lake without a capful of wind  it is said that at one portion of the voyage she steamed nineteen miles an hour  the explosionall went well till the ship had passed folkestone about halfpast five oclock while the majority of the passengers were on deck and a few gentlemen only remained in the dining saloon a tremendous explosion occurred and in an instant showers of broken glass and fragments of wood and iron came crashing through the skylight  those in the cabin rushed on deck  the ship was still pressing onward at either end all was still and deserted while in the centre all was smoke fire vapour and confusion  the great funnel of eight tons weight had been shot up as if from a mortar and fell on the deck broken in two pieces  the whole centre of the ship seemed to be only one vast chasm and from it were belching up steam dust and something that looked like incipient conflagration  captain harrison acted nobly on this terrible occasion  he had been standing on the bridge overhead looking into the binnacle and the moment he heard the report and whilst the destructive shower was still falling fast he jumped upon the deck and ordered an immediate descent to the ladies saloon in the firm conviction that they were all there as on the previous evening  but many of the men were panicstricken and had already shrunk away from the explosion  a foolish passenger had raised a cry of the boats and assisted by some of the sailors was madly attempting to let them down  in one moment all would have been lost for the rush to the boats would have been general and hundreds been drowned whilst the noble ship would have been left to certain destruction  but the voice of the captain was heard like a trumpet calling out men to your duty officers to your posts give me a rope and let six men follow me  the effect of this short address was electric  in an instant he had slid down the rope into the saloon followed by his brave boatswain hawkins and six volunteers were not long wanted for the forlorn hope  one after another he dashed open the gilded panels but the splendid apartment had strange to say only two inhabitantshis little daughter edith and her pet dog  it was the reward of his gallantry that his own child should be thus the one to be so providentially saved  but even then he did not for a moment lose his selfcommand  snatching up the child and with one glance seeing that she was unharmed he exclaimed pass her along to the deck there are more rooms to be searched  in this way did he move about rapidly but coolly and did not again return to the deck until he had satisfied himself that not a single woman was in the burning steaming suffocating chamber  his intimate friend mr trotman who had followed him down almost immediately found the poor lapdog moaning under a heap of ruins and was the means of restoring it to its little mistress  the magnificent saloon was a mass of torn and shattered furniture mirrors and ornaments  had the passengers adjourned to this apartment after dinner instead of to the deck the consequences would have been awful  an eyewitness describes the scene of devastation as follows  the mirrors which formed the covering of the funnel which had been the cause of so much mischief were literally smashed to atoms and large fragments of the broken glass were hurled upon deck a long distance aft of the paddlewheels  the ornamental bronzed columns which supported the gilt cornices and elaborate ornamentation were either struck down or bent into the most fantastic shapes the flooring consisting of threeinch planks was upheaved in several places the gangways leading to the sleepingcabins at the sides were shot away the handrails were gone and the elegant carpet was concealed beneath a chaos of fragments of finery  the books on the shelves of the library remained unmoved the piano was thrown on one side and the floor presented huge upheaved and rent chasms through which might be seen the still greater ruin in the lower cabin  below the saloon or drawingroom is the saloon of the lower deck which was of course traversed by the same funnel as the one above it  on each side of these spacious saloons were small staircases leading to blocks of sleepingcabins scarcely one of which would have been without its two or more occupants a few hours later in the evening  they were now blown down like a house of cards  the furniture which they contained formed heaps of dislocated chairs and washstands and basins the doors were off their hinges the partitions were forced outward the staircases leading to them had to be sought in the splinters and broken wood which lay in heaps in the lower saloon  the unhappy men who were working in the stokeholes and tending the furnaces were the sufferers by this catastrophe  believing that one of the boilers had exploded fears were entertained that the whole body of stokers and engineers attending the paddle engines were killed  mr trotman went down the airshaft communicating with the other boilers seeing by the light of the furnaces a number of men moving about he inquired if they were all right and the response sent up from these lowest depths of the ship was all right at present but we dont know how long  they were told to keep quiet and stay where they were that they could be of no service on deck and all would be well in a few minutes  the gallant fellows remained by their fiery furnaces with resolute goodwill  in the case of the firemen tending the other set of boilers a very different scene was taking place  ropes were thrown down and one by one wounded bleeding and staggering men were drawn up their black begrimed faces forming a ghastly contrast with scalded portions of their limbs and bodies  the men were taken aft to the hospital and to the cabins where mattresses and blankets were laid for them  two or three of these poor fellows walked up to the deck almost if not quite unassisted  their aspect told its own tale and none who had ever seen blownup men before could fail to know at a glance that some had only two or three hours to live  where not grimed by the smoke or ashes the peculiar bright soft whiteness of the face hands or breast told at once that the skin though unbroken had in fact been boiled by the steam  one man walked along and seemed quite unconscious that the flesh of his thighs most probably by the ashes from the furnace was burnt in deep holes  to some one who came to his assistance he said quietly i am all right  there are others worse than me go and look after them  this poor man was the first to die it was seen at once that but little hope existed for many if not the majority of the sufferers who were twelve in number  most of them seemed very restless and almost if not quite delirious but a few of those whose injuries were likely to be more immediately fatal remained quiet half unconscious or at most only asking to be covered up as if they felt the cold  for these latter all knew that nothing whatever could be done as in fact they were then dying  the explosion had occurred in the double casing round the bottom of one of the funnels  we have not space to describe this minutely and by the general reader the description were it given would scarce be understood but it is well to remark that the piece of machinery which caused the deplorable accident had been previously condemned in strong terms by competent judges and there is no doubt that the hotwater casing round the funnel ought never to have been there  after the catastrophe the great eastern kept on her course as though nothing had happened although the force of the explosion was sufficient to have sent any other ship to the bottom  the damage was estimated at 5000 pounds  she arrived at portland on the 10th and remained there for some time undergoing repairs  afterwards she continued her trial trip to holyhead where she arrived on the 10th of october  the results of the trial excepting of course the accident were most satisfactory  her speed under disadvantageous circumstances had been good and her engines had worked admirably  against a gale of head wind she went as steadily as if in harbour but with the wind abeam she rolled considerably  altogether there was good reason to hope that the great eastern would fulfil the sanguine expectations of her warmest admirers  the following account of the continuation of her trial trip from portland to holyhead as gathered from the times is exceedingly interestingwhen steam was up and all ready for starting from portland the crew were sent forward to heave up the anchor  eighty men sufficed to drag the great eastern up to and over her moorings bringing the anchor out of the ground however was not so easily managed and it was not till all the musical resources known to sailors on such occasions were nearly exhausted that the tenacious gripe of trotmans patent was released when a slow drift with the tide showed that the great ship was again set free  in another minute without shouting confusion or hurry of any kind and with less noise than is made by a 100ton coaster a slight vibration through the ship with a thin line of foam astern showed that the screw engines were at work and the vessel once more under way  with such ease with such perfect quietness and good order was everything accomplished that the occasional cheering from the yachts and steamers was almost the first token given to those on board that the trial trip had commenced  at a quarter to four the way on the vessel was rapid her head went round like turning a pleasureboat and so little sign was given of the ship being under steam that it seemed rather as if the breakwater had got adrift and was slowly floating past than that the monster vessel was really cleaving the blue waves with a force which as yet we have seen no wind or sea to resist or check  directly the anchor was fished captain harrison passed the word to steam ahead with both engines easily and the wheels began their revolutions slowly at first but nevertheless making a track of foam upon the water such as they never made on the first start from deptford to the nore  the accession of speed from working the paddles was at first but slight not from any want of power however but simply from the fact that both engines were ordered to work slowly and though propelling the great ship at something like eleven knots were really scarcely driving at indicated halfspeed  quitting portland it was necessary to make rather a round turn on leaving the breakwater as right ahead on the starboard bow was a small lightship looking like the skeleton of a vessel and marking the presence of a dangerous shoal known by the most appropriate and significant name of the shambles  inside this lay a long and turbid ridge of angry water where the race of portland ran and where a deep rolling swell like the bay of biscay on a reduced scale kept tumbling and breaking into spray like drifts of snow against the high gaunt cliffs  it however required no actual watching of the low green mounds of water which seemed butting against the coast to convince all on board that the great eastern was at sea  to the infinite relief and comfort of all the passengers the vessel began to yield to reason and to behave as much like another ship as she could consistently with her size  it would be too much to say she rolled at this time for when the great eastern rolls if ever she does roll travellers may depend upon her accomplishing something in that peculiar style of ocean navigation quite in proportion to her bulk but one thing is certain that she went from side to side sufficiently to show that she was susceptible of the motion of the water and that if ever she steams across a beam sea she is likely to move to it with a will though slowly and easily  continuing for a considerable time under little more than half steam the great eastern averaged more than thirteen knots fifteen miles an hour  the best guide to the rapidity of the ships progress was the way in which she passed fastsailing schooners and overhauled the steamers  at this time nearly all the swell had ceased and the monster ship was rushing over what to her were the mimic waves and leaving less wake upon the waters than is caused in the thames by a gravesend boat the only peculiarity about her progress was the three distinct lines of frothy water which the screw and paddles made and which stretching out in the clear moonlight like a broad highway seemed as if the great eastern had fulfilled her purpose and really bridged the sea  for a considerable part of the way the paddles were working easily at from nine to ten and the screw at from thirtytwo to thirtyfour revolutions per minute  it will give most readers a better idea of the tremendous nature of the size and speed of the engines which worked so easily when it is said that at ten revolutions the paddlewheels dashed through the water at something like 1600 feet per minute and the screw revolved at 2500  when accomplishing this the consumption of fuel was at the rate of 250 tons a day for both engines the indicated power being above 5000 horsesabout 2000 horses for the paddles and a little over 3500 for the screw  in order to secure her going at full speed however under such circumstances the great ship should have been down by the stern at least eighteen inches more than she really was for not less than a foot of the screwblades was out of the water and the slip or loss of power was of course very great  off the coast of cornwall the swell caused her to roll very considerably as long as she was abeam of the long swell  soon after this a small brig was seen right under the starboard bow  as usual with these small coasters she was showing no light and keeping no lookout and but for the anxious vigilance exercised on board the big ship the brig would have been under the waves in two minutes more  her escape was narrow enough and nothing short of the instant stoppage of the engines and actually reversing the screw saved her from swift destruction  she drifted from under the starboard paddle within twenty yardsquite close enough to enable captain harrison to speak to her master and to express a very strong opinion on his style of navigation and conduct generally  towards the close of the trip all the fore and aft sails were set  the look of her vast spread of canvas and the extraordinary effect it produced as one stood at the wheelhouse and gazed beneath the long vista of brown sails stretched to the very utmost and sending off the wind with the sustained roar of a volcano was something almost indescribable  no mere description could convey a fair idea of the curious effect of the long unbroken avenue of masts sails and funnelslike a whole street of steamships if such a term is fairly applicable  the rate of going throughout the whole trip was very satisfactory allowing for the want of trim on the part of the vessel and consequent absence of immersion in both screw and paddles it was calculated from this data by all the nautical authorities on board that in proper condition the vessel might be depended on for eighteen miles an hour throughout a long voyage and under steam alone  that in a strong and favourable breeze she would at times accomplish eighteen knots or more than twentyone miles an hour there was no reason to doubt  among other tests to which the great eastern was subjected was the terrible storm of the 25th and 26th october of that year 1859 in which the royal charter went down  she lay at anchor in the harbour of holyhead during that storm  so fierce was the gale that a large part of the breakwater was destroyed and several vessels went down inside the harbour while some were driven on shore  for one hour the big ship was as near destruction as she is ever likely to be  her salvation under god was due to the experience and energy of captain harrison and his officers  during the whole gale the captain was on the watch sounding the lead to see if she dragged and keeping the steam up to be in readiness to put to sea at a moments notice  the gale roared and whistled through the rigging with indescribable fury  the captain in trying to pass along the deck was thrown down and his waterproof coat was blown to ribbons  the cabin skylights were thrown open with a fearful crash the glass broken and deluges of rain and spray poured into the saloons  two anchors were down one seven tons the other three with eighty and sixty fathoms of chain respectively but the ground was known to be bad and the leeshore rocky while the waves came curling and writhing into harbour straining the cables to the utmost and dashing against the rocks like avalanches of snow  the dash of these billows on the breakwater was like the roar of artillery  all this time the red light at the end of the breakwater shone out cheerily in the midst of a turmoil of spray  at last masses of the timberwork and solid masonry gave way  the gale rose to its fiercest and one huge billow came rolling in it towered high above the breakwater it fell and the red light was seen no more  the danger was now imminent  the cables could evidently bear no more and the gale was increasing so the screw was set going but the wreck of timber from the breakwater fouled it and brought it to a deadlock  then the wind veered round more to the northeast sending a tremendous swell into the harbour and the great eastern began to roll heavily  in this extremity the paddle engines were set going and the ship was brought up to her anchors one of which was raised for the purpose of being dropped in a better position  at this moment the cable of the other anchor parted and the great ship drifted swiftly toward what seemed certain destruction but the heavy anchor was let go and the engines turned on full speed  she swung round head to wind and was brought up  this was the turningpoint  the gale slowly abated and the great eastern was saved while all round her the shores and harbour were strewn with wrecks  after the gale the great eastern started on her return trip to southampton which she reached in safety on the morning of the 3rd november  in this as in her previous experiences the mighty ship was well tested and her good and bad points in some degree proved  at the very outset the steam gear for aiding in lifting the anchors broke down and one of the anchors refusing to let go was broken in half  the condenser of the paddle engines seems to have been proved too small in this trip  for some time she went against a stiff headwind and sea which is now well known to be the great ships fortewith perfect steadiness but on getting into the channel she rolled slowly but decidedly as if bowingacknowledging majestically the might of the atlantics genuine swell  here too a wave actually overtopped her towering hull and sent a mass of green water inboard  but her roll was peculiarly her own and wonderfully easy  the vessel made eighteen knots an hour  she was under perfect command even in narrow and intricate channels and despite her varied mishaps and trials passed through this stormy period of her infancy with credit  disaster to great eastern in september 1861having made three successful voyages to america the great eastern after all her troubles was beginning to establish her reputation to confirm the hopes of her friends and silence the cavils of her enemies when the bad fortune that has been her portion from the cradle once more overwhelmed her and shook if it did not altogether destroy the confidence in her capabilities which the public had been beginning tardily to entertain  there is nothing more difficult to ascertain than the true state of the casewith reference to culpability accidental circumstance inherent or incidental weakness negligence unavoidable risks etceterain such a disaster as that which happened to the great ship in september of 1861  and nothing could be more unfair than to pass judgment on her without a full knowledge of the minute particulars and moreover a pretty fair capacity to understand such details and their various relations  before proceeding with the narrative of the event referred to we may remark that while on the one hand it may be argued with great plausibility that her numerous disasters and misfortunes prove that she is unfitted for the navigation of the sea it may on the other hand be argued with equal plausibility that the very fact of her having come through such appalling trials unconquered though buffeted is strong presumptive evidence that she is eminently fitted for her work and that under ordinary circumstances and proper management she would do it well  it is believed that any other vessel afloat would have been sunk had she been exposed to the same storm under similar circumstances  it must be borne in mind that although other vessels weathered the same storm successfully they did not do so with their rudder and rudderposts gone their captains and part of their crews new to them and their chain cables cabin furniture and other material left as totally unsecured as if she had been a river steamer about to start on a few hours trip  on tuesday the 10th of september the great eastern left liverpool for america with 400 passengers and a large though not a full general cargo  between 100 and 200 of the passengers occupied the berths in the principal cabins the remainder of them occupied the intermediate and steerage cabins  all went on prosperously until the thursday when as the ship was in full steam and sail she encountered a terrific gale about 280 miles to the west of cape clear and in spite of the best seamanship she failed to ride over the storm which with tremendous fury swept away both her paddles  simultaneously the top of the rudderpost a bar of iron ten inches in diameter was suddenly wrenched off and her steering gear being also carried away she broached to and lay like a huge log in the trough of the sea  from thursday evening until two oclock on sunday her bulwarks almost touching the water she rolled about like a disabled hulk the passengers and crew expecting that she would every moment go down  the working and rolling of the vessel at one instant of dread displaced and destroyed all the furniture of the cabin and saloons and broke it to pieces throwing the passengers pellmell about the cabin everything that occupied the upper deck was washed away and a large part of the passengers luggage was destroyed  between twenty and thirty of those who were on board including several ladies had limbs and ribs fractured with numerous cuts and bruises  one of the cowsheds with two cows in it was washed into the ladies cabin together with other things on board and caused indescribable consternation and confusion  on sunday evening after two days of terrible suspense a temporary steering gear was fitted up and the disabled vessel with her distressed crew made for cork harbour steaming with her screw at nine knots an hour  her flag of distress was sighted at about three oclock in the afternoon of tuesday off the old head of kinsale and hm ship advice at once steamed out to her assistance and towed her to within a mile of the lighthouse off cork harbour by about nine oclock  such is a general outline of this disasterone which is rendered all the more remarkable from the circumstance that the vessel had only been recently surveyed by the officers of the marine department of the board of trade when new decks and other requirements were carried out and completed at a cost of 15000 pounds  the scene during the storm in the grand saloon as described in detail by various passengers was absolutely terrific  none of the furniture had been secured and when the gale became violent and the rolling of the vessel increased sideboards tables chairs stools crockery sofas and passengers were hurled with fearful violence from side to side in a promiscuous heap  when it is said that at each roll the top platform of the paddleboxes dipped into the sea anyone who has seen the towering sides of the great eastern may form some conception of the angle of the decks and the riot of unfastened articles that continued below during the greater part of the gale  the destruction was universal  the largest mirror in the grand saloon which was about twelve feet high was smashed to pieces by a gentleman going head foremost into it  although much bruised and cut strange to say he was not seriously injured  the chandeliers fell from the ceiling and the crashes they made in falling added to the general din  one of the other mirrors was smashed by a large stove  some of the passengers escaping from the diningroom were dashed against the iron balconies which gave way with the pressure and falling on the glass flooring at the sides dashed it to atoms  the noise and turmoil of destruction below together with the howling of the tempest above and the dashing of spray over the decks whence it flowed in copious streams down into the cabins formed a scene which cannot be fully conceived except by those who witnessed it  on deck the confusion was equally great and destructive  many of the boats were carried away  the great chain cables rolled from side to side until they were actually polished bright by the friction while they were a source of perpetual danger to the crew in the performance of their duties  the oiltanks broke loose and after tumbling about for a time fell down through the upper hatchway  and the two cows that fell with their cowshed down into the ladies cabin were killed by the violence of the shock  the chief cook was flung against one of the paddleboxes and having put out his hand to save himself had his wrist sprained  he was then flung towards the other side and coming against a stanchion in the way had his leg fractured in three places  one lady had a rib fractured another her shoulder dislocated another her wrist these are only specimens selected to show what the poor people were subjected to  it is said that there were twentytwo fractures altogether among passengers and crew besides innumerable cuts and bruises  the cabins were flooded to the depth of several feet and broken articles of furniture floated about everywhere  the luggage in the luggageroom which had not been secured was hurled about until trunks boxes valises etcetera striking against each other and against the sides of the compartment were utterly destroyedthe very leather of the trunks being torn into small shreds  throughout all this terrible scene the passengers behaved with one or two exceptions admirably  the ladies especially displayed great courageremaining in accordance with the desires intimated to them in their cabins while the gentlemen did their best to keep order  on the friday they appointed a sort of committee or police force of upwards of twenty strong who took the duty in turns of going round the vessel keeping order carrying information to and reassuring the ladies and children  four only of these who were called directors had the privilege of speaking to the captain during the stormthus saving him from the annoyance of repeated and ceaseless questioning  the crew also did their duty nobly  captain walker acted throughout with calmness courage and good judgment and from the tenor of resolutions passed at an indignation meeting held by the passengers after their return into port it would appear that they entirely exonerated him from any blame in reference to the disaster  the fitting up of temporary steering gear which was begun on the sunday when the storm moderated was a work of great difficulty and danger  it was accomplished chiefly through the courage and cleverness of two menjohn carroll and patrick grantwho volunteered for it and were let down over the stern at the imminent risk of their lives and an american gentleman mr towle a civil engineer rendered great assistance in superintending and directing the work  it was not until two oclock on sunday morning that the vessel got up steam in her screw boilers and steered for cork harbour  the whole of the ironwork of both paddlewheels was carried entirely away  the ladder leading up to the larboard paddlebox was twisted in an extraordinary manner  the boats on the starboard side were all gone and those on the other side were hanging loosely from their fastenings altogether the great ship presented a most melancholy spectacle as she was towed into port  at the meeting of the passengers already referred to the first resolution was expressive of their grateful acknowledgments to almighty god for his kind care in protecting them during the storm and bringing them in safety out of their danger  the second condemned the directors and stated that the great eastern was sent to sea thoroughly unprepared to face the storms which everyone must expect to meet with in crossing the atlantic and that if it had not been for the extraordinary strength of the hull and the skill which was manifested in the construction of the vessel and its engines in all human probability every soul on board would have perished  it has been said that if the ship had been more deeply laden she would have weathered the gale more easily  this if true is an argument in her favour  but in viewing the whole circumstances of this and previous disasters we cannot avoid being deeply impressed with the fact that the great eastern had not up to that time had fair play  in her construction and general arrangements there have been some grave and numerous more or less trivial errors  from first to last there has been a good deal of gross mismanagement but the great eastern cannot with justice be pronounced a failure  latterly she has done good service in laying ocean telegraphcables a species of work for which she is preeminently well adapted  it is possible that she may yet live to ride out many a wild atlantic storm and perchance become the first of a race of ponderous giants who shall yet walk the deepto the utter confusion of timid croakers and to the immense advantage of the world    chapter fifteen  curious craft of many lands  many men many minds runs the proverb  many nations many ships is almost equally true  a nation may show its individuality in the fashion of its marine architecture as much as in any other direction as for instance in its national dress dwellinghouses food amusements and an ethnologist in studying a peoples characteristics may do wisely not to overlook its ships and boats  even in europe where an advanced civilisation may be supposed to be slowly smoothing off national characteristics and peculiarities and gradually blending and amalgamating diverse national customs there still exists a considerable disparity in the marine architecture of different states while between the ships of europe and those of some parts of asia the gulf is certainly broad enough so that about the only point of resemblance between an english ironclad and a chinese junk is that both are manifestly better adapted for the sea than the land  we now propose describing some of the more curious craft peculiar to various nations beginning with europe  the dutch galliot is a somewhat peculiar craft to the eye of an englishman heavy and clumsylooking beyond doubt but a good seaboat notwithstanding  the galliot looks much the same whether you regard her from stem or from stern both being almost equally rounded  keel she has scarce any her floors are flat hull broad and deep and rudder very wide  hung on each side is a large leeboard to keep her from making too much leeway  her hull is varnished a bright yellow colour and shines in the sun  her bulwarks are lofty and a wooden house is placed aft where the captain and his family live and which is always kept brightly painted  this part of the ship is a remarkably snug place comfortably furnished and kept with the characteristic dutch cleanliness and neatness  forward is the caboose of the crew a wide low but roomy erection  the galliot is rigged with square sails on her mainmast a fore and aft mainsail a gaff mizzen and mizzen gaff topsails and a high bowsprit her sails are sometimes white sometimes tanned  if the reader has ever chanced to enter the port of rotterdam he will have encountered plenty of examples of the craft we are describing and if he did not altogether approve or admire their shape he must at least have been struck by their remarkable cleanness and brightness  a dutch galliot may be fifty eighty or even a hundred and fifty tons burden  when the dutch build vessels of a larger size than this they do so on very similar lines to english merchantmen though usually somewhat broader and bluffer  off the coast of portugal we meet with many different kinds of craft of which the trading schooners differ from almost any other kind of vessel broad in the beam and short in the counter some are rounded at the stem some nearly square  they are decked and are from forty to one hundred tons burden  they are peculiarly rigged having only lower masts stepped at different angles  the gaffs of the foresail as well as the mainsail can be raised to different heights  they have fore staysail jib and flying jib gaff topsails and a large square sail and square topsails  on the whole they are ungainlylooking craft in the extreme but they are very capable seaboats and make voyages as far as south america  mr whg kingston gives a graphic description of a portuguese craft which it has never been our fortune to see  he calls it the lisbon beanpod from its exact resemblance to that vegetable and affirms it to be the most curious of european craft which we can readily believe take a wellgrown beanpod he says and put it on its convex edge and then put two little sticks one in the centre and one at the bows raking forward for the masts and another in the bows steeving up for the bowsprit and another astern for a boomkin or outrigger and then you have before you the boat in question  these boats carry a lateen sail sail very fast and are much used on the waters of the tagus as fishingboats and trawlers  other curious craft to be met with in europe are the scamparia and felucca of the mediterranean the greek mystico and the trabacalo of the adriatic  the gondola than which perhaps nothing that floats on the waters is suggestive of more romantic and poetical associations is so familiar to everybody from pictures and has so often been introduced into story song and narratives of travel that we shall not pause to describe it  passing from europe to africa we note among the craft peculiar to that country the diabiah or nile boat a very comfortable travelling boat for warm climates  it is a large boat and contains a house at one end in which the passengers sleep at night or take refuge from the suns fierce heat by day  in asia a great variety of vessels and boats of various shapes and sizes are met with to describe all of which would carry us far beyond the space at our disposal  the dhow of the arabs runs from sixty to a hundred tons is almost entirely open and has a sharp pointed bow projecting for a considerable distance beyond the hull  on the high broad stern a coveredin poop is placed containing the quarters of the captain and passengers  the stern is usually ornamented with carving as english vessels used to be in old days  the dhow carries but one sail lateenshaped and the mast stoops forward at a sharp angle these craft have not unfrequently been engaged in the nefarious slave traffic carried on on the east coast of africa  the catamaran of madras can only be called a boat on the lucus a non lucendo principle for it consists simply of three logs placed side by side pointed at the bows and kept together by two crosspieces  yet this rude raft does good service in its way being the only means of communication in rough weather between vessels lying off madras and the shore for there are no wharves at madras and ships are compelled to anchor in the offing  when the sea runs so high that boats of the ordinary kind are useless the services of the catamarans are gladly enough made use of  the native boatmen seated on their log rafts and quite naked make their way through the roughest surf to the vessels carrying messages to and from the land  the rower propels his boat with a rather long paddle  sometimes he is washed off his catamaran into the sea but being an expert swimmer he usually recovers his seat without much trouble and it rarely happens that any of these men are drowned  we spoke a little space back of the national characteristics of a people being traceable in its marine architecture as well as in other things and surely this statement finds abundant illustration in the craft of the chinese  in china we find an intensely conservative people and their national bent is undoubtedly indicated in their ships which in all probability have not altered in any material regard for centuries a chinaman would be as slow to change the shape of his junk as his shoes or the length of his pigtail  and a strange oldworld semibarbarous look a chinese junk has  chinese junks vary greatly in size but all present the same type of architecture  the sails in every case are of brownishyellow matting swung across the mast like a mainsail and having pieces of bamboo placed crosswise and parallel to each other making them look somewhat like venetian blinds  these wooden strips both strengthen the sail and facilitate its reefing when lowered  a large chinese junk rises high out of the water there are two or more decks aft above the maindeck painted and carved with various devices and the cabins are often luxuriously furnished according to celestial tastes  if you look at any representation of a junk you will notice that the rudder is very broad resembling somewhat the rudder of a canal barge  in spite of its primitive look it has after all something picturesque about it but we fancy that we would rather contemplate it in a picture than sail in one across the atlantic  on the deck of a junk is always to be found a josshouse or temple in front of which the crew keep incense sticks and perfumed paper continually burning  when a calm overtakes an english vessel the sailors and passengers are always supposed to try what whistling for a wind will effect  in lieu of this method of raising the wind a chinese sailor shapes little junks out of paper and sets them afloat on the water as a propitiatory service to the divinity who has the welfare of seamen under his especial care  the riverlife of china is very curious  quite a large proportion of the people spend their whole lives on the water while many who are employed during the day on land sleep in boats on the various rivers this condition of things corresponds in some degree to that described by captain marryat in that fine old story jacob faithful in the early chapters of which we get diverting glimpses of life on board a thames lighterman  but the river population of china is still more absolutely aquatic in manner of life than the thames bargefolk  the boats in which this class of the population live have an awning of bamboo and matting fore and aft which is removed by day and raised at night  at sundown the boatpeople anchor their craft in rows to stakes thus forming boatterraces as it were  when business grows slack at one part of the river the master of the boat moves up or down stream to some other part  from the shape of these boats resembling somewhat the half of an egg cut lengthwise they are called in the chinese language eggboats  a large family will sometimes pack itself into an eggboat not much more than twelve feet long and six broad  these riverfolk have characteristics which almost render them a people apart  they have a code of laws of their own differing in many points from that which governs the land community and the two populations do not intermarry  women to a large extent navigate the eggboats as indeed they do many other kinds of boats in china  travellers report that these riverfamilies live peaceable and happy enough lives seldom disturbed by disputes of any kind  possibly one cause for this may be that which some humourist suggested as the reason why birds in their little nests agree namely because it would be dangerous if they fell out  but speaking seriously it says much for the placable nature of these chinese riverfolk that they can pass such a happy existence within the narrow bounds of their eggboats  passing over to america we shall first describe the famous american and canadian river steamboats which are in many respects as curious and unique as they are generally magnificent  these steamers are usually paddleboats are very long and narrow in shape but of great strength on the hull a sort of lofty platform is built which is divided into what may be called the middle and the main deck one above the other fore and aft there is a spacious luxuriously appointed and richly decorated saloon covered in with a glass roof  ranged on each side of the saloon are the cabins each containing two berths  these sleepingcabins like the saloon are prettily furnished and tastefully decorated  over the saloon is another deck or platform the whole structure as may be seen from our illustration is very much bedeckedabout the middle of the vessel and in front of the funnel here is situated the wheel and here also the captain and officers take their position  this part of the vessel is kept private to them no passenger being permitted to trespass on it  beneath the saloondeck is the middledeck as has already been indicated which also contains a saloon of its own as well as sleeping apartments  this portion of the steamer is usually reserved for the unmarried ladies among the passengers who as all readers of american literature must be aware are treated in america with an almost chivalrous courtesy and consideration  the diningsaloon of the vessel is situated in a third and undermost deck which reaches from the middle of the boat right aft and is a welllighted wellarranged room  the cargo is placed amidships heaped up in great pilespassenger boats seldom or never carrying heavy goods  the americans passion for economising time is manifest in the steamboats as everywhere else most of them carrying a barber who will accommodate you with easy shaving during the voyage  the barbers shop is forward with the cooks quarters and other offices  american riverboats may vary of course in details but we have endeavoured to indicate the leading characteristics of a typical example  the stories current in regard to the facility with which an american steamboat blows up have been much exaggerated but nevertheless it is probably true that they bear the bell in this direction of risk and danger    of all craft of the canoe order the flyingproa of the pacific is the swiftest  it carries a sail almost triangular in shape and a straight yard  it has an outrigger and outrigger mast and yard are of bamboo strong matting composes the sail which is stretched very flat upon the yard  when the crew wish to put their boat about they have merely to shift the sail when what was before the prow of the proa becomes the stern  these boats are usually manned by a crew of about halfadozen one man sits at either end of the vessel and takes his turn of steering according to whatever tack the canoe is on  the duty of the rest is to bail out the boat and to keep the sail properly trimmed  nothing afloat probably can go so close to the wind as the flyingproa while its speed is astonishing  the malays use the proa but theirs is a broader heavier and less swift boat than that used by the ladrone islanders of the pacific which is that which we have just described  the canoes of the fijians are superior to those in use among any other of the south sea islanders  their chief feature is that they are twincanoes joined together by crossbeams which support a platform of from twelve to fifteen feet broad  of the two canoes one is smaller than the other and the smaller serves by way of an outrigger  these canoes are sometimes one hundred feet long their depth being usually about seven feet  sometimes a small cabin is built upon the platform the mast is about thirty feet long is supported by guys and is furnished with a yard carrying a large sail  there are small hatchways at both ends of the craft at each of which one of the crew sits ready to bail out the boat  the fijian canoes can also be propelled by means of sculling the sculler using a broadbladed scull about ten feet in length  a large canoe can be got through the water at the rate of two or three miles an hour by sculling  various experiments have from time to time been made in the way of building boats and ships with double hulls the object being to obtain increased stability and thus reduce to a minimum the rolling and pitching of ordinary vessels  the steamship castalia was an ambitious attempt in this direction  she was built for the passenger service between england and france  but she did not realise the expectations formed of her  most persons who have crossed from dover to calais or vice versa by the calaisdouvre mail packet will bear witness both to the comfort and speed of that vessel  up to this she has proved the most perfect form of steamship yet constructed for the purpose required  the calaisdouvre is built somewhat upon the same principle as the castalia but differs from that vessel in that whereas the latter was two halfships joined together each twinportion of the calaisdouvre is a perfect ship in itself  the result has been that while the castalia was a failure the calaisdouvre has proved a distinct success  she is three hundred feet in length and sixty feet in breadth her tonnage is two thousand and her waterdraught only six feet so that she can enter calais harbour at even a low tide  two transverse iron girder bulkheads unite the two hulls of the vessel and her steering apparatus is so simple and at the same time so effective in construction that one wheel is usually sufficient to work it  she makes the passage from dover to calais usually in an hour and a half but in very fine weather we ourselves have crossed in less than that time  with the maximum rate of speed the calaisdouvre has attained the minimum amount of pitching and rolling yet secured by any channel boat  her saloons cabins and decks are spacious and handsomely appointed so that the channel passage in this vessel is made under as favourable conditions for bad sailors as any seapassage can be
