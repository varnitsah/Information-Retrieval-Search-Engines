50905950	chasing the sun by rm ballantyne   our hero fred temple has risen to be a senior manager in the great liverpool business founded by his father  but he was getting overworked and deeply tired so one day he announced that he was taking leave for a while and was going to visit norway in a small yacht  ballantyne had several holidays in norway so to write about it and describe it was a pleasure to him  this book is therefore an account of norway seen through the eyes of an enthusiast for that country  fred takes some friends with him  together they have great adventures and great fun  they even venture so far north as lapland and the land of the midnight sun  a wonderful piece of vintage victoriana at its best   chasing the sun by rm ballantyne    chapter one  preparations for the chase  fred temple was a tall handsome young fellow of about fiveandtwenty  he had a romantic spirit a quiet gentlemanly manner a pleasant smile and a passionate desire for violent exercise  to look at him you would have supposed that he was rather a lazy man for all his motions were slow and deliberate  he was never in a hurry and looked as if it would take a great deal to excite him  but those who knew fred temple well used to say that there was a great deal more in him than appeared at first sight  sometimes a sudden flush of the brow or a gleam of his eyes told of hidden fires within  fred when a small boy was extremely fond of daring and dangerous expeditions  he had risked his life hundreds of times on treetops and precipices for birds nests and had fought more handtohand battles than any of the old greek or roman heroes  after he became a man he risked his life more than once in saving the lives of others and it was a notable fact that many of the antagonists of his boyhood became at last his most intimate friends  fred temple was fair and ruddy  at about the age of nineteen certain parts of his goodlooking face became covered with a substance resembling flosssilk  at twentyfive this substance had changed into a pair of light whiskers and a lighter moustache  by means of that barbarous custom called shaving he kept his chin smooth  freds father was a wealthy liverpool merchant  at the period when our tale opens fred himself had become chief manager of the business people began about this time to say that the business could not get on without him  there were a great number of hands both men and women employed by temple and son and there was not one on the establishment male or female who did not say and believe that mr frederick was the best master not only in liverpool but in the whole world  he did not by any means overdose the people with attentions but he had a hearty offhand way of addressing them that was very attractive  he was a firm ruler  no skulker had a chance of escape from his sharp eye but on the other hand no hardworking servant was overlooked  one day it was rumoured in the works that mr frederick was going to take a long holiday  since his appointment to the chief charge fred had taken few holidays and had worked so hard that he began to have a careworn aspect so the people said they were glad to hear it no one in the works deserved a long holiday better than he  but the people were not a little puzzled when bob bowie the office porter told them that their young master was going away for three months to chase the sun  chase the sun bob what dye mean said one  i dont know wot i mean i can only tell ye wot i say answered bowie bluntly  bob bowie was an old salta retired seamanwho had sailed long as steward of one of the ships belonging to the house of temple and son and in consequence of gallantry in saving the life of a comrade had been pensioned off and placed in an easy post about the office with good pay  he was called old bob because he looked old and was weatherworn but he was stout and hale and still fit for active service  come bowie cried another how dye know hes goin to chase the sun  cause i heerd him say so replied bob  was he in earnest inquired a third  in coorse he wos said bob  then its my opinion replied the other that old mr templell have to chase his son and clap him in a straitjacket wen he catches himif he talks such stuff  the porter could not understand a joke and did not like one so he turned on his heel and leaving his friends to laugh at their comrades jest proceeded to the countingroom  there were two countingroomsa small outer and a large inner one  in the outer room sat a tall middleaged man lanky and worn in appearance and with a red nose  opposite to him at the same desk sat a small fat boy with a round red face and no chin to speak of  the man was writing busilythe boy was drawing a caricature of the man also busily  passing these bob bowie entered the inner office where a dozen clerks were all busily employed or pretending to be so  going straight onward like a homewardbound ship keeping his eyes right ahead bob was stranded at last in front of a green door at which he knocked and was answered with a hearty come in  the porter went in and found fred temple seated at a table which was covered with books and papers  oh  i sent for you bowie to say that i want you to go with me to norway tomorrow morning  to norway sir said bowie in surprise  ay surely youre not growing timid in your old age bob  it is but a short voyage of two or three days  my little schooner is a good seaboat and a firstrate sailor  why as for bein timid said the porter rubbing the end of his nose which was coppercoloured and knotty i dont think i ever knowed that there feelin but it does take a feller aback to be told all of a suddent after hes reglarly laid up in port to get ready to trip anchor in twelve hours and bear away over the north seanot that i cares a brass fardin for that fishpond blow high blow low but its raither suddent dye see and my rig aint just seaworthy  bowie glanced uneasily at his garments which were a cross between those of a railwayguard and a policeman  never mind the rig bob cried fred laughing  do you get ready to start with all the underclothing you have by six tomorrow morning we shall go to hull by rail and i will see to it that your topsails are made all right  wery good sir  youve not forgotten how to make lobscouse or plumduff i dare say  bobs eyes brightened as he replied stoutly by no manner o means  then be off and remember sharp six  ay ay sir cried the old seaman in a nautical tone that he had not used for many years and the very sound of which stirred his heart with old memories  he was about to retire but paused at the threshold of the green door  beg parding sir but if i might make so bold as to ax  go on bob said fred encouragingly  i heerd ye say to our cashier sir that you wos goin for to chase the sun  wot sort of a chase may that be sir  ha  bowie thats a curious chase but not a wild goose one as i hope to show you in a month or two  you know of course that in the regions of the earth north of the arctic circle the sun shines by night as well as by day for several weeks in summer  in coorse i do answered bob every seaman knows that or ought for to know it and that its dark all day as well as all night in winter for some weeks just to make up for it so to speak  well bob i am very desirous to see this wonderful sight with my own eyes but i fear i am almost too late of setting out  the season is so far advanced that the sun is setting farther and farther north every night and if the winds baffle us i wont be able to catch him sitting up all night but if the winds serve and we have plenty of them we may yet be in time to see him draw an unbroken circle in the sky  you see it will be a regular chase for the sun travels north at a rapid pace dyou understand  bob bowie grinned nodded his head significantly retired and shut the door  fred temple left alone seized a quill and scribbled off two notes one to a friend in scotland the other to a friend in wales  the note to scotland ran as follows  my dear granti have made up my mind to go to norway for three months  principal object to chase the sun  secondary objects health and amusement  will you go  you will find my schooner comfortable my society charming if you make yourself agreeable and no end of salmonfishing and scenery  reply by return of post  i go to hull tomorrow and will be there a week  this will give you ample time to get ready  ever thine fred temple  the note to wales was addressed to sam sorrel and was written in somewhat similar terms but sam being a painter by profession the beauty of the scenery was enlarged on and held out as an inducement  both of freds friends had been prepared some time before for this proposal and both of them at once agreed to assist him in chasing the sun  that night frederick temple dreamed that the sun smiled on him in a peculiarly sweet manner he dreamed still further that it beckoned him to follow it to the far north whereupon fred was suddenly transformed into a gigantic locomotive engine the sun all at once became a green dragon with pink eyes and a blue tail and he set off in chase of it into the arctic regions with a noise like a long roar of the loudest thunder    chapter two  the storm and the first adventure  a storm raged on the bosom of the north sea  the wind whistled as if all the spirits of ocean were warring with each other furiously  the waves writhed and tossed on the surface as if in agony  white foam greenishgrey water and leadencoloured sky were all that met the eyes of the men who stood on the deck of a little schooner that rose and sank and staggered helplessly before the tempest  truly it was a grand sighta terrible sightto behold that little craft battling with the storm  it suggested the idea of gods might and forbearanceof mans daring and helplessness  the schooner was named the snowflake  it seemed indeed little heavier than a flake of snow or a scrap of foam in the grasp of that angry sea  on her deck stood five men  four were holding on to the weathershrouds the fifth stood at the helm  there was only a narrow rag of the topsail and the jib shown to the wind and even this small amount of canvas caused the schooner to lie over so much that it seemed a wonder she did not upset  fred temple was one of the men who held on to the weatherrigging two of the others were his friends grant and sam sorrel  the fourth was one of the crew and the man at the helm was the captain for although fred understood a good deal of seamanship he did not choose to take on his own shoulders the responsibility of navigating the yacht  he employed for that purpose a regular seaman whom he styled captain and never interfered with him except to tell him where he wished to go  captain mcnab was a big tough rawboned man of the orkney islands  he was born at sea had lived all his life at sea and meant so he said to die at sea  he was a grim hardfeatured old fellow with a face that had been so long battered by storms that it looked more like the figurehead of a southsea whaler than the countenance of a living man he seldom smiled and when he did he smiled grimly never laughed and never spoke when he could avoid it  he was wonderfully slow both in speech and in action but he was a firstrate and fearless seaman in whom the owner of the schooner had perfect confidence  as we have fallen into a descriptive vein it may be as well to describe the rest of our friends offhand  norman grant was a sturdy highlander about the same size as his friend temple but a great contrast to him for while temple was fair and ruddy grant was dark with hair beard whiskers and moustache bushy and black as night  grant was a highlander in heart as well as in name for he wore a glengarry bonnet and a kilt and did not seem at all ashamed of exposing to view his brown hairy knees  he was a hearty fellow with a rich deeptoned voice and a pair of eyes so black and glittering that they seemed to pierce right through you and come out at your back when he looked at you  temple on the contrary was clad in grey tweed from head to foot wideawake included and looked as he was a thorough englishman  grant was a doctor by profession by taste a naturalist  he loved to shoot and stuff birds of every shape and size and hue and to collect and squeeze flat plants of every form and name  his rooms at home were filled with strange specimens of birds beasts fishes and plants from every part of scotland england and irelandto the disgust of his old nurse whose duty it was to dust them and to the delight of his little brother whose selfimposed duty it was to pull out their tails and pick out their eyes  grants trip to norway promised a rich harvest in a new field so he went there with romantic anticipations  sam sorrel was like neither of his companions  he was a little fellow a mere spider of a man and extremely thin so thin that it seemed as if his skin had been drawn over the bones in a hurry and the flesh forgotten  the captain once said to bob bowie in a moment of confidence that mr sorrel was a mere spunk whereupon bob nodded his head and added that he was no better than half a fathom of pump water  if there was little of sam however that little was good stuff  it has been said that he was a painter by profession  certainly there was not a more enthusiastic artist in the kingdom  sam was a strange mixture of earnestness enthusiasm and fun  although as thin as a walkingstick and almost as flat as a pancake he was tough like wire could walk any distance could leap farther than anybody and could swim like a cork his features were sharp prominent and exceedingly handsome  his eyes were large dark and expressive and were surmounted by delicate eyebrows which moved about continually with every changeful feeling that filled his breast  when excited his glance was magnificent and the natural wildness of his whole aspect was increased by the luxuriance of his brown hair which hung in long elflocks over his shoulders  among his intimates he was known by the name of mad sam sorrel  when we have said that the crew of the schooner consisted of six picked men besides those described and our friend bob bowie we have enumerated all the human beings who stood within the bulwarks of that trim little yacht on that stormy summers day  there was however one other being on board that deserves notice  it was sam sorrels dog  like its master this dog was a curious creature  it was little and thin and without form of any distinct or positive kind  if we could suppose that this dog had been permitted to make itself and that it had begun with the skyeterrier suddenly changed its mind and attempted to come the poodle then midway in this effort had got itself very much dishevelled and become so entangled that it was too late to do anything better than finish off with a wild attempt at a longeared spaniel one could understand how such a creature as titian had come into existence  sam had meant to pay a tribute of respect to the great painter when he named his dog titian  but having done his duty in this matter he found it convenient to shorten the name into titsometimes tittles  tittles had no face whatever as far as could be seen by the naked eye  his whole misshapen body was covered with long shaggy hair of a light grey colour  only the end of his black nose was visible in front and the extreme point of his tail in rear  but for these two landmarks it would have been utterly impossible to tell which end of the dog was which  somehow the end of his tail had been singed or skinned or burned for it was quite naked and not much thicker than a pipestem  tittles was extremely sensitive in regard to this and could not bear to have his miserable projection touched  how that storm did rage to be sure  the whole sea was lashed into a boiling sheet of foam and the schooner lay over so much that it was impossible for the men to stand on the deck  at times it seemed as if she were thrown on her beamends but the good yacht was buoyant as a cork and she rose again from every fresh blast like an unconquerable warrior  it seems to me that the masts will be torn out of her said temple to the captain as he grasped the brass rail that surrounded the quarterdeck and gazed upward with some anxiety  no fear o her said the captain turning the quid of tobacco in his cheek shes a tight boat an could stand a heavier sea than this  i hope itll blow a wee thing harder  harder exclaimed fred  you must be fond of wind captain observed grant with a laugh  oo ay ive no objection to wund  the captain said this as he said everything else more than half through his nose and very slowly  but do you not think that more wind would be apt to carry away our topmasts or split the sails said temple  its not unlikely was the captains cool reply  then why wish for it inquired the other in surprise  because were only thirty miles from the coast of norway and if the wund holds on as its doin well not make the land till dark  but if it blows harder well get under the shelter of the islands in daylight  dark exclaimed poor sam sorrel who being a bad sailor was very sick and clung to the lee bulwarks with a look of helpless misery i thought there was no dark in nor  the unhappy painter stopped abruptly in consequence of a sensation in the pit of his stomach  theres not much darkness in norway in summer answered mcnab but at the south end of it here theres a littlespecially when the weather is thick  ay i see its comin  the peculiar way in which the captain said this caused the others to turn their eyes to windward where it was very evident that something was coming for the sky was black as ink and the sea under it was ruffled with cold white foam  stand by the clewlines and halyards roared the captain  the men who were now all assembled on deck sprang to obey  as they did so a squall came hissing down on the weatherquarter and burst upon the vessel with such fury that for a moment she reeled under the shock like a drunken man while the spray deluged her decks and the wind shrieked through the rigging  but this was too violent to last  it soon passed over and the gale blew more steadily driving the snowflake over the north sea like a seamew  that evening the mountains of norway rose to view  about the time that this occurred the sky began to clear towards the northwest and soon after a white line of foam was seen on the horizon right ahead  this was the ocean beating on the great army of islands or skerries that line the west coast of norway from north to south  hurrah for old norway shouted fred temple with delight when he first observed the foam that leaped upon these bare rocky islets  it seems to me that we shall be wrecked said grant gravely  i do not see an opening in these tremendous breakers and if we cant get through them even a landsman could tell that we shall be dashed to pieces  why not put about the ship and sail away from them suggested sorrel looking round with a face so yellow and miserable that even the captain was almost forced to smile  because that is simply impossible said fred temple  poor sam groaned and looked down at his dog which sat trembling on the deck between his feet gazing up in its masters face sadlyat least so it is to be supposed but the face of tittles as well as the expression thereof was invisible owing to hair  is there an opening captain inquired fred in a low serious tone  oo ay no fear o that replied the captain  there was indeed no fear of that for as the schooner approached the islands numerous openings were observed  it also became evident that the gentlemen had mistaken the distance from the broken water for they were much longer of reaching the outer skerries than they had expected and the foam which at first appeared like a white line soon grew into immense masses which thundered on these weatherworn rocks with a deep loud continuous roar and burst upwards in great spouts like white steam many yards into the air  captain are the islands as numerous everywhere along the coast as they are here said fred  deed ay an more answered the captain some places yell sail for fifty or sixty miles after getting among the skerries before reachin the main  they were now within a hundred yards of the islands towards a narrow channel between two of which the captain steered  every one was silent for there was something awful in the aspect of the great dark waves of the raging sea as they rolled heavily forward and fell with crash after crash in terrific fury on the rocks dashing themselves to pieces and churning the water into foam so that the whole sea resembled milk  to those who were unaccustomed to the coast it seemed as if the schooner were leaping forward to certain destruction but they knew that a sure hand was at the helm and thought not of the danger but the sublimity of the scene  stand by the weatherbraces cried mcnab  the schooner leaped as he spoke into the turmoil of roaring spray  in ten seconds she was through the passage and there was a sudden and almost total cessation of heaving motion  the line of islands formed a perfect breakwater and not a wave was formed even by the roaring gale bigger than those we find on such occasions in an ordinary harbour  as isle after isle was passed the sea became more and more smooth and although the surface was torn up and covered with foam no great rollers heaved the vessel about  the tight little craft still bent over to the blast but she cut through perfectly flat water now  a delightful feeling of having come to the end of a rough voyage filled the hearts of all on board  sam sorrel raised his head and began to look less yellow and more cheerful  tittles began to wag the stump of his miserable tail and in short every one began to look and to feel happy  thus did the snowflake approach the coast of norway  now it is by no means an uncommon occurrence in this world that a calm should follow close on the heels of a storm  soon after the snowflake had entered the islands the storm began to abate as if it felt that there was no chance of overwhelming the little yacht now  that night and the greater part of the following day a dead calm prevailed and the schooner lay among the islands with her sails flapping idly from the yards  a little after midnight all on board were asleep save the man at the helm and captain mcnab who seemed to be capable of existing without sleep for any length of time when occasion required  the schooner now lay in a latitude so far north that the light of the sun never quite left the sky in clear weather  a sweet soft twilight rested on the rocky islands and on the sea and no sound disturbed the stillness except the creaking of the yards or the cries of seamews  yes by the way there was another sound  it proceeded from the cabin where our three friends lay sleeping on the sofas  the sound was that of snoring and it issued from the wideopen mouth of sam sorrel who lay sprawling on his back with tittles coiled up at his feet  it is probable that sam would have snored on for hours but for a piece of carelessness on his part  just before going to rest he had placed a tin can of water close to his head in such a way that it was balanced on the edge of a shelf  a slight roll of the schooner caused by the entrance of a wave through an opening in the islands toppled this can over and emptied its contents on the sleepers face  he leaped up with a roar of course  tittles jumped up with a yelp while grant and temple turned round with a growl at having been awakened and went off to sleep again  but sleep was driven away from the eyes of sam sorrel  he made one or two efforts to woo it back in vain so in despair he jumped up put his sketchbook in his pocket seized a doublebarrelled fowlingpiece and went on deck followed by tittles  the little boat was floating under the quarter and a great mountainous island lay close off the starboard bow  getting into the boat sam rowed to the island and was soon clambering up the heights with the activity of a squirrel  sam paused now and then to gaze with admiration on the magnificent scene that lay spread out far below him the innumerable islands the calm water bathed in the soft light of early morning and the schooner floating just under his feet like a little speck or a seagull on the calm sea  pulling out his book and pencil he sat down on a rock and began to draw  suddenly the artist was startled by the sound of a heavy pair of wings overhead  thousands of seagulls flew above him filling the air with their wild cries but sam did not think it possible that they could cause the sound which he had heard  while he was still in doubt an enormous eagle sailed majestically past him  it evidently had not seen him and he sat quite still scarce daring to draw his breath  in a moment the gigantic bird sailed round the edge of a precipitous cliff and was gone  sam at once rose and hurried forward with his gun  he was much excited for eagles are very difficult to approachthey are so shy and wary few men who go to norway ever get the chance of a shot at the king of birds  judge then of the state of sam sorrels mind when on turning a corner of rock he suddenly beheld the eagle standing on the edge of a great precipice about a hundred yards in advance of him  but his hopes were much cast down when he observed that between him and the eagle there was a space of open ground so that he could not creep farther forward without being seen  how was he to advance  what was he to do  such a chance might not occur again during the whole voyage  no time was to be lost so he resolved to make a rush forward and get as near as possible before the bird should take to flight  no sooner thought than done  he rushed down the mountainside like a madman  the eagle sprang up in alarm just as he reached the side of a rounded rock  halting suddenly he took aim and fired both barrels the eagle gave a toss of its head and a twirl of its tail and sailing slowly away round a neighbouring cliff disappeared from view  a deep groan burst from the poor artist as he exclaimed oh dear ive missed it  but sam was wrong  he had not missed it  on climbing to the other side of the cliff he found the eagle stretched on the ground in a dying state  its noblelooking eye scowled for a moment on him as he came up then the head drooped forward and the bird died  it measured six feet four inches from tip to tip of its expanded wings and was as magnificent a specimen of the golden eagle as one could wish to see  with a triumphant step sam carried it down to the yacht where he found his comrades still sound asleep so he quietly fastened the eagle up over grants bed with the wings expanded and the hooked beak close to the sleepers nose  the day that followed this event continued calm but towards evening a light breeze sprang up and before midnight the snowflake cast anchor in the harbour of bergen    chapter three  bergentalking supping and sleeping under difficulties  the city of bergen is a famous and a strange old place  in ancient days it was a stronghold of the vikingsthose notorious seawarriors who were little better than pirates and who issued from among the dark mountains of norway in their great uncouth galleys and swept across the seas landing on the coasts everywhere to the terror of surrounding nations  they were a bold fearless set the norse vikings of old  they voyaged far and wide in open boats round the coasts of europe and across the stormy sea long before the mariners compass was invented and they discovered iceland and america long before christopher columbus was born  they had free spirits these fierce norwegians of old and there was much good as well as evil in them  they had good and wise laws when nearly all the rest of the world was lawless and many of the laws and customs which prevailed among them a thousand years ago exist at the present day  the bold vikings were great colonisers among other parts of the world they overran and settled in a large portion of great britain and much of their bloodmore than many people are aware of flows in our own veins  but i am wandering from my subject  let me return to it by repeating that bergen this ancient stronghold of the vikings is a famous and a strange old place  it is built at the foot of a steep mountainrange which is so close to the margin of the sea that the city has barely room to stand  one might fancy that the houses were crowding and jostling each other and squeezing themselves together in order to avoid on the one hand being pushed up the mountainside and on the other hand being thrust into the sea  some of the smaller cottages and a few villas seem to have been beaten in this struggle for standingroom for they appear to have been obliged to clamber up the mountainside and perch themselves on spots where there does not seem to be standingroom for a goat  from such elevated positions they look down complacently on their crowded brethren  the houses near the sea have not fared so well  they are built in the water on piles and are all of them warehouses with projections in front from which hang blocks and hoisting tackle  these projections resemble heads the piles look like legs and it does not require a very strong effort of imagination to believe that the warehouses are great living creatures which have waded into the sea and are looking earnestly down into the water to observe how the fish are getting on  the houses are all built of wood all are painted white and all have redtiled roofs  they are peaked and gableended to an extraordinary degree so that the general aspect of the city is confused and irregularall the more interesting and picturesque on this account  a thought strikes me here and when a thought strikes one i think we ought always to pay that thought the compliment of jotting it down  it is thisregularity in small details is pleasing regularity on a grand scale is disagreeable  for instance a chair with one leg turned another square and a third ornamentally carved would be a disagreeable object  the two front legs at least must be regular and the two back legs regular  a chair is a small matter  but proceed to a grander subjecta city  if every house is similar to its neighbours if every street is parallel to the rest the effect is bad regularity here is disagreeable  this is a deep subject requiring much study and philosophical inquiry  if i were to go farther into it our friend fred temples adventures would have to be cast overboard  i will therefore cut it short with the remark that the subject is well worthy the attention of even deeperthinking men than are ever likely to read this book  when the three friends temple grant and sorrel found themselves in the quaint old city of bergen their first thought was supper their second thought bed  now this may seem to some minds a dreadfully low and contemptible state of things  what a romantic reader may exclaim they had arrived in that celebrated city from which in days of old the stalwart vikings used to issue on their daring voyages in which the descendants of these grand fellows still dwell and in which are interesting memorials of the past and quaint evidences of the present  did your heroes temple sorrel and grant think of supper and of bed when their feet for the first time trod the soil of old norway  even so  romantic reader i am bound to tell you that romance is all very well in its way but it has no power whatever over an empty stomach or an exhausted brain  when our three friends landed in bergen it was past midnight  their admiration of the scenery had induced them to neglect supper and to defy sleep so that when they landed they felt more than half inclined to fall upon their boatman and eat him up alive and then to fall down on the stone pier and go off to sleep at once  in this frame of mind and body they entered the house of madame sontoom and called for supper  madame sontoom was the owner of a private hotel  moreover she was the owner of a plump body and a warm heart  consequently she at once became a mother to all who were fortunate enough to dwell under her roof  her hotel was by no means like to a hotel in this country  it was more like a private residence  there were no hired waiters  her amiable daughters waited and they did not look upon you as a customer or conduct themselves like servants  no they treated you as a visitor and conducted themselves with the agreeable familiarity of friends  of course they presented their bill when you were about to leave them but in all other respects the idea of a hotel was banished from the mind  supper cried temple on entering the house  ya ya yes yes in cheerful tones from two of madame sontooms daughters  then followed a violent conversation in the norse language in which there was much that was puzzling and more that was amusing for the norwegian ladies were talkative and inquisitive  fred temple had studied the norse language for three months before setting out on this voyage and being a good linguist he understood a good deal of what was said and could make his own wants known pretty well  grant had studied the language also but not for so long a time and being an indifferent linguist he made little headway in conversation  as to sam sorrel he had no talent for languages  he hated every language but his mothertongue had not studied norse at all and did not intend to do so  it may be supposed therefore that he was dumb  far from it  he had picked up a few phrases by ear and was so fond of making use of these and of twisting them into all shapes and out of all shape that he really appeared to be a great talker of norse although in reality he could scarcely talk at all  supper consisted of coffee rolls eggs gamleost old cheese lobster and smoked salmon  the viands were good the appetites were also good so the supper went off admirably  ver so goot said one of the young ladies handing mr sorrel a plate of smoked salmon  tak tak thanks thanks said our artist accepting the salmon and beginning to devour it  i say what dye mean by ver so goot  youre never done saying it what does it mean  the fair waitress laughed and bowed politely as much as to say i dont understand english  can you explain it fred said sam  well yes i can give you a sort of explanation replied fred but it is not an easy sentence to translate  ver so goot another claw of that lobster please  thanksver so goot is an expression that seems to me capable of extension and distension  it is a comfortable jovial rollicking expression if i may say so  i cannot think of a better way of conveying an idea of its meaning than saying that it is a compound of the phrases be so good by your leave good luck to you go it ye cripples and thats your sort  the first of these be so good is the literal translation  the others are more or less mixed up with it  you may rely on it sam that when a norwegian offers you anything and says ver so goot he means you well and hopes that you will make yourself comfortable  you dont say so fred ill adopt the phrase from this hour  accordingly sam sorrel did adopt it and used it on all and every occasion without any regard to its appropriateness  little was said at supper  the whole party were too tired to converse  now for bed cried sam rising  i say fred whats the norse for a bed  seng replied fred  seng what a remarkable name  now then my good girl ver so goot will you show me my seng  good night comrades im off toha ha what a musical ideato seng  more probably to snore observed grant  oh grant said sam looking back and shaking his head give up jesting  its bad for your health fie for shame good night  norwegian beds are wooden boxes of about three feet wide and five and a half long  i have never been able to discover why it is that norwegians love to make their beds as uncomfortable as possible  yet so it is  grant had a room to himself  temple and our artist were shown into a doublebedded room  is that a bed said sam pointing to a redpainted wooden box in a corner why its too short even for me and you know im not a giant  oh then what must it be for me groaned fred temple  on close examination it was found that each bed was too short for any man above five feet two and further that there was a featherbed below and a featherbed above instead of blankets  thus they lay that night between two featherbeds which made them so hot that it was impossible to sleep at first  sorrel being short managed to lie diagonally across his box but fred being long was compelled to double himself up like a footrule  however fatigue at last caused them to slumber in spite of all difficulties  in the morning they were visited by a ghost    chapter four  a ghost and a customa fishmarket and a norse lover  there was no night in bergen at this time  at the midnight hour there was light enough to see to read the smallest print and at an early hour in the morning this sweet twilight brightened into dawn  this being the case fred temple was not a little surprised to see a ghost make its appearance about six oclockfor ghosts are famous for their hatred of broad daylight  nevertheless there it was in the form of a woman  what else could it be but a ghost for no woman would dare to enter his bedroom so he thought without knocking at the door  the ghost had in her hand a tray with a cup of coffee on it  fred watched her motions with intense curiosity and kept perfectly still pretending to be asleep  she went straight to the box in which sam sorrel slept and going down on her knees looked earnestly into his face  as our artists mouth happened to be wideopen it may be said that she looked down his throat  presently she spoke to him in a soft whisperwill de have caffe  will you have coffee  a loud snore was the reply  again she spoke somewhat louder vill de have caffe  a snort was the reply  once more in a tone which would not be denied  vill de have caffe  eh hallo what dear me yesahthank youver so goot replied sam as he awoke and gazed in wild surprise at the ghost who was none other than the female domestic servant of the house who had brought the visitors a cup of coffee before breakfast  sams exclamations were wild at first and he stared like a maniac but as consciousness returned he understood his position and being naturally a modest man he hastily drew on his nightcap and gathered the bedding round his shoulders  accepting the coffee he drank it and the girl crossed the room to pay similar attentions to fred temple  this presentation of a cup of coffee in bed before breakfast is a custom in norway and a very pleasant custom it is too especially when it breaks upon you unexpectedly for the first time  now for the fishmarket sam cried fred leaping out of bed when the girl had left the room  who cares for the fishmarket said sam testily as he turned round in his bed and prepared to slumber  i care for it retorted fred and so do you old boy only you are lazy this morning  come get up  i have resolved to spend only one day in this queer old city so you must not let drowsiness rob you of your opportunities of seeing it  the fishmarket you know is famous come get up  temple enforced his advice by seizing his companion by the ankles and hauling him out of bed  sam grumbled but submitted and in a short time they were ready to start  hallo  grant cried fred as they passed his door will you come with us to ramble over the town  no said grant in a deep bass voice  why  because i wont  a most excellent reason one much in use in this world replied temple laughing  by the way will you remember to order two sheep to be killed for our voyage north  yes in a sulky tone from grant  now mind i trust this to you  go away and dont bother  thus dismissed temple and sorrel went out and sauntered towards the fishmarket  now fishmarkets are famous all the world over for noise riot and confusion  the fishmarket of bergen is no exception to the rule but there is this peculiarity about it that the sellers of fish are all men and the buyers all women moreover the noise is all on the side of the buyers  the scene of the market is the pier alongside of which the fishermens boats are ranged and here the fish are sold direct from the boats by the men to all the servantgirls of the town who assemble each morning to purchase the days dinner  the men standing in the boats are considerably below the level of the pier so that they have to look up at the girls who look down at them with eager anxious faces  the men sure that their fish will be sold in the longrun are quiet sedate silent  the women anxious to get good bargains and impatient to get home bend forward shouting screaming and flourishing arms fists and umbrellas  every one carries an umbrella in bergen for that city is said to be the rainiest in the world  of gay colours are these umbrellas too  pink and skyblue are not uncommon  there is a stout iron rail round the pier which prevents the eager females from tumbling headlong into the boats over this they lean and bargain  fierce were the pretty blue eyes of these norse females and flushed were their fair faces and tremendous was the flourishing of their umbrellas and the shaking of their fists at the time when temple and sorrel approached  the fishermen were used to it they only smiled or paid no attention whatever to the noise  and what was all the noise about  you shall hear  look at yonder flaxenhaired prettyfaced stoutish little girl leaning so far over the iron rail that it seems her desire to tumble over it and plunge into the arms of a rough old fisherman who is gazing quietly up at her with a sarcastic smile  he has put up a lot of fish for which she has offered sex six skillings  a skilling is about equal to a halfpenny  he thinks this too little but he wont condescend to say so  he merely pays no attention to the girls violent entreaties  the language of the girl bears so strong a resemblance to our own that it scarcely requires translation  fiskman she cries vill du have otto skillings  will you have eight skillings  no the fiskman wont have that it is not enough so he makes no reply but pretends to be washing his boat  fiskman fiskman vill du have ni  will you have nine  still no reply  the fisherman turns his back on the market gazes out to sea and begins to whistle  at this the girl becomes furious  she whirls her umbrella in the air desperately  if that umbrella were only a foot longer the fiskmans head would certainly feel its weight  presently the girl forces herself to become calm and deeply earnest she has made up her mind to make a liberal offer  fiskman vill du have ti ten skillings  the fiskman who wears a red nightcap with a tall hat on the top of it takes off his headgear exposes his bald pate to view and wipes it with a fishy cotton handkerchief but he takes no notice whatever of the girl who now becomes madthat is to say she stamps glares shakes her pretty little fist at the hardhearted man and gasps  suddenly she becomes reckless and makes a wild offer of tolve twelve skillings  ha the mark is hit at last  the fiskman can hold out no longer without saying a word he turns quietly round and hands up the fish the girl without a word stoops down and pays for them and then goes off in triumph for her energy has been successful she has got the fish a little cheaper than she had expected  suppose twenty or thirty such scenes going on at once and you have a faint idea of the bergen fishmarket  it was just before the termination of the bargain which has been described that fred temple and sam sorrel arrived on the scene  the artist was busy with his sketchbook in one minute  sam said fred touching his friends arm look here sketch me yonder girl like a good fellow  which girl the one with the nose  if you see one without a nose retorted fred ill be glad to have a portrait of her too  nay but really i do see one with such a long red nose that  well well interrupted fred impatiently its not her  do look to where i am pointing see the stout pretty little woman who is talking so fiercely to that fisherman  oh i see exclaimed sam who began to take her portrait without delay  meanwhile fred was observant  at first he was much amused by the scene before him and continued to gaze with interest at one group after another  in a short time his curiosity was awakened by a handsome norwegian youth whose gaze was fixed with intense earnestness on the maiden whom sam was sketching  when the girl had concluded her bargain and gone away he observed that the youth who appeared to be a fisherman from his dress went after her  without well knowing what he did and without any very definite intentions fred temple followed them and left his friend busy with his pencil  the norwegian youth soon overtook the girl who at once received him with a bright smile and held out her hand  the two then went on together turned to the left and followed a winding road which led up the side of the mountain  they appeared to converse earnestly as they went  fred still followed them but in a few minutes they paused in front of a small white house with a green door so he was now compelled to pass them  as he did so it suddenly occurred to his mind that he was acting a mean contemptible part in following them thus  he blushed as he thought of this and passed quickly forward intending to deny his curiosity and take a ramble  he could not help observing however that the girl was weeping and that the youth did not look happy by any means  having gained the brow of an eminence which overlooked the city fred sat down behind a rock to admire the beautiful scenery and to ponder what he had seen  while he was thus engaged he heard the voices of two men who approached on the other side of the rock and did not observe him  they talked loud in the norse language  fred understood enough of it to make out their meaning pretty well  i tell you what it is hans said one give her up  you have no chance of gaining the required sum for many years and its a hard case to keep a poor girl waiting  give her up man and dont go on like a silly lovesick boy  give her up cried he who was called hansgive her up  ah my friend ole i did not expect such counsel from thee  but i tell thee flatly i will not give her up  she loves me i love her  sweet raneilda nothing but death shall separate us  a very pretty sentiment retorted old but pray what do you mean to do  i have decided that replied hans i will fish all winter in the deep sea and all summer i will  well what will you  alas  i know not  would that i were a pilot but i am not  but you know the coast as well as any pilot said 016  true but who would trust mean unknown boy replied hans sadly  there was silence for a few minutes then ole said how much money do you require to pay for your fathers farm and set yourself up  two hundred dollars the dollar is equal to about 4 shillings and 6 pence sterling answered hans  a goodly sum said ole despondingly  no no hans give her up boy give her up  it is the advice of an oldish man and a true friend  it is the advice of an ass retorted hans fiercely  go my true friendwhen i want your advice i will ask it  the youth flung off from his friend and came suddenly on fred temple who rose and saluted him  this is a splendid city of yours hans said he  you know my name and you speak norse exclaimed the youth in surprise  i know your name hans because i heard your friend mention it and i can speak a little norse because i have studied it  i have come to stay in old norway for a few months and would like to get a little information about it from some one  are you a busy man just now  no not very busy said hans with a disconcerted look  then could you call on me this afternoon  i live in madame sontooms house  i will come said hans whose face beamed with goodhumour  good i shall expect you  farewell  farvel replied hans  fred sauntered down the hill that morning with a very peculiar smile on his countenance  there was something quite sly about his aspect and more than once his companions caught him chuckling at breakfast in a way that surprised them much for fred temple was not given to secrets or to act in an outrageous manner without any apparent reason  but fred had his own peculiar thoughts that morning and they tickled him to such an extent that more than once he burst into a fit of laughter  come fred youre meditating something  out with it said grant it is selfish to keep all your good thoughts to yourself  not yet not yet replied fred with a mysterious look  you shall know before our excursion comes to an end  further conversation was interrupted by the entrance of hans ericsson who was impatient to get employment of any kind in order to earn a few dollars and lay them up with a view to the future  fred took him aside and said in a low tonehans are you very anxious to wed raneilda  the young norsemans face flushed and he started as if he had received a blow  dont be angry hans continued fred i ask the question because i think i can help you in the matter if you will allow me  i do not ask it out of idle curiosity  come tell me your troubles like a good fellow and ill put you in the way of getting out of them  hans was inclined to repel freds kind intentions at first but the englishmans open honest manner won upon him so much that he related to him all his sorrows  he was the son of eric who dwelt in a valley at the head of the nord fiord  his father was too old to manage his farm and hans wished to take it up and work it on his own account  but in order to do so he must buy up the shares of the other members of his family  this would require 500 dollars  he had worked hard for two years to make this sum but there was still 200 dollars to pay  he could make this in the course of time but he had been engaged to raneilda long and he wished now to make her his wife  in short he was tired of waiting  so then you would be glad to get some sort of work with good pay said fred  ya said hans with a nod of his head  can you pilot a schooner from this to the nord fiord  ya i know every island on the coast  good then be ready to start this evening  i shall send my vessel there in your charge and i myself with my friends will travel overland and meet you there  farewell  hans went off to tell raneilda his handsome face beaming with joy  now said fred returning to his friends i have made arrangements with a pilot to take the snowflake round to the nord fiord and we will travel overland to the same place and meet it  the journey will be a very charming one of several days through wild magnificent scenery by the way grant did you order the two sheep to be killed and sent aboard immediately  of course i did  have i not always proved myself a trustworthy messenger  i told the man in my best norse to have two kos killed without delay  two what exclaimed fred with a look of alarm  two kos returned grant did you not tell me that ko is the norse word for a sheep  why as i live you have ordered two cows to be killed  quick come with me to the butchers  the two friends rushed out of the house and reached the shop of the man of meat just in time fortunately to arrest the fatal blow  the order was of course countermanded and they were thus saved the necessity of setting up a butchers shop in bergen to get rid of their superabundant beef  that night the snowflake set sail for the far north and next morning our three adventurers were galloping through the wilds of norway    chapter five  cariole travellingmiserable lodging and poor farenative peculiaritiesa night battle  as i am now about to drag my reader through the wild interior of norway let me try to describe it  dont be alarmed dear reader i do not mean to be tedious on this point but i candidly confess that i am puzzled as to how i should begin  norway is such a jumble of natures elements perhaps a jumbled description may answer the purpose better than any other  here it is then  mountains and crags and gorges and rocks and serried ridges towering peaks and dark ravines lakes and fords and glens and valleys pinewoods and glaciers for a full description of glaciers see fast in the ice page 86 volume 3 of this miscellany streamlets rivulets rivers cascades waterfalls and cataracts  add to thisin summersweltering heat in the valleys and everlasting snow and ice on the mountaintops with sunlight all night as well as all dayand the description of norway is complete  no arrangement of these materials is necessary  conceive them arranged as you will and no matter how wild your fancy your conception will be a pretty fair idea of norway  toes these elements into some chamber of your brain shake them well updont be timid about itthen look at the result and you will behold norway  having said thus much it is unnecessary to say more  rugged grandeur is the main feature of norway  on a lovely summers evening not long after the departure of the snowflake from bergen our three travellers found themselves trotting through a wild glen on each side of which rose a range of rugged mountains and down the centre of which roared a small river  the glen was so steep and the bed of the torrent so broken that there was not a spot of clear water in its whole course  from the end of the lake out of which it flowed to the head of the fiord or firth into which it ran the river was one boiling roaring mass of milkwhite foam  fred temple and his friends travelled in the ordinary vehicle of the country which is called a cariole  the norwegian cariole holds only one person and the driver or attendant sits on a narrow board above the axletree  of course it follows that each traveller in norway must have a cariole and a pony to himself  these are hired very cheaply however  you can travel post there at the rate of about twopence a mile  our friends had three carioles among them three ponies and three drivers or shooscarles this word is spelt as it should be pronounced besides a small native cart to carry the luggage  their drive that day and indeed every day since starting had been emphatically up hill and down dale  it was therefore impossible to cross such a country in the ordinary jogtrot manner  when not ascending a steep hill they were necessarily descending one for the level parts of the land are few and far between  in order therefore to get on at all it was needful to descend the hills at a slapping pace so as to make up for time lost in ascending them  there was something delightfully wild in this mode of progressing which gladdened the hearts of our travellers each of whom had a strong dash of recklessness in his composition  there was a little danger too connected with it which made it all the more attractive  frequently the roads were narrow and they wound along the top of precipices over which a false step might easily have hurled them  at the foot of many of the roads too there were sharp turns and it was a matter of intense delight to sam sorrel to try how fast he could gallop down and take the turn without upsetting  the norwegian ponies are usually small and creamcoloured with black manes and tails or white manes and tails always from some incomprehensible reason with manes and tails different in colour from their bodies  they are hardy active animals and they seem to take positive pleasure in the rattling neckornothing scamper that succeeds each toilsome ascent  the shooscarle is usually the owner of the pony  he may be a man or a boy but whether man or boy he almost invariably wears a red worsted nightcap  he also wears coarse homespun trousers immensely too long in the body and a waistcoat monstrously too short  he will hold the reins and drive if you choose but most travellers prefer to drive themselves  during the journey fred temple usually led the way  norman grant being a careless easygoing drowsy fellow not to be trusted was placed in the middle and sam sorrel brought up the rear  sams duty was to prevent straggling and pick up stray articles or baggage  on the day of which i write the three friends had travelled far and were very sleepy  it was near midnight when they came to a steep and broken part of the road which ran alongside of the foaming river already mentioned and turning at a sharp angle crossed it by means of a rude wooden bridge  notwithstanding the lateness of the hour the sky was almost as bright as at noon  mind yourself here shouted fred looking back at grant who was almost asleep  hallo oh all right cried grant gathering up the reins and attempting to drive  fortunately for him norwegian ponies need no driving  they are trained to look after themselves  fred went down the hill at a canter  grant followed at a spanking trot and both of them reached the bridge and made the turn in safety  sam sorrel was some distance behind  both he and his shooscarle were sitting boltupright more than halfasleep with the reins hanging loose on the ponys back  the first thing that awakened sam was the feeling of going down hill like a locomotive engine  rousing himself he seized the reins and tried to check the pony  this only confused it and made it run the cariole so near to the edge of the river that they were almost upset into it  when sam became fully aware of his position he opened his eyes pursed his lips and prepared for squalls  not being a practised driver he did not make sufficient allowance for a large stone which had fallen from the cliffs and lay on the road  he saw what was coming and gathered himself up for a smash but the tough little cariole took it as an irish hunter takes a stone wall  there was a tremendous crash sams teeth came together with a snap and the shooscarle uttered a roar no wonder poor fellow for his seat being over the axle and having no spring to it the shock which he received must have been absolutely shocking  however they got over that without damage and the river was crossed by all three in safety  the next hill they came to was a still worse one  when they were halfway down the leader came to a sudden halt grants cariole almost ran over it sam and the luggagecart pulled up just in time and so from front to rear they were jammed up into the smallest space they could occupy  hallo whats wrong shouted grant  oh nothing only a trace or something broken replied fred  mend it in a minute  it was mended in a minute and away they went again on their reckless course over hill and dale  the mending of the trace was a simple affair  the harness of each pony consisted of nothing more than the reins a wooden collar and a wooden saddle  the shafts were fastened to the collar by means of an iron pin and this pin was secured in its place by a green withe or birchbough twisted in a peculiar manner so as to resemble a piece of rope  this was the only part of the harness that could break so that when an accident of the kind occurred the driver had only to step into the woods and cut a new one  it is a roughandready style of thing but well suited to the rough country and the simple people of norway  fred being anxious to see as much as possible had compelled his guide to turn out of the usual highroad the consequence of which was that he soon got into difficulties for although each shooscarle knew the district through which they were passing they could not quite understand to what part of the country this peculiar englishman was going  this is not surprising for the peculiar englishman was not quite sure of that point himself  on this particular night they seemed to have got quite lost among the hills  at every stage of ten or twelve english miles they changed horses and drivers  the drivers on this particular stage were more stupid than usual or fred temple was not so bright  be that as it may about midnight they arrived at a gloomy savage place lying deep among the hills with two or three wooden huts so poorlooking and so dirty that a wellbred dog would have objected to go into them  fred pulled up when he came to this place and grants pony pulled up when his nose touched the back of freds cart  grant himself and his man were sound asleep  in a few seconds sam joined them  there was a brilliant rosy light on the mountaintops but this came down in a subdued form to the travellers in the valley  the place scarcely deserved the name of a valley  it was more of a gorge  the mountains rose up like broken walls on each side until they seemed to pierce the sky  if you could fancy that a thunderbolt had split the mountain from top to bottom and scattered great masses of rock all over the gorge thus formed you would have an idea of the soft of place in which our belated travellers found themselves  yet even here there were little patches of cultivated ground behind rocks and in outoftheway corners where the poor inhabitants cultivated a little barley and grass for their cattle  it was a lovely calm night  had you been there reader you would have said it was day not night  there was no sound to break the deep stillness of all around except the murmur of many cataracts of melted snowwater that poured down the mountainsides like threads of silver or streams of milk  but the rush of these was so mellowed by distance that the noise was soft and agreeable  i say grant this will never do said fred gravely  i suppose not returned grant with a yawn  what say you samshall we go on  i think so  they can have nothing to give us in such miserable huts as these except grod barleymeal porridge and sour milk and dirty beds  perhaps not even so much as that said fred turning to his driver how far is it my man to the next station  ten miles sir  hum shall we go on comrades  go on forward cried grant and sorrel  so on they went as before over hill and dale for ten miles which poor sam who was very sleepy but could not sleep in the cariole declared were much more like twenty miles than ten  the sun was up and the birds were twittering when they reached the next station  but what was their dismay when they found that it was poorer and more miserable than the last  it lay in a wilder gorge and seemed a much more suitable residence for wolves and bears than for human beings  indeed it was evident that the savage creatures referred to did favour that region with their presence for the skin of a wolf and the skull of a bear were found hanging on the walls of the first hut the travellers entered  the people in this hamlet were extremely poor and uncommonly stupid living as they did in an unfrequented district they seldom or never saw travellers and when fred asked for something to eat the reply he got at first was a stare of astonishment  we must hunt up things for ourselves i see cried sam sorrel beginning to search through the hut for victuals  seeing this the people assisted him but all that they could produce was a box of barley meat and two large flat dishes of sour milk  this sour milk is a favourite dish with the norwegians  during summer the cattle are sent to the pastures high up in the mountains in order to spare the small quantity of grass grown in the valleys which is made into hay and stored for winter use  these mountain pastures are called saeters and the milk required by each family for daily use is carried down from the saeter by the girls  the milk is put into round flat tubs varying from one to two feet in diameter and four or five inches deep  it is then allowed to stand not only until it is sour but until it is thick throughout like curd with a thick coat of cream on the top in this form it is eaten with a spoon and a very pleasant sight it is to behold three or four sturdy herdsmen and perchance one or two boys squatting round one of these large dishes and supping away to their hearts content  grant seized the first dish of milk he discovered and at once sat down on a stool and began to devour it  hold on let us start fair cried sam sorrel catching up a spoon and sitting down opposite his comrade on another stool  the hut was built of rough logs and the only furniture in it was of the rudest description a couple of boxbeds two or three stools and a bench a gailypainted chest in one corner and a misshapen table was all that it contained  there was a very small door at one side a particularly small window at the other and a raised stone fireplace at one end  well while you two are stuffing yourselves with sour milk ill go and search for better fare said fred with a laugh as he left the hut  good luck go with you cried grant a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush  now then old boy he continued turning to the owner of the hut could your goodwife make us a little porridge i say sam whats the norse for porridge  grod grod is pronounced groot i believe said sam who was still busy with the sour milk  ah yes grod thats it said grant turning again to the old man grod grod get us some grod grod groddye understand  ya ya answered the man  it would have been very strange if he had not understood for though grant addressed him in english the word grod bawled so frequently into his ear was sufficiently comprehensible  a fire was quickly kindled by the goodwife a pleasantlooking elderly woman and the black familypot was soon smoking  the old man was smoking too in less than five minutes for grant in the fulness of his heart gave him a pipe and a lump of tobacco  this man was a fine specimen of a hale old norseman  he wore a complete suit of brown homespunexcepting the jacket which hung on a rusty nail in the wall  kneebreeches and worsted stockings showed that even in declining years he had a good pair of legs  his grey hair hung in long straight locks over his shoulders and on his head was the invariable red nightcap  the only weakness for finery displayed by this old hero was in the matter of buttons and braces  the buttons were polished brass of enormous size and the braces were red  these were displayed to great advantage in consequence of a space of full four inches intervening between the bottom of his vest and the waistband of his breeches  while the grod was being made fred temple put up his fishingrod and rambled away in search of a stream  he had not to go far  in about five minutes he found one that looked tempting  at the very first cast a large fish rose so greedily that it leaped quite out of the water and missed the fly  the next cast the fish caught the fly and fred caught the fish  it was a splendid yellow trout of about a pound weight  in quarter of an hour fred had three such trout in the pockets of his shootingcoat in half an hour more the three fish were consigned by the three friends to the region of digestion  and now the question of bed had to be considered  grant settled it as far as he was concerned by throwing himself down on a pile of brushwood that lay in a corner pillowing his head on a threelegged stool and going off to sleep at once  fred and sam looked at the two beds  they were extremely dirty and it was evident that straw was the bedding  come travellers must not be particular cried fred as he tumbled into his box  i couldnt hold my eyes open five minutes longer to save my life muttered sam as he rolled over into the other  in a minute the three friends began to breathe heavily  two minutes more and they were snoring a trio in happy forgetfulness of all their toils  now it must be told that this pleasant state of things did not last long  fred temple and sam sorrel were not the only occupants of these beds  truth however disagreeable must be revealed  there were living creatures which not only slept in those beds but which dwelt there when perfectly wide awake and these creatures waged unceasing war with every human being that lay down beside them  in a very short time the sleepers found this out  fred began to grow restless and to groan  so did sam  in the course of an hour or so fred uttered a fierce exclamation and rose on his hands and knees  so did sam  then fred and sam began to fightnot with each other butwith the common enemy  the battle raged for more than an hour during which the foe although frequently routed returned again and again to the charge  their courage and determination were tremendous  it cannot be said that fred and sam were actually put to flight but a regard for truth compels me to state that they continued fleaing the greater part of that morning and it was not until the sun was high in the heavenspouring down a flood of light into that wild glenthat they gained the victory and lay down to repose on their laurels and strawnot to mention the bodies of the dead and dying  they hoped now to be rewarded for their exertions with a few hours repose  vain hope  scarcely had they closed their eyes when the door opened and an old woman with nose and chin of the nutcracker type entered the room  this was the grandmother of the family she had come to look at the strangers  grants face with the eyes shut and the mouth wideopen was the first object that met her view  she bent over him and looked into his mouth as if anxious to examine his teeth  having looked him over and felt the quality of his clothes with her shrivelled fingers she turned to the beds and stared at the other strangers  fred had gone off into a sort of doze so he bore the inspection well but sam was only pretending to sleep and when he peeped up at the old face that looked down on his with kindly interest and curiosity he found it difficult to check a smile  having looked at them well and touched everything belonging to them to see what it could be made of the old woman moved quietly towards the door  she shut it with a bang however and roused them up with a startexcepting grant who slept through everything and in spite of everything  they were just dropping off again when the old woman returned  she had forgotten something and was moving across the floor when she accidentally knocked over a bench which upset a heavy stool  the crash was followed by a scream of alarm and once more the sleepers were awakenedalways excepting grant  scarcely had this happened when a strange sound was heard outside  it gradually became louder and more alarming  what can it be cried fred leaping out of bed and rushing to the door  as he threw it open there was a roar like the sudden discharge of artillery and at the same moment a huge mass of rock many tons in weight bounded close past the door went crashing through a wooden shed as if it had been a sheet of paper and carrying shrubs and small trees along with it finally found a restingplace at the bottom of the glen the huge mass had fallen from the cliffs above and fortunately swept through the hamlet without doing further damage  it was followed by a shower of smaller stones some of which struck and shook the house and produced a commotion that caused even grant to wake up and run out in alarm  the whole valley was covered with rocks of every shape and size which had at various times fallen from the cliffs on either side and one could not look at them without wondering that the little cluster of huts had not long ago been destroyed  there are many such scenes in norway and accidents do sometimes occur but not so frequently as one might expect  it is needless to say that our travellers did not again court sleep in that wild spot  before another hour had passed they were over the mountains and far away on their journey to the far north    chapter six  deceptive appearancesperpetual dayperplexities about bedtime confusion of mind  the scene is changed  we are on board the snowflake and out once more among the thousands of islands off the coast far beyond the arctic circle now  this is the region where the sun does not set night or day for several weeks in summer and where he never rises night or day during several weeks in winter  but fred temple has not gained his point yet  he is behind time  had he arrived at this latitude a week sooner he would have seen the sun sweep an entire circle in the sky  but calms have delayed him and now the sun just dips below the horizon at midnight  a good stiff southerly breeze of a few hours would take him far enough north but he cannot command the winds to blow although bob bowie the steward evidently thinks he can make it blow by whistling  the sea is like a sheet of glass  meanwhile fred and his friends are enjoying all the delight of daylight which is perpetual  every thoughtful reader will at once perceive that where the sun only sets for a few minutes there can be no diminution of the light worth speaking ofnothing approaching even to twilight  the night before the arrival of the yacht at this place the sun set a little after midnight and in twenty minutes afterwards it rose again to pursue its brilliant course through the northern sky  it is scarcely possible for a christian to look on such a scene without recalling those striking passages in gods word which in describing heaven tell us that there shall be no night there and speaks of a sea of glass like unto crystal before the throne of god  well may the heart of man in such a scene exclaim with the psalmist o lord how manifold are thy works  in wisdom hast thou made them all the earth is full of thy riches  the islands in this particular place were positively uncountable  they lay scattered over the calm sea in hundreds  some were no bigger than a boatothers were towering jagged mountains of more than four thousand feet high  most of them were barren and over the smaller islets as well as round the cliffs of the larger ones myriads of gulls and other seabirds flew with clamorous cries  but for this the scene would have been one of deep solitude as well as intense calmness  the seabirds however filled the air with life ay and with melody for the plaintive cry of wildfowl when mellowed by distance is inexpressibly sweet and agreeable  one thing that puzzled our voyagers very much was the deceptive appearance of land so that they found it extremely difficult to judge correctly of distance  on one occasion when sailing towards one of the large islands fred went up to bob bowie who was leaning over the side watching the ripples caused by the snowflake and meditating as he himself said on things in ginral and nothin in particular  it may be remarked in passing that this was not an uncommon state of mind with bob bowie  well bob said temple were going along nicely with this breeze  i expect we shall pass that island before many hours go by  how far dye think its off sir inquired the steward  about three miles said fred  three miles sir wy its not more than one mileif its that  what say you captain asked fred  ye better try suggested mcnab with a quiet grin  so i will ho stand by to heave the log there  now captain steer straight as the crow flies for the island  the yachts course was altered the log was hove and observing the moment of starting they awaited the result  bob thought it was a smallish island with little bushes on it  the time they took in drawing near to it first led him to doubt the correctness of his own opinion but when the bushes began to turn into trees and the cliffs to tower into the sky above his head and throw a dark shadow over the vessel he was obliged to give in  the distance which he had imagined was not more than one mile turned out to be five  on another occasion a similar case of the deceptive appearance of distance occurred  they were sailing up a certain fiord which most of the people on board supposed was only about a mile broad  one of the sailors bill by name insisted that it could not be more than threequarters of a mile and thereupon an animated discussion amounting almost to a dispute began  but bill was not to be put down he was an old salt  he wasnt to be taken in by these molehills not he  he had sailed round the world according to his own account had been shipwrecked half a dozen times and drowned once or twice besides being murdered occasionally so he thought himself a weighty authority and entitled to great respect  well to settle this point the yacht was sailed straight across the fiord and the breadth measured by the log was found as in the former case to be about five miles  the calms although frequent in this latitude did not last long  light breezes sprang up now and then and for several days carried our travellers to the north  but not fast enough for the sun still kept ahead of them  during this period they saw great variety of wonderful scenery had several small adventures and enjoyed themselves extremely  fred temple usually began each calm day by jumping out of bed rushing upon deck and going over the side headforemost into the water  he was generally followed by sam sorrel but sam was inclined to be lazy and did not always follow his friends lead  grant never followed it  he was inveterately lazy in the morning although at all other times he was as active as a mountain goat  our highlander was particularly successful about this time with his gun the number of birds that he shot and stuffed was enormous  whenever a calm prevailed he took the light little norse boat that had been purchased at bergen and went off to the nearest island with his gun on these occasions he was usually accompanied by sam whose love for sketching was quite equal to that of his companion for birdshooting and stuffing  fred of course went to keep them company and was wont to carry with him a rod as well as a gun for he was passionately fond of fishing  on these occasions too they took hans ericsson with them to assist in rowing and to pilot them when they felt inclined to leave the yacht out of sight behind  one day they were out on an excursion of this kind and had rowed towards the mainland and up a fiord  fred and sam were reclining in the stern of the boat the former smoking a meerschaum pipe the latter making a drawing of a range of hills which were so rugged that the tops appeared like the teeth of a saw  grant and hans were rowing  do you know what oclock it was when we left the yacht inquired fred  what oclock echoed sam no well let me see  we went to bed last night at five oclock this morning  you mean that we turned in for our nights rest at five this morning i suppose said temple  my dear fred retorted sam never mind what i mean only attend to what i say  dont be too particular  its a bad habit being too particular  i once had a friend who was too particular in his attentions to a young lady and the result was that he was obliged to marry her  then sam returned temple i should say that the habit of being too particular is a good one if it leads to such a good thing as marriage but to return to the point what time of day or night do you think it is now  have not the least idea said sam i think its some time or other in the evening but this perpetual daylight confuses me  you know that when you and grant were away last week after the gulls i went to bed on thursday forenoon at ten oclock by mistake thinking it was ten at night  how i ever came to do it i cant tell but i suppose that i had sat so long stuffing that great eagle for grant that my brains had got obfuscated  it was cloudy too not unlike what it is just now so that i could not see the sun  whatever was the cause there is no doubt of the fact that i lost a day somehow and my ideas have got such a twist that i fear they will never recover it  a most unfortunate state of things truly said fred laughing perhaps youll recover when we return to low latitudes  if not there are plenty lunatic asylums  but we must not spend more than a few hours longer on this excursion for ive a notion that we are somewhere about saturday just now and you know its against our rules to run the risk of shooting or fishing into sunday  very true replied sam as he continued his sketch  i say grant do you happen to have your watch with you  not i cried grant from the bow of the boat  since day and night took to being the same i let it run down  i have no regard for time now  dye know what day it is  no  humph its lucky that we can depend upon the captain for keeping us right in regard to sunday  well lets go ashore and try the mouth of yonder stream  ill warrant me there are seatrout there perhaps salmon and the ground hereabouts seems a likely place for grouse and ptarmigan  pull hard hans thou son of eric and shove the boat into yonder creek  hans ericsson bent his strong back and a bright smile crossed his sunburnt face as the head of the boat flew round  hallo hans steady my lad cried grant giving his oar a pull that sent the head of the boat spinning round in the opposite direction then the sturdy norseman and the stalwart scot gave a pull together with all their might and sent the boat like an arrow into the creek where in a few seconds her keel grated on the shore  for several hours after that the three friends were busy with their favourite pursuits  grant soon bagged several brace of grouse  fred caught a basket of splendid seatrout some of which were over three pounds weight and a small salmon of about ten pounds while sam sorrel sat down on a rock and painted an elaborate picture of the scenery  of course their different occupations separated them from each other but hans kept close to freds elbowfor he had not only conceived a strong friendship for the young englishman but he was immensely delighted with flyfishing which he had never before witnessed  the astonishment of hans was great when he beheld heavy trout landed by means of a slender rod and an almost invisible line  but when fred hooked the salmon the excitement of the norseman knew no bounds  after nearly half an hours playing of the fish fred drew it close to the bank and told hans to strike the gaffhook into it and lift it out of the water  hans in his excitement missed his aim and the terrified fish darted away  but fred was prepared for this and let out line  soon he brought his fish once more to the side exhausted and rolling over  hans made a second attempt and was successful in landing the silvery salmon on the bank  when they returned to the schooner after that excursion captain mcnab was leaning over the side with a grim smile on his wooden countenance bob bowie was beside him with a beaming smile on his jolly red face  goodday captain cried fred as the boat drew near  well bowie were desperately hungry i hope youve got supper ready for us  ive got breakfast sir replied the steward  eh ah well call it what you like only let us have it soon  they clambered up the side why captain what day is it and what time of day  its friday mornin sir and eight oclock  fred opened his eyes in astonishment  why then comrades it seems that we have been shooting sketching and fishing all night by daylight and the sun has set and risen again without our being aware of the fact  so much for perpetual day and a cloudy sky  come bob bowie look alive with break ah supper i mean for whatever it may be to you it is supper to us  meanwhile ill have a bathe to refresh me  so our hardy adventurers bathed that morning over the side then they supped after which they turned in and slept all day and rose again at six oclock in the evening to breakfast    chapter seven  a sunday on shore  only once during their voyage along the rugged coast of norway did our three friends go to church  it must not be supposed however that therefore they were heathens  far from it  fred and his companions were truly christian men  that is to say they not only called themselves christians but they made it their earnest aim to walk after the example of christ and to exhibit their christianity by their deeds but only once during their trip had they the opportunity of visiting a church on a sunday forenoon when service was going on  it happened to be on a bright calm sunday  there was just enough of wind to urge the snowflake through the water at the rate of two miles an hour  freds usual custom was to get to a secure anchorage on saturdays so as to be able to spend the sabbath as a day of rest  but this was not always practicable because the water was so deep close inshore that no bottom could be found in many places and often they were obliged to continue their voyage on sunday  this however was a matter of small importance because the working of the yacht required so little attentionespecially in fine weatherthat it did not interfere with the services or the rest of the day  fred made a point of assembling the crew and reading the church of england service every sunday forenoon and a chapter or two from the bible in the evening  on the present occasion they were all assembled on the quarterdeck joining in the morning service  the breeze was steady and the steersman was the only man on duty but he was not thereby prevented from attending to what was being read  the vessel was gliding along close under a precipice which towered high above the mast and at a short distance ahead extended out in a bold promontory or headland elsewhere mountainous islands hemmed them in  when they reached the promontory fred was reading that beautiful psalm the 95thwhich appeared somewhat appropriate to the occasion  o come let us sing unto the lord let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation  let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and shew ourselves glad in him with psalms  for the lord is a great god and a great king above all gods  in his hand are all the corners of the earth and the strength of the hills is his also  the sea is his and he made it and his hands prepared the dry land  o come let us worship and fall down and kneel before the lord our maker  fred happened to look up at the last words and an exclamation of wonder broke from him as he pointed towards the shore  the schooner had just doubled the towering promontory and a new scene had been suddenly opened up to view  just beyond the promontory the coastline took an abrupt bend to the right at the end of which was a sequestered little bay with a beach of yellow sand and a cluster of grassy mounds behind of the brightest emerald green  the bay and the green mounds and the strip of yellow sand were all exceedingly small and were surrounded by a mass of rugged rocks of a cold whitishgrey colour  beyond these were the great purple mountains of the mainland  ahead and in front towered the islands of the coast  the whole of the surrounding scenery was wild rugged and barren  this one little spot alone was soft and lovely it shone out like a bright jewel from its dark setting  all round the bay were clustering cottages with white walls and red roofssome on the sides of the mounds others perched on rocks that projected out into the sea  on the highest of these mounds stood a church and in the bay floated a large norwegian vessel and numerous small boats  the promontory round which the snowflake had just passed completely sheltered this bay so that the water was like a sheet of glass in which everythingboats rocks mounds cottages and churchwas clearly reflected  the churchbell was ringing  it was a small bell and its sweet sound came floating softly over the sea to the ears of our voyagers like an old familiar hymn  the interest of this scene was further enhanced by the assembling of the people to church  boats were seen pushing off from every island issuing from every creek rowing over the calm water and all converging towards the little bay with the yellow strand  each boat was crowded with men women and children and as the men wore red caps and the women white kerchiefs on their heads their appearance was quite brilliant  in other respects their clothes being all homespun and of one dark colour their aspect was sombre enough  so numerous were the boats and so suddenly did they make their appearance that it seemed as if the land were being invaded by a foreign host  all this was taken in at a glance by the yacht party as they doubled the promontory and glided slowly into the bay  this is our anchorage said the captain  very well let go the anchor and we will finish the service after it is down said temple rising and taking up the telescope to examine the groups of people on shore  as each boat discharged its load on the little stone pier the males and females separated into two distinct bands and walked slowly and sedately towards the church at the door of which the whole congregation assembled still keeping in two separate bands to await the arrival of the clergyman  in a few minutes the rattle of the chain announced that the anchor was down  the sails were dewed up and service was continued  now said fred when he had concluded lower the boat captaini will go to church  will any one of you join me  whats the use of my going said sam sorrel i wont understand a word  youre not sure of that said grant  besides it is so long since weve been to church that i feel as if i should enjoy it whether i understand it or not  if it dont do you no good sir it cant do you no harm urged bob bowie who was evidently anxious to get ashore  come along cried fred jumping into the boat and taking his seat in the sternsheets  he was quickly followed by his companions and by honest bob whose delight in a ramble on shore was only equalled by his love for a voyage on the sea  aint it an xtroarnary church sir said bob sidling up to temple and touching his hat as they ascended the green mound on which the building stood  it is bob most remarkable replied fred  to say truth there could not be two opinions on this point  the church was of very peculiar and curious form  it was more like a number of dovecots placed together than anything else those dovecots i mean which have sloping roofs and are frequently seen nailed against the sides of houses in country places  take four such dovecots and place them back to back so as to form a sort of square on the top of these place three more dovecots also back to back above these set up two more dovecots and one on the top of all with a short steeple above it and a spire with an enormous weathercock on the top of that and the building will not be a bad model of a norwegian church especially if you paint the sides white and the gabled roofs blackishred  inside this church was found to be exceedingly plain but very clean the pews and galleries and walls were of unpainted fir and the ceiling was whitewashed  the entire building was utterly devoid of ornament except round the altar above which there was a large crucifix and a few candles and other things somewhat resembling those used in roman catholic worship  the service had begun some time before the arrival of our friends  it was a lutheran church and the ceremonial resembled that of the english church in some respects that of the roman catholic in others  the entrance of so many strangers of course created some sensation even although they entered as quietly as possible and sat down on the first seats they found vacant  the people seemed to have native politeness in them  they could not indeed resist the temptation to look round but they did it modestly and only indulged in glances as if they felt that it was rude to stare at strangers  unfortunately bob bowie had not been warned that it is the custom in norway for the men to sit together on one side of the church and the women on the other side and being rather a stupid man in some matters he did not observe that the door by which he entered led to the womens pews  being by nature a modest man he cast down his eyes on entering and did not again raise them until he found himself seated beside a norwegian female in a black gown and a white headdress with a baby in her arms which also wore a black gown and a white headdress  bob sat with a solemn look on his bluff visage and wiped his bald forehead gently for some time ere he discovered that he was the only male being in the midst of a crowd of two hundred women and girls and female infants  on making this discovery honest bobs body became exceedingly warm and his face uncommonly red  he glanced round uneasily blew his nose rose suddenly and putting on his hat with the back to the front went out of the church on tiptoe as quietly as possible and was not again seen until an hour afterwards he was discovered seated on the sunny side of a rock near the boat calmly smoking his pipe  bob was somewhat ashamed of this little adventure and did not like to have it spoken of  as a matter of course his comrades did not spare him but being the steward of the ship and having supreme command over the food he so contrived to punish his messmates that they very soon gave up joking him about his going to church with the norse girls  it cannot be said that any of the three friends made much of the sermon that day  fred understood only a sentence here and there grant understood only a word now and then and sam sorrel understood nothing at all but from the earnestness of the preacher especially when the name of our saviour was mentioned they were inclined to believe that a good work was going on there  in this opinion they were further strengthened when on afterwards visiting the pastor they found him to be a man of singularly kind and earnest disposition with agreeable and unaffected manners  he wore a long loose robe of black material and a thick white frill round his neck similar to that usually seen in the portraits of the great reformer martin luther  his family consisted of a wife and four childrena sturdy boy and three flaxenhaired girls all of whom vied with each other in paying attention to their visitors  coffee was instantly produced and cakes made by the fair fingers of the goodwife  the pastor could speak a little french so that his visitors were able to converse with him but the other members of the family could speak nothing but their native tongue  however this did not prove a great stumblingblock for while grant talked french with the pastor fred entertained his hostess in his best norse and sam sorrel not to be behindhand got the children round him and made such wonderful use of ver so goot and his other pet phrases that he succeeded in getting the boy on his knee and in setting the girls off into giggles of laughter  they spent that sunday and the following monday at this pleasant place and were taken by the pastor all over his house and grounds and village after which he conducted them to the summit of a mountain whence they obtained one of the finest views they had yet seen in norway  here for the first time since leaving england they regarded a fair wind with disfavour they bade adieu to the pastor and his family with a little of that sad feeling which one experiences when parting perhaps for ever from dear friends  but time and the sun would not wait  the anchor was tripped the sails were spread in half an hour the place had dwindled away to a bright green spot in the far distance then they rounded the beetling crags of an islandand it vanished from their view    chapter eight  visit to a strange peoplethe midnight sun  one day the snowflake lay becalmed in one of those long narrow fiords by which the whole of the west coast of norway is cut up and some of which extend from seventy to a hundred miles inland  there was no prospect of a breeze so another boat excursion was talked of  hearing this hans ericsson informed his master that there was a small settlement of laplanders about thirty miles or so inland and that he would be very glad to guide him and his friends to it if they chose  they jumped at the proposal at once and in less than half an hour they were on their way to it  bob bowie also went on this expedition  no carioles could be procured in that wild region but at a poor fishingvillage on the coast they got two of the country carts  these are small rough machines with a seat on wooden springs  they can hold only two persons and are light and serviceable well suited to the rough roads  fred and sam led the way grant and the steward followed hans acted the part of shooscarle to the former and the owner of the carts drove the latter  the first start was up the side of a hill at least two thousand feet and the road was so steep that it was all that the ponies could do to drag up the empty carts  having gained the top of the first hill they came upon a level plateau resembling the bleak scottish moorlands which terminated in a range of wild snowcapped mountains  after resting the ponies a few minutes they set off at a brisk trot and were soon across the level ground  ascending to another plateau they crossed it and finally reached the higher mountainrange of the interior  here they crossed several patches of snow which the summer heat had not yet been able to melt away  as soon as they were fairly amongst the mountains the roads became horrible and it was a matter of wonder that the springs of the carts were not broken  toiling up hills and dashing down on the other sidecrashing over fallen rocks and shaving the edge of yawning gulfs and precipicesthus they advanced till evening through a country which was the picture of barrenness and desolation  rocks were the chief feature of the scenery  they had got to such a height above the level of the sea that there were no pines only a few stunted birchtrees  there was little soil but that little was well clothed with vegetation  rocky mountains rocky masses and rocky glens everywhere but as they went farther inland the scenery improved a little  soon they found that instead of travelling inland they had been only crossing one of these broad necks of high land which separate the fords of norway from each other and ere long they came in sight of the sea with precipitous mountains dipping into it  here on a green slope facing the fiord were seen the conical tents of the strange people whom they had travelled so far to visit  the inhabitants of lapland are a distinct race from their southern neighbours the norwegians in size intelligence civilisation and manner of life  they are as near as may be savages in appearance and in some of their habits insomuch that on first visiting them a stranger might be apt to set them down as real savages  yet they are many degrees higher than the savage such as the red indian of north america the lapp is as dirty as the indian and dwells in as poor a hut and lives in as simple a style but he is rich in propertyhis property being herds of reindeer while the indian depends entirely on the chase for wealth and subsistence  then again although the lapp has nothing worthy of the name of a house he is an educated man to a small extent he can read and above all he possesses the word of god in a language which he understands  in bodily size however the red indian beats him for as a race the lapps are particularly small though they are well proportioned and active  they are seldom visited by strangers and it is not improbable that when the two carts dashed into their village our friends were the first englishmen they had ever seen  it happened to rain heavily during the last part of the journey to the lapp village  to the surprise and amusement of the travellers bob bowie drew forth from his cart a huge red cotton umbrella which he had purchased at bergen and which seeing the sky cloudy he had brought with him in the hope that he might have occasion to use that is to display it  the rain however did not depress the spirits of the party a whit nothing in the shape of water could damp their enthusiasm  if any one wants to see a poor ragged diminutive wizened yet jolly race of human beingsa race of beings who wear hairy garments sup reindeers milk with wooden spoons and dwell in big beehiveshe has only got to go to lapland and see the lapps  quitting the carts at the outskirts of the village the travellers advanced into the centre of it just as the natives were driving a herd of reindeer into an enclosure to be milked  there could not have been fewer than three hundred reindeerstags does and numerous fawns and these they afterwards learned constituted the entire wealth of three families of lapps  as fred and his friends strode into the enclosure and came upon these good people rather suddenly their amazement was unspeakable at finding they had bagged a party of giants along with their deer  even scraggy sam sorrel looked quite big compared with them  after the first gaze and shout of surprise they crowded round the strangers and they allmen women and childrenbegan to eye and paw them over and to examine their costumes with deep interest  the diminutive size of the lapps became very apparent as they were thus engaged  none of the men were much if at all above five feet several were considerably under that height and the women were short in proportion  if the bosoms of these lapps were small their hearts must certainly have been very large for they received their visitors with great warmth and delight  altogether they were a jovial and hearty though uncommonly illdressed race of mortals  the men were clothed partly in deerskin partly in coarse cloth and these garments were reduced by long service to a uniform dirtybrown colour  they showed signs of being slept in by night as well as worn by day  there was a schoolmaster amongst them  only fancy a lapp schoolmaster four feet nine or ten inches high  sam sorrel took a sketch of this gentleman on the spot with his wife and child  what the schoolmaster taught or whom he taught or when or where he taught are questions to which fred could obtain no answer  to look at him one would have imagined that eating sleeping and herding reindeer were the only lessons that he was able to teach  yet it was found on inquiry that some of them could read norse and sam actually discovered an old man in one of the huts poring over a new testament in that language  there seemed something strangely incongruous in all this  they were dirty and uncouth they had no houses no tables or chairs no civilised habits of any kind yet they could read and they had a schoolmaster  a very dirty one to be sure and not very deeply learned i dare say still a dominie without doubt  on the strength of their acquirements fred presented the tribe with a norse new testament  besides being four feet ten the schoolmaster was comical and quizzical he was evidently the wit of his tribe  his face was yellow and dirty his nose was short and red in addition to which it was turned up at the point his eyes were small and sloped downwards at the inner corners towards the nose like those of the chinese  his dirty leathern tunic was belted so low down and his little legs were so short that there was considerably more of him above the belt than below it  on his head he wore a cap somewhat like that of a jockey in shape and his lower limbs were encased in tight but illfitting leggings  altogether this man was the most disreputablelooking schoolmaster that was ever seen either at home or abroad  while both parties were making acquaintance with each other the rain fell more heavily  youd better put up your umbrella bob bowie said fred  bob who had forgotten the umbrella in consequence of being so much taken up with the lapps at once put it up  being extremely proud of this curiosity he was glad of the opportunity to display it  a shout of surprise and delight greeted its appearance  it was clear that the lapps had never seen one before  the schoolmaster at once seized it out of bobs hand and strutted about with it over his head to the inexpressible joy of the children who ran after him and crowded round him  undoubtedly he must have been a kind schoolmaster  for some time the earnest attention of old and young was entirely given to this umbrella while they tried to find out how many could get under it at once  the costume of the women was as rude as that of the men  the schoolmasters wife wore a sort of cloth helmet and a rough yellow cloth gown which was not by any means too long  her little girl wore a tightfitting skullcap and another youngster had on a thing much too large for itlike a huge extinguisher which seemed to be its fathers nightcap  they were extremely ugly all of them but very happylooking and goodnatured  of course fred had taken a few trinkets with him such as beads thimbles scissors sugarplums knives etcetera and as every one in the village received something the whole place resounded with exclamations of joy  despite the rain sam sorrel pulled out his sketchbook and began to take portraits  here was another source of wonder to the lapps  for some time they knew not what to make of it but crowded round sam with looks of inquisitive surprise and getting on tiptoe peeped at his book  when one or two lines had been drawn exclamations of interest were uttered by one and other and when in a few minutes the small youth with his fathers extinguisher on his head became clearly defined on the paper there was a regular burst of laughter  sam instantly received a far greater number of orders than he could execute  the stout little woman in the cloth helmet placed herself in an attitude which was no doubt meant to be irresistibly attractive several of the youngsters plucked the artist by the sleeve and thrust forward their pert little faces as if to say do me or heres a chance for you and the schoolmaster promptly clearing a space in front of sam placed himself in an attitude and by his commanding look ordered him to begin at once  he did begin on the spot and finished the portrait in five minutesrather a long sitting considering the state of the weather and the impatience of the schoolmaster to see himself on canvas  while this was going on in one quarter bob bowie had attracted round him a circle of warm admirers whose souls he captivated by showing and explaining to them the interior of his watch  as the lecture was delivered in english it is not to be supposed that the audience profited much by means of their ears but their eyes did double duty that day at least one might reasonably suppose so from the immense size to which they were constantly expanded  they evidently did not know whether to regard the watch as a mechanical contrivance or a living creature  in the study of this mysterious thing they were somewhat distracted by the presence of their first love the umbrella which the lecturer had erected over his head in order to shield his timepiece from the rain  fred and grant went about everywhere looking at everything and talking as they best could to everybody  meanwhile the three hundred deer in the midst of which they had been standing all this time kept moving about the enclosure emitting a peculiar grunting sound and making a strange clicking noise with their anklejoints  this is a wellknown peculiarity of the reindeer  every time they lift or set down their feet the anklejoints crack as do the knuckles of a man when he pulls his fingers  as these deer were constantly getting up and lying down the twittering rattle of their anklejoints was unceasing  presently the schoolmasters wife took a small wooden cup milked one of the does and handed the proceeds to fred  he was surprised to find the milk as thick and as pleasant to the taste as the richest cream and he was still more surprised to be told that all that could be got from a doe at any one time was about half a teacupful  the deer varied in colour from dark brown to almost white  the stags stood about three feet eight inches high at the shoulder and the antlers were about three feet long following the curve  quitting the enclosure the party next visited several of the huts which were made of moss turf sticks etcetera put together in such a confused way that it was difficult to make out how they had been formed  a hole in the side was the only door to each hut and a hole in the top was the window and chimney  in one of these they found an extremely old woman seated on a pile of dirty deerskins  sam sorrel said he was convinced she was the schoolmasters greatgrandmother  she looked like a living mummy so small and wrinkled and brown and dried up was the poor old body  yet she was lively enough to show signs of pleasure when fred patted her back gently and presented her with a pair of scissors and a pair of worsted gloves  it was a late hour before the curiosity of our friends was satisfied the sun was dipping low on the horizon when at last they bade adieu to the lapps and harnessing their ponies set out on the return journey the way was long and their eyes were heavy  they tried by means of conversation and song to keep themselves awake but were unsuccessful despite their utmost efforts their heads would nod and brief little dreams kept perpetually reminding them of laplanders dirty little schoolmasters and reindeer  now while fred was nodding in his cart and trying to keep awake that night he little thought that he was so nearly attaining the great object for which he had come to norway  yet so it was  they came in course of time to the summit of a ridge from which could be had a splendid view of the fiord and the sea with its thousands of islands beyond and the snowflake floating like a white speck on the blue water far below  here hans pulled up and touched fred on the shoulder  well hans anything wrong said fred starting and looking round  sun not set here replied hans with a grin  what cried fred jumping out of the cart rubbing his eyes and staring at the great luminary which was dipping close to the sea impossible we are not yet far enough north  you must be mistaken hans  to this hans replied that he was not mistaken  that he had been on that same spot at the same time of the year long ago and had noticed that the sun had not descended below the horizon  pointing to the sharp top of a hill that rose some six or eight hundred feet close beside them he said that from that point the sun would be seen complete while from the place where they then stood the lower part of it would be hid below the horizon  hallo  grant sam dye hear that shouted fred with enthusiasm weve no time to lose quick follow  away fred temple went up the mountainside like a deer followed by sam and grant who having been more than halfasleep when aroused by their comrades shout scarce knew what they were about  even bob bowies spirit was stirred and he went stumbling after his friends rubbing his eyes and yawning as he went  the highest peak was soon reached  here they sat down to watch  the sun was close upon the horizon now and freds heart beat fast with anxiety lest it should descend below it  theres but a narrow line of sky between the sea and the lower edge of the sun now said fred  it looks no more than an inch broad and it is narrowing i think  no it is growing broader said grant  no narrower whispered sam  broader it is said fred eagerly  for a few seconds they remained uncertain and silent gazing earnestly at the sun  at last there could be no doubt of it  the line of sky was evidently broader the sun had begun to rise without having set  huzzah shouted fred temple springing up tossing his cap into the air and cheering as enthusiastically as if he had just discovered a new goldfield  infected with the same spirit the others joined him and then they expended their energies in building a cairn of stones on the hilltop to commemorate the event  hans thou son of eric said fred grasping the hand of his pilot and guide when this was finished  i like thee man thou hast done me good service this day  but for you i should have missed this chance so i consider myself thy debtor lad mark me well i will discharge this debt when we return to the south  so now let us be gone  how fred discharged this debt remains to be seen  meanwhile the party descended the hill and returned once more to their floating home    chapter nine  miscellaneous adventuresthe value of languagesalmonfishing  the main object of the voyage having now been gained fred temple did not care to push northward with the earnest haste that he had hitherto exhibited  he did indeed avail himself of a fine southerly breeze which sprang up and succeeded in reaching latitude 67 and a half degrees where he saw the sun all night from the deck of his little yacht but he devoted himself henceforth to enjoying the country fully  he no longer sailed against baffling winds but went quite contentedly in any direction in which the wind chose to blow him  the consequence was that he visited many curious outoftheway places and saw many strange sights besides having a considerable number of peculiar adventures  the week following that in which he first saw the sun all night was particularly full of small adventures  let me briefly relate a few  one day having left the schooner becalmed close to the mainland they took the boat and rowed towards the land  while they were pulling alongshore under a tremendous cliff that rose out of the sea like a wall they heard voices on the top of the cliff  the top was lined with bushes so that they could see no one but the sounds led them to suppose that some persons were disputing there  presently a crash was heard and looking up they beheld a dark object in the air  they had just time to observe that this object was a pony and cariole which had evidently fallen from the top of the cliff when they were drenched with spray and a mass of foam indicated the spot not three yards off where the whole affair had disappeared beneath the waves  in a few seconds the pony came kicking to the surface  it had broken loose from the cariole and strange to say reached the shore unhurt and in safety  another day they saw a whale  it may not perhaps have occurred to many people that although a whale is a very wellknown fish and his picture extremely familiar to us the sight of a live whale about six or eight yards under ones feet is an uncommonly startling and impressive vision  such a sight our voyagers saw while sailing up the skars fiord  it was a calm day and a pleasant day withal and i think it right to state that although they did at times grumble at prolonged calms their grumbling was more than half feigned while their gratitude for good weather bright days not to mention nights and pleasant scenes was sincere  but to return to the point it was a calm day and they were doing nothingthat is nothing worthy of mention  the waters of the fiord were deep and blue and clear so that looking over the side of the yacht they could see very far down in realitycountless fathoms in imaginationinto the mysterious abyss  presently some one cried hullo look there  hullo look where inquired all the rest  there close astern its aa  whale shouted the whole ships company  that it really was a whale and a big one too became very apparent three minutes later for it thrust a great blunt nose like the end of a large boat out of the water and gave a prolonged puff  a few minutes later and the nose appeared close off the starboard bow then it came up not far from the larboard quarter so they were convinced that the creature was taking a survey of the yacht  perhaps it took it for another whale and felt inclined to be social  after one or two circuits it drew nearer and at last the huge fish could be seen as if in the depths of a bad lookingglass swimming round and round the yacht ever and anon coming to the surface and showing the whole length and depth of its bulky body  they were considerably excited as may be supposed at such an unexpected visit and the near approach of such a visitant  as they gazed at him with eager eyes he suddenly turned his head straight towards the side of the vessel and sinking down sufficiently to clear the keel dived right under it and came up on the other side  so clear was the water and so near was the fish to the surface that they saw its great fins driving it along and observed its comparatively little eyes looking inquisitively up at them  on clearing the yacht he came to the surface not more that thirty yards from the side  in fact he had shaved it as near as possible without actually touching familiarity breeds contempt saith the proverb  the longer this whale played round them the more did he exhibit a growing tendency to play with them and as there was no saying what fancies he might take into his great head fred resolved to give him a shot  accordingly the riflea doublebarrelwas brought up and watching his opportunity fred put two leaden balls into the back of his head the insulted monster wisely took the hint gave a final flourish of his tail and disappeared for ever  on another occasion they landed at the head of a remote fiord where the natives seldom had the chance of seeing strangers and were therefore overjoyed to receive them  here sam sorrel had a small adventure  his companions had left him to sketch  while thus engaged a fat hearty goodnatured fellow found him and insisted on him paying a visit to his cottage  the houses of the people in norway generally are built of wood and are roofed with red tiles  floors walls ceilings tables chairs beds etcetera all are of wood and usually unpainted  all have iron stoves for winter use no carpets cover the floors and no ornaments grace the walls save one or two prints and a number of large tobaccopipes for the norsemen are great smokers and chewers of tobacco  the language here perplexed our artist not a little  being a lazy student he had left fred to do all the talking but now he found himself for the first time alone with a norwegian fairly left to his own resources  well he accompanied his fat friend and began by stringing together all the norse he knew which wasnt much and endeavoured to look as if he knew a great deal more but his speech quickly degenerated into sounds which were quite unintelligible either to his new friend or himself at last he terminated in a mixture of bad norse and broad scotch  having dwelt many years in scotland sam found his knowledge of lowland scotch to be of use for there is great similarity between it and the norwegian tongue  for instance they call a cow a ko or a coo  bring me meen skoe i spell as pronounced is bring me my shoes  gae til land is go ashore  tak place is take place or sit down  if you talk of bathing they will advise you to dook oonder and should a mother present her baby to you she will call it her smook barn her pretty bairn or child smook being the norse word for pretty  and it is a curious fact worthy of particular note that all the mothers in norway think their bairns smook very smook and they never hesitate to tell you so why i cannot imagine unless it be that if you were not told you would not be likely to find it out for yourself  well sam and his fat friend soon became very amicable on this system the norseman told him no end of stories of which he did not comprehend a sentence but nevertheless looked as if he did smiled nodded his head and said ya ya yes yes to which the other replied ya ya waving his arms slapping his breast and rolling his eyes as he bustled along towards his dwelling  the house was perched on a rock close to the waters edge  it was very small quite like a bandbox with windows in it  here the man found another subject to rave about and dance round in the shape of his own baby a soft smooth copy of himself which lay sleeping like a cupid in its cradle  the man was evidently very fondperhaps even proudof this infant  he went quite into ecstasies about it now gazing into its chubby face with looks of pensive admiration anon starting and looking at sam with eager glance as if to say did you ever in all your life see such a magnificent cherub  his enthusiasm was quite catching  sam afterwards confessed that he actually began to feel quite a fatherly interest in the cherub  oh cried the father in rapture dat er smook barn thats a pretty baby  ya ya said sam smook barn though it must be confessed that if he had called it a smoked bairn he would have been nearer the mark for it was as brown as a red herring  in proof of his admiration of this baby our artist made a sketch of it on the spot and presented it to the delighted father after which he was introduced to the norsemans wife and treated to a cup of coffee when sam returned from this visit he told his companions that he was quite amazed at having got on so well with the language and was warm in praise of his host who he said laughed more heartily than any man he had ever met with  it is just possible that the norseman may have had more occasion afforded him for laughter than usual for sam had waxed very talkative and had been particularly profuse in the use and abuse of his pet phrase ver so goot  soon after this the yachts head was turned into the nord fiord at the head of which dwelt the father and mother of hans ericsson  here hans to his unutterable delight found the fair raneilda on a visit to her mother for raneilda was a native of that remote valley and had gone to bergen only a year before this time  here too sam sorrel found splendid scenery to paint and grant obtained numerous specimens of birds for his museum  this reminds me by the way that our naturalist who was amiable and eccentric on one occasion nearly drove his comrades out of the yacht one day he shot a young unfledged gull or puffin or some such creature whose brief existence had only conducted it the length of a down coat a little round body and a pair of tremendously long legs  well this object was laid carefully past sic in a spare berth of the yacht in which they used to stow away all manner of useless articleschairs and stools that had broken their legs etceteraand which went by the name of the infirmary in consequence  about a week after there was a most unaccountable smell in the infirmary  several stuffed birds hanging there were suspected and smelt but were found to be quite fresh  one or two of them were put out to air but still the smell grew worse and worse until the most obtuse nose did not dare to go near the infirmary at last they became desperate  a general and thorough investigation was instituted and there in a dark corner under a hair mattress and flat as a pancake lay the poor puffin alivebut not with the life wherewith it had lived before it was shotand emitting an odour that is indescribable a description of which therefore would be quite unprofitable  the puffin was pitched overboard and it was half insinuated that they ought to pitch the naturalist overboard along with it  at the head of this fiord also fred temple to his inexpressible joy found a mighty river in which were hundreds of salmon that had never yet been tempted by the angler with gaudy fly though they had been sometimes wooed by the natives with a bunch of worms on a clumsy codhook  thus both fred and hans found themselves in an earthly paradise  the number of splendid salmon that were caught here in a couple of weeks was wonderful not to mention the risks run and the adventures  space will only permit of one or two examples being given  on the day of their arrival fred seized his rod and taking hans to gaff the fish and show him the river sallied forth accompanied by about a score of natives chiefly men and boys who were eager to see the new style of fishing  they soon came to a finelooking part of the stream and fred put together his rod  he was much amused at the looks of the men when they saw the thin supple point of the rod  they shook their heads gravely and said he cannot hold a big fish with that they were right so far but they did not understand the use of the reel and the running line  presently fred cast and almost immediately a large salmon took his fly the rod bent like a hoop and the reel whizzed furiously as the line ran out  sam sorrel who was there at the time afterwards said that he was divided between interest in the movements of the fish and amusement at the open mouths and staring eyes of the natives  this fish was a very active one it dashed up down and across the river several times running out nearly the whole of the line more than once and compelling fred to take to the water as deep as his waist  at last after a fight of half an hour it was brought close to the bank and hans put the gaffhook cleverly into its side and hauled it ashore amid the shouts of the astonished people for the salmon weighed eighteen pounds  after a time the natives began to understand the principles of flyfishing with a rod and regarded fred temple with deep respect  on all his fishing excursions in that fiord he was attended by a band of eager admirers to whom he gave most of the fish for he caught so many of all sizes that his friends and his crew were not able to eat the quarter of them  the catching of his largest salmon was a stirring incident  it happened on the evening of a very bright day  he had been unfortunate  the sun being too bright the fish would not rise  this annoyed him much because on that particular day he had been accompanied by the captain and bob bowie as well as his two companions all of whom were anxious to see him catch fish and learn a lesson in the art  fred was up to his middle in a rough part of the river  it was all he could do to retain his foothold the water was so strong  it wont do said he the sun is too bright  his friends on shore looked grave and disappointed  i sees a cloud acomin said bob bowie glancing upwards  hallo hey shouted grant who observed that at that moment freds legs had been swept from under him and he was gone  before any one could speak or act fred reappeared a little farther down the river holding tight to the rod and staggering into shallower water  none the worse of it cried fred bursting into a laugh  just as he said this and while he was paying no attention to his rod a salmon rose and seized the fly  in an instant fred and his comrades utterly forgot all about the ducking and were filled with the excitement of the sport  freds rod bent like a willow wand  his eyes seemed to flash and his lips were tightly pressed together for he felt that he had on a very large fish  suddenly it darted up stream and did what the large fish seldom doleaped quite out of the water  a whale stand by roared bob bowie  there was a cry from the others for at that moment the salmon set off down streama most dangerous proceeding at all times  fred made for the bank and let out line as fast as possible  when he gained the bank he ran down the stream leaping over bushes and stones like a wild goat the places he went over in that run were terribly rugged  it seemed a miracle that he escaped without broken bones  presently he came to a steep rock that projected into the water  there was no getting round it so in he dashed  it took him only up to the knees  this passed he came to another place of the same sort  here he put a strain on the fish and tried to stop it  but it was not to be stopped  it had clearly made up its mind to go right down to the sea  fred looked at the pool hesitated one moment and then leaped in  it took him up to the neck and he was carried down by the current fifty yards or so when his feet caught bottom again and he managed to raise his rod fully expecting to find that the salmon had broken off  but it was still on and lively  meanwhile his comrades on the bank were keeping pace with him shouting and yelling with excitement as they ran  the rapid mind the rapid roared grant  fred saw a foaming rapid before him  he became anxious  it was dangerous to venture down this  if he should touch a rock on the way down the chances were that he would get a limb broken  the banks here were so thickly covered with bushes that it was impossible to pass  the fish still held on its headlong course  what shall i do thought fred  if i stop he will break all to pieces and i shall lose him lose him no never  dont venture in fred shrieked sam sorrel  but the advice came too late  fred was already in the foaming current in a moment he was swept down into the comparatively still water below the rapid  his friends lost sight of him for they had to run round through the bushes  when they got to the foot of the rapid they found fred on the bank panting violently and holding tight to the rod for the salmon had stopped there and was now sulking at the bottom of a deep hole  for a full hour did the fisher labour to pull him out of that hole in vain for in this kind of fishing nothing can be done by main force  the great beauty of the art consists in getting the salmon to move and in humouring his movements so that you tire him out and get him gradually close to your side  at last the fish came out of the deep pool  then there was another short struggle of quarter of an hour and the fishers perseverance and skill were rewarded  the salmon at last turned up its silvery side fred drew it slowly to the bank in breathless anxiety for many a fish is lost at this point  hans struck the gaff in neatly and with a huge effort flung it floundering on the bank amid the hearty cheers of all present  this salmon weighed 34 pounds and was about four feet long  it was a magnificent fish and it may well be believed that fred temple did not grudge the two hours battle and the risk that he had run in the catching of it    chapter ten  conclusion  sam sorrel said fred temple one day to his friend while they were seated at breakfast in the house of a farmer of the nord fiord we have been here more than a fortnight now we have enjoyed ourselves much have had good sport of various kinds and have laid in a stock of health and wisdom it is to be hoped that will last us for some time to come  that sounds very much like the beginning of a formal speech said grant  hold your tongue grant retorted temple i have not yet done  as i have said we have been successful in gaining the ends for which we came here  we have seen the sun rise without setting  sam sorrel has filled a large portfolio with beautiful sketches of perhaps the finest scenery in europe  grant has shot and stuffed i am afraid to say how many birds of all kinds besides making a large collection of rare plants and fred temple has caught about five hundred pounds weight of salmonnot to mention hundreds of trout  good said sam and very correctly stated  you are fit for the house of commons my friend  sam be silentnow this being the case it is time that we should think of returning to our native land  i will therefore make arrangements for setting sail in two or three days  but before leaving i will bring to a point a little plot which i have been hatching ever since i landed in norway  i wont tell you what it is just yet but i must have your help sam  command my services sir said sam with a wave of his hand  i am your servant your eastern slave ready if need be to prostrate myself in the earth and rub my nose in the dust  good  i accept your offer said fred and my first command is that you take your brushes and paint me a norwegian bride in the course of this forenoon  why your orders cannot be obeyed cried sam in surprise  where am i to find a bride on such short notice  you are more unreasonable than the most tyrannical of sultans  nevertheless replied fred calmly i issue my commands and in order to relieve your mind of anxiety i will find a bride for you  where then is this bride o wizard asked sam with a laugh  behold her cried fred starting up and throwing open the door from which could be seen the shore and the fiord with its background of noble hills  sam and grant started up with sudden exclamations and stared at the object which met their gaze in speechless wonder  and truly there was cause for astonishment for there on the shore close to the waters edge stood the fair raneilda clothed in the gorgeous costume of a norwegian bride  assuredly you are a wizard cried grant glancing at his friend  not so replied fred  i met sweet raneilda last night at her fathers cottage and begged of her to come here at a certain hour this morning in the costume of a bride in order that my friend the artist might paint her  she hesitated and blushed a good deal at first but at length she agreed and as you see is punctual in keeping her appointment  fred now went down to raneilda and brought her up to the house sam sorrel at once placed her in a good position seized his brushes and began the portrait  he was delighted with the dress for it glittered with gold and silver ornaments  the crown was of pure silver covered with gold  the breastplate was red cloth ornamented with silvergilt brooches beads of various colours silver chains and small round lookingglasses  there was also a belt ornamented with gold and silver  altogether raneilda looked much more like the queen of norway than a poor peasant girl  it is necessary to inform the reader that the greater part of this costume did not belong to the girl  in fact it did not belong to any one in particular  it is the custom in norway for each district to have a marriagedress for general use  the crown the breastplate and the belt are public property and may be hired out by the girls who are about to be married at a few shillings for each occasion  while sam was busy with his portrait grant went out to search for plants and fred went off to search for hans and to carry out the remainder of his plot  he soon found the young pilot  hans said he follow me i wish to speak with you  hans was quite willing to follow fred to the moon if he had chosen to lead the way  i am going to show you a very pretty sight hans step this way  here in this room  he threw open the door and led him in  the young norseman entered with a smile but the smile suddenly vanished his blue eyes opened to their utmost width and he stood rooted to the floor unable to speak  tuts what means this cried sam in disgust at being interrupted  raneilda gasped her lover  the bride covered her face with her hands  very good excellent exclaimed grant who chanced to pass at the moment and peeped in at the open window  hurrah cried bob bowie who just then came up to announce that the snowflake was ready for sea  she wont be wanted for some days yet cried fred bursting into a fit of laughter as he seized hans by the arm dragged him into another room and shut the door  now hans said he earnestly i am going to pay you off  nay man be not cast down i did not take you into yonder room to mock you but to show you how pretty raneilda looked in her bridal dress  fred paused for a moment and the norseman sighed and shook his head  you must know resumed fred that i wish to dance at your wedding hans and in order that i may do so i mean to have you married at once hans stared  you told me in bergen that you wanted some sort of work that would bring you good pay  hans nodded his head  well i will give you a hundred dollars for the time you have been with me  hans face brightened and he shook hands with fred according to norwegian custom when a gift is presented or a generous payment made  now continued fred did you not tell me that two hundred dollars would enable you to take your fathers farm off his hands  hans nodded again  and is raneilda willing to marry you when you can afford to ask her  hans nodded this time very decidedly  well hans i have been very much pleased with the way in which you have conducted yourself while in my service you have done your duty well  hans smiled and looked happy  but you have done more than that  hans looked surprised  you have been the means of enabling me to see the sun all night at a time when i should otherwise have missed it  i owe you something for that  moreover you pulled me out of that rapid by the neck when i caught the twentyeight pound salmon and so perhaps were the means of saving my life and certainly you saved me that salmon for all this and for many other good deeds i owe you a debt of gratitude  now hans you must know that it is impossible to pay a debt of gratitude in full for however much you may pay there is always something more owing  hans looked puzzled  this debt then i cannot pay up at once but i can prove to you that i consider myself your debtor by making you a present of another hundred dollars  here is the money my lad so go and tell raneilda to get ready as soon as possible  hans stared in wonder and unbelief first at the money then at fred then a look of triumph gleamed in his eyes and he seized freds hand and wrung it  then he uttered a shout and ran to raneilda and kissed her  fred kissed her too  sam sorrel and grant not knowing exactly what to do kissed her also and bob bowie who was under the belief that they were all mad made a grasp at the poor girl but missed her for raneilda was overwhelmed with confusion and ran nimbly out of the room leaving her crown behind her  hans ericsson hastily picked it up and ran after her leaving fred temple to explain things to his astonished friends as he best could  so that was the end of that matter  but that was by no means the end of the whole affair  before the snowflake left the fiord hans and raneilda were married as all true lovers ought to be  the fair bride was once again decked out in the queenlike garments which had formerly filled sam and grant with so great surprise and admiration and fred as he had promised danced at the norsemans wedding  and not only did fred dance but so did his friendsay and his whole ships crew  and it would have done your heart good reader to have seen the way in which the jacktars footed it on that occasion on the green grass and astonished the norsemen  but it must also be told that the norsemen were not a whit behindhand for they showed the tars a number of capers and new steps which they had never before seen or even dreamed of  just before the ball began there was heard a sound resembling the yells of an exceedingly young pig in its dying agonies  this was a violin it was accompanied by a noise somewhat like to the beating of a flourmill which was found to proceed from the heel of the fiddler who had placed a wooden board under his left foot  thus he beat time and a drum as it were at once  he also beat paganini and all other fiddlers hollow  round this manufacturer of sweet sounds did the lads and lasses flock and soon gave evidence of their sympathy with the rest of mankind by beginning to dance  certainly elegance is not a characteristic of the norwegian peasantry having formed a ring they went to work with the utmost gravity and decorum  scarcely a laugh was heard nothing approaching to a shout during the whole evening  the nature of their dances was utterly incomprehensible  the chief object the young men had in view seemed to be to exhibit their agility by every species of bound and fling of which the human frame is capable including the rather desperate feat of dashing themselves flat upon the ground  the principal care of the girls seemed to be to keep out of the way of the men and avoid being killed by a frantic kick or felled by a random blow  but the desperate features in each dance did not appear at once  each man began by seizing his partner and dragging her recklessly round the circle ever and anon twirling her round violently with one arm and catching her round the waist with the other in order apparently to save her from total destruction  to this treatment the fair damsels submitted for some time with downcast eyes and pleased yet bashful looks  then the men seemed to fling them off and go at it entirely on their own account yet keeping up a sort of revolving course round their partners like satellites encircling their separate suns  presently the men grew furious rushed about the circle in wild erratic courses leaped into the air and while in that position slapped the soles of their feet with both hands  then they became a little more sane and a waltz or something like it was got up  it was quite pretty and some of the movements graceful but the wild spirit of the glens seemed to reenter them again rather suddenly  the females were expelled from the ring altogether and the young men braced themselves for a little really heavy work they dashed flung and hurled themselves about like maniacs stood on their heads and walked on their hands in short became a company of acrobats yet always kept up a sort of sympathetic attempt at time with the fiddler who went on pounding his wooden board with his left heel and murdering an inconceivable multitude of young pigs with a degree of energy that was only equalled by that of those to whom he fiddled  but not a man woman or child there gave vent to his or her feelings in laughter  they smiled they commented in a soft tone they looked happy nay they were happy but they did not laugh  once only did they give way a little and that was when an aspiring youth after having nearly leaped down his own throat walked round the circle on his hands  even tittles danced that day  he danced in and out among the feet of the dancers in a most perplexing manner and got his unhappy toes and his unfortunate tail trod upon to a terrible extent  but tittles did not seem to mind  it is true that he gave a yelp of pain on each occasion but he instantly forgave the offender if he looked at all sorry  upon the whole tittles was the cause of much noise no little confusion and great amusement at that celebrated wedding  thus did fred temple and his friends spend their last day in norway  at midnight they set sail for old england  on rising next morning they found themselves far out among the islands of the coast  soon after that they were out of sight of landheaving on the swell of the ocean thinking over the varied and stirring scenes of the past three months with a sort of feeling that it must have been all a dream and wishing heartily that they were still away in the far north enjoying the endless daylight andchasing the sun  the end
