13446466	the pharisee and the publican  by john bunyan     two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other a publican  the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican  i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess  and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner luke xviii 1013  in the beginning of this chapter you read of the reason of the parable of the unjust judge and the poor widow namely to encourage men to pray  he spake a parable to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint and a most sweet parable for that purpose it is  for if through importunity a poor widow woman may prevail with an unjust judge and so consequently with an unmerciful and hardhearted tyrant how much more shall the poor afflicted distressed and tempted people of god prevail with and obtain mercy at the hands of a loving just and merciful god  the unjust judge would not hearken to nor regard the cry of the poor widow for a while  but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me  hark saith christ what the unjust judge saith  and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto himi tell you that he will avenge them speedily  this is therefore a very comfortable parable to such of the saints as are under hard usage by reason of evil men their might and tyranny for by it we are taught to believe and expect that god though for a while he seemeth not to regard yet will in due time and season arise and set such in safety from them that puff at them psalm xii 4  let the good christian pray always let him pray and not faint at seeming delays for if the widow by importunity prevailed with the unjust judge how much more shall he with his heavenly father  i tell you says christ that he will avenge them speedily  but now forasmuch as this parable reacheth not so directly the poor publican in the text therefore our lord begins again and adds to that other parable this parable which i have chosen for my text by which he designeth two things  first the conviction of the proud and selfconceited pharisee  secondly the raising up and healing of the cast down and dejected publican  and observe it as by the first parable he chiefly designeth the relief of those that are under the hands of cruel tyrants so by this he designeth the relief of those that lie under the load and burden of a guilty and disquieted conscience  this therefore is a parable that is full of singular comfort to such of the sinners in the world that are clogged with guilt and sense of sin and that lie under the apprehensions of and that are driven to god by the sense of the judgment that for sin is due unto them  in my handling of this text i shall have respect to these things   1  to the persons in the text  2  to the condition of the persons in the text  3  to the conclusion that christ makes upon them both  first for the persons  they were as you see far one from another in their own apprehension of themselves one good the other bad but yet in the judgment of the law both alike both the same both sinners for they both stood in need of mercy  true the first mentioned did not see it as the other poor sinner did but that altereth not the case  he that is in the judgment of the law a sinner is in the judgment of the law for sin condemned though in his own judgment he be ever so righteous  men must not be judged or justified according to what themselves do think but according to the verdict and sentence that cometh out of the mouth of god about them  now the sentence of god is all have sinned there is none righteous no not one rom iii  it is no matter then what the pharisee did think of himself god by his word hath proclaimed him a sinner  a sinner by reason of original sin a sinner by reason of actual transgression  personally therefore with reference to the true nature of their state they both were sinners and both by the law under condemnation  true the publicans leprosy was outward but the pharisees leprosy was inward  his heart his soul his spirit was as foul and had as much the plague of sin as had the other in his life or conversation  secondly as to their conditions i do not mean by condition so much a habit of mind as the state that they had each of them put themselves into by that mind  the one says the text was a pharisee the other a publican  a pharisee  that is one that hath chosen to himself such a course of life  a publican  that is one that hath chosen to himself such a course of life  these terms therefore shew the divers courses of life that they had put themselves into  the pharisee as he thought had put himself into a condition for heaven and glory but the publican was for this world and his lusts  wherefore when the pharisee stands in the temple he boasteth of himself and good condition but condemneth the publican and bitterly inveigheth against him  but as i said their personal state by the law was not at all changed  the pharisee made himself never the better the publican also abode in his place  indeed the publican is here found to recant and repent of his condition and of the condition that he had put himself into and the pharisee to boast of his  but the publicans repentance was not of himself but of god who can also yea and sometimes it is evident acts ix he doth make pharisees also repent of that condition that they have chosen to be in themselves phil iii 38  the pharisee therefore in commending of himself makes himself never the better the publican also in condemning of himself makes himself never the worse  nay contrariwise the pharisee by commending of himself makes himself much the worse ver 14 and the publican by condemning of himself makes himself much the better  i tell you says christ this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased  and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted  but i say as to mens commending of themselves yea though others should commend them also that availeth to godward nothing at all for not he that commendeth himself is approved but whom the lord commendeth  so then men in measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise 2 cor x 12  now this was the way of the pharisee i am not saith he as other men  i am no extortioner nor unjust no adulterer nor yet as this publican  two men went up into the temple to pray and they two as i said as opposite one to the other as any two men that ever went thither to pray  one of them was over righteous and the other wicked over much  some would have thought had they not by the word of christ been otherwise described that they had been both of the same religion for they both went up into the temple to pray yea both to pray and that at the same time as if they did it by appointment by agreement but there was no such thing  the one was a pharisee the other a publican  for so saith the after words  and therefore persons as opposite as light and darkness as fire and water i mean as to their apprehensions one of another  the pharisee could not abide the publican nor could the publican brook the pharisee and yet both went up into the temple to pray  it is strange to see and yet it is seen that men cross in their minds cross in their principles cross in their apprehensions yea and cross in their prayers too should yet meet together in the temple to pray  two men men not of the middle sort and them too picked out of the best and worst that was  two men a pharisee and a publican  to be a pharisee was in those days counted honourable for religion and for holiness of life  a pharisee was a man of esteem and repute among the jews though it is a term of reproach with us else paul would not at such a time as he did it have said men and brethren i am a pharisee the son of a pharisee acts xxiii 6 phil iii 5 for now he stood upon his purgation and justification especially it appears so by the place first named  and far be it from any to think that paul would make use of a colour of wickedness to save thereby himself from the fury of the people  a publican was in those days counted one of the vilest of men as is manifest because when they are in the word by way of discrimination made mention of they are ranked with the most vile and base therefore they are joined with sinnershe eateth with publicans and sinners and with harlots  publicans and harlots enter into the kingdom of heaven  yea when our lord christ would have the rebellious professor stigmatized to purpose he saith let him be to thee as an heathen man and a publican  we therefore can make no judgment of men upon the outward appearance of them  who would have thought but that the pharisee had been a good man for he was righteous for he prayed  and who could have thought that the other had been a good man for he was a publican a man by good men and bad men joined with the worst of men to wit with sinners harlots heathens  the pharisee was a sectarian the publican was an officer  the pharisee even because he was a sectarian was had the more in esteem and the publican because he was an officer was had the more in reproach  to speak a little to both these  1  the pharisee was a sectarian one that deviated that turned aside in his worshipping from the way of god both in matter and manner of worship for such an one i count a sectarian  that he turned aside from the matter which is the rule of worship to wit the written word it is evident for christ saith that they rejected the commandments of god and made them of no effect that they might keep their own traditions  that they turned aside also as to their manner of worship and became sectarians there is with no less authority assertedfor all their works they do for to be seen of men acts xxvi 5 mark vii 913 matt xxiii 5  now this being none of the order or ordinance of christ and yet being chosen by and stuck to of these sort of men and also made a singular and necessary part of worship became a sect or bottom for those hypocritical factious men to adhere unto and to make of others disciples to themselves  and that they might be admired and rendered venerable by the simple people to their fellows they loved to go in long robes they loved to pray in markets and in the corners of the streets they shewed great zeal for the small things of the law but had only great words for things that were substantialthey made broad their phylacteries and enlarged the borders of their garments matt xxiii  when i say the pharisee was a sectarian i do not mean that every sectarian is a pharisee  there were the sects of the herodians of the alexandrians and of the sadducees with many others but to be a pharisee was to be of the straitest sect  after the most straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee  that therefore of all the sects was the most strait and strict  therefore saith he in another place i was taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers  and again touching the law a pharisee acts xxii 3 xxvi 46 phil iii 5  the pharisee therefore did carry the bell and wear the garland for religion for he outdid he went beyond all other sectarians in his day  he was strictest he was the most zealous therefore christ in his making of this parable waived all other sects then in being and pitched upon the pharisee as the man most meet by whose rejection he might shew forth and demonstrate the riches of his mercy in its extension to sinners  two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee such a brave man as you have heard  2  the publican also went up thither to pray  the publican i told you before was an officer  an officer that served the romans and himself too for the romans at that time were possessors of the land of jewry the lot of israels inheritance and the emperor tiberius caesar placed over that land four governors to wit pilate herod philip and lysanias all these were gentiles heathens infidels and the publicans were a sort of inferior men to whom was let out to farm and so men that were employed by these to gather up the taxes and customs that the heathens had laid upon the jews to be paid to the emperor luke ii 1 iii 1 2 12 13  but they were a generation of men that were very injurious in the execution of their office  they would exact and demand more than was due of the people yea and if their demands were denied they would falsely accuse those that so denied them to the governor and by false accusation obtain the money of the people and so wickedly enrich themselves luke iii 13 14 xix 2 8  this was therefore grievous to the jews who always counted themselves a free people and could never abide to be in bondage to any  and this was something of the reason that they were so generally by all the jews counted so vile and base and reckoned among the worst of men even as our informers and bumbailiffs are with us at this day  but that which heightened the spirit of the people against them and that made them so odious and filthy in their eyes was for that at least so i think these publicans were not as the other officers aliens heathens and gentiles but men of their own nation jews and so the brethren of those that they so abused  had they been gentiles it had not been wondered at  the publican then was a jew a kind of a renegade jew that through the love that he had to unjust gains fell off in his affections from his brethren adhered to the romans and became a kind of servant to them against their brethren farming the heathenish taxations at the hand of strangers and exacting of them upon their brethren with much cruelty falsehood and extortion  and hence as i said it was that to be a publican was to be so odious a thing so vile a sinner and so grievous a man in the eyes of the jews  why this was the publican he was a jew and so should have abode with them and have been content to share with his brethren in their calamities but contrary to nature to law to religion reason and honesty he fell in with the heathen and took the advantage of their tyranny to poll to rob and impoverish his brethren  but for proof that the publican was a jew  1  publicans are even then when compared with yet distinguished from the heathen let him be to thee as an heathen man and a publican matt xviii which two terms i think must not here be applied to one and the selfsame man as if the heathen was a publican or the publican a heathen but to men of two distinct nations as that publican and harlot is to be understood of sinners of both sexes  the publican is not an harlot for he is a man c and such a man as has been described before  so by publicans and sinners is meant publicans and such sinners as the gentiles were or such as by the text the publican is distinguished from  where the pharisee saith he was not an extortioner unjust adulterer or even as this publican  nor can he by heathen man intend the person and by the term publican the office or place of the heathen man but by publican is meant the renegade jew in such a place c as is yet further manifested by that which follows  for   2  those publicans even every one of them that by name are made mention of in the new testament have such names put upon them yea and other circumstances thereunto annexed as doth demonstrate them to be jews  i remember the names of no more but three to wit matthew levi and zaccheus and they were all jews  1  matthew was a jew and the same matthew was a publican yea and also afterwards an apostle  he was a jew and wrote his gospel in hebrew  he was an apostle and is therefore found among the twelve  that he was a publican too is as evident by his own words for though mark and luke in their mentioning of his name and apostleship do forbear to call him a publican mark iii 18 luke vi l6 yet when this matthew comes to speak of himself he calls himself matthew the publican matth x 3 for i count this the selfsame matthew that mark and luke make mention of because i find no other matthew among the apostles but he  matthew the publican matthew the man so deep in apostacy matthew the man of that ill fame among his brethren  love in mark and luke when they counted him among the apostles did cover with silence this his publican state and it is meet for peter to call paul his beloved brother when paul himself shall call himself the chief of sinners but faithfulness to the world and a desire to be abased that christ thereby and grace by him might be advanced made matthew in his evangelical writings call himself by the name of matthew the publican  nor has he lost thereby for christ again to exalt him as he hath also done by the apostle paul hath set by his special providence the testimony that this matthew hath given of his birth life death doctrine and miracles in the front of all the new testament  2  the next publican that i find by the testament of christ made mention of by name is levi another of the apostles of jesus christ this levi also by the holy ghost in holy writ is called by the name of james  not james the brother of john for zebedee was his father but james the son of alpheus  now i take this levi also to be another than matthew first because matthew is not called the son of alpheus and because matthew and levi or james the son of alpheus are distinctly counted where the names of the apostles are mentioned matt x 3 for two distinct persons  and that this levi or james the apostle was a publican as was the apostle matthew whom we mentioned before is evident for both mark and luke do count him such  first mark saith christ found him when he called him as he also found matthew sitting at the receipt of custom yea luke words it thus  he went forth and saw a publican named levi sitting at the receipt of custom and he said unto him follow me mark ii 14 luke v 27  now that this levi or james the son of alpheus was a jew his name doth well make manifest  besides had there been among the apostles any more gentiles save simon the canaanite or if this levi james had been here i think the holy ghost would to distinguish him have included him in the same discriminating character as he did the other when he called him simon the canaanite matt x 4  matthew therefore and levi or james were both publicans and as i think called both at the same time were both publican jews and made by grace the apostles of jesus christ  3  the next publican that i find by name made mention of in the testament of christ is one zaccheus  and he was a publican yea for ought i know the master of them all  there was a man saith luke named zaccheus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich luke xix 2  this man christ saith was a son of abraham that is as other jews were for he spake to stop the mouths of their pharisaical cavillations  besides the publican shewed himself to be such an one when under a supposition of wronging any man he had respect to the jewish law of restoring fourfold exod xxii 1 2 sam xii 6  it is further manifest that he was a jew because christ puts him among the lost to wit among the lost sheep of the house of israel ver 10 and matt xv 24 for zaccheus was one that might properly be said to be lost and that in the jews account  lost i say and that not only in the most common sense by reason of transgression against the law but for that he was an apostate jew not with reference to heathenish religion but as to heathenish cruel and barbarous actions and therefore he was as the other by his brethren counted as bad as heathens gentiles and harlots  but salvation is come to this house saith christ and that notwithstanding his publican practice forasmuch as he also is the son of abraham  3  again christ by the parable of the lost sheep doth plainly intimate that the publican was a jew  then drew near all the publicans and sinners for to hear him and the pharisees and scribes murmured saying this man receiveth sinners and eateth with them  but by what answer doth christ repel their objections  why he saith what man of you having an hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it  doth he not here by the lost sheep mean the poor publican plenty of whom while he preached this sermon were there as objects of the pharisees scorn but of the pity and compassion of jesus christ  he did without doubt mean them  for pray what was the flock and who christs sheep under the law but the house and people of israel  ezek xxxiv 11  so then who could be the lost sheep of the house of israel but such as were matthew james zaccheus and their companions in their and such like transgressions  4  besides had not the publicans been of the jews how easy had it been for the pharisees to have objected that an impertinency was couched in that most excellent parable of the lost sheep  they might have said we are offended because thou receivest the publicans and thou for vindication of thy practice propoundest a parable of lost sheep but they are the sinners of the house of israel and the publicans are aliens and gentiles  i say how easily might they thus have objected but they knew full well that the parable was pertinent for that the publicans were of the jews and not of the aliens  yea had they not been jews it cannot it must not be thought that christ in sum should call them so and yet he did do so when he called them lost sheep  now that these publicans were jews what follows but that for this they were a great deal the more abominated by their brethren and as i have also hinted before it is no marvel that they were for a treacherous brother is worse than an open enemy psalm lv 12 13 for if to be debauched in an open and common transgression is odious how odious is it for a brother to be so for a brother in nature and religion to be so  i say again all this they did as both john insinuates and zaccheus confesses  the pharisee therefore was not so good but the publican was as bad  indeed the publican was a notorious wretch one that had a way of transgressing by himself one that could not be sufficiently condemned by the jews nor coupled with a viler than himself  it is true you find him here in the temple at prayer not because he retained in his apostacy conscience of the true religion but god had awakened him shewed him his sin and bestowed upon him the grace of repentance by which he was not only fetched back to the temple and prayer but to his god and to the salvation of his soul  the pharisee then was a man of another complexion and good as to his own thoughts of himself yea and in the thoughts of others also upon the highest and better ground by far  the publican was a notorious sinner  the pharisee was a reputed righteous man  the publican was a sinner out of the ordinary way of sinning and the pharisee was a man for righteousness in a singular way also  the publican pursued his villanies and the pharisee pursued his righteousness and yet they both met in the temple to pray  yea the pharisee stuck to and boasted in the law of god  but the publican did forsake it and hardened his heart against his way  thus diverse were they in their appearances  the pharisee very good the publican very bad  but as to the law of god which looked upon them with reference to the state of their spirits and the nature of their actions by that they were both found sinners the publican an open outside one and the pharisee a filthy inside one  this is evident because the best of them was rejected and the worst of them was received to mercy  mercy standeth not at the publicans badness nor is it enamoured with the pharisees goodness  it suffereth not the law to take place on both though it findeth them both in sin but graciously embraceth the most unworthy and leaveth the best to shift for himself  and good reason that both should be dealt with after this manner to wit that the word of grace should be justified upon the soul of the penitent and that the other should stand or fall to that which he had chosen to be his master  there are three things that follow upon this discourse  1  that the righteousness of man is not of any esteem with god as to justification  it is passed by as a thing of naughtiness a thing not worth the taking notice of  there was not so much as notice taken of the pharisees person or prayer because he came into the temple mantled up in his own good things  2  that the man that has nothing to commend him to god but his own good doings shall never be in favour with him  this also is evident from the text  the pharisee had his own righteousness but had nothing else to commend him to god and therefore could not by that obtain favour with god but abode still a rejected one and in a state of condemnation  3  wherefore though we are bound by the law of charity to judge of men according as in appearance they present themselves unto us yet withal to wit though we do so judge we must leave room for the judgment of god  mercy may receive him that we have doomed to hell and justice may take hold on him whom we have judged to be bound up in the bundle of life  and both these things are apparent by the persons under consideration  we like joseph are for setting of manasseh before ephraim but god like jacob puts his hands across and lays his right hand upon the worst mans head and his left hand upon the best gen xlviii to the amazement and wonderment even of the best of men  two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other a publican  the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican  i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess  in these words many things are worth the noting  as  first the pharisees definition of righteousness the which standeth in two things  1  in negatives 2  in positives  1  in negatives to wit what a man that is righteous must not be i am no extortioner no unjust man no adulterer nor yet as this publican  2  in positives to wit what a man that is righteous must be  i fast twice aweek i give tithes of all that i possess c  that righteousness standeth in negative and positive holiness is true but that the pharisees definition is notwithstanding false will be manifest by and by  but i will first treat of righteousness in the general because the text leadeth me to it  first then a man that is righteous must have negative holiness that is he must not live in actual transgressions he must not be an extortioner unjust an adulterer or as the publican was  and this the apostle intends when he saith flee fornication flee youthful lusts flee from idolatry and little children keep yourselves from idols 1 cor vi 18 x 14 2 tim ii 22 1 john v 21  for it is a vain thing to talk of righteousness and that ourselves are righteous when every observer shall find us in actual transgression  yea though a man shall mix his want of negative holiness with some good actions that will not make him a righteous man  as suppose a man that is a swearer a drunkard an adulterer or the like should notwithstanding this be openhanded to the poor be a great executor of justice in his place be exact in his buying selling keeping his promise with his friend or the like these things yea many more such cannot make him a righteous man for the beginning of righteousness is yet wanting in him which is this negative holiness  for except a man leave off to do evil he cannot be a righteous man  negative holiness is therefore of absolute necessity to make one in ones self a righteous man  this therefore condemns them that count it sufficient if a man have some actions that in themselves and by virtue of the command are good to make him a righteous man though negative holiness is wanting this is as saying to the wicked thou art righteous and a perverting of the right way of the lord  negative holiness therefore must be in a man before he can be accounted righteous  2  as negative holiness is required to declare one a righteous man so also positive holiness must be joined therewith or the man is unrighteous still  for it is not what a man is not but what a man does that declares him a righteous man  suppose a man be no thief no liar no unjust man or as the pharisee saith no extortioner nor adulterer c this will not make a righteous man but there must be joined to these holy and good actions before he can be declared a righteous man  wherefore as the apostle when he pressed the christians to righteousness did put them first upon negative holiness so he joineth thereto an exhortation to positive holiness knowing that where positive holiness is wanting all the negative holiness in the whole world cannot declare a man a righteous man when therefore he had said but thou o man of god flee these things sin and wickedness he adds and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness c 1 tim vi 11  here timothy is exhorted to negative holiness when he is bid to flee sin  here also he is exhorted to positive holiness when he is bid to follow after righteousness c for righteousness can neither stand in negative nor positive holiness as severed one from another  that man then and that man only is as to actions a righteous man that hath left off to do evil and hath learned to do well isa i 16 17 that hath cast off the works of darkness and put on the armour of light  flee youthful lusts said paul but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart 2 tim ii 22  the pharisee therefore as to the general description of righteousness made his definition right but as to his person and personal righteousness he made his definition wrong  i do not mean he defined his own righteousness wrong but i mean his definition of true righteousness which standeth in negative and positive holiness he made to stoop to justify his own righteousness and therein he played the hypocrite in his prayer  for although it is true righteousness that standeth in negative and positive holiness yet that this is not true righteousness that standeth but in some pieces and ragged remnants of negative and positive righteousness  if then the pharisee would in his definition of personal righteousness have proved his own righteousness to be good he must have proved that both his negative and positive holiness had been universal to wit that he had left off to act in any wickedness and that he had given up himself to the duty enjoined in every commandment  for so the righteous man is described job i 8 ii 3  as it is said of zacharias and elisabeth his wife they were both righteous before god walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless luke i 5 6  here the perfection that is the universality of their negative holiness is implied and the universality of their positive holiness is expressed  they walked in all the commandments of the lord but that they could not do if they had lived in any unrighteous thing or way  they walked in all blamelessly that is sincerely with upright hearts  the pharisees righteousness therefore even by his own implied definition of righteousness was not good as is manifest these two ways   1  his negative holiness was not universal  2  his positive holiness was rather ceremonial than moral  1  his negative holiness was not universal  he saith indeed he was not an extortioner nor unjust no adulterer nor yet as this publican  but none of these expressions apart nor all if put together do prove him to be perfect as to negative holiness that is they do not prove him should it be granted that he was as holy with this kind of holiness as himself of himself had testified for  1  what though he was no extortioner he might yet be a covetous man luke xvi 14  2  what though as to dealing he was not unjust to others yet he wanted honesty to do justice to his own soul luke xvi 15  3  what though he was free from the act of adultery he might yet be made guilty by an adulterous eye against which the pharisee did not watch matt v 28 of which the pharisee did not take cognizance  4  what though he was not like the publican yet he was like yea was a downright hypocrite he wanted in those things wherein he boasted himself sincerity but without sincerity no action can be good or accounted of god as righteous  the pharisee therefore notwithstanding his boast was deficient in his righteousness though he would fain have shrouded it under the right definition thereof  5  nor doth his positive holiness help him at all forasmuch as it is grounded mostly if not altogether in ceremonial holiness  nay i will recollect myself it was grounded partly in ceremonial and partly in superstitious holiness if there be such a thing as superstitious holiness in the world this paying of tithes was ceremonial such as came in and went out with the typical priesthood but what is that to positive holiness when it was but a small pittance by the by  had the pharisee argued plainly and honestly i mean had he so dealt with that law by which now he sought to be justified he should have brought forth positive righteousness in morals and should have said and proved it too that as he was no wicked man with reference to the act of wickedness he was indeed a righteous man in acts of moral virtues  he should i say have proved himself a true lover of god no superstitious one but a sincere worshipper of him for this is contained in the first table exod xx and is so in sum expounded by the lord christ himself mark xii 30  he should also in the next place have proved himself truly kind compassionate liberal and full of love and charity to his neighbour for that is the sum of the second table as our lord doth expound it saying thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself mark xii 31  true he says he did them no hurt but did he do them good  to do no hurt is one thing and to do good is another and it is possible for a man to do neither hurt nor good to his neighbour  what then is he a righteous man because he hath done him no hurt  no verily unless to his power he hath also done him good  it is therefore a very fallacious and deceitful arguing of the pharisee thus to speak before god in his prayers  i am righteous because i have not hurt my neighbour and because i have acted in ceremonial duties  nor will that help him at all to say he gave tithes of all that he possessed  it had been more modest to say that he had paid them for they being commanded were a due debt nor could they go before god for a free gift because by the commandment they were made a payment but proud men and hypocrites love so to word it both with god and man as at least to imply that they are more forward to do than gods command is to require them to do  the second part of his positive holiness was superstitious for god had appointed no such set fasts neither more nor less but just twice aweek  i fast twice aweek  ay but who did command thee to do so other than by thy being put upon it by a superstitious and erroneous conscience doth not nor canst thou make to appear  this part therefore of this positive righteousness was positive superstition and abuse of gods law and a gratification of thy own erroneous conscience  hitherto therefore thou art defective in thy so seemingly brave and glorious righteousness  yet this let me say in commendation of the pharisee in my conscience he was better than many of our english christians for many of them are so far off from being at all partakers of positive righteousness that neither all their ministers bibles and good books good sermons nor yet gods judgments can persuade them to become so much as negatively holy that is to leave off evil  the second thing that i take notice of in this prayer of the pharisee is his manner of delivery as he stood praying in the temple  god i thank thee said he that i am not as other men are  he seemed to be at this time in more than an ordinary frame while now he stood in the presence of the divine majesty  for a prayer made up of praise is a prayer made up of the highest order and is most like the way of them that are now in a state beyond prayer  praise is the work of heaven but we see here that an hypocrite may get into that vein even while an hypocrite and while on earth below  nor do i think that this prayer of his was a premeditated stinted form but a prayer extempore made on a sudden according to what he felt thought or understood of himself  here therefore we may see that even prayer as well as other acts of religious worship may be performed in great hypocrisy although i think that to perform prayer in hypocrisy is one of the most daring sins that are committed by the sons of men  for by prayer above all duties is our most direct and immediate personal approach into the presence of god as there is an uttering of things before him especially a giving to him of thanks for things received or a begging that such and such things might be bestowed upon me  but now to do these things in hypocrisy and it is easy to do them so when we go up into the temple to pray must needs be intolerable wickedness and it argueth infinite patience in god that he should let such as do so arise alive from their knees or that he should suffer them to go away from the place where they stand without some token or mark of his wrath upon them  i also observe that this extempore prayer of the pharisee was performed by himself or in the strength of his own natural parts for so the text implieth  the pharisee saith the text stood and prayed thus with himself or by himself and may signify either that he spoke softly or that he made this prayer by reason of his natural parts  i will pray with the spirit said paul 1 cor xiv 15  the pharisee prayed with himself said christ  it is at this day wonderfully common for men to pray extempore also to pray by a book by a premeditated set form is now out of fashion  he is counted nobody now that cannot at any time at a minutes warning make a prayer of half an hour long  i am not against extempore prayer for i believe it to be the best kind of praying but yet i am jealous that there are a great many such prayers made especially in pulpits and public meetings without the breathing of the holy ghost in them for if a pharisee of old could do so why not a pharisee do the same now  wit and reason and notion are not screwed up to a very great height nor do men want words or fancies or pride to make them do this thing  great is the formality of religion this day and little the power thereof  now where there is a great form and little power and such there was among the jews in the time of our lord and saviour jesus christ there men are most strangely under the temptation to be hypocrites for nothing doth so properly and directly oppose hypocrisy as the power and glory of the things we profess  and so on the contrary nothing is a greater temptation to hypocrisy than a form of knowledge of things without the savour thereof  nor can much of the power and savour of the things of the gospel be seen at this day upon professors i speak not now of all if their notions and conversations be compared together  how proud how covetous how like the world in garb and guise in words and actions are most of the great professors of this our day  but when they come to divine worship especially to pray by their words and carriage there one would almost judge them to be angels in heaven but such things must be done in hypocrisy as also the pharisees was  the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself  and in that it is said he prayed with himself it may signify that he went in his prayer no further than his sense and reason feeling and carnal apprehensions went  true christian prayer ofttimes leaves sense and reason feeling and carnal apprehensions behind it and it goeth forth with faith hope and desires to know what at present we are ignorant of and that unto which our sense feeling reason c are strangers  the apostle indeed doth say i will pray with the understanding 1 cor xiv 15 but then it must be taken for an understanding spiritually enlightened  i say it must be so understood because the natural understanding as such receiveth not the things of god therefore cannot pray for them for they to such are foolish things 1 cor ii 14  now a spiritually enlightened understanding may be officious in prayer these ways   1  as it has received conviction of the truth of the being of the spirit of god for to receive conviction of the truth and being of such things comes from the spirit of god not from the law sense or reason 1 cor ii 1012  now the understanding having by the holy ghost received conviction of the truth of things draweth out the heart to cry in prayer to god for them  therefore he saith he would pray with the understanding  2  the spiritually enlightened understanding hath also received by the holy ghost conviction of the excellency and glory of the things that are of the spirit of god and so inflameth the heart with more fervent desires in this duty of prayer for there is a supernatural excellency in the things that are of the spirit  for if the ministration of death to which the pharisee adhered written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not steadfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious  for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory  for even that which was made glorious hath no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth 2 cor iii 710  and the spirit of god sheweth at least some things of that excellent glory of them to the understanding that it enlighteneth eph i 1719  3  the spiritually enlightened understanding hath also thereby received knowledge that these excellent supernatural things of the spirit are given by covenant in christ to those that love god and are beloved of him  now we have received says paul not the spirit of the world that the pharisee had but the spirit which is of god that we make know the things that are freely given to us of god 1 cor ii 12  and this knowledge that the things of the spirit of god are freely given to us of god puts yet a greater edge more vigour and yet further confidence into the heart to ask for what is mine by gift by a free gift of god in his son  but all these things the poor pharisee was an utter stranger to he knew not the spirit nor the things of the spirit and therefore must neglect faith judgment and the love of god matt xxiii 23 luke xi 42 and follow himself only as to his sense feeling reason and carnal imagination in prayer  he stood and prayed thus with himself  he prayed thus talking to himself for so also it may i think be understood  it is said of the unjust judge he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man c luke xviii 4 that is he said it to himself  so the pharisee is said to pray with himself  god and the pharisee were not together there was only the pharisee and himself  paul knew not what to pray for without the holy ghost joined himself with him and helping him with groans unutterable but the pharisee had no need of that it was enough that he and himself were together at this work for he thought without doubting that he and himself together could do  how many times have i heard ancient men and ancient women at it with themselves when all alone in some private room or in some solitary path and in their chat they have been sometimes reasoning sometimes chiding sometimes pleading sometimes praying and sometimes singing but yet all has been done by themselves when all alone but yet so done as one that has not seen them must needs have concluded that they were talking singing and praying with company when all that they had said they did it with themselves and had neither auditor nor regarder  so the pharisee was at it with himself he and himself performed at this time the duty of prayer  now i observe that usually when men do speak to or with themselves they greatly strive to please themselves  therefore it is said there is a man that flattereth himself in his own eyes until his iniquity be found to be hateful psalm xxxvi 2  he flattereth himself in his own way according as his sense and carnal reason dictate to him and he might do it as well in prayer as in any other way  some men will so hear sermons and apply them that they may please themselves and some men will pray but will refuse such words and thoughts in prayer as will not please themselves  o how many men speak all that they speak in prayer rather to themselves or to their auditory than to god that dwelleth in heaven  and this i take to be the manner i mean something of the manner of the pharisees praying  indeed he made mention of god as also others do but he prayed with himself to himself in his own spirit and to his own pleasing as the matter of his prayer doth manifest  for was it not pleasant to this hypocrite think you to speak thus well of himself at this time  doubtless it was  also children and fools are of the same temper with hypocrites as to this  they also love without ground as the pharisee to flatter themselves in their own eyes but not he that commendeth himself is approved  god i thank thee i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican c  thus he begins his prayer and it is as was hinted before a prayer of the highest strain  for to make a prayer all of thanksgiving and to urge in that prayer the cause of that thanksgiving is the highest manner of praying and seems to be done in the strongest faith c in the greatest sense of things  and such was the pharisees prayer only he wanted substantial ground for his thanksgiving to wit he wanted proof of that he said he was not as other men were except he had meant he did not that he was even of the worst sort of men for even the best of men by nature and the worst are all alike what then are we better than they saith paul no in nowise rom iii 9  so then he failed in the ground of his thankfulness and therefore his thankfulness was grounded on untruth and so became feigned and selfflattering and could not be acceptable with the god of heaven  besides in this high prayer of the pharisee he fathered that upon god which he could by no means own to wit that he being so good as he thought himself to be was through distinguishing love and favour of godgod i thank thee that i am not as other men are  i thank thee that thou hast made me better than others i thank thee that my condition is so good and that i am so far advanced above my neighbour  there are several things flow from this prayer of the pharisee that are worth our observation  as   1  that the pharisees and hypocrites do not love to count themselves sinners when they stand before god  they choose rather to commend themselves before him for virtuous and holy persons sometimes saying and oftener thinking that they are more righteous than others  yea it seems by the word to be natural hereditary and so common for hypocrites to trust to themselves that they are righteous and then to condemn others  this is the foundation upon which this very parable is built  he spake this parable saith luke unto certain which trusted in themselves as being righteous or that they were so and despised others ver 9  i say hypocrites love not to think of their sins when they stand in the presence of god but rather to muster up and to present him with their several good deeds and to venture a standing or falling by them  2  this carriage of the pharisee before god informs us that moral virtues and the ground of them which is the law if trusted to blinds the mind of man that he cannot for them perceive the way to happiness  while moses is read and his law and the righteousness thereof trusted to the vail is upon their heart and even unto this day said paul the vail remaineth untaken away in the reading of the old testament which vail is done away in christ  but even unto this day when moses is read the vail is upon their heart 2 cor iii 14 15  and this is the reason so many moral men that are adorned with civil and moral righteousness are yet so ignorant of themselves and the way of life by christ  the law of works and the righteousness of the flesh which is the righteousness of the law blinds their minds shuts up their eyes and causeth them to miss of the righteousness that they are so hotly in the pursuit of  their minds were blinded saith the text  whose minds  why those that adhered to that stood by and that sought righteousness of the law  now  the pharisee was such an one he rested in the law he made his boast of god and trusted to himself that he was righteous all this proceeded of that blindness and ignorance that the law had possessed his mind withal for it is not granted to the law to be the ministration of life and light but to be the ministration of death when it speaks and of darkness when trusted unto that the son of god might have the preeminence in all things  therefore it is said when the heart shall turn to him the vail shall be taken away 2 cor iii 16  3  we may see by this prayer the strength of vain confidence it will embolden a man to stand in a lie before god it will embolden a man to trust to himself and to what he hath done yea to plead his own goodness instead of gods mercy before him  for the pharisee was not only a man that justified himself before men but that justified himself before god and what was the cause of his so justifying himself before god but that vain confidence that he had in himself and his works which were both a cheat and a lie to himself  but i say the boldness of the man was wonderful for he stood to the lie that was in his right hand and pleaded the goodness of it before him  but besides these things there are four things more that are couched in this prayer of the pharisee  1  by this prayer the pharisee doth appropriate to himself conversion he challengeth it to himself and to his fellows  i am not saith he as other men that is in unconversion in a state of sin wrath and death  and this must be his meaning for the religion of the pharisee was not grounded upon any particular natural privilege  i mean not singly not only upon that but upon a falling in with those principles notions opinions decrees traditions and doctrines that they taught distinct from the true and holy doctrines of the prophets  and they made to themselves disciples by such doctrine men that they could captivate by those principles laws doctrines and traditions  and therefore such are said to be of the sect of the pharisees  that is the scholars and disciples of them converted to them and to their doctrine  o it is easy for souls to appropriate conversion to themselves that know not what conversion is  it is easy i say for men to lay conversion to god on a legal or ceremonial or delusive bottom on such a bottom that will sink under the burden that is laid upon it on such a bottom that will not stand when it is brought under the touchstone of god nor against the rain wind and floods that are ordained to put it to the trial whether it is true or false  the pharisee here stands upon a supposed conversion to god i am not as other men but both he and his conversion are rejected by the sequel of the parable  that which is highly esteemed among men luke xvi 15 is abomination in the sight of god  that is that conversion that men as men flatter themselves that they have is such  but the pharisee will be a converted man he will have more to shew for heaven than his neighbouri am not as other men are to wit in a state of sin and condemnation but in a state of conversion and salvation  but see how grievously this sect this religion beguiled men  it made them twofold worse the children of hell than they were before and than their teachers were matth xxiii 15 that is their doctrine begat such blindness such vain confidence and groundless boldness in their disciples as to involve them in that conceit of conversion that was false and so if trusted to damnable  2  by these words we find the pharisee not only appropriating conversion to himself but rejoicing in that conversion  god i thank thee saith he that i am not as other men which saying of his gives us to see that he gloried in his conversion he made no doubt at all of his state but lived in the joy of the safety that he supposed his soul by his conversion to be in  oh thanks to god says he i am not in the state of sin death and damnation as the unjust and this publican is  what a strange delusion to trust to the spiders web and to think that a few or the most fine of the works of the flesh would be sufficient to bear up the soul in at and under the judgment of god  there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes and yet are not washed from their filthiness this text can be so fitly applied to none as the pharisee and to those that tread in the pharisees steps and that are swallowed up with his conceits and with the glory of their own righteousness  so again there is a way a way to heaven which seemeth right to a man but the end thereof are the ways of death prov xxx 12 xiv 12  this also is fulfilled in these kind of men at the end of their way is death and hell notwithstanding their confidence in the goodness of their state  again there is that maketh himself rich yet hath nothing prov xiii 7  what can be more plain from all these texts than that some men that are out of the way think themselves in it and that some men think themselves clean that are yet in their filthiness and that think themselves rich for the next world and yet are poor and miserable and wretched and blind and naked  thus the poor blind naked hypocritical pharisee thought of himself when god threatened to abase him  yea he thought himself thus and joyed therein when indeed he was going down to the chambers of death  3  by these words the pharisee seems to put the goodness of his condition upon the goodness of god  i am not as other men are and i thank god for it  god saith he i thank thee that i am not as other men are  he thanked god when god had done nothing for him he thanked god when the way that he was in was not of gods prescribing but of his own inventing  so the persecutor thanks god that he was put into that way of roguery that the devil had put him into when he fell to rending and tearing of the church of god their possessors slay them saith the prophet and hold themselves not guilty  and they that sell them say blessed be the lord for i am rich zech xi 5  i remember that luther used to say in the name of god begins all mischief  all must be fathered upon god the pharisees conversion must be fathered upon god the right or rather the villany of the outrageous persecution against gods people must be fathered upon god  god i thank thee and blessed be god must be the burden of the heretics song  so again the freewiller he will ascribe all to god the quaker the ranter the socinian c will ascribe all to god  god i thank thee is in every mans mouth and must be entailed to every error delusion and damnable doctrine that is in the world  but the name of god and their doctrine worship and way hangeth together as the pharisees doctrine that is to say by nothing at all  for god hath not proposed their principles nor doth he own them nor hath he commanded them nor doth he convey by them the least grace or mercy to them but rather rejecteth them and holdeth them for his enemies and for the destroyers of the world  4  we come in the next place to the ground of all this and that is to what the pharisee had attained to wit that he was no extortioner no unjust man no adulterer nor even as this publican and for that he fasted twice aweek and paid tithes of all that he possessed  so that you see he pretended to a double foundation for his salvation a moral and a ceremonial one but both very lean weak and feeble  for the first of his foundation what is it more if all be true that he saith but a being removed a few inches from the vilest men in their vilest actions a very slender matter to build my confidence for heaven upon  and for the second part of his ground for life what is it but a couple of ceremonies if so good the first is questioned as a thing not founded in gods law and the second is such as is of the remotest sort of ceremonies that teach and preach the lord jesus but suppose them to be the best and his conformity to them the thoroughest they never were ordained to get to heaven by and so are become but a sandy foundation  but any thing will serve some men for a foundation and support for their souls and to build their hopes of heaven upon  i am not a drunkard says one nor a liar nor a swearer nor a thief and therefore i thank god i have hopes of heaven and glory  i am not an extortioner nor an adulterer not unjust nor yet as this publican and therefore do hope i shall go to heaven  alas poor men will your being furnished with these things save you from the thundering claps and vehement batteries that the wrath of god will make upon sin and sinners in the day that shall burn like an oven  no no nothing at that day can shroud a man from the hot rebukes of that vengeance but the very righteousness of god which is not the righteousness of the law however christened named or garnished with all the righteousness of man  but o thou blind pharisee since thou art so confident that thy state is good and thy righteousness is that that will stand when it shall be tried with fire 1 cor iii 13 let me now reason with thee of righteousness  my terror shall not make thee afraid i am not god but a man as thou art we both are formed out of the clay  first prithee when didst thou begin to be righteous  was it before or after thou hadst been a sinner  not before i dare say but if after then the sins that thou pollutedst thyself withal before have made thee incapable of acting legal righteousness  for sin where it is pollutes defiles and makes vile the whole man therefore thou canst not by after acts of obedience make thyself just in the sight of that god thou pretendest now to stand praying unto  indeed thou mayst cover thy dirt and paint thy sepulchre for that acts of after obedience will do though sin has gone before  but pharisee god can see through the white of this wall even to the dirt that is within  god can also see through the paint and garnish of thy beauteous sepulchre to the dead mens bones that are within nor can any of thy most holy duties nor all when put together blind the eye of the allseeing majesty from beholding all the uncleanness of thy soul matt xxiii 27  stand not therefore so stoutly to it now thou art before god sin is with thee and judgment and justice is before him  it becomes thee therefore rather to despise and abhor this life and to count all thy doings but dross and dung and to be content to be justified with anothers righteousness instead of thy own  this is the way to be secured  i say blind pharisee this is the way to be secured from the wrath which is to come  there is nothing more certain than this that as to justification from the curse of the law god has rejected mans righteousness for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof and hath accepted in the room of that the glorious righteousness of his son because indeed that and that only is universal perfect and equal with his justice and holiness  this is in a manner the contents of the whole bible and therefore must needs be more certainly true  now then mr pharisee methinks what if thou didst this and that while thou art at thy prayers to wit cast in thy mind what doth god love most and the resolve will be at hand  the best righteousness surely the best righteousness for that thy reason will tell thee  this done even while thou art at thy devotion ask thyself again but who has the best righteousness and that resolve will be at hand also to wit he that in person is equal with god and that is his in jesus christ he that is separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens and that is his son jesus christ he that did no sin nor had any guile found in his mouth and there never was any such he in all the world but the son of god jesus christ  now pharisee when thou hast done this then as thou art at thy devotion ask again but what is this best righteousness the righteousness of christ to do and the answer will be ready  it is to be made by an act of the sovereign grace of god over to the sinner that shall dare to trust thereto for justification from the curse of the law  he is made unto us of god righteousness  he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him  for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth 1 cor i 30 2 cor v 21 rom x 4  this done and concluded on then turn again pharisee and say thus with thyselfis it most safe for me to trust in this righteousness of god this righteousness of godman this righteousness of christ certainly it is since by the text it is counted the best and that which is best pleaseth god since it is that which god hath appointed that sinners shall be justified withal  for in the lord have we righteousness if we believe  and in the lord we are justified and do glory isa xlv 24 25  nay pharisee suppose thine own righteousness should be as long as broad as high as deep as perfect as good even every way as good as the righteousness of christ yet since god has chosen by christ to reconcile us to himself canst thou attempt to seek by thy own righteousness to reconcile thyself to god and not attempt at least to confront this righteousness of christ before god yea to challenge it by acceptance of thy person contrary to gods design  suppose that when the king has chosen one to be judge in the land and has determined that he shall be judge in all cases and that by his verdict every mans judgment shall stand i say suppose after this another should arise and of his own head resolve to do his own business himself  now though he should be every whit as able yea and suppose he should do it as justly and righteously too yet his making of himself a judge would be an affront to the king and an act of rebellion and so a transgression worthy of punishment  why pharisee god hath appointed that by the righteousness of his son and by that righteousness only men shall be justified in his sight from the curse of the law  wherefore take heed and at thy peril whatever thy righteousness is confront not the righteousness of christ therewith  i say bring it not in let it not plead for thee at the bar of god nor do thou plead for that in his court of justice for thou canst not do this and be innocent  if he trust to his righteousness he hath sinned says ezekiel  mark the text when i shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live if he trust to his own righteousness and commit iniquity all his righteousness shall not be remembered  but for his iniquity that he hath committed he shall die for it ezek xxxiii 13  observe a few things from this text and they are these that follow  1  here is a righteous man a man with whom we do not hear that the god of heaven finds fault  2  here is a promise made to this man that he shall surely live but on this condition that he trust not to his own righteousness whence it is manifest that the promise of life to this righteous man is not for the sake of his righteousness but for the sake of something else to wit the righteousness of christ  1  not for the sake of his own righteousness  this is evident because we are permitted yea commanded to trust in the righteousness that saveth us  the righteousness of god is unto us all and upon all that believe that is trust in it and trust to it for justification  now therefore if thy righteousness when most perfect could save thee thou mightst yea oughtst most boldly to trust therein  but since thou art forbidden to trust to it it is evident it cannot save nor is it for the sake of that that the righteous man is saved rom iii 21 22  2  but for the sake of something else to wit for the sake of the righteousness of christ whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him that believeth in jesus rom iii 25 26 see phil iii 68  if he trust to his own righteousness and commit iniquity all his righteousness shall not be remembered but for his iniquity that he hath committed in trusting to his own righteousness he shall die for it  note hence further  1  that there is more virtue in one sin to destroy than in all thy righteousness to save thee alive  if he trust if he trust ever so little if he do at all trust to his own righteousness all his righteousness shall be forgotten and by and for and in the sin that he hath committed in trusting to it he shall die  2  take notice also that there are more damnable sins than those that are against the moral law  by which of the ten commandments is trusting to our own righteousness forbidden  yet it is a sin  it is a sin therefore forbidden by the gospel and is included lurketh close in yea is the very root of unbelief itself he that believes not shall be damned  but he that trusteth in his own righteousness doth not believe neither in the truth nor sufficiency of the righteousness of christ to save him therefore he shall be damned  but how is it manifest that he that trusteth to his own righteousness doth it through a doubt or unbelief of the truth or sufficiency of the righteousness of christ  i answer because he trusteth to his own  a man will never willingly choose to trust to the worst of helps when he believes there is a better as near and to be had as soon and that too upon as easy if not more easy terms  if he that trusteth to his own righteousness for life did believe that there is indeed such a thing as the righteousness of christ to justify and that this righteousness of christ has in it allsufficiency to do that blessed work be sure he would choose that thereon to lay lean and venture his soul that he saw was the best and most sufficient to save especially when he saw also and see that he must when he sees the righteousness of christ to wit that that is to be obtained as soon because as near and to be had on as easy terms  nay upon easier than mans own righteousness  i say he would sooner choose it because of the weight of salvation of the worth of salvation and of the fearful sorrow that to eternity will overtake him that in this thing shall miscarry  it is for heaven it is to escape hell wrath and damnation saith the soul and therefore i will i must i dare not but choose that and that only that i believe to be the best and most sufficient help in so great a concern as soulconcern is  so then he that trusteth to his own righteousness does it of unbelief of the sufficiency of the righteousness of christ to save him  wherefore this sin of trusting to his own righteousness is a most high transgression because it contemneth the righteousness of christ which is the only righteousness that is sufficient to save from the curse of the law  it also disalloweth the design of heaven and the excellency of the mystery of the wisdom of god in designing this way of salvation for man  what shall i say it also seeketh to rob god of the honour of the salvation of man  it seeketh to take the crown from the head of christ and to set it upon the hypocrites head therefore no marvel that this one sin be of that weight virtue and power as to sink that man and his righteousness into hell that leaneth thereon or trusteth unto it  but pharisee i need not talk thus unto thee for thou art not the man that hath that righteousness that god findeth not fault withal nor is it to be found but with him that is ordained to be the saviour of mankind nor is there any such one besides jesus who is called christ  what madness then has brought thee into the temple there in an audacious manner to stand and vaunt before god saying god i thank thee i am not as other men are  dost thou not know that he that breaks one breaks all the commandments of god and consequently that he that keeps not all keeps none at all of the commandments of god  saith not the scripture the same  for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all jam ii 10  be confounded then be confounded  dost thou know the god with whom now thou hast to do  he is a god that cannot as he is just accept of an half righteousness for a whole of a lame righteousness for a sound of a sick righteousness for a well and healthy one mal i 7 8  and if so how should he then accept of that which is no righteousness  i say how should he accept of that which is none at all for thine is only such  and if christ said when you have done all say we are unprofitable how camest thou to say before thou hadst done one thing well i am better more righteous than other men  didst thou believe when thou saidst it that god knew thy heart hadst thou said this to the publican it had been a high and rampant expression but to say this before god to the face of god when he knew that thou wert vile and a sinner from the womb and from the conception spoils all  it was spoken to put a check to thy arrogancy when christ said ye are they that justify yourselves before men but god knoweth your hearts luke xvi 15  hast thou taken notice of this that god judgeth the fruit by the heart from whence it comes  a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil luke vi 45  nor can it be otherwise concluded but that thou art an evil man and so that all thy supposed good is nought but badness for that thou hast made it to stand in the room of jesus and hast dared to commend thyself to the living god thereby  for thou hast trusted in thy shadow of righteousness and committed iniquity  thy sin hath melted away thy righteousness and turned it to nothing but dross or if you will to the early dew like to which it goeth away and so can by no means do thee good when thou shalt stand in need of salvation and eternal life of god  but further thou sayst thou art righteous but they are but vain words  knowest thou not that thy zeal which is the life of thy righteousness is preposterous in many things  what else means thy madness and the rage thereof against men as good as thyself  true thy being ignorant that they are good may save thee from the commission of the sin that is unpardonable but it will never keep thee from spot in gods sight but will make both thee and thy righteousness culpable  paul who was once as brave a pharisee as thou canst be calleth much of that zeal which he in that estate was possessed with and lived in the exercise of madness yea exceeding madness acts xxvi 911 phil iii 5 6 and of the same sort is much of thine and it must be so for a lawyer a man for the law and that resteth in it must be a persecutor yea a persecutor of righteous men and that of zeal to god because by the law is begotten through the weakness that it meeteth with in thee sourness bitterness of spirit and anger against him that rightfully condemneth thee of folly for choosing to trust to thy own righteousness when a better is provided of god to save us gal iv 2831  thy righteousness therefore is deficient yea thy zeal for the law and the men of the law has joined madness with thy moral virtues and made thy righteousness unrighteousness how then canst thou be upright before the lord  further has not the pride of thy spirit in this hotheaded zeal for thy pharisaical notions run thee upon thinking that thou art able to do more than god hath enjoined thee and so able to make thyself more righteous than god requireth thou shouldst be  what else is the cause of thy adding laws to gods laws precepts to gods precepts and traditions to gods appointment  mark vii  nay hast thou not by thus doing condemned the law of want of perfection and so the god that gave it of want of wisdom and faithfulness to himself and thee  nay i say again hath not thy thus doing charged god with being ignorant of knowing what rules there needed to be imposed on his creatures to make their obedience complete  and doth not this madness of thine intimate moreover that if thou hadst not stepped in with the bundle of thy traditions righteousness had been imperfect not through mans weakness but through impediment in god or in his ministering rules of righteousness unto us  now when thou hast thought on these things fairly answer thyself these few questions  is not this arrogancy  is not this blasphemy is not this to condemn god that thou mightst be righteous  and dost thou think this is indeed the way to be righteous  but again what means thy preferring of thine own rules laws statutes ordinances and appointments before the rules laws statutes and appointments of god  thinkest thou this to be right whither will thy zeal thy pride and thy folly carry thee  is there more reason more equity more holiness in thy tradition than in the holy and just and good commandments of god  rom vii 12  why then i say dost thou reject the commandment of god to keep thine own tradition  yea why dost thou rage and rail and cry out when men keep not thy law or the rule of thine order and tradition of thine elders and yet shut thine eyes or wink with them when thou thyself shalt live in the breach of the law of god  yea why wilt thou condemn men when they keep not thy law but study for an excuse yea plead for them that live in the breach of gods  mark vii 1013  will this go for righteousness in the day of god almighty  nay rather will not this like a millstone about thy neck drown thee in the deeps of hell  o the blindness the madness the pride that dwells in the hearts of these pretended righteous men  again what kind of righteousness of thine is this that standeth in a misesteeming of gods commands  some thou settest too high and some too low as in the text thou hast set a ceremony above faith above love and above hope in the mercy of god when as it is evident the things last mentioned are the things of the first rate the weightier matters matt xxiii 17  again thou hast preferred the gold above the temple that sanctifieth the gold and the gift above the altar that sanctifieth the gift matt xxiii 17  i say again what kind of righteousness shall this be called  what back will such a suit of apparel fit that is set together to what it should be  nor can other righteousness proceed where a wrong judgment precedeth it  this misplacing of gods laws cannot i say but produce misplaced obedience  it indeed produceth a monster an illshaped thing unclean and an abomination to the lord  for see saith he if thou wilt be making that thou make all things according to the pattern shewn thee in the mount  set faith where faith should stand a moral where a moral should stand and a ceremony where a ceremony should stand  for this turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potters clay  and wilt thou call this thy righteousness yea wilt thou stand in this wilt thou plead for this and venture an eternal concern in such a piece of linsey woolsey as this  o fools and blind  but further let us come a little closer to the point  o blind pharisee thou standest to thy righteousness  what dost thou mean wouldst thou have mercy for thy righteousness or justice for thy righteousness  if mercy what mercy  temporal things god giveth to the unthankful and unholy  nor doth he use to sell the world to man for righteousness  the earth hath he given to the children of men  but this is not the thing  thou wouldst have eternal mercy for thy righteousness thou wouldst have god think upon what an holy what a good what a righteous man thou art and hast been  but christ died not for the good and righteous nor did he come to call such to the banquet that grace hath prepared for the world  i came noti am not come saith christ to call the righteous but sinners to repentance mark ii rom v  yet this is thy plea lord god i am a righteous man therefore grant me mercy and a share in thy heavenly kingdom  what else dost thou mean when thou sayst god i thank thee that i am not as other men are  why dost thou rejoice why art thou glad that thou art more righteous if indeed thou art than thy neighbour if it is not because thou thinkest that thou hast got the start of thy neighbour with reference to mercy and that by thy righteousness thou hast insinuated thyself into gods affections and procured an interest in his eternal favour  but  what what hast thou done by thy righteousness  i say what hast thou given to god thereby  and what hath he received of thy hand perhaps thou wilt say righteousness pleaseth god  but i answer no not thine with respect to justification from the curse of the law unless it be as perfect as the justice it is yielded to and as the law that doth command it  but thine is not such a righteousness no thine is speckled thine is spotted thine makes thee to look like a speckled bird in his eyesight  thy righteousness has added iniquity because it has kept thee from a belief of thy need of repentance and because it has emboldened thee to thrust thyself audaciously into the presence of god and made thee even before his holy eyes which are so pure that they cannot look on iniquity hab i 13 to vaunt boast and brag of thyself and of thy tottering ragged stinking uncleanness for all our righteousnesses are as menstruous rags because they flow from a thing a heart a man that is unclean  but  again wouldst thou have mercy for thy righteousness  for whom wouldst thou have it  for another or for thyself  if for another and it is most proper that a righteous man should intercede for another by his righteousness rather than for himself then thou thrustest christ out of his place and office and makest thyself to be a saviour in his stead for a mediator there is already even a mediator between god and man and he is the man christ jesus  but dost thou plead by thy righteousness for mercy for thyself  why in doing so thou impliest   1  that thy righteousness can prevail with god more than can thy sins i say that thy righteousness can prevail with god to preserve thee from death more than thy sins can prevail with him to condemn thee to it  and if so what follows but that thy righteousness is more and has been done in a fuller spirit than ever were thy sins but thus to insinuate is to insinuate a lie for there is no man but while he is a sinner sinneth with a more full spirit than a good man can act righteousness withal  a sinner when he sinneth he doth it with all his heart and with all his mind and with all his soul and with all his strength nor hath he in his ordinary course any thing that bindeth  but with a good man it is not so all and every whit of himself neither is nor can be in every good duty that he doth  for when he would do good evil is the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are present with him  and again the flesh lusteth against one to the other so that ye cannot do the things would gal v 17  now if a good man cannot do good things with that oneness and universalness of mind as a wicked man doth sin with then is his sin heavier to weigh him down to hell than is his righteousness to buoy him up to the heavens  and again i say if the righteousness of a good man comes short of his sin both in number weight and measure as it doth for a good man shrinks and quakes at the thoughts of gods entering into judgment with him psalm cxliii 2 then is his iniquity more than his righteousness  and i say again if the sin of one that is truly gracious and so of one that hath the best of principles is heavier and mightier to destroy him than is his righteousness to save him how can it be that the pharisee that is not gracious but a mere carnal man somewhat reformed and painted over with a few lean and low formalities should with his empty partial hypocritical righteousness counterpoise his great mighty and weighty sins that have cleaved to him in every state and condition of his to make him odious in the sight of god  2  dost thou plead by thy righteousness for mercy for thyself  why in so doing thou impliest that mercy thou deservest and that is next door to or almost as much as to say god oweth me what i ask for  the best that can be put upon it is thou seekest security from the direful curse of god as it were by the works of the law rom ix 3133 and to be sure betwixt christ and the law thou wilt drop into hell  for he that seeks for mercy as it were and but as it were by the works of the law doth not altogether trust thereto nor doth he that seeks for that righteousness that should save him as it were by the works of the law seek it only wholly and solely at the hands of mercy  so then to seek for that that should save thee neither at the hands of the law nor at the hands of mercy is to be sure to seek it where it is not to be found for there is no medium betwixt the righteousness of the law and the mercy of god  thou must have it either at the door of the law or at the door of grace  but sayst thou i am for having of it at the hands of both  i will trust solely to neither  i love to have two strings to my bow  if one of them as you think can help me by itself my reason tells me that both can help me better  therefore will i be righteous and good and will seek by my goodness to be commended to the mercy of god  for surely he that hath something of his own to ingratiate himself into the favour of his prince withal shall sooner obtain his mercy and favour than one that comes to him stripped of all good  i answer but there are not two ways to heaven  there is but one new and living way which christ hath consecrated for us through the vail that is to say his flesh and besides that one there is no more heb x 1924  why then dost thou talk of two strings to thy bow what became of him that had and would have two stools to sit on yea the text says plainly that therefore they obtained not righteousness because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law  see here they are disowned by the gospel because they sought it not by faith that is by faith only  again the law and the righteousness thereof flies from them nor could they attain it though they follow after it because they sought it not by faith  mercy then is to be found alone in jesus christ  again the righteousness of the law is to be obtained only by faith of jesus christ that is in the son of god is the righteousness of the law to be found for he by his obedience to his father is become the end of the law for righteousness  and for the sake of his legal righteousness which is also called the righteousness of god because it was god in the flesh of the lord jesus that did accomplish it is mercy and grace from god extended to whoever dependeth by faith upon god by this jesus his righteousness for it  and hence it is that we so often read that this jesus is the way to the father that god for christs sake forgiveth us that by the obedience of one many are made righteous or justified and that through this man is preached to us the forgiveness of sins and that by him all that believe are justified from all things from which they could not be justified by the law of moses  now though i here do make mention of righteousness and mercy yet i hold there is but one way to wit to eternal life which way as i said is jesus christ for he is the new the only new and living way to the father of mercies for mercy to make me capable of abiding with him in the heavens for ever and ever  but sayst thou i will be righteous in myself that i may have wherewith to commend me to god when i go to him for mercy  i answer but thou blind pharisee i tell thee thou hast no understanding of gods design by the gospel which is not to advance mans righteousness as thou dreamest but to advance the righteousness of his son and his grace by him  indeed if gods design by the gospel was to exalt and advance mans righteousness then that which thou hast said would be to the purpose for what greater dignity can be put upon mans righteousness than to admit it  i say then for god to admit it to be an advocate an intercessor a mediator for all these are they which prevail with god to shew me mercy  but this god never thought of much less could he thus design by the gospel for the text runs flat against it  not of works not of works of righteousness which we have done not of works lest any man should boast saying well i may thank my own good life for mercy  it was partly for the sake of my own good deeds that i obtained mercy to be in heaven and glory  shall this be the burden of the song of heaven or is this that which is composed by that glittering heavenly host and which we have read of in the holy book of god  no no that song runs upon other feetstandeth in far better strains being composed of far higher and truly heavenly matter  for god has predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved  in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace eph i  and it is requisite that the song be framed accordingly wherefore he saith that the heavenly song runs thus thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and hast made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth rev v 9 10  he saith not that they have redeemed or helped to redeem and deliver themselves but that the lamb the lamb that was slain the lamb only was he that redeemed them  nor saith he that they had made themselves kings and priests unto god to offer any oblation sacrifice or offering whatsoever but that the same lamb had made them such  for they as is insinuated by the text were in among one with and no better than the kindreds tongues nations and people of the earth  better  no in no wise saith paul rom iii 9 therefore their separation from them was of mere mercy free grace good will and distinguishing love not for or because of works of righteousness which any of them have done no they were all alike  but these because beloved when in their blood according to ezek xvi were separated by free grace and as another scripture hath it redeemed from the earth and from among men by blood rev xiv 3 4  wherefore deliverance from the ireful wrath of god must not neither in whole nor in part be ascribed to the whole law or to all the righteousness that comes by it but to this lamb of god jesus the saviour of the world for it is he that delivered us from the wrath to come and that according to gods appointment for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by or through our lord jesus christ 1 thess i 10 v 9  let every man therefore take heed what he doth and whereon he layeth the stress of his salvation for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is jesus christ 1 cor iii ii  but dost thou plead still as thou didst before and wilt thou stand thereto  why then thy design must overcome god or gods design must overcome thee  thy design is to give thy good life thy good deeds a part of the glory of thy justification from the curse  and gods design is to throw all thy righteousness out into the street into the dirt and dunghill as to that thou art for glory and for glorying here before god yea thou art sharing in the glory of justification when that alone belongeth to god  and he hath said my glory will i not give to another  thou wilt not trust wholly to gods grace in christ for justification and god will not take thy stinking righteousness in as a partner in thy acquitment from sin death wrath and hell  now the question is who shall prevail god or the pharisee and whose word shall stand his the pharisees  alas the pharisee here must needs come down for god is greater than all  also he hath said that no flesh shall glory in his presence and that he will have mercy and not sacrifice  and again that it is not or shall be in him that wills nor in him that runs but in god that sheweth mercy  what hope help stay or relief then is there left for the meritmonger  what twig or straw or twined thread is left to be a stay for his soul  this besom will sweep away his cobweb  the house that this spider doth so lean upon will now be overturned and he in it to hellfire for nothing less than everlasting damnation is designed by god and that for this fearful and unbelieving pharisee  god will prevail against him for ever  3  but wilt thou yet plead thy righteousness for mercy  why in so doing thou takest away from god the power of giving mercy  for if it be thine as wages it is no longer his to dispose of at pleasure for that which another man oweth me is in equity not at his but at my disposal  did i say that by this thy plea thou takest away from god the power of giving mercy  i will add yea and also of disposing of heaven and life eternal  and then i pray you what is left unto god and what can he call his own  not mercy for that by thy good deeds thou hast purchased  not heaven for that by thy good deeds thou hast purchased  not eternal life for that by thy good deeds thou hast purchased  thus pharisee o thou selfrighteous man hast thou set up thyself above grace mercy heaven glory yea above even god himself for the purchaser should in reason be esteemed above the purchase  awake man  what hast thou done  thou hast blasphemed god thou has undervalued the glory of his grace thou hast what in thee lieth opposed the glorious design of heaven thou hast sought to make thy filthy rags to share in thy justification  now all these are mighty sins these have made thine iniquity infinite  what wilt thou do  thou hast created to thyself a world of needless miseries  i call them needless because thou hadst more than enough before  thou hast set thyself against god in a way of contending thou standest upon thy points and pantables thou wilt not bate god an ace of what thy righteousness is worth and wilt also make it worth what thyself shalt list  thou wilt be thine own judge as to the worth of thy righteousness thou wilt neither hear what verdict the word has passed about it nor wilt thou endure that god should throw it out in the matter of thy justification but quarrelest with the doctrine of free grace or else dost wrest it out of its place to serve thy pharisaical designs saying god i thank thee i am not as other men fathering upon thyself yea upon god and thyself a stark lie for thou art as other men are though not in this yet in that yea in a far worse condition than the most of men are  nor will it help thee anything to attribute this thy goodness to the god of heaven for that is but a mere toying the truth is the god that thou intendest is nothing but thy righteousness and the grace that thou supposest is nothing but thine own good and honest intentions  so that  4  in all that thou sayst thou dost but play the downright hypocrite  thou pretendest indeed to mercy but thou intendest nothing but merit  thou seemest to give the glory to god but at the same time takest it all to thyself  thou despisest others and criest up thyself and in conclusion fatherest all upon god by word and upon thyself in truth  nor is there anything more common among this sort of men than to make god his grace and kindness the stalkinghorse to their own praise saying god i thank thee when they trust to themselves that they are righteous and have not need of any repentance when the truth is they are the worst sort of men in the world because they put themselves into such a state as god hath not put them into and then impute it to god saying god i thank thee that thou hast done it for what greater sin than to make god a liar or than to father that upon god which he never meant intended or did  and all this under colour to glorify god when there is nothing else designed but to take all glory from him and to wear it on thine own head as a crown and a diadem in the face of the whole world  a selfrighteous man therefore can come to god for mercy no otherwise than fawningly  for what need of mercy hath a righteous man  let him then talk of mercy of grace and goodness and come in an hundred times with his god i thank thee in his mouth all is but words there is no sense nor savour nor relish of mercy and favour nor doth he in truth from his very heart understand the nature of mercy nor what is an object thereof but when he thanks god he praises himself  when he pleads for mercy he means his own merit and all this is manifest from what doth follow for saith he i am not as this publican  thence clearly insinuating that not the good but the bad should be rejected of the god of heaven  that not the bad but the good not the sinner but the selfrighteous are the most proper objects of gods favour  the same thing is done by others in this our day  favour mercy grace and god i thank thee is in their mouths but their own strength sufficiency free will and the like they are the things they mean by all such high and glorious expressions  but secondly if thy plea be not for mercy but for justice then to speak a little to that 1  justice has measures and rules to go by unto which measures and rules if thou comest not up justice can do thee no good  come then o thou blind pharisee let us pass away a few minutes in some discourse about this  thou demandest justice because god hath said that the man that doth these things shall live in and by them  and again the doers of the law shall be justified not in a way of mercy but in a way of justice  he shall live by them  but what hast thou done o blind pharisee  what hast thou done that thou art emboldened to venture to stand and fall to the most perfect justice of god  hast thou fulfilled the whole law and not offended in one point  hast thou purged thyself from the pollutions and motions of sin that dwell in thy flesh and work in thy own members  is the very being of sin rooted out of thy tabernacle  and art thou now as perfectly innocent as ever was jesus christ hast thou by suffering the uttermost punishment that justice could justly lay upon thee for thy sins made fair and full satisfaction to god according to the tenor of his law for thy transgressions  if thou hast done all these things then thou mayst plead something and yet but something for thyself in a way of justice  nay in this i will assert nothing but will rather inquire  what hast thou gained by all this thy righteousness  we will now suppose what must not be granted was not this thy state when thou wast in thy first parents  wast thou not innocent perfectly innocent and righteous  and if thou shouldst be so now what hast thou gained thereby  suppose that the man that had forty years ago forty pounds of his own and had spent it all since should yet be able now to shew his forty pounds again what has he got thereby or how much richer is he at last than he was when he first set up for himself  nay doth not the blot of his ill living betwixt his first and his last lie as a blemish upon him unless he should redeem himself also by works of supererogation from the scandal that justice may lay at his door for that  but i say suppose o pharisee this should be thy case yet god is not bound to give thee in justice that eternal which by his grace he bestoweth upon those that have redemption from sin by the blood of his son  injustice therefore when all comes to all thou canst require no more than an endless life in an earthly paradise for there thou wast set up at first nor doth it appear from what hath been said touching all that thou hast done or canst do that thou deservest a better place  did i say that thou mayst require justly an endless life in an earthly paradise  why i must add to that saying this proviso if thou continuest in the law and in the righteousness thereof else not  but how dost thou know that thou shalt continue therein  thou hast no promise from gods mouth for that nor is grace or strength ministered to mankind by the covenant that thou art under  so that still thou standest bound to thy good behaviour and in the day that thou dost give the first though ever so little a trip or stumble in thy obedience thou forfeitest thine interest in paradise and in justice as to any benefit there  but alas what need is there that we should thus talk things when it is manifest that thou hast sinned not before thou wast a pharisee but when after the most strictest sect of thy religion thou livest also a pharisee yea and now in the temple in thy prayer there thou shewest thyself to be full of ignorance pride selfconceit and horrible arrogancy and desire of vain glory c which are none of them the seat or fruits of righteousness but the seat of the devil and the fruit of his dwelling even at this time in thy heart  could it ever have been imagined that such audacious impudence could have put itself forth in any mortal man in his approach unto god by prayer as has shewed itself in thee  i am not as other men sayst thou  but is this the way to go to god in prayer  the prayer of the upright is gods delight  but the upright man glorifies gods justice by confessing to god the vileness and pollution of his state and condition  he glorifies gods mercy by acknowledging that that and that only as communicated of god by christ to sinners can save and deliver from the curse of the law  this i say is the sum of the prayer of the just and upright man job i 8 xl 4 acts xiii 22 psalm xxxviii li 2 sam vi 21 22 and not as thou most vaingloriously vauntest with thy god i thank thee i am not as other men are  true when a man is accused by his neighbours by a brother by an enemy and the like if he be clear and he may be so as to what they shall lay to his charge then let him vindicate justify and acquit himself to the utmost that in justice and truth he can for his name the preservation whereof is more to be chosen than silver and gold also his profession yea the name of god too and religion may now lie at stake by reason of such false accusations and perhaps can by no means as to this man be covered and vindicated from reproach and scandal but by his justifying of himself wherefore in such a work a man serveth god and saves religion from hurt yea as he that is a professor and has his profession attended with a scandalous life hurteth religion thereby so he that has his profession attended with a good life and shall suffer it notwithstanding to lie under blame by false accusations when it is in the power of his hand to justify himself hurteth religion also but the case of the pharisee is otherwise  he is not here adealing with men but god not seeking to stand clear in the sight of the world but in the sight of heaven itself and that too not with respect to what men or angels but with respect to what god and his law could charge him with and justly lay at his door  this therefore mainly altereth the case for a man here to stand thus upon his point it is death for he affronteth god he giveth him the lie he reproveth the law and in sum accuseth it of bearing false witness against him he doth this i say even by saying god i thank thee i am not as other men are for god hath made none of this difference  the law condemneth all man as sinners testifieth that every imagination of the thought of the heart of the sons of men is only evil and that continually wherefore they that do as the pharisee did to wit seek to justify themselves before god from the curse of the law by their own good doings though they also as the pharisee did seem to give god the thanks for all yet do most horribly sin even by their so doing and shall receive a pharisees reward at last  wherefore o thou pharisee it is a vain thing for thee either to think of or to ask for at gods hand either mercy or justice  because mercy thou canst not ask for from sense of want of mercy because thy righteousness which is by the law hath utterly blinded thine eyes and complimenting with god doth nothing and as for justice that can do thee no good but the more just god is and the more by that he acteth towards thee the more miserable and fearful will be thy condition because of the deficiency of thy so much by thee esteemed righteousness  what a deplorable condition then is a poor pharisee in  for mercy he cannot pray he cannot pray for it with all his heart for he seeth indeed no need thereof  true the pharisee though he was impudent enough yet would not take all from god he would still count that there was due to him a tribute of thanks  god i thank thee saith he  but yet not a bit of this for mercy but for that he had let him live for i know not for what he did thank himself till he had made himself better than other men  but that betterment was a betterment in none others judgment than that of his own and that was none other but such an one as was false  so then the pharisee is by this time quite out of doors  his righteousness is worth nothing his prayer is worth nothing his thanks to god are worth nothing for that what he had was scanty and imperfect and it was his pride that made him offer it to god for acceptance nor could his fawning thanksgiving better his case or make his matter at all good before god  but i will warrant you the pharisee was so far off from thinking thus of himself and of his righteousness that he thought of nothing so much as of this that he was a happy man  yea happier by far than other his fellow rationals  yea he plainly declares it when he saith god i thank thee i am not as other men are  o what a fools paradise was the heart of the pharisee now in while he stood in the temple praying to god  god i thank thee said he for i am good and holy i am a righteous man i have been full of good works i am no extortioner unjust nor adulterer nor yet as this wretched publican  i have kept myself strictly to the rule of mine order and my order is the most strict of all orders now in being  i fast i pray i give tithes of all that i possess  yea so forward am i to be a religious man so ready have i been to listen after my duty that i have asked both of god and man the ordinances of judgment and justice i take delight in approaching to god  what less now can be mine than the heavenly kingdom and glory  now the pharisee like haman saith in his heart to whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself  where is the man that so pleaseth god and consequently that in equity and reason should be beloved of god like me  thus like the prodigals brother he pleadeth saying lo these many years do i serve thee neither transgressed i at any time thy commandments luke xv 29  o brave pharisee but go on in thine orationnor yet as this publican  poor wretch quoth the pharisee to the publican what comest thou for  dost think that such a sinner as thou art shall be heard of god  god heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of god as i am as i thank god i am him he heareth  thou for thy part hast been a rebel all thy days  i abhor to come nigh thee or to touch thy garments  stand by thyself come not near me for i am more holy than thou isa lxv 5  hold stop there go no further  fie pharisee fie dost thou know before whom thou standest to whom thou speakest and of what the matter of thy silly oration is made  thou art now before god thou speakest now to god and therefore in justice and honesty thou shouldst make mention of his righteousness not of thine of his righteousness and of his only  i am sure abraham of whom thou sayst he is thy father never had the face to do as thou hast done though it is to be presumed he had more cause so to do than thou hast or canst have  abraham had whereof to glory but not before god yea he was called gods friend and yet would not glory before him but humbleth himself was afraid and trembled in himself when he stood before him acknowledging of himself to be but dust and ashes gen xviii 27 30 22 rom iv 1 2 but thou as thou hadst quite forgot that thou wast framed of that matter and after the manner of other men standest and pleadest thy goodness before him  be ashamed pharisee dost thou think that god hath eyes of flesh or that he seeth as man sees  are not the secrets of thy heart open unto him thinkest thou with thyself that thou with a few of thy defiled ways canst cover thy rotten wall that thou has daubed with untempered mortar and so hide the dirt thereof from his eyes or that these fine smooth and oily words that come out of thy mouth will make him forget that thy throat is an open sepulchre and that thou within art full of dead mens bones and all uncleanness  thy thus cleansing of the outside of the cup and platter and thy garnishing of the sepulchres of the righteous is nothing at all in gods eyes but things that manifest that thou art an hypocrite and blind because thou takest no notice of that which is within which yet is that which is most abominable to god  for the fruit alas what is the fruit of the tree or what are the streams of the fountain  thy fountain is defiled yea a defiler and so that which maketh the whole self with thy works unclean in gods sight  but pharisee how comes it to pass that the poor publican is now so much a mote in thine eye that thou canst not forbear but must accuse him before the judgmentseat of godfor in that thou sayst that thou art not even as this publican thou bringest in an accusation a charge a bill against him  what has he done  has he concealed any of thy righteousness or has he secretly informed against thee that thou art an hypocrite and superstitious  i dare say the poor wretch has neither meddled nor made with thee in these matters  but what aileth thee pharisee  doth the poor publican stand to vex thee  doth he touch thee with his dirty garments or doth he annoy thee with his stinking breath  doth his posture of standing so like a man condemned offend thee  true he now standeth with his hand held up at gods bar he pleads guilty to all that is laid to his charge  he cannot strut vapour and swagger as thou dost but why offended at this  oh but he has been a naughty man and i have been righteous sayst thou  well pharisee well his naughtiness shall not be laid to thy charge if thou hast chosen none of his ways  but since thou wilt yet bear me down that thou art righteous shew now even now while thou standest before god with the publican some though they be but small yea though but very small fruits of thy righteousness  let the publican alone since he is speaking for his life before god  or if thou canst not let him alone yet do not speak against him for thy so doing will but prove that thou rememberest the evil that the man has done unto thee yea and that thou bearest him a grudge for it too and while you stand before god  but pharisee the righteous man is a merciful man and while he standeth praying he forgiveth yea and also crieth to god that he will forgive him too mark xi 25 26 acts vii 60  hitherto then thou hast shewed none of the fruits of thy righteousness  pharisee righteousness would teach thee to love this publican but thou shewest that thou hatest him  love covereth the multitude of sins but hatred and unfaithfulness revealeth secrets  pharisee thou shouldst have remembered this thy brother in this his day of adversity and shouldst have shewed that thou hadst compassion on thy brother in this his deplorable condition but thou like the proud the cruel and the arrogant man hast taken thy neighbour at the advantage and that when he is even between the straits and standing upon the pinnacle of difficulty betwixt the heavens and the hells and hast done what thou couldst what on thy part lay to thrust him down to the deep saying i am not even as this publican  what cruelty can be greater what rage more furious and what spite and hatred more damnable and implacable than to follow or take a man while he is asking of mercy at gods hands and to put in a caveat against his obtaining of it by exclaiming against him that he is a sinner  the master of righteousness doth not so  do not think saith he that i will accuse you to the father  the scholars of righteousness do not do so  but as for me said david when they mine enemies were sick and the publican here was sick of the most malignant disease my clothing was of sackcloth i humbled my soul with fasting and my prayer to wit that i made for them returned into mine own bosom  i behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother  i bowed down heavily as one that mourneth for his mother john v 45 psalm xxxv 13 14  pharisee dost thou see here how contrary thou art to righteous men now then where shall we find out one to parallel thee but by finding him out that is called the dragon for he it is that accuseth the poor sinners before god  zech iii rev xii  i am not as this publican  modesty should have commanded thee to have bit thy tongue as to this  what could the angels think but that revenge was now in thine heart and but that thou comest up into the temple rather to boast of thyself and accuse thy neighbour than to pray to the god of heaven for what petition is there in all thy prayer that gives the least intimation that thou hast the knowledge of god or thyself  nay what petition of any kind is there in thy vainglorious oration from first to last  only an accusation drawn up and that against one helpless and forlorn against a poor man because he is a sinner drawn up i say against him by thee who canst not make proof of thyself that thou art righteous but come to proofs of righteousness and thou art wanting also  what though thy raiment is better than his thy skin may be full as black yea what if thy skin be whiter than his thy heart may be yet far blacker yea it is so for the truth hath spoken it for within you are full of excess and all uncleanness matt xxiii  pharisee these are transgressions against the second table and the publican shall be guilty of them but there are sins also against the first table and thou thyself art guilty of them  the publican in that he was an extortioner unjust and an adulterer made it thereby manifest that he did not love his neighbour and thou by making a god a saviour a deliverer of thy filthy righteousness dost make it appear that thou dost not love thy god for as he that taketh or that derogateth from his neighbour in that which is his neighbours due sinneth against his neighbour so he that taketh or derogateth from god sinneth against god  now then though thou hast not as thou dost imagine played at that low game as to derogate from thy neighbour yet thou hast played at that high game as to derogate from thy god for thou hast robbed god of the glory of salvation yea declared that as to that there is no trust to be put in him  lo this is the man that made not god his strength but trusted in the abundance of his riches and strengthened himself in his wickedness psalm lii 7  what else means this great bundle of thy own righteousness which thou hast brought with thee into the temple yea what means else thy commending of thyself because of that and so thy implicit prayer that thou for that mightst find acceptance with god  all this what does it argue i say but thy diffidence of god and that thou countest salvation safer in thine own righteousness than in the righteousness of god and that thy own love to and care of thy own soul is far greater and so much better than is the care and love of god  and is this to keep the first table yea the first branch of that table which saith thou shalt love the lord thy god for thy thus doing cannot stand with love to god  how can that man say i love god who from his very heart shrinketh to trust in him  or how can that man say i would glorify god who in his very heart refuseth to stand and fall by his mercy  suppose a great man should bid all the poor of the parish to his house to dinner and should moreover send by the mouth of his servant saying my lord hath killed his fatlings hath furnished his table and prepared his wine nor is there want of anything come to the banquet  would it not be counted as an high affront to great contempt of and much distrust in the goodness of the man of the house if some of these guests should take with them out of their own poor store some of their mouldy crusts and carry them with them lay them on their trenchers upon the table before the lord of the feast and the rest of his guests out of fear that he yet would not provide sufficiently for those he had bidden to the dinner that he had made  why pharisee this is the very case thou hast been called to a banquet even to the banquet of gods grace and thou hast been disposed to go but behold thou hast not believed that he would of his own cost make thee a feast when thou comest  wherefore of thy own store thou hast brought with thee and hast laid upon thy trencher on his table thy mouldy crusts in the presence of the angels and of this poor publican yea and hast vauntingly said upon the whole god i thank thee i am not as other men are  i am no such needy man luke xviii 11  i am no extortioner nor unjust nor adulterer nor even as this publican  i am come indeed to thy feast for of civility i could do no less but for thy dainties i need them not i have of such things enough of mine own luke xviii 12  i thank thee therefore for thy offer of kindness but i am not as those that have and stand in need thereof nor yet as this publican  and thus feeding upon thine own fare or by making a composition of his and thine together thou contemnest god thou countest him insufficient or unfaithful that is either one that has not enough or having it will not bestow it upon the poor and needy and therefore of mere pretence thou goest to his banquet but yet trustest to thy own and to that only  this is to break the first table and so to make thyself a sinner of the highest form  for the sins against the first table are sins of an higher nature than are the sins against the second  true the sins of the second table are also sins against god because they are sins against the commandments of god  but the sins that are against the first table are sins not only against the command but against the very love strength holiness and faithfulness of god  and herein stands thy condition thou hast not thou sayst thou hast not done injury to thy neighbour but what of that if thou hast reproached thy maker  pharisee i will assure thee thou art beside the saddle thy state is not good thy righteousness is so far off from doing any good that it maketh thee to be a greater sinner because it signifieth more immediately against the mercy the love the grace and goodness of god than the sins of other sinners as to degree do  and as they are more odious and abominable in the sight of god as they needs must if what is said be true as it is so they are more dangerous to the life and soul of man for that they always appear unto him in whom they dwell and to him that trusteth in them not to be sins and transgressions but virtues and excellent things not things that set a man further off but the things that bring a man nearer god than those that want them are or can be  this therefore is the dangerous estate of those that go about to establish their own righteousness that neither have nor can while they are so doing submit themselves to the righteousness of god rom x 3  it is far more easy to persuade a poor wretch whose life is debauched and sins are written in his forehead to submit to the righteousness of god that is to the righteousness that is of gods providing and giving than it is to persuade a selfrighteous man to do it for the profane is sooner convinced of the necessity of righteousness to save him as that he has none of his own and accepteth of and submitteth himself to the help and salvation that is in the righteousness and obedience of another  and upon this account it is that christ saith the publicans and harlots enter into the kingdom of heaven before the scribes and pharisees matt xxi 31  poor pharisee what a loss art thou at thou art not only a sinner but a sinner of the highest form  not a sinner by such sins by such sins chiefly as the second table doth make manifest but a sinner chiefly in that way as no selfrighteous man did ever dream of  for when the righteous man or pharisee shall hear that he is a sinner he replieth i am not as other men are  and because the common and more ordinary description of sin is the transgression against the second table he presently replieth again i am not as this publican is and so shroudeth himself under his own lame endeavours and ragged partial patches of moral or civil righteousness  wherefore when he heareth that his righteousness is condemned slighted and accounted nothing worth then he fretteth and fumeth and would kill the man that so slighteth and disdaineth his goodly righteousness but christ and the true gospelteacher still go on and condemn all his righteousness as menstruous rags as an abomination to god and nothing but loss and dung  now menstruous rags things that are an abomination and dung are not fit matter to make a garment of to wear when i come to god for life much less to be made my friend my advocate my mediator and spokesman when i stand betwixt heaven and hell isa lxiv 6 luke xvi 15 phil iii 68 to plead for me that i might be saved  perhaps some will blame me and count me also worthy thereof because i do not distinguish betwixt the matter and the manner of the pharisees righteousness  and let them condemn me still for saving the holy law which is neither the matter nor manner of the pharisees righteousness but rather the rules if he will live thereby up to which he should completely come in every thing that he doth  and i say again that the whole of the pharisees righteousness is sinful though not with and to men yet with and before the god of heaven  sinful i say it is and abominable both in itself and also in its effects  1  in itself for that it is imperfect scanty and short of the rule by which righteousness is enjoined and even with which every act should be for shortness here even every shortness in these duties is sin and sinful weakness wherefore the curse taketh hold of the man for coming short but that it could not justly do if his coming short was not his sin  cursed is every one that doth not and that continueth not to do all things written in the law deut xxvii 26 gal iii 10  2  it is sinful because it is wrought by sinful flesh for all legal righteousness is a work of the flesh rom iv 1 c phil iii 38  a work i say of the flesh even of that flesh who or which also committeth the greatest enormities for the flesh is but one though its workings are divers  sometimes in a way most notoriously sensual and devilish causing the soul to wallow in the mire  but these are not all the works of the flesh the flesh sometimes will attempt to be righteous and set upon doing actions that in their perfection would be very glorious and beautiful to behold  but because the law is only commanding words and yieldeth no help to the man that attempts to perform it and because the flesh is weak and cannot do of itself that therefore this most glorious work of the flesh faileth  but i say as it is a work of the flesh it cannot be good forasmuch as the hand that worketh it is defiled with sin for in a good man one spiritually good that is in his flesh there dwells no good thing but consequently that which is bad how then can the flesh of a carnal graceless man and such a one is every pharisee and self righteous man in the world produce though it joineth itself to the law to the righteous law of god that which is good in his sight  if any shall think that i pinch too hard because i call mans righteousness which is of the law of the righteous law of god flesh let them consider that which follows  to wit that though man by sin is said to be dead in sin and trespasses yet not so dead but that he can act still in his own sphere that is to do and choose to do either that which by all men is counted base or that which by some is counted good though he is not nor can all the world make him capable of doing any thing that may please his god  man by nature as dead as he is can and that with the will of his flesh will his own salvation  man by nature can and that by the power of the flesh pursue and follow after his own salvation but then he wills it and pursues or follows after it not in gods way but his own not by faith in christ but by the law of moses  see rom ix 16 31 x 3 7  wherefore it is no error to say that a man naturally has will and a power to pursue his will and that as to his own salvation  but it is a damnable error to say that he hath will and power to pursue it and that in gods way  for then we must hold that the mysteries of the gospel are natural for that natural men or men by nature may apprehend and know them yea and know them to be the only means by which they must obtain eternal life for the understanding must act before the will yea a man must approve of the way to life by jesus christ before his mind will budge or stir or move that way  but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god of the gospel for they are foolishness to him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned  he receiveth not these things that is his mind and will lie cross unto them for he counts them foolishness nor can all the natural wisdom in the world cause that his will should fall in with them because it cannot discern them  nature discerneth the law and the righteousness thereof yea it discerneth it and approveth thereof that is that the righteousness of it is the best and only way to life and therefore the natural will and power of the flesh as here you see in the pharisee do steer their course by that to eternal life 1 cor ii 14  the righteousness of the law therefore is a work of the flesh a work of sinful flesh and therefore must needs be as filth and dung and abominable as to that for which this man hath produced it and presented it in the temple before god  nor is the pharisee alone entangled in this mischief many souls are by these works of the flesh flattered as also the pharisee was into an opinion that their state is good when there is nothing in it the most that their conversion amounteth to is the publican is become a pharisee the open sinner is become a selfrighteous man of the black side of the flesh he hath had enough now therefore with the white side of the flesh he will recreate himself  and now most wicked must he needs be that questioneth the goodness of the state of such a man  he of a drunkard a swearer an unclean person a sabbathbreaker a liar and the like is become reformed a lover of righteousness a strict observer doer and trader in the formalities of the law and a herder with men of his complexion  and now he is become a great exclaimer against sin and sinners denying to be acquaint with those that once were his companions saying i am not even as this publican  to turn therefore from sin to mans righteousness yea to rejoice in confidence that thy state is better than is that of the publican i mean better in the eyes of divine justice and in the judgment of the law and yet to be found by the law not in the spirit but in the flesh not in christ but under the law not in a state of salvation but of damnation is common among men  for they and they only are the right men who worship god in the spirit and rejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh  where by flesh must not be meant the horrible transgressions against the law though they are also called the works of the flesh gal iv 29 for they minister no occasion unto men to have confidence in them towards god  but that is that which is insinuated by paul where he saith he had no confidence in the flesh though he might have had it as he said though i might also have confidence in the flesh  if any other man saith he thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh i more phil iii 3 4 and then he repeats a twofold privilege that he had by the flesh  1  that he was one of the seed of abraham and of the tribe of benjamin an hebrew of the hebrews c  2  that he had fallen in with the strictest men of that religion which was such after the flesh to wit to be a pharisee and was the son of a pharisee had much fleshly zeal for god and touching the righteousness which is of the law blameless phil iii 3 5 6  but i say still there is nothing but flesh fleshly privileges and fleshly righteousness and so consequently a fleshly confidence and trust for heaven  this is manifest when the man had his eyes enlightened he counted all loss and dung that he might be found in christ not having his own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith  and this leads me to another thing and that is to tell thee o thou blind pharisee that thou canst not be in a safe condition because thou hast thy confidence in the flesh that is in the righteousness of the flesh  for all flesh is grass and all the glory of it as the flower of the field and the flesh and the glory of that being as weak as the grass which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven is but a weak business for a man to venture his eternal salvation upon  wherefore as i also hinted before the godlywise have been afraid to be found in their righteousness i mean their own personal righteousness though that is far better than can be the righteousness of any carnal man  for the godly mans righteousness is wrought by the spirit and faith of christ but the ungodly mans righteousness is of the flesh and of the law  yet i say this godly man is afraid to stand by his righteousness before the tribunal of god as is manifest in these following particulars  1  he sees sin in his righteousness for so the prophet intimates when he saith all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags isa lxiv but there is nothing can make ones righteousness filthy but sin  it is not the poor the low the mean the sickly the beggarly state of man nor yet his being hated of devils persecuted of men broken under necessities reproaches distresses or any kind of troubles of this nature that can make the godly mans righteousness filthy nothing but sin can do it and that can doth hath and will do it  nor can any man be he who he will and though he watches prays strives denies himself and puts his body under what chastisement or hardships he can yea though he also get his spirit and soul hoisted up to the highest peg or pin of sanctity and holy contemplation and so his lusts to the greatest degree of mortification but sin will be with him in the best of his performances  with him i say to pollute and defile his duties and to make his righteousness speckled and spotted filthy and menstruous  i will give you two or three instances for this  1  nehemiah was a man in his day one that was zealous very zealous for god for his house for his people and for his ways and so continued and that from first to last as they may see that please to read the relation of his actions yet when he comes seriously to be concerned with god about his duties he relinquisheth a standing by them  true he mentioneth them to god but confesseth that there are imperfections in them and prayeth that god will not wipe them away  wipe not out my good deeds o my god that i have done for the house of my god and for the offices thereof  and again remember me o my god concerning this also another good deed and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy and remember me o my god for good neh xiii  i do not think that by these prayers he pleadeth for an acceptance of his person as touching justification from the curse of the law as the poor blind pharisee doth but that god would accept of his service as he was a son and not deny to give him a reward of grace for what he had done since he was pleased to declare in his testament that he would reward the labour of love of his saints with an exceeding weight of glory and therefore prayeth that god would not wipe away his good deeds but remember him for good according to the greatness of his mercy  2  a second instance is that of david where he saith enter not into judgment with thy servant o lord for in thy sight shall no man living be justified psalm clxiii 2  david as i have hinted before is said to be a man after gods own heart acts xiii and as here by the spirit he acknowledges him for his servant yet behold how he shrinketh how he draweth back how he prayeth and petitioneth that god would vouchsafe so much as not to enter into judgment with him  lord saith he if thou enterest into judgment with me i die because i shall be condemned for in thy sight i cannot be justified to wit by my own good deeds  lord at the beginning of thy dealing with me by the law and my works i die therefore do not so much as enter into judgment with me o lord  nor is this my case only but it is the condition of all the world  for in thy sight shall no man living be justified  3  a third instance is that general conclusion of the apostle but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god is evident for the just shall live by faith  by this saying of st paul as he taketh up the sentence of the prophet habakkuk chap ii 4 so he taketh up this sentence yea and the personal justice of david also  no man saith he is justified by the law in the sight of god  no no just man no holy man not the strictest and most righteous man  but why not  why because the just shall live by faith  the just man therefore must die if he has not faith in another righteousness than that which is of the law called his own  i say he must die if he has none other righteousness than that which is his own by the law  thus also paul confesses of himself  i saith he know nothing by myself either before conversion or after that is i knew not that i did any thing before conversion either against the law or against my conscience for i was then touching the righteousness which is of the law blameless  also since my conversion i know nothing by myself for i have walked in all good conscience before god unto this day  a great saying i promise you  well but yet i am not hereby justified phil iii 7 acts xxiii 1 1 cor iv 4  nor will i dare to venture the eternal salvation of my soul upon mine own justice for he that judgeth me is the lord that is though i through my dimsightedness cannot see the imperfections of my righteousness yet the lord who is my judge and before whose tribunal i must shortly stand can and will and if in his sight there shall be found no more but one spot in my righteousness i must if i plead my righteousness fall for that  2  that the best of men are afraid to stand before gods tribunal there to be judged by the law as to life and death according to the sufficiency or nonsufficiency of their righteousness is evident because by casting away their own in this matter they make all the means they can for this that is that his mercy by an act of grace be made over to them and that they in it may stand before god to be judged  hence david cries out so often lead me in thy righteousness deliver me in thy righteousness  judge me according to thy righteousness  quicken me in thy righteousness  o lord says he give ear to my supplications  in thy faithfulness answer me and in thy righteousness  and enter not into judgment with thy servant o lord  for in thy sight shall no flesh living be justified  and david what if god doth thus  why then saith he my tongue shall speak of his righteousness  my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness  my mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness  yea i will make mention of thy righteousness even of thine only psalm lviii xxxi 1 xxxv 24 cxix 40 xxxv 28 li 14 lxxi 15 16  daniel also when he comes to plead for himself and his people he first casts away his and their righteousness saying for we do not present our supplications unto thee for our righteousness  and he pleads gods righteousness and that he might have a share and interest in that saying o lord righteousness belongeth to thee to wit that righteousness for the sake of which mercy and forgiveness and so heaven and happiness is extended to us  righteousness belongeth to thee and is thine as nearly as sin shame and confusion are ours and belongeth to us  read the 16th and 17th verses of the 9th of daniel  o lord saith he according to all thy righteousness i beseech thee let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city jerusalem thy holy mountain because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us  now therefore o our god hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate for the lords sake  for the sake of the lord jesus christ for on him daniel now had his eye and through him to the father he made his supplication yea and the answer was according to his prayer to wit that god would have mercy on jerusalem and that he would in his time send the lord the messias to bring them in everlasting righteousness for them  paul also as i have hinted before disclaims his own righteousness and layeth fast hold on the righteousness of god seeking to be found in that not having his own righteousness for he knew that when the rain descends the winds blow and the floods come down on all men they that have but their own righteousness must fall phil iii  now the earnest desire of the righteous to be found in gods righteousness ariseth from strong conviction of the imperfections of their own and the knowledge that was given them of the terror that will attend men at the day of the fiery trial to wit the day of judgement  for although men can now flatter themselves into a fools paradise and persuade themselves that all shall be well with them then for the sake of their own silly and vainglorious performances yet when the day comes that shall burn like an oven and when all that have done wickedly shall be as stubble and so will all appear to be that are not found in christ then will their righteousness vanish like smoke or be like fuel for that burning flame  and hence the righteousness that the godly seek to be found in is called the name of the lord a strong tower a rock a shield a fortress a buckler a rock of defence unto which they resort and into which they run and are safe  the godly therefore do not as this pharisee bring their own righteousness into the temple and there buoy up themselves and spirits by that into a conceit that for the sake of that god will be merciful and good unto them but throwing away their own they make to god for his because they certainly know even by the word of god that in the judgment none can stand the trial but those that are found in the righteousness of god  3  that the best of men are afraid to stand before gods tribunal by the law there to be judged to life and death according to the sufficiency or nonsufficiency of their righteousness is evident for they know that it is a vain thing to seek by acts of righteousness to make themselves righteous men as is the way of all them that seek to be justified by the deeds of the law  and herein lieth the great difference between the pharisee and the true christian man  the pharisee thinks by acts of righteousness he shall make himself a righteous man  therefore he cometh into the presence of god well furnished as he thinks with his negative and positive righteousness  grace suffereth not a man to boast before god whatever he saith before men  his soul that is lifted up is not upright in him and better is the poor in spirit than the proud in spirit  the pharisee was a very proud man a proud ignorant man proud of his own righteousness and ignorant of gods  for had he not he could not as he did have so condemned the publican and justified himself  and i say again that all this pride and vainglorious show of the pharisee did arise from his not being acquainted with this that a man must be good before he can do good he must be righteous before he can do righteousness  this is evident from paul who insinuateth this as the reason why none do good even because there is none that is righteous no not one  there is none righteous saith he and then follows there is none that doeth good rom iii 10 11 12 for it is not possible for a man that is not first made righteous by the god of heaven to do any thing that in a gospelsense may be called righteousness  to make himself a righteous man by his so meddling with them he may design but work righteousness and so by such works of righteousness make himself a righteous man he cannot  the righteousness of a carnal man is indeed by god called righteousness but it must be understood as spoken in the dialect of the world  the world indeed calls it righteousness and it will do no harm if it bear that term with reference to worldly matters hence worldly civilians are called good and righteous men and so such as christ under that notion neither died for nor giveth his grace unto rom v 7 8  but we are not now discoursing about any other righteousness than that which is so accounted either in a law or in a gospelsense and therefore let us a little more touch upon that  a man then must be righteous in a lawsense before he can do acts of righteousness i mean that are such in a gospelsense  hence first you have true gospelrighteousness made the fruit of a second birth  if ye know that christ is righteous know ye that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him 1 john ii 29  not born of him by virtue of his own righteous actions but born of him by virtue of christs mighty working with his work upon the soul who afterwards from a principle of life acteth and worketh righteousness  and he saith again little children let no man deceive you  he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous upon this scripture i will a little comment for the proof of what is urged before  namely that a man must be righteous in a lawsense before he can do such things that may be called acts of righteousness in a gospelsense  and for this this scripture 1 john iii 7 ministereth to us two things to be considered by us  the first is that he that doth righteousness is righteous  the second is that he that doth righteousness is righteous as christ is righteous  first he that doth righteousness that is righteousness which the gospel calleth so is righteous that is precedent to or before he doth that righteousness  for he doth not say he shall make his person righteous by acts of righteousness that he shall do for then an evil tree may bear good fruit yea and may make itself good by doing so but he saith he that doth righteousness is righteous as he saith he that doth righteousness is born of him  so then a man must be righteous before he can do righteousness before he can do righteousness in a gospelsense  our second thing then is to inquire with what righteousness a man must be righteous before he can do that which in a gospelsense is called righteousness  and first i answer he must be righteous in a lawsense  that is he must be righteous in the judgment of the law  this is evident because he saith he that doeth righteousness is righteous as he is righteous  that is in a lawsense  for christ in no sense is righteous in the judgment of charity only but in his meanest acts if it be lawful to make such comparison he was righteous in a law sense or in the judgment of the law  now the apostle saith that he that doeth righteousness is righteous as he is righteous  they are the words of god and therefore i cannot err in quoting of them though i may not so fully as i would make the glory of them shine in speaking to them  but what righteousness is that with which a man must stand righteous in the judgment of the law before he shall or can be found to do acts of righteousness that by the gospel are so called  1  i answer first it is none of his own which is of the law you may be sure  for he hath his righteousness before he doth any that can be called his own  he that doeth righteousness is righteous already precedent to or before he doth that righteousness yea he is righteous even as he is righteous  2  it cannot be his own which is of the gospel that is that which floweth from a principle of grace in the soul  for he is righteous before he doth this righteousness  he that doeth righteousness is righteous  he doth not say he that hath done it but he that doth it respecting the act while it is in doing he is righteous  he is righteous even then when he is adoing of the very first act of righteousness but an act while it is doing cannot until it is done be called an act of righteousness yet saith the text he is righteous  but again if an act while it is doing cannot be called an act of righteousness to be sure it cannot have such influences as to make the actor righteousto make him righteous as the son of god is righteous and yet the righteousness with which this doer is made righteous and that before he doth righteousness is such for so saith the text that makes him righteous as he is righteous  besides it cannot be his own which is gospelrighteousness flowing from a principle of grace in the soul for that in its greatest perfection in us while we live in this world is accompanied with some imperfections to wit our faith love and whole course of holiness is wanting or hath something lacking in it  they neither are apart nor when put all together perfect as to the degree the uttermost degree of perfection  but the righteousness under consideration with which the man in that of john is made righteous is a perfect righteousness not only with respect to the nature of it as a penny is as perfect silver as a shilling nor yet with respect to a comparative degree for so a shilling arriveth more toward the perfection of the number twenty than doth a twopenny or a threepenny piece but it is a righteousness so perfect that nothing can be added to nor can any thing be taken from it for so implieth the words of the text he is righteous as christ is righteous yea thus righteous before and in order to his doing of righteousness  and in this he is like unto the son of god who was also righteous before he did acts of righteousness referring to a law of commandment wherefore it is said that as he is so are we in this world  as he is or was righteous before he did acts of righteousness among men by a law so are his righteous before they act righteousness among men by a law  he that doeth righteousness is righteous as he is righteous  christ was righteous before he did righteousness with a twofold righteousness  he had a righteousness as he was god his godhead was perfectly righteous  yea it was righteousness itself  his human nature was perfectly righteous it was naturally spotless and undefiled  thus his person was righteous and so qualified to do that righteousness that because he was born of woman and made under the law he was bound by the law to perform  now as he is so are we not by way of natural righteousness but by way of resemblance thereunto  had christ in order to his working of righteousness a two fold righteousness inherent in himselfthe christian in order to his working of righteousness had belonging to him a twofold righteousness  did christs twofold righteousness qualify him for that work of righteousness that was of god designed for him to dowhy the christians twofold righteousness doth qualify him for that work of righteousness that god hath ordained that he should do and walk in this world  but you may ask what is that righteousness with which a christian is made righteous before he doth righteousness  i answer it is a twofold righteousness  1  it is a righteousness put upon him  2  it is a righteousness put into him  for the first it is a righteousness put upon him with which also he is clothed as with a coat or mantle rom iii 22 and this is called the robe of righteousness and this is called the garment of salvation isa lxi 10  this righteousness is none other but the obedience of christ the which he performed in the days of his flesh and can properly be called no mans righteousness but the righteousness of christ because no man had a hand therein but he completed it himself  and hence it is said that by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous rom v 19  by the obedience of one of one man jesus christ as you have it in verse 15 for he came down into the world to this very end that is to make a generation righteous not by making of them laws and prescribing unto them rules for this was the work of moses who said and it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these commandments before the lord our god as he hath commanded us deut vi 25 xxiv 13 nor yet by taking away by his grace the imperfections of their righteousness and so making of that perfect by additions of his own but he makes them righteous by his obedience not in them but for them while he personally subjected himself to his fathers law on our behalf that he might have a righteousness to bestow upon us  and hence we are said to be made righteous while we work not and to be justified while ungodly rom iv 5 which can be done by no other righteousness than that which is the righteousness of christ by performance the righteousness of god by donation and our righteousness by imputation  for i say the person that wrought this righteousness for us is jesus christ the person that giveth it to us is the father who hath made christ to be unto us righteousness and hath given him to us for this very end that we might be made the righteousness of god in him 1 cor i 4 2 cor v 21  and hence it is often said one shall say surely in the lord have i righteousness and strength  and again in the lord shall all the seed of israel be justified and shall glory  this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me saith the lord isa xlv 24 25 liv 17  this righteousness is that which justifieth and which secureth the soul from the curse of the law by hiding through its perfection all the sins and imperfections of the soul  hence it follows even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered  blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin rom iv  and this it doth even while the person that by grace is made a partaker is without good works and so ungodly  this is the righteousness of christ christs personal performances which he did when he was in this world that is that by which the soul while naked is covered and so hid as to its nakedness from the divine sentence of the law  i spread my skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness ezek xvi 49  now this obediential righteousness of christ consisteth of two parts 1  in a doing of that which the law commanded us to do 2  in a paying that price for the transgression thereof which justice hath said shall be required at the hand of man and that is the cursed death  in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die the death to wit the death that comes by the curse of the law  so then christ having brought in that part of obedience for us which consisteth in a doing of such obediential acts of righteousness which the law commands he adds thereto the spilling of his blood to be the price of our redemption from that cursed death that by sin we had brought upon our bodies and souls  and thus are the christians perfectly righteous they have the whole obedience of christ made over to them to wit that obedience that standeth in doing the law and that obedience that standeth in paying of a price for our transgressions  so then doth the law call for righteousness here it is  doth the law call for satisfaction for our sins  here it is and what can the law say any more to the sinner but that which is good when he findeth in the personal obedience of christ for him that which answereth to what it can command that which it can demand of us  herein then standeth a christians safety not in a bundle of actions of his own but in a righteousness which cometh to him by grace and gift for this righteousness is such as comes by gift by the gift of god  hence it is called the gift of righteousness the gift by grace the gift of righteousness by grace which is the righteousness of one to wit the obedience of jesus christ rom v 1519  and this is the righteousness by which he that doth righteousness is righteous as he is righteous because it is the very selfsame righteousness that the son of god hath accomplished by himself  nor has he any other or more excellent righteousness of which the law taketh notice or that it requireth than this  for as for the righteousness of his godhead the law is not concerned with that for as he is such the law is his creature and servant and may not meddle with him  the righteousness also of his human nature the law hath nothing to do with that for that is the workmanship of god and is as good as pure as holy and undefiled as is the law itself  all then that the law hath to do with is to exact complete obedience of him that is made under it and a due satisfaction for the breach thereof the which if it hath then moses is content  now this is the righteousness with which the christian as to justification is made righteous to wit a righteousness that is neither essential to his godhead nor to his manhood but such as standeth in that glorious person who was such his obedience to the law  which righteousness himself had with reference to himself no need of at all for his godhead yea his manhood was perfectly righteous without it  this righteousness therefore was there and there only necessary where christ was considered as gods servant and our surety to bring to god jacob again and to restore the preserved of israel  for though christ was a son yet he became a servant to do not for himself for he had no need but for us the whole law and so bring in everlasting righteousness for us  and hence it is said that christ did what he did for us  he became the end of the law for righteousness for us he suffered for us he died for us he laid down his life for us and he gave himself for us  the righteousness then that christ did fulfil when he was in the world was not for himself simply considered nor for himself personally considered for he had no need thereof but it was for the elect the members of his body  christ then did not fulfil the law for himself for he had no need thereof  christ again did fulfil the law for himself for he had need of the righteousness thereof he had need thereof for the covering of his body and the several members thereof for they in a good sense are himself members of his body of his flesh and of his bones and he owns them as parts of himself in many places of the holy scriptures eph v 30 acts ix 4 5 matt xxv 45 x 40 mark ix 37 luke x 16 1 cor xii 12 27  this righteousness then even the whole of what christ did in answer to the law it was for us and god hath put it upon them and they were righteous in it even righteous as he is righteous  and this they have before they do acts of righteousness  secondly there is righteousness put into them before they act righteous things  a righteousness i say put into them or i had rather that you should call it a principle of righteousness for it is a principle of life to righteousness  before mans conversion there is in him a principle of death to sin but when he is converted to christ there is put in him a principle of righteousness that he may bring forth fruit unto god rom vii 46  hence they are said to be quickened to be made alive to be risen from death to life to have the spirit of god dwelling in them not only to make their souls alive but to quicken their mortal bodies to that which is good rom viii 11  here as i hinted before they that do righteousness are said to be born of him that is antecedent to their doing of righteousness 1 john ii 29 born of him that is made alive with new spiritual and heavenly life  wherefore the exhortation to them is neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god rom vi 13  now this principle must also be in men before they can do that which is spiritual  for whatever seeming good thing any man doth before he has bestowed upon him this heavenly principle from god it is accounted nothing it is accounted sin and abomination in the sight of god for an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit  men do not gather grapes of thorns neither of a bramble gather figs  it is not the fruit that makes the tree but the tree that makes the fruit a man must be good before he can do good and evil before he can do evil  this is that which is asserted by the son of god himself and it lieth so level with reason and the nature of things that it cannot be contradicted  matth vii 1618 luke vi 4345  a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good  and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil  but notwithstanding all that can be said it seemeth very strange to the carnal world for they will not be otherwise persuaded but that they be good deeds that make good men and evil ones that make evil men  and so by such dotish apprehensions do what in them lieth to fortify their hearts with the mists of darkness against the clear shining of the word and conviction of the truth  and thus it was from the beginning  abels first services to god were from this principle of righteousness but cain would have been made righteous by his deeds but his deeds not flowing from the same root of goodness as did abels notwithstanding he did it with the very best he had is yet called evil  for he wanted i say the principles to wit of grace and faith without which no action can be counted good in a gospelsense  these two things then that man must have that will do righteousness  he must have put upon him the perfect righteousness of christ  and he must have that dwelling in him as a fruit of the new birth a principle of righteousness  then indeed he is a tree of righteousness and god is like to be glorified in and by him but this the pharisee was utterly ignorant of and at the remotest distance from  you may ask me next but which of these are first bestowed upon the christianthe perfect righteousness of christ unto justification or this gospelprinciple of righteousness unto sanctification  answ  the perfect righteousness of christ unto justification must first be made over to him by an act of grace  this is evident  1  because he is justified as ungodly that is whilst he is ungodly  but it must not be said of them that have this principle of grace in them that they are ungodly for they are saints and holy but this righteousness by it god justifieth the ungodly by imputing it to them when and while they as to a principle of grace are graceless  this is further manifested thus  the person must be accepted before his performance can and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering gen iv  if he had respect to abels person first yet he must have respect unto it for the sake of some righteousness but abel as yet had no righteousness for that he acted after god had a respect unto his person  and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering  but unto cain and to his offering he had no respect  the prophet ezekiel also shews us this where by the similitude of the wretched infant and of the manner of gods receiving it to mercy he shews how he received the jews to favour  first saith he i spread my skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness  there is justification i covered thy nakedness  but what manner of nakedness was it  yes it was then as naked as naked could be even as naked as in the day that it was born ezek xvi 49  and as thus naked it was covered not with any thing but with the skirt of christ that is with his robe of righteousness with his obedience that he performed of himself for that very purpose for by the obedience of one many are made righteous  2  righteousness unto justification must be first because the first duty that a christian performeth to god must be accepted not for the sake of the principle from which in the heart it flows nor yet for the sake of the person that acts it but for the sake of christ whose righteousness it is by which the sinner stands just before god and hence it is said by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain heb xi  by faith he did it but faith in respect to the righteousness that justifies for we are justified by faith not by faith as it is an acting grace but the righteousness of faith that is by that righteousness that faith embraceth layeth hold of and helpeth the soul to rest and trust to for justification of life which is the obedience of christ besides it is said by faith he offered faith then in christ was precedent to his offering  now since faith was in act before his offer and since before his offer he had no personal goodness of his own faith must look out from home i say to another for righteousness and finding the righteousness of christ to be the righteousness which by god was designed to be performed for the justification of a sinner it embraces it and through it offereth to god a more excellent sacrifice than cain  hence it follows by which he obtained witness that he was righteous by which not by his offering but by his faith for his offering simply as an offering could not have made him righteous if he had not been righteous before for an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit  besides if this be granted why had not god respect to cains offering as well as to abels  for did abel offer so did cain  did abel offer his best  so did cain his  and if with this we shall take notice of the order of their offspring cain seemed to offer first and so with the frankest will and forwardest mind but yet saith the text the lord had respect to abel and to his offering  but why to abel  why because his person was made righteous before he offered his gift  by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts that they were good and acceptable because they declared abels acceptation of the righteousness of christ through the riches of the grace of god  by faith then abel offered to god a more excellent sacrifice than cain  he shrouded himself under the righteousness of christ and so of that righteousness he offered to god  god also looking and finding him there where he could not have been as to his own apprehension no otherwise than by faith accepted of his gift by which acceptation for so you may understand it also god testifieth that he was righteous for god receiveth not the gifts and offerings of those that are not righteous for their sacrifices are an abomination unto him prov xxi 27  abel then was i say made righteous first as he stood ungodly in himself god justifieth the ungodly rom iv  now being justified he was righteous and being righteous he offered his sacrifice of praise to god or other offerings which god accepted because he believed in his son  but this our pharisee understandeth not  3  righteousness by imputation must be first because we are made so to wit by anotherby the obedience of one shall many be made righteous  now to be made righteous implies a passiveness in him that is so made and the activity of the work to lie in some body else except he had said they had made themselves righteous but that it doth not nor doth the text leave to any the least countenance so to insinuate nay it plainly affirms the contrary for it saith by the obedience of one of one man jesus christ many are made righteous by the righteousness of one rom v  so then if they be made righteous by the righteousness of one i say if many be made righteous by the righteousness of one then are they that are so as to themselves passive and not active with reference to the working out of this righteousness  they have no hand in that for that is the act of one the righteousness of one the obedience of one the workmanship of one even of christ jesus  again if they are made righteous by this righteousness then also they are passive as to their first privilege by it for they are made righteous by it they do not make themselves righteous by it  imputation is also the act of god  even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness the righteousness then is a work of christ his own obedience to his fathers law the making of it ours is the act of the father and of his infinite grace  for of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness  for god hath made jim to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him  and both these things god shewed to our first parents when he acted in grace towards them after the fall  there it is said the lord god made unto adam and unto his wife coats of skins and clothed them gen iii 21  whence note  1  that adam and his wife were naked both in gods eye and in their own verses 10 11  2  that the lord god made coats of skins  3  that in his making of them he had respect to adam and to his wife that is he made them  4  that when he had made them he also clothed them therewith  they made not the coats nor did god bid them make them but god did make them himself to cover their nakedness with  yea when he had made them he did not bid them put them on but he himself did clothe them with them  for thus runs the text unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothed them  o it was the lord god that made this coat with which a poor sinner is made righteous  and it is also the lord god that putteth it upon us  but this our pharisee understandeth not  but now if a man is not righteous before he is made so before the lord god has by the righteousness of another made him so then whether this righteousness comes first or last the man is not righteous until it cometh and if he be not righteous until it cometh then what works soever are done before it comes they are not the works of a righteous man nor the fruits of a good tree but of a bad  and so again this righteousness must first come before a man be righteous and before a man does righteousness  make the tree good and its fruit will be good  now since a man must be made righteous before he can do righteousness it is manifest his works of righteousness do not make him righteous no more than the fig makes its own tree a figtree or than the grape doth make its own vine a vine  hence those acts of righteousness that christian men do perform are called the fruits of righteousness which are by jesus christ to the glory and praise of god phil i 11  the fruits of righteousness they are by jesus christ as the fruits of the tree are by the tree itself for the truth is that principle of righteousness of which mention has been made before and concerning which i have said it comes in in the second place it is also originally to be found for us nowhere but in christ  hence it is said to be by jesus christ and again of his fulness have we all received and grace for grace john i 16  a man must then be united to christ first and so being united he partaketh of this benefit to wit a principle that is supernatural spiritual and heavenly  now his being united to christ is not of or from himself but of and from the father who as to this work is the husbandman even as the twig that is grafted into the tree officiateth not that is grafteth not itself thereunto but is grafted in by some other itself being utterly passive as to that now being united unto christ the soul is first made partaker of justification or of justifying righteousness and now no longer beareth the name of an ungodly man for he is made righteous by the obedience of christ he being also united to christ partaketh of the root and fatness of christ the root that is his divine nature the fatness that is the fulness of grace that is laid up in him to be communicated unto us even as the branch that is grafted into the olivetree partaketh of the root and fatness of the olivetree  now partaking thereof it quickeneth it groweth it buddeth and yieldeth fruit to the praise and glory of god rom xi 17  but these things as i have often said the poor pharisee was ignorant of when so swaggeringly he with his god i thank thee came into the temple to pray  and indeed in that which hath been said is something of the mystery of gods will in his way with his elect and such a mystery it is that it lieth hid for ever to nature and natural men for they think of nothing less than of this nor of nothing more when they think of their souls and of salvation than that something must be done by themselves to reconcile them to god yea if through some common convictions their understandings should be swayed to a consenting to that that justification is of grace by christ and not of works by men yet conscience reason and the law of nature not being as yet subdued by the power and glory of grace unto the obedience of christ will rise up in rebellion against this doctrine and will overrule and bow down the soul again to the law and works thereof for life  4  righteousness by imputation must be first because else faith which is a part yea a greater part of that which is called a principle of grace in the soul will have nothing to fix itself upon nor a motive to work by  let this therefore be considered by those that are on the contrary side  1  faith so soon as it has a being in the soul is like the child that has a being in the mothers lap it must have something to feed upon not something at a distance afar off to be purchased i speak now as to justification from the curse but something by promise made over of grace to the soul something to feed upon to support from the fears of perishing by the curse for sin  nor can it rest content with all duties and performances that other graces shall put the soul upon nor with any of its own works until it reaches and takes hold of the righteousness of christ  faith is like the dove which found no rest any where until it returned to noah into the ark but this our pharisee understandeth not  perhaps some may object that from this way of reasoning it is apparent that sanctification is first since the soul may have faith and so a principle of grace in it and yet as yet it cannot find christ to feed and refresh the soul withal  answ  from this way of reasoning it is not at all apparent that sanctification or a principle of grace is in the soul before righteousness is imputed and the soul made perfectly righteous thereby  and for the clearing up of this let me propose a few things  1  justifying righteousness to wit the obedience of that one man christ is imputed to the sinner to justify him in gods sight for his law calls for perfect righteousness and before that be come to and put upon the poor sinner god cannot bestow other spiritual blessings upon him because by the law he has pronounced him accursed by the which curse he is also so holden until a righteousness shall be found upon the sinner that the law and divine justice can approve of and be contented within  so then as to the justification of the sinner there must be a righteousness for god i say for the sinner and for god  for the sinner to be clothed within and for god to look upon that he may for the sake thereof in a way of justice bless the sinner with forgiveness of sins  for forgiveness of sins is the next thing that followeth upon the appearance of the sinner before god in the righteousness of christ rom iv 6 7  now upon this forgiveness follows the second blessing  christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us and so consequently hath obtained for us the forgiveness of sins  for he that is delivered from the curse hath received forgiveness of sins or rather is made partaker thereof  now being made a partaker thereof the second blessing immediately follows to wit the blessing of abraham that is the promise of the spirit through faith gal iii 13 14  but this our pharisee understandeth not  but now although it be of absolute necessity that imputed righteousness be first to the soul that is that perfect righteousness be found upon the sinner first by god that he may bestow other blessings in a way of justice  let god then put the righteousness of his son upon me and by virtue of that let the second blessing of god come into me and by virtue of that let me be made to see myself a sinner and christs righteousness and my need of it in the doctrine of it as it is revealed in the scriptures of truth  let me then believe this doctrine to be true and be brought by my belief to repentance for my sins to hungering and thirsting vehemently after this righteousness for this is the kingdom of god and his righteousness  yea let me pray and cry and sigh and groan day and night to the god of this righteousness that he will of grace make me a partaker  and let me thus be prostrate before my god all the time that in wisdom he shall think fit and in his own time he shall shew me that i am a justified person a pardoned person a person in whom the spirit of god hath dwelt for some time though i knew it not  so then justification before god is one thing and justification in mine own eyes is another not that these are two justifications but the same righteousness by which i stand justified before god may be seen of god when i am ignorant of it  yea for the sake of it i may be received pardoned and accounted righteous of him and yet i may not understand it  yea further he may proceed in the way of blessing to bless me with additional blessings and yet i be ignorant of it  so that the question is not do i find that i am righteous but am i so  doth god find me so when he seeth that the righteousness of his son is upon me being made over to me by an act of his grace  for i am justified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in jesus christ whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god rom iii 24 but this our pharisee understandeth not  i am then made righteous first by the righteousness of another and because i am thus righteous god accepteth of my person as such and bestoweth upon me his grace the which at first for want of skill and experience in the word of righteousness i make use of but poorly and have need to be certified that i am made righteous and that i have eternal life not by faith first and immediately but by the written word which is called the word of faith which word declareth unto me to whom grace and so faith in the seed of it is given that i have eternal life and that i should with boldness in peace and joy believe on the son of god heb v 13 rom xv 13 1 john v 13  but  again i in the first acts of my faith when i come at christ do not accept of him because i know i am righteous either with imputed righteousness or with that which is inherent  both these as to my present privilege in them may be hidden from mine eyes and i only put upon taking of encouragement to close with christ for life and righteousness as he is set forth to be a propitiation before mine eyes in the word of the truth of the gospel to which word i adhere as or because i find i want peace with god in my soul and because i am convinced that the means of peace is not to be found any where but in jesus christ  now by my thus adhering to him i find stay for my soul and peace to my conscience because the word doth ascertain to me that he that believeth on him hath remission of sins hath eternal life and shall be saved from the wrath to come  but alas who knows the many straits and as i may say the stress of weather i mean the cold blasts of hell with which the poor soul is assaulted betwixt its receiving of grace and its sensible closing with jesus christ  none i dare say but it and its fellows the heart knows its own bitterness and a stranger intermeddleth not with his joy prov xiv 10  no sooner doth satan perceive what god is doing with the soul in a way of grace and mercy but he endeavoureth what he may to make the renewing thereof bitter and wearisome work to the sinner  o what mists what mountains what clouds what darkness what objections what false apprehensions of god of christ of grace of the word and of the souls condition doth he now lay before it and haunt it with whereby he dejecteth casteth down daunteth distresseth and almost driveth it quite into despair  now by the reason of these things faith and all the grace that is in the soul is hard put to it to come at the promise and by the promise of christ as it is said when the tempest and great danger of shipwreck lay upon the vessel in which paul was they had much work to come by the boat acts xxvii 16  for satans design is if he cannot keep the soul from christ to make his coming to him and closing with him as hard as difficult and troublesome as he by his devices can  but faith true justifying faith is a grace is not weary by all that satan can do but meditateth upon the word and taketh stomach and courage fighteth and crieth and by crying and fighting by help from heaven its way is made through all the oppositions that appear so mighty and draweth up at last to jesus christ into whose bosom it putteth the soul where for the time it sweetly resteth after its marvellous tossings to and fro  and besides what hath been said let me yet illustrate this truth unto you by this familiar similitude  suppose a man a traitor that by the law should die for his sin is yet such an one that the king has exceeding kindness for may not the king pardon this man of his clemency yea order that his pardon should be drawn up and sealed and so in every sense be made sure and yet for the present keep all this close enough from the ears or the knowledge of the person therein concerned  yea may not the king after all leave this person with others under the same transgression to sue for and obtain this pardon with great expense and difficulty with many tears and heartachings with many fears and dubious cogitations  why this is the case between god and the soul that he saveth he saveth him pardoneth him and secureth him from the curse and death that is due unto sin but yet doth not tell him so but he ascends in his great suit unto god for it  only this difference we must make between god and the potentates of this world god cannot pardon before the sinner stands before him righteous by the righteousness of christ because he has in judgment and justice and righteousness threatened and concluded that he that wants righteousness shall die  and i say again because this righteousness is gods and at gods disposal only it is god that must make a man righteous before he can forgive him his sins or bestow upon him of his secondary blessings to wit his spirit and the graces thereof  and i say again it must be this righteousness for it can be no other that justifies a sinner from sin in the sight of god and from the sentence of the law  secondly this is and must be the way of god with the sinner that faith may not only have an object to work upon but a motive to work by  1  here as i said faith hath an object to work upon and that in the person of christ and that personal righteousness of his which he in the days of his flesh did finish to justify sinners withal this is i say the object of faith for justification whereunto the soul by it doth continually resort  hence david saith to christ be thou my strong habitation or as you have it in the margin be thou to me a rock of habitation whereunto i may continually resort psalm lxxi 3  and two things he infers by so saying  the first is that the christian is a man under continual exercises sometimes one way and sometimes another but all his exercises have a tendency in them more or less to spoil him therefore he is rather for flying to christ than for grappling with them in and by his own power  the second is that christ is of god our shelter as to this very thing  hence his name is said to be a strong tower and that the righteous run into it and are safe prov xviii 10  that also of david in the fiftysixth psalm is very pregnant to this purpose mine enemies saith he would daily swallow me up for they be many that fight against me o thou most high  and what then  why saith he i will trust in thee  thus you see faith hath an object to work upon to carry the soul unto and to secure the soul in times of difficulty and that object is jesus christ and his righteousness but  2  again as faith hath an object to work upon so it hath a motive to work by and that is the love of god in giving of christ to the soul for righteousness  nor is there any profession religion or duty and performance that is at all regarded where this faith which by such means can work is wanting  for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love so gal v 6 acteth lovely or by faith whose fruit is love though true faith hath love for its offspring but faith which worketh by love that is true saving justifying faith as it beholdeth the righteousness of christ as made over to the soul for justification so it beholdeth love love to be the cause of its so being made over  it beholdeth love in the father in giving of his son and love in the son in giving of himself to be made soulsaving righteousness for me  and seeing it worketh by it that is it is stirred up to an holy boldness of venturing all eternal concerns upon christ and also to an holy endeared affecting love of him for his sweet and blessed redeeming love  hence the apostle saith the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead  and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again 2 cor v 14 15  thus then is the heart united in affection and love to the father and the son for the love that they have shewed to the poor sinner in their thus delivering him from the wrath to come  for by this love faith worketh in sweet passions and pangs of love to all that are thus reconciled as this sinner seeth he is  the motive then whereby faith worketh both as to justification and sanctification the great motive to them i say is love the love of god and the love of christ  we love him because he first loved us  that is when our faith hath told us so for so are the words above we have known and believed the love that god hath to us  and then we love him because he first loved us  and then this commandment have we from him that he that loveth god loveth his brother also 1 john iv 1621  but this our poor pharisee understandeth not  but  5  righteousness by imputation must be first to cut off boasting from the heart conceit and lips of men  wherefore he saith as before that we are justified freely by the grace of god not through or for the sake of an holy gospelprinciple in us but through the redemption that is in jesus christ c  where is boasting then  it is excluded  by what law  of works  nay but by the law of faith  and this is the law of faith by which we are justified as before rom iii 27 28  nor can any man propound such an essential way to cut off boasting as this which is of gods providing  for what is man here to boast of no righteousness nor yet of the application of it to his soul  the righteousness is christs not the sinners  the imputation is gods not the sinners  the cause of imputation is gods grace and love not the sinners works of righteousness  the time of gods imputing righteousness is when the sinner was a sinner wrapped up in ignorance and wallowing in his vanity not when he was good or when he was seeking of it for his inward gospelgoodness is a fruit of the imputation of justifying righteousness  where is boasting then where is our pharisee then with his brags of not being as other men are  it is excluded and he with it and the poor publican taken into favour that boasting might be cut off  not of works lest any man should boast  there is no trust to be put in men those that seem most humble and that to appearance and farthest off from pride it is natural to them to boast yea now they have no cause to boast for by grace are we saved through faith and that not of ourselves it is the gift of god  not of works lest any man should boast  but if man is so prone to boast when yet there is no pound of boasting in him nor yet in what he doth how would he have boasted had he been permitted by the god of heaven to have done something though that something had been but a very little something towards his justification  but god has prevented boasting by doing as he has done eph ii 8 9  nay the apostle addeth further lest any man should boast that as to good works we are gods workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them ver 10  can the tree boast since it was god that made it such  where is boasting then  but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption  that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord 1 cor i 30 31  where is boasting then  where is our pharisee then with all his works of righteousness and with his boasts of being better than his neighbours  it may be said if we should be justified for the sake of our inherent righteousness since that righteousness is the gift of god will it not follow that boasting is in the occasion thereof cut off  answ  no for although the principle of inherent righteousness be the gift of god yet it bringeth forth fruits by man and through man and so man having a hand therein though he should have ever so little he has an occasion offered him to boast  yea if a man should be justified before god by the grace or the working of the grace of faith in him he would have ground of occasion to boast because faith though it be the gift of god yet as it acteth in man takes man along with it in its so acting yea the acting of faith is as often attributed to the man by whom it is acted and oftener than to the grace itself  how then can it be but that man must have a hand therein and so a ground therein or thereof to boast  but now since justification from the curse of the law before god lieth only and wholly in gods imputing of christs righteousness to a man and that too while the man to whom it is imputed is in himself wicked and ungodly there is no room left for boasting before god for that is the boasting intended but rather an occasion given to shame and confusion of face and to stop the mouth for ever since justification comes in a way so far above him so vastly without him his skill help or what else soever ezek xvi 6163  6  righteousness by imputation must be first that justification may not be of debt but of mercy and grace  this is evident from reason it is meet that god should therefore justify us by a righteousness of his own not of his own prescribing for that he may do and yet the righteousness be ours but of his own providing that the righteousness may be his  now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt rom iv 24  if i work for justifying righteousness and that way get righteousness my justification is not of grace but of debt  god giveth it not unto me but he oweth it unto me so then it is no longer his but mine mine not of grace but of debt  and if so then i thank him not for his remission of sins nor for the kingdom of heaven nor for eternal life for if justifying righteousness is of debt then when i have it and what dependeth thereon i have but mine own that which god oweth to me  nor will it help at all to say but i obtain it by gods grace in me because that doth not cut off my works nor prevent my having of a hand in my justifying righteousness  suppose i give a man materials even all materials that are necessary to the completing of such or such a thing yet if he worketh though the materials be mine i am to him a debtor and he deserveth a reward  thou sayst god has given thee his spirit his grace and all other things that are necessary for the working up of a complete righteousness  well but is thy work required to the finishing of this righteousness  if so this is not the righteousness that justifieth because it is such as has thy hand thy workmanship therein and so obtains a reward  and observe it righteousness justifying righteousness consisteth not in a principle of righteousness but in works of righteousness that is in good duties in obedience in a walking in the law to the pleasing of the law and the content of the justice of god  i suppose again that thou shalt conclude with me that justifying righteousness i mean that which justifies from the curse of the law resideth only in the obedience of the son of god and that the principle of grace that is in thee is none of that righteousness no not then when thou hast to the utmost walked with god according to thy gift and grace yet if thou concludest that this principle must be in thee and these works done by thee before this justifying righteousness is imputed to thee for justification thou layest in a caveat against justification by grace and also concludest that though thou art not justified by thy righteousness but by christ yet thou art justified by christs righteousness for the sake of thine own and so makest justification to be still a debt  but here the scripture doth also cut thee off  not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thine heart dost thou go to possess the land which was but a type of heaven and if our righteousness cannot give us by its excellency a share in the type be sure that for it we shall never be sharers in the antitype itself  understand therefore that the lord thy god giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness for thou art a stiffnecked people deut ix 5 6  gospelperformances therefore are not first that was first for the sake of which god did receive these people into favour with himself and that was a covenantrighteousness and where could that covenantrighteousness be found but in the prince mediator and high priest of the covenant  for it was he and he only that was appointed of god nor could any but himself bring in everlasting righteousness dan ix 24 25  this is evident from these texts last mentioned it was not for their righteousness that they possessed the land  again as it was not for their righteousness that they were made possessors of the land so it was not for the sake of their righteousness that they were made partakers of such a righteousness that did make them possess the land  this is plain to reason for personal righteousness when by us performed is of no worth to obtain of god a justifying righteousness  but if it be of no worth to obtain a justifying righteousness then it seems it is more commodious to both parties than justifying righteousness  first it is more commodious to him that worketh it and secondly it is more commodious unto him that receiveth it else why doth he for it give us a due debt and so put upon us the everlasting justifying righteousness  perhaps it will be objected that god doth all this of grace but i answer that these are but fallacious words spoken by the tongue of the crafty  for we are not now discoursing of what rewards god can give to the operations of his own grace in us but whether he can in a way of justice or how he will bestow any spiritual blessing upon sinful creatures against whom for sin he has pronounced the curse of the law before he hath found them in a righteousness that is proved to be as good justice and righteousness as is the justice and righteousness of the law with which we have to do  i assert he cannot because he cannot lie because he cannot deny himself  for if he should first threaten the transgression of the law with death and yet afterwards receive the transgressor to grace without a plenary satisfaction what is this but to lie and to diminish his truth righteousness and faithfulness yea and also to overthrow the sanction and perfect holiness of his law  his mercy therefore must act so towards the sinner that justice may be satisfied and that can never be without a justifying righteousness  now what this justifying righteousness should be and when imputed that is the question  i say it is the righteousness or obedience of the son of god in the flesh which he assumed and so his own and the righteousness of no body else otherwise than by imputation  i say again that this righteousness must be imputed first that the sinner may stand just in gods sight from the curse that god might deal with him both in a way of justice as well as mercy and yet do the sinner no harm  but you may ask how did god deal with sinners before his righteousness was actually in being  i answer he did then deal with sinners even as he dealeth with them now he justified them by it by virtue of the suretyship of him that was to bring it in  christ became surety for us and by his suretyship laid himself under an obligation for those for whom he became a surety to bring in this everlasting and justifying righteousness and by virtue of this those of his elect that came into and went out of the world before he came to perform his work were saved though the forbearance of god  wherefore before the lord came they were saved for the lords sake and for the sake of his name  and they that were spiritually wise understood it and pleaded it as their necessities required and the lord accepted them heb vii 22 rom iv 24 dan ix 17 psalm xxv 11  7  righteousness by imputation must be first that justification may be certain therefore it is of faith of the righteousness that faith layeth hold on that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed rom iv 16  that the promisewhat promise  the promise of remission of sins c might be sure  now a promise of remission of sins supposeth a righteousness going before for there is no forgiveness of sins nor promise of forgiveness for the sake of righteousness that shall be by us but that already found in christ as head and so imputed to the elect for their remission  god for christs sake hath forgiven you eph iv 32 for christs sake that this for the sake of the righteousness of christ  imputed righteousness must be first yea it must be before forgiveness and forgiveness is extended by god then when we lie in our blood though to us it is manifested afterwards therefore it is of faith he saith not by it respecting the act of faith but of respecting the doctrine or word which presenteth me with this blessed imputed righteousness  they that are of faith are the children of faithful abraham  they that are of the doctrine of faith for all the elect are the sons of that doctrine in which is this righteousness of christ contained yea they are begotten by it of god to this inheritance to their comfortable enjoyment of the comfort of it by faith  that the promise might be sure to all the seed to all them wrapped up in the promise and so begotten and born  that it might be sure implying that there is no certain way of salvation for the elect but this because god can never by other means reconcile us to himself for his heavenly eyes perceive yea they spy faults in the best of our gospel performances yea our faith is faulty and also imperfect  how then should remission be extended to us for the sake of that  but now the righteousness of christ is perfect perpetual and stable as the great mountains wherefore he is called the rock of our salvation because a man may as soon tumble the mountains before him as sin can make invalid the righteousness of christ when and unto whom god shall impute it for justice psalm xxxvi  in the margin it is said to be like the mountain of god to wit called mount zion or that moriah on which the temple was built and upon which it stood all other bottoms are fickle all other righteousnesses are so feeble short narrow yea so full of imperfections for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh christ did for us in the similitude of sinful flesh  but what could not the law do  why it could not give us righteousness nor strengthen us to perform it  it could not give us any certain solid wellgrounded hope of remission of sin and salvation  wherefore this righteousness being imputed justice findeth no fault therewith but consenteth to the extending to the sinner those blessings that tend to perfect his happiness in the heavens  8  righteousness by imputation must be first that in all things christ may have the preeminence  christ is head of the church and therefore let him have the highest honour in the soul but how can he have that if any precede as to justification before his perfect righteousness be imputed  if it be said grace may be in the soul though the soul doth not act it until the moment that justifying righteousness shall be imputed  i ask what should it do there before or to what purpose is it there if it be not acted  and again how came it thither how got the soul possession of it while it was unjustified or how could god in justice give it to a person that by the law stood condemned before they were acquitted from that condemnation  and i say nothing can set the soul free from that curse but the perfect obedience of christ nor that either if it be not imputed for that end to the sinner by the grace of god  imputed that is reckoned or accounted to him  and why should it not be accounted to him for righteousness  what did christ bring it into the world for for the righteous or for sinners  no doubt for sinners  and how must it be reckoned to them  not in circumcision but in uncircumcision not as righteous but as sinners  and how are they to consider of themselves even then when they first are apprehensive of their need of this righteousness  are they to think that they are righteous or sinners  and again how are they to believe concerning themselves then when they put forth the first act of faith towards this righteousness for justification  are they to think that they are righteous or sinners  sinners doubtless they are to reckon themselves and as such to reckon themselves justified by this righteousness  and this is according to the sentence of god as appeareth by such sayings  for when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly  but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us  for if while we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son c rom v  out of these words i gather these three things  1  that christ by gods appointment died for us  2  that by his death he reconciled us to god  3  that even then when the very act of reconciliation was in performing and also when performed we were ungodly sinners enemies  now the act by which we are said to be reconciled to god while ungodly while sinners and while enemies was christs offering himself a sacrifice for us which is in the words above mentioned called his death  christ died for the ungodly christ died for us while sinners christ reconciled us to god by his death  and as christ is said to die for us so the father is said to impute righteousness to us to wit as we are without works as we are ungodly  now to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness  he worketh not but is ungodly when this gracious act of god in imputing the righteousness of christ to him is extended when he shall believe his faith is counted to him for righteousness  and why should we not have the benefit of the righteousness since it was completed for us while we were yet ungodly  yea we have the benefit of it  for when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son  when i say the benefit i mean that benefit that we are capable of and that is justification before god for that a man may be capable of while he is in himself ungodly because this comes to him by the righteousness of another  true were it to be his own righteousness by which he was to be justified he could not  but the righteousness is christs and that imputed by god not as a reward for work or of debt but freely by his grace and therefore may be and is so while the person concerned is without works ungodly and a sinner  and he that denieth that we are capable of this benefit while we are sinners and ungodly may with the like reason deny that we are created beings  for that which is done for a man without him may be done for him at any time which they that do it shall appoint  while a man is a beggar may not i make him worth ten thousand ayear if i can and will  and yet he may not know thereof in that moment that i make him so yet the revenue of that estate shall really be his from the moment that i make him so and he shall know it too at the rent day  this is the case  we are sinners and ungodly there is a righteousness wrought out by jesus christ which god hath designed we shall be made righteous by  and by it if he will impute it to us we shall be righteous in his sight even then when we are yet ungodly in ourselves  for he justifies the ungodly  now though it is irregular and blameworthy in man to justify the wicked because he cannot provide and clothe him with a justifying righteousness yet it is glorious and for ever worthy of praise for god to do it  because it is in his power not only to forgive but to make a man righteous even then when he is a sinner and to justify him while he is ungodly  but it may be yet objected that though god has received satisfaction for sin and so sufficient terms of reconciliation by the obedience and death of his son yet he imputeth it not unto us but upon condition of our becoming good  ans  this must not be admitted  for  1  the scripture saith not so but that we are reconciled to god by the death of his son and justified too and that while or when we are sinners and ungodly  2  if this objection carrieth truth in it then it follows that the holy ghost faith and so all grace may be given to us and we may have it dwelling in us yea acting in us before we stand righteous in the judgment of the law before god for nothing can make us stand just before god in the judgment of the law but the obedience of the son of god without us  and if the holy ghost faith and so consequently the habit of every grace may be in us acting in us before christs righteousness be by god imputed to us then we are not justified as sinners and ungodly but as persons inherently holy and righteous before  but i have shewed you that this cannot be therefore righteousness for justification must be imputed first  and here let me present the reader with two or three things  1  that justification before god is one thing and justification to the understanding and conscience is another  now i am treating of justification before god not of it as to mans understanding and conscience  and i say a man may be justified before god even then when himself knoweth nothing thereof isa xl 2 mark ii 5 and while he hath not faith about it but is ungodly  2  there is justification by faith by faiths applying of that righteousness to the understanding and conscience which god hath of his grace imputed for righteousness to the soul for justification in his sight  and this is that by which we as to sense and feeling have peace with god being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ rom v 1  and these two the apostle keepeth distinct in the 10th verse  that while we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son  he addeth and not only so but we joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now received the atonement verse 11  here you see that to be reconciled to god by the death of his son is one thing and for us actually to receive by faith this reconciliation is another  and not only so but we have received the atonement  3  men do not gather their justification from gods single act of imputing of righteousness that we might stand clear in his sight from the curse and judgment of the law but from the word of god which they understand not till it is brought to their understanding by the light and glory of the holy ghost  we are not therefore in the ministry of the word to pronounce any man justified from a supposition that god has imputed righteousness to him since that act is not known to us until the fruits that follow thereupon do break out before our eyes to wit the signs and effects of the holy ghost indwelling in our souls  and then we may conclude it that is that such a one stands justified before god yet not for the sake of his inherent righteousness nor yet for the fruits thereof and so not for the sake of the act of faith but for the sake of jesus christ his doing and suffering for us  nor will it avail to object that if at first we stand justified before god by his imputing of christs righteousness unto us though faith be not in us to act we may always stand justified so and so what need of faith for therefore are we justified first by the imputation of god as we are ungodly that thereby we may be made capable of receiving the holy ghost and his graces in a way of righteousness and justice  besides god will have those that he shall justify by his grace through the redemption that is in jesus christ to have the holy ghost and so faith that they may know and believe the things not only that shall be but that already are freely given to us of god  now says paul we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god 1 cor ii 12 to know that is to believe  it is given to you to believe who believe according to the working of his mighty power and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us preceding to our believing john iv 16  he then that is justified by gods imputation shall believe by the power of the holy ghost for that must come and work faith and strengthen the soul to act it because imputed righteousness has gone before  he then that believeth shall be saved for his believing is a sign not a cause of his being made righteous before god by imputation and he that believeth not shall be damned  and thus much for the pharisee and for his information  and now i come to that part of the text which remains and which respecteth the publican  and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner  what this publican was i have shewed you both with respect to nation office and disposition  wherefore i shall not here trouble the reader as to that  we now therefore come to his repentance in the whole and in the parts of it concerning which i shall take notice of several things some more remote and some more near to the matter and life of it  but first let us see how cross the pharisee and the publican did lie in the temple one to another while they both were presenting of their prayers to god  1  the pharisee he goes in boldly fears nothing but trusteth in himself that his state is good that god loves him and that there was no doubt to be made but of his good speed in this his religious enterprise  but alas poor publican he sneaks crawls into the temple and when he comes there stands behind aloof off as one not worthy to approach the divine presence  2  the pharisee at his approach hath his mouth full of many fine things whereby he strokes himself over the head and in effect calls himself one of gods dear sons that always kept close to his will abode with him or as the prodigals brother said lo these many years do i serve thee neither transgressed i at any time thy commandment luke xv 29  but alas poor publican thy guilt as to these pleas stops thy mouth thou hast not one good thing to say of thyself not one rag of righteousness thy conscience tells thee so yea and if thou shouldst now attempt to set a good face on it and for thy credit say something after the pharisee in way of thine own commendations yet here is god on the one side the pharisee on the other together with thine own heart to give thee a check to rebuke thee to condemn thee and to lay thee even to the ground for thy insolence  3  the pharisee in his approach to god wipes his fingers of the publicans enormities will not come nigh him lest he should defile himself with his beastly rags  i am not as other men are nor yet as this publican  but the poor publican alas for him his fingers are not clean nor can he tell how to make them so besides he meekly and quietly puts up with this reflection of the pharisee upon him and by silent behaviour justifies the severe sentence of that selfrighteous man concluding with him that for his part he is wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked and not worthy to come nigh or to stand by so good so virtuous so holy and so deserving a man as our sparkling pharisee is  4  the pharisee as at feasts and synagogues chose the chief and first place for his person and for his prayer counting that the publican was not meet ought not to presume to let his foul breath once come out of his polluted lips in the temple till he had made his holy prayer  and poor publican how dost thou hear and put up this with all other affronts counting even as the pharisee counted of thee that thou wast but a dog in comparison of him and therefore not fit to go before but to come as in chains behind and forbear to present thy mournful supplication to the holy god till he had presented his in his own conceit brave gay and fine oration  5  the pharisee as he is numerous in his repeating his good deeds so is he stiff in standing to them bearing up himself that he hath now sufficient foundation on which to bear up his soul against all the attempts of the law the devil sin and hell  but alas poor publican thou standest naked nay worse than naked for thou art clothed with filthy garments thy sins cover thy face with shame nor hast thou in or of thyself any defence from or shelter against the attempts assaults and censures of thy spiritual enemies but art now in thine own eyes though in the temple cast forth into thine open field starknaked to the loathing of thy person as in the day that thou wast born and there ready to be devoured and torn in pieces for thy transgressions against thy god  what wilt thou do publican  what wilt thou do  come let us see which way wilt thou begin to address thyself to god  bethink thyself  hast thou any thing to say speak out man  the pharisee by this time has done and received his sentence  make an o yes let all the world be silent yea let the angels of heaven draw near and listen for the publican is come to have to do with god yea is come from the receipt of custom into the temple to pray to him  and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner  and is this thy way poor publican  o cunning sinner  o crafty publican thy wisdom has outdone the pharisee for it is better to apply ourselves to gods mercy than to trust to ourselves that we are righteous  but that the publican did hit the mark yea get nearer unto and more in the heart of god and his son than the pharisee the sequel will make manifest  take notice then of this profound speech of the publican god be merciful to me a sinner  yea the son of god was so delighted with this prayer that for the sake of it he even as a limner draweth out the publican in his manner of standing behaviour gestures c while he makes this prayer to god  wherefore we will take notice both of the one and of the other for surely his gestures put lustre into his prayer and repentance  1  his prayer you see is this god be merciful to me a sinner  his gestures in his prayer were in general three  1  he stood afar off  2  he would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven  3  he smote upon his breast with his fist saying god be merciful to me a sinner  to begin first with his prayer  in this prayer we have two things to consider of  1  his confession  i am a sinner  2  his imploring of help against this malady  god be merciful to me a sinner  in his confession divers things are to be taken notice of  as   1  the fairness and simplicity of his confession a sinner i am a sinner god be merciful to me a sinner  this indeed he was and this indeed he confesses and this i say he doth of godly simplicity  for a man to confess himself a sinner it is to speak all against himself that can be spoken  and man as degenerate is too much an hypocrite and too much a selfflatterer thus to confess against himself unless made simple and honest through the power of conviction upon his heart  and it is worth your noting that he doth not say he was or had been but that at that time his state was such to wit a sinner  god be merciful to me a sinner or who am and now stand before thee a sinner in my sins  now a little to shew you what it is to be a sinner for every one that sinneth may not in a proper sense be called a sinner  saints the sanctified in christ jesus do often sin but it is not proper to call them sinners  but here the publican calls himself a sinner and therefore in effect calls himself an evil tree one that beareth no good fruit one whose body and soul is polluted whose mind and conscience is defiled one who hath walked according to the course of this world and after the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience  they having their minds at enmity against god and are taken captive by the devil at his will a sinner one whose trade hath been in sin and the works of satan all his days  thus he waives all pleas and stoops his neck immediately to the block  though he was a base man yet he might have had pleas pleas i say as well as the pharisee though not so many yet as good  he was of the stock of abraham a jew an israelite of the israelites and so a privileged man in the religion of the jews else what doth he do in the temple  yea why did not the pharisee if he was a heathen lay that to his charge while he stood before god  but the truth is he could not for the publican was a jew as well as the pharisee and consequently might had he been so disposed have pleaded that before god  but he would not he could not for his conscience was under convictions the awakenings of god were upon him wherefore his privileges melt away like grease and fly from him like the chaff of the summer threshingfloor which the wind taketh up and scattereth as the dust he therefore lets all privileges fall and pleads only that he us a sinner  2  in this confession he judges and condemns himself  for a man to say i am a sinner is as much as to say i am contrary to the holiness of god a transgressor of the law and consequently an object of the curse and an heir of hell  the publican therefore goeth very far in this his confession for  3  in the third place to confess that there is nothing in him done or can be done by him that should allure or prevail with god to do any thing for him  for a sinner cannot do good no not work up his heart unto one good thought  no though he should have heaven itself if he could or was sure to burn in hellfire for ever and ever if he could not  for sin where it is in possession and bears rule as it doth in every one that we may properly call a sinner there it hath the mastery of the man hath bound up his senses in cords and chains and made nothing so odious to the soul as the things that are of the spirit of god  wherefore it is said of such that they are enemies in their minds that the carnal mind is enmity against god and that wickedness proceedeth of the wicked and that the ethiopian may as well change his skin or the leopard his spots as they that are accustomed to do evil may learn to do well col i rom viii 1 sam xxiv 13 jer xiii 23  4  in this confession he implicitly acknowledgeth that sin is the worst of things forasmuch as it layeth the soul out of the reach of all remedy that can be found under heaven  nothing below or short of the mercy of god can deliver a poor soul from this fearful malady this the pharisee did not see  doubtless he did conclude that at some time or other he had sinned but he never in all his life did arrive to a sight of what sin was  his knowledge of it was but false and counterfeit as is manifest by his cure to wit his own righteousness  for take this for a truth undeniable that he that thinks himself better before god because of his reformations never yet had the true knowledge of his sin  but the poor publican he had it he had it in truth as is manifest because it drives him to the only sovereign remedy  for indeed the right knowledge of sin in the filth and guilt and damning power thereof makes a man to understand that not any thing but grace and mercy by christ can secure him from the hellish ruins thereof  suppose a man sick of an apoplexy unto death and should for his remedy make use only of those things that are good against the second ague would not this demonstrate that this man was not sensible of the nature and danger of this disease  the same may be said of every sinner that shall make use only of those means to justify him before god that can hardly make him go for a good christian before judicious men  but the poor publican he knew the nature and the danger of his disease and knew also that nothing but mercy infinite mercy could cure him thereof  5  this confession of the publican declareth that he himself was borne up now by an almighty though invisible hand  for sin when seen in its colours and when appearing in its monstrous shape frighteth all away from god  this is manifest by cain judas saul and others who could not stand up before god under the sense and appearance of their sin but fled before him one to one fruit of despair and one to another  but now this publican though he apprehends his sin that himself was one that was a sinner yet he beareth up cometh into the temple approaches the presence of an holy and sinrevenging god stands before him and confesses that he is that man that sin had defiled and that had brought him into the danger of damnation thereby  this therefore was a mighty act of the publican  he went against the voice of conscience against sense and feeling against the curse and condemning verdict of the law  he went as i may say upon hot burning coals to one that to sin and sinners is a consuming fire  now then did the publican this of his own head or from his own mind  no verily there was some supernatural power within that did secretly prompt him on and strengthen him to this more noble venture  true there is nothing more common among wicked men than to trick and toy and play with this saying of the publican god be merciful to me a sinner not at all being sensible either what sin is or of their need of mercy  and such sinners shall find their speed in the publicans prayer far otherwise than the publican sped himself it will happen unto them much as it happened unto the vagabond jews exorcists who took upon them to call over them that had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus that were beaten by that spirit and made fly out of that house naked and wounded acts xix 13  poor sinner thou wilt say the publicans prayer and make the publicans confession and say god be merciful to me a sinner but hold dost thou do it with the publicans heart sense dread and simplicity  if not thou dost but abuse the publican and his prayer and thyself and his god and shalt find god rejecting of thee and thy prayers saying the publican i know his prayers and godly tears i know but who or what art thou and will send thee away naked  they are the hungry that he filleth with good things but the rich and the senseless he sendeth empty away  for my part i find it one of the hardest things that i can put my soul upon even to come to god when warmly sensible that i am a sinner for a share in grace and mercy  oh methinks it seems to me as if the whole face of the heavens were set against me  yea the very thought of god strikes me through i cannot bear up i cannot stand before him i cannot but with a thousand tears say god be merciful to me a sinner ezra ix 15  at another time when my heart is more hard and stupid and when his terror doth not make me afraid then i can come before him and ask mercy at his hand and scarce be sensible of sin or grace or that indeed i am before god  but above all they are the rare times when i can go to god as the publican sensible of his glorious majesty sensible of my misery and bear up and affectionately cry god me merciful to me a sinner  but again the publican by his confession sheweth a piece of the highest wisdom that a mortal man can shew because by so doing he engageth as well as imploreth the grace and mercy of god to save him you see by the text he imploreth it and now i will shew you that he engageth it and makes himself a sharer in it  he that covereth his sins shall not prosper but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy  and again if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness prov xxviii 13 1 john i 9  first in the promise of pardon he shall have mercy he shall have his sins forgiven  as also solomon prays that god will forgive them that know their own sores and they are indeed such as are sensible of the plague of their own heart 2 chron vi 29 30 1 kings viii 37 38  and the reason is because the sinner is now driven to the farthest point for confession is the farthest point and the utmost bound unto which god has appointed the publican to go with reference to his work as it is said of saul to david when he was about to give him michal his daughter to wife i desire not any dowry but an hundred foreskins of the philistines to be avenged of the kings enemies  so says god in this matter i desire no sacrifices nor legal righteousness to make thee acceptable to me  only acknowledge and confess thine iniquity that thou hast transgressed against me 1 sam xviii 25 jer iii 12 13  and though this by some may be thought to be a very easy way to come at and partake of the mercy of god yet let the sensible sinner try it and he shall find it one of the hardest things in the world  and there are two things to which man is prone that makes confession hard  first there is a great proneness in us to be partial and not thorough and plain in our confessions  we are apt to make half confessions to confess some and hide some or else to make feigned confessions flattering both ourselves and also god while we make confession unto him or else to confess sin as our own fancies apprehend and not as the word descries them  these things we are very prone to do men can confess little sins while they hide great ones  men can feign themselves sorry for sin when they are not or else in their confessions forget to judge of sin by the word  hence it is said they turned to god not with their whole hearts but as it were feignedly  they spake not aright saying what have i done  they flatter him with their mouth and lie unto him with their tongues and do their wickedness in the dark and sin against him with a high hand and then come to him and cover the altar with their tears  these things therefore demonstrate the difficulty of sincere confession of sin and that to do it as it should is no such easy thing  to right confession of sin several things must go  as  1  there must be sound conviction for sin upon the spirit  for before a man shall be convinced of the nature aggravation and evil of sin how shall he make godly confession of it  now to convince the soul of sin the law must be set home upon the conscience by the spirit of god  for by the law is the knowledge of sin  and again i had not known lust unless the law had said thou shalt not covet rom vii 7  this law now when it effectually ministereth convictionof sin to the conscience doth it by putting of life and strength and terror into sin  by its working on the conscience it makes sin revive and the strength of sin is the law rom vii 1 cor xv  it also increaseth and multiplieth sin both by the revelation of gods anger against the soul and also by mustering up and calling to view sins committed and forgotten time out of mind sin seen in the glass of the law is a terrible thing no man can behold it and live  when the commandment came sin revived and i died when it came from god to my conscience as managed by an almighty arm then it slew me  and now is the time to confess sin because now a soul knows what it is and sees what it is both in the nature and consequence of it  2  to a right confession of sin there must be sound knowledge of god especially as to his justice holiness righteousness and purity wherefore the publican here begins his confession by calling upon or by the acknowledgement of his majesty  god be merciful to me a sinner  as if he should say god o god o great god o sin revenging god i have sinned against thee i have broken thy law i have opposed thy holiness thy justice thy law and thy righteous will  o consuming fire for our god is a consuming fire i have justly provoked thee to wrath and to take vengeance on me for my transgressions  but alas how few that make confession of sin have right apprehension of god unto whom confession of sin doth belong alas it is easy for men to entertain such apprehensions of god as shall please their own humours to bear up under the sense of sin and that shall make their confession rather facile and fantastical than solid and heartbreaking  the sight and knowledge of the great god is to sinful man the most dreadful thing in the world which makes confession of sin so rare  most men confess their sins behind gods back but few to his face and you know there is ofttimes a vast difference in thus doing among men  3  to the right confession of sin there must be a deep conviction of the terribleness of the day of judgment  this john the baptist inserts where he insinuates that the pharisees want of sense of and the true confession of sin was because they had not been warned or had not taken the alarm to flee from the wrath to come  what dread terror or frightful apprehension can there be where there is no sense of a day of judgment and of our giving unto god an account for it  matth iii 7 luke iii 7  i say therefore to confession of sin there must be  1  a deep conviction of the certainty of the day of judgment namely that such a day is coming that such a day shall be  this the apostle insinuates where he saith god commandeth all men every where to repent  because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead acts xvii 30 31  this will give a sense of what the soul must expect at that day for sin and so will drive to an hearty acknowledgement of it and strong cries for a deliverance from it  for thus will the soul argue that expecteth the judgmentday and that believes that it must count for all  o my heart it is in vain now to dissemble or to hide or to lessen transgressions for there is a judgment to come a day in which god will judge the secrets of men by his son and at that day he will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will manifest the counsels of the heart  if it must be so then to what end will it be now to seek to dissemble 1 cor iv 5  this also is in the old testament urged as an argument to cause youth and persons of all sizes to recall themselves to sobriety and so to confession of their sin to god where the holy ghost saith ironically rejoice o young man in thy youth and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes  but know thou that for all these things god will bring thee into judgment  so again god shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil eccles xi 9 xii 12 14  the certainty of this i say must go to the producing of sincere confession of sin and this is intimated by the publican who within his confession addeth god be merciful to me a sinner  as if he should say if thou art not merciful to me thy judgment shall swallow me up  without thy mercy i shall not stand but fall by the judgment which thou hast appointed  2  as there must be for the producing of sincere confession of sin a deep conviction of the certainty so of the terribleness of the day of judgment  wherefore the apostle to put men on repentance which is sincere confession of sin saith for we must all appear before the judgmentseat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad  knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men 2 cor v 10 11  the terror of the lord as we see here he makes use of to persuade men to confession of sin and repentance to god for mercy  and i am persuaded that one reason that this day doth so swarm with wanton professors is because they have not sound conviction for nor go to god with sincere confession of sin  and one cause of that has been that they did never seriously fall in with nor yet sink under either the certainty or terribleness of the day of judgment  o the terrors of the lord the amazing face that will be put upon all things before the tribunal of god  yea the terror that will then be read in the face of god of christ of saints and angels against the ungodly  whoso believes and understands it cannot live without confession of sin to god and a coming to him for mercy  mountains fall upon us and cover us and hide us from the face of him that sits upon the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who is able to stand  this terror is also signified where it is said and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the very earth and the heaven fled away  and there was found no place for them  and i saw the dead small and great stand before god  and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life  and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works  and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them  and they were judged every man according to his works  and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire  this is the second death  and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire rev xx  here is terror and this is revealed in the word of god that sinners might hear and consider it and so come and confess and implore gods mercy  the terror of the lord how will it appear when he shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ  2 thess i 79  the terror of the lord how will it appear when his wrath shall burn and flame out like an oven or a fiery furnace before him while the wicked stand in his sight  matt xiii 50  the terror of the lord how will it appear while the angels at his command shall gather the wicked to burn them  as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world  the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather together out of his kingdom all things that offend and them that do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire where there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth matt xiii 4042 who can conceive this terror much more unable are men to express it with tongue or pen yet the truly penitent and sinconfessing publican hath apprehension so far thereof by the word of the testimony that it driveth him to god with a confession of sin for an interest in gods mercy  but  4  to right and sincere confession of sin there must be a conviction of a probability of mercy  this also is intimated by the publican in his confession god saith he be merciful to me a sinner  he had some glimmerings of mercy some conviction of a probability of mercy or that he might obtain mercy for his pardon if he went and with unfeigned lips did confess his sins to god  despair of mercy shuts up the mouth makes the heart hard and drives a man away from god as is manifest in the case of adam and the fallen angels  but the least intimation of mercy if the heart can but touch feel taste or have the least probability of it that will open the mouth tend to soften the heart and to make a very publican come up to god into the temple and say god be merciful to me a sinner  there must then be this holy mixture of things in the heart of a truly confessing publican  there must be sound sense of sin sound knowledge of god deep conviction of the certainty and terribleness of the day of judgment as also of the probability of obtaining mercy  but to come to that which remains i told you that there were two things that did make unfeigned confession hard  the first i have touched upon  secondly and now the second follows  and that is some private leaning to some goodness a man shall conceit that he hath done before or is doing now or that he purposeth to prevail with god for the pardon of sins  this man to be sure knows not sin in the nature and evil of it only he has some false apprehensions about it for where the right knowledge of sin is in the heart that man sees so much evil in the least transgressions as that it would break the back of all the angels of heaven should the great god impute it to them  and he that sees this is far enough off from thinking of doing to mitigate or assuage the rigour of the law or to make pardonable his own transgressions thereby  but he that sees not this cannot confess his transgressions aright for true confession consisteth in the general in a mans taking to himself his transgressions with the acknowledgment of them to be his and that he cannot stir from under them nor do anything to make amends for them or to palliate the rigour of justice against the soul  and this the publican did when he cried god be merciful to me a sinner  he made his sins his own he stood before god in them accounting that he was surely undone for ever if god did not extend forgiveness unto him  and this is to do as the prophet jeremiah bids to wit only to acknowledge our iniquities to acknowledge them at the terrible bar of gods justice until mercy takes them out of the way not by doing or promising to do either this or that good work  and the reason of this kind of confession is  1  because this carrieth in it the true nature of confession to confess and plead for mercy under the crimes confessed without shifts and evasions is the only real simple way of confession  i said i will confess my transgressions to the lord and what then and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin  mark nothing comes in betwixt confession and forgiveness of sin psalm xxxii 5 nothing of works of righteousness nothing of legal amendments nothing but an outcry for mercy and that act is so far off from lessening the offence that it greatly heightens and aggravates it  that is the first reason  2  a second reason is because god doth expect that the penitent confessors should not only confess but bear their shame on them yea saith god be thou confounded also and bear thine own shame when god takes away thine iniquity thou shalt be confounded and never open thy mouth more because of thy shame ezek xvi 52 54 62 63  we count it convenient that men when their crimes and transgressions are to be manifested that they be set in some open place with a piece paper wherein their transgressions are inserted that they may not only confess but bear their own shame  at the penitential confession of sinners god has something to do if not before men yet before angels that they may behold and be affected and rejoice when they shall see after the revelation of sin the sinner taken into the favour and abundant mercy of god luke xv  3  a third reason is for that god will in the forgiveness of sin magnify the riches of his mercy but this cannot be if god shall suffer or accept of such confession of sin as is yet intermixed with those things that will darken the heinousness of the offence  that god in the salvation and so in the confession of the sinner designs the magnifying of his mercy is apparent enough from the whole current of scripture and that any of the things now mentioned will if suffered to be done darken and eclipse this thing is evident to reason itself  suppose a man stand indicted for treason yet shall so order the matter that it shall ring in the country that his offences are but petty crimes though the king shall forgive the man much glory shall not thereby redound to the riches and greatness of his mercy  but let all things lie naked let nothing lie hid or covered let sin be seen shewn and confessed as it is in the sinner himself and then there will be in his forgiveness a magnifying of mercy  4  a fourth reason is for else god cannot be justified in his sayings nor overcome when he is judged psalm li rom iii  gods word hath told us what sin is both as to its nature and evil effects gods word hath told us that the best of our righteousness is no better than filthy rags  gods word has also told us that sin is forgiven us freely by grace and not for the sake of our amendments  and all this god shews not only in the acts of his mercy toward but even in the humiliations and confessions of the penitent for god will have his mercy to be displayed even there where the sinner hath taken his first step toward him  that as sin hath reigned unto death even so grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord rom v 21  5  a fifth reason is because god would have by the publicans conversion others affected with the displays and discoveries of wonderful grace but not to cloud and cover it with lessening of sin  for what will such say when sin begins to appear to conscience and when the law shall follow it with a voice of words each one like a clap of thunder  i say what will such say when they shall read that the publican did only acknowledge his iniquity and found grace and favour of god  that god is infinitely merciful to those or to such as in truth stand in need of mercy  also that he sheweth mercy of his own good pleasure nothing moving him thereto  i say this is the way to make others be affected with mercy as he saith by the apostle paul but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness to usward or toward us through christ jesus eph ii 47  you may also see that 1 tim i 15 16  6  another reason of this is because this is the way to heighten the comfort and consolation of the soul and that both here and hereafter  what tendeth more to this than for sinners to see and with guilt and amazement to confess what sin is and so to have pardon extended from god to the sinner as such  this fills the heart it ravishes the soul puts joy into the thoughts of salvation from sin and deliverance from wrath to come  now they return and comb to zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads  they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away isa xxxv 10  indeed the belief of this makes joy and gladness endless  7  besides it layeth upon the soul the greatest obligations to holiness  what like the apprehension of free forgiveness and that apprehension must come in through a sight of the greatness of sin and of inability to do any thing towards satisfaction to engage the heart of a rebel to love his prince and to submit to his laws  when elisha had taken the syrian captives some were for using severities towards them but he said set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink and go to their master and they did so  and what follows  so the bands of syria came no more into the land of israelhe conquered their malice with his compassion and it is the love of christ that constraineth to live to him 2 kings vi 1323 2 cor v 14  many other things might possibly be urged but at present let these be sufficient  the second thing that we made mention of in the publicans prayer was an imploring of help against this malady  god be merciful to me a sinner  in which petition i shall take notice of several things  first that a mans help against sin doth not so absolutely lie in his personal conquest as in the pardon of them  i suppose a conquest though there can indeed by man be none so long as he liveth in this world i mean a complete conquest and annihilation of sin  the publican and so every graciously awakened sinner is doubtless for the subduing of sin but yet he looketh that the chief help against it doth lie in the pardon of it  suppose a man should stab his neighbour with his knife and afterwards burn his knife to nothing in the fire would this give him help against his murder no verily nothwithstanding this his neck is obnoxious to the halter yea and his soul to hellfire  but a pardon gives him absolute help  it is god that justifies who shall condemn  rom viii  suppose a man should live many days in rebellion against god and after that leave off to live any longer so rebelliously would this help him against the guilt which he had contracted before  no verily without remission there is no help but the rebel is undone wherefore the first blessedness yea and that without which all other things cannot make one blessed it lies in pardon  blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered  blessed is the man unto whom the lord will not impute sin psalm xxxii rom iv  suppose a man greatly sanctified and made holy i say suppose it yet if the sins before committed by him be not pardoned he cannot be a blessed man  yet again suppose a man should be caught up to heaven not having his sins pardoned heaven itself cannot make him a blessed man  i suppose these thingsnot that they can beto illustrate my matter there can be no blessedness upon any man who yet remaineth unforgiven  you see therefore here that there was much of the wisdom of the holy ghost in this prayer of the publican  he was directed the right the only the next way to shelter where blessedness begins even to mercy for the pardon of his sins  alas what would it advantage a traitor to be taken up into the kings coach to be clothed with the kings royal robe to have put upon his finger the kings gold ring and to be made to wear for the present a chain of gold about his neck if after all this the king should say unto him but i will not pardon thy rebellion thou shalt die for thy treason  pardon then to him that loves life is better and more to be preferred and sought after than all other things yea it is the highest wisdom in any sinner to seek after that first  this therefore confuteth the blindness of some and the hypocrisy of others  some are so silly and so blind as quite to forget and look over the pardon of sin and to lay their happiness in some external amendments when alas poor wretches as they are they abide under the wrath of god  or if they be not quite so foolish as utterly to forget the forgiveness of sin yet they think of it but in the second place they are for setting of sanctification before justification and so seek to confound the order of god and that which is worse unto them they by so doing do what they can to keep themselves indeed from being sharers in that great blessing of forgiveness of sins by grace  but the publican here was guided by the wisdom of heaven  he comes into the temple he confesseth himself a sinner and forthwith without any delay before he removeth his foot from where he stands craves help of pardon for he knew that all other things if he remained in guilt would not help him against that damnation that belonged to a vile and unforgiven sinner  this also confuteth the hypocrites such as is our pharisee here in the text that glory in nothing so much as that they are not as other men not unjust no adulterer no extortioner nor even as this publican and thus miss of the forgiveness of sin and if they have missed of the beginning good they shall never as so standing receive the second or the third  justification sanctification glorification they are the three things but the order of god must not be perverted  justification must be first because that comes to man while he is ungodly and a sinner  justification cannot be where god has not passed a pardon  a pardon then is the first thing to be looked after by the sinner  this the pharisee did not therefore he went down to his house unjustified he set the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face when he went to inquire of the lord and as he neglected slighted scorned because he thought that he had no need of pardon therefore it was given to the poor needy and miserable publican and he went away with the blessing  publicans since this is so weighty a point let me exhort you that you do not forget this prayer of your wise and elder brother to wit the publican that went up into the temple to pray  i say forget it not neither suffer any vainglorious or selfconceited hypocrites with argument to allure you with their silly and deceitful tongues from this wholesome doctrine  remember that you are sinners as abominable as the publican wherefore do you as you have him for your pattern go to god confess in all simple honest and self abasing your numerous and abominable sins and be sure that in the very next place you forget not to ask for pardon saying god be merciful to me a sinner  and remember that none but god can help you against nor keep you from the damnation and misery that comes by sin  secondly as the publican imploreth help so notwithstanding the sentence of the law that is gone out against him he saith to god be merciful to me  and also in that he concludes himself a sinner  i say he justifieth he approveth of the sentence of the law that was now gone out against him and by which he now stood condemned in his own conscience before the tribunal of gods justice  he saith not as the hypocrite because i am innocent surely his anger shall turn from me or what have we spoken so much against thee  no he is none of these murmurs or complainers but fairly falls before the law witnesses judge and jury and consenteth to the verdict sentence and testimony of each of them jer ii 36 mal ii 13  to illustrate this a little suppose a malefactor should be arraigned before a judge and that after the witnesses jury and judge have all condemned him to death for his fact the judge again should ask him what he can say for himself why sentence of death should not pass upon him  now if he saith nothing but good my lord mercy he confesseth the indictment approveth of the verdict of the jury and consenteth to the judgment of the judge  the publican therefore in crying mercy justifieth the sentence of the law that was gone out against his sins  he wrangleth not with the law saying that was too severe though many men do thus saying god forbid for then woe be to us  he wrangleth not with the witness which was his own conscience though some will buffet smite and stop its mouth or command it to be silent  he wrangleth not with the jury which were the prophets and apostles though some men cannot abide to hear all that they say  he wrangleth not with the judge nor sheweth himself irreverently before him but in all humble gestures that could bespeak him acquiescing with the sentence he flieth to mercy for relief  nor is this alone the way of the publican but of other godly men before his time  when david was condemned he justified the sentence and the judge out of whose mouth it proceeded and so fled for succour to the mercy of god psalm li  when shemaiah the prophet pronounced gods judgments against the princes of judah for their sin they said the lord is righteous  when the church in the lamentations had reckoned up several of her grievous afflictions wherewith she had been chastised she instead of complaining doth justify the lord and approve of the sentence that was passed upon her saying the lord is righteous for i have rebelled against his commandment  so daniel after he had enumerated the evils that befel the church in his day addeth therefore hath the lord brought it upon us for the lord our god is righteous in all his works which he doth  for we obeyed not his voice 2 chron xii 6 lam i 18 dan ix 14  and this is the case with our publican  he has transgressed a law that is holy just and good  the witness that accuseth him of this is god and his conscience he is also cast by the verdict of holy men and all this he knows and implicitly confesses even in that he directs his prayer unto his judge for pardon  and it is one of the excellentest sights in the world to see or understand a sinner thus honestly receiving the sentence of the law that is gone out against him to see and hear a publican thus to justify god  and this god would have men do for these reasons  1  that it might be conspicuous to all that the publican has need of mercy  this is for the glory of the justice of god because it vindicates it in its goings out against the publican  god loveth to do things in justice and righteousness when he goeth out against men though it be but such a going out against them as only tendeth to their conviction and conversion  when he dealt with our father abraham in this matter he called him to his foot as here he doth the publican  and sinner if god counts thee worthy to inherit the throne of glory he will bring thee hither  but  2  the publican by the power of conviction stoops to and falleth under the righteous sentence gone forth against him that it might be also manifest that what afterward he shall receive is of the mere grace and sovereign goodness of god  and indeed there is no way that doth more naturally tend to make this manifest than this  for thus there is a man proceeded against for life by the law and the sentence of death is in conclusion most justly and righteously passed upon him by the judge  suppose now that after this this man lives and is exalted to honour enjoys great things and is put into place of trust and power and that by him that he has offended even by him that did pass the sentence upon him  what will all say or what will they conclude even upon the very first hearing of this story  will they not saywell whoever he was that found himself wrapped up in this strange providence must thank the mercy of a gracious prince for all these things bespeak grace and favour  but  3  as the publican falleth willingly under the sentence and justifieth the passing of it upon him so by his flying to mercy for help he declareth to all that he cannot deliver himself  he putteth help away from himself or saith it is not in me  this i say is another thing included in this prayer and it is a thing distinct from that  for it is possible for a man to justify and fall under the sentence of the judge and yet retain that with himself that will certainly deliver him from that sentence when it has done its worst  many have held up their hand and cried guilty at the bar and yet have fetched themselves off for all that but then they have not pleaded mercy for he that doth so puts his life altogether into the hands of another but privilege or good deeds either done or to be done by them  but the publican in our text puts all out of his own hand and in effect saith to that god before whom he went up into the temple to pray lord i stand here condemned at the bar of thy justice and that worthily for the sentence is good and hath in righteousness gone out against me  nor can i deliver myself  i heartily and freely confess i cannot wherefore i betake myself only to thy mercy and do pray thee to forgive the transgressions of me a sinner  o how few be there of such kind of publicans i mean of publicans thus made sensible that come unto god for mercy  mercy with most is rather a compliment i mean while they plead it with god than a matter of absolute necessity they have not awfully and in judgment and conscience fallen under the sentence nor put themselves out of all plea but the plea of mercy indeed thus to do is the effect of the proof of the vanity and emptiness of all experiments made use of before  now there is a twofold proof of experiments the one is the result of practice the other is the result of faith  the woman with her bloody issue made her proof by practice when she had spent all that she had upon physicians and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse mark v  but our publican here proves the emptiness and vanity of any other helps by one cast of faith upon the contents of the bible and by another look upon his present state of condemnation wherefore he presently without any more ado condemneth all other helps ways modes or means of deliverance and betakes himself only to the mercy of god  saying god be merciful to me a sinner  and herein he sheweth wonderful wisdom  for  1  by this he thrusts himself under the shelter and blessing of the promise and i am sure it is better and safer to do so than to rely upon the best of excellencies that this world can afford  hos xiv 13  2  he takes the ready way to please god  for god takes more delight in shewing of mercy than in any thing that we can do hos vi 6 matt ix 13 xii 7  yea and that also is the man that pleaseth him even he that hopes in his mercy psalm cxlvii 11  the publican therefore whatever the pharisee might think stood all this while upon sure ground and had by far the start of him for heaven  alas his dull head could look no further than to the conceit of the pitiful beauty and splendour of his own filthy righteousness  nor durst he leave that to trust wholly to the mercy of god but the publican comes out though in his sins yet like an awakened enlightened resolved man and first abases himself then gives god the glory of his justice and after that the glory of his mercy by saying god be merciful to me a sinner and thus in the ears of the angels he did ring the changes of heaven  and  3  the publican in his thus putting himself upon mercy sheweth that in his opinion there is more virtue in mercy to save than there is in the law and sin to condemn  and although this is not counted a great matter to do while men are far from the law and while their conscience is asleep within them yet when the law comes near and conscience is awake who so tries it will find it a laborious work cain could not do thus for his heart no nor saul nor judas either this is another kind of thing than most men think it to be or shall find it whenever they shall behold gods angry face and when they shall hear the words of his law  however our publican did it and ventured his body soul and future condition for ever on this bottom with other the saints and servants of god leaving the world to swim over the sea of gods wrath if they will in their weak and simple vessels of bulrushes or to lean upon their cobwebhold when he shall arise to the judgment that he hath appointed  in the mean time pray god awaken us as he did the publican pray god enlighten us as he did the publican pray god grant us boldness to come to him as the publican did and also in that trembling spirit as he did when he cried in the temple before him god be merciful to me a sinner  thus having passed over his prayer we come in the next place to his gestures for in my judgment the right understanding of them will give us yet more conviction of the publicans sense and awakening of spirit under this present action of his  and i have observed many a poor wretch that hath readily had recourse to the publicans prayer that never knew what the publicans gestures in the presence of god while in prayer before him did mean  nor must any man be admitted to think that those gestures of his were a custom and a formality among the jews in those days for it is evident enough by the carriage of the pharisee that it was below them and their mode when they came into the temple or when they prayed any where else and they in those days were counted for the best of men and in religious matters men were to imitate and take their examples at the hands of the best not at the hands of the worst  the publicans gestures then were properly his own caused by the guilt of sin and by that dread of the majesty of god that was upon his spirit  and a comely posture it was else christ jesus the son of god would never have taken that particular notice thereof as he did nor have smiled upon it so much as to take and distinctly repeat it as that which made his prayer the more weighty also to be taken notice of  yea in my opinion the lord jesus committed it to record for that he liked it and for that it will pass for some kind of touchstone of prayer that is made in good sense of sin and of god and of need of his goodness and mercy  for verily all these postures signify sense sight of a lost condition and a heart in good earnest for mercy  i know that they may be counterfeited and christ jesus knows who doth so too but that will not hinder or make weak or invalid what hath already been spoken about it  but to forbear to make a further prologue and to come to the handling of particulars  and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven but smote upon his breast c  three things as i told you already we may perceive in these words by which his publican posture or gestures are set forth  1  he stands afar off  2  he would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven  3  he smote upon his breast c  for the first of these he stood afar off  and the publican standing afar off  this is i say the first thing the first posture of his with which we are acquainted and it informeth us of several things  first that he came not with senselessness of the majesty of god when he came to pray as the pharisee did and as sinners commonly do for this standing back or afar off declares that the majesty of god had an awe upon his spirit he saw whither to whom and for what he was now approaching the temple  it is said in the 20th of exodus that when the people saw the thunderings and lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and all these were signs of gods terrible presence and dreadful majesty they removed themselves and stood afar off exod xx 18  this behaviour therefore of the publican did well become his present action especially since in his own eyes he was yet an unforgiven sinner  alas what is gods majesty to a sinful man but a consuming fire  and what is a sinful man in himself or in his approach to god but as stubble fully dry  how then could the publican do otherwise than what he did than stand afar off if he either thought of god or himself  indeed the people afore named before they saw god in his terrible majesty could scarcely be kept off from the mount with words and bounds as it is now the case of many  their blindness gives them boldness their rudeness gives them confidence but when they shall see what the publican saw and felt and understood as he they will pray and stand afar off even as these people did  they removed and stood afar off and then fell to praying of moses that this dreadful sight and sound might be taken from them  and what if i should say he stood afar off for fear of a blow though he came for mercy as it is said of them they stood afar off for fear of her torments rev xviii 10 18  i know what it is to go to god for mercy and stand all that while through fear afar off being possessed with this will not god now smite me at once to the ground for my sins  david thought something when he said as he prayed cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me psalm li 11  there is none knows but those that have them what turns and returns what coming on and going off there is in the spirit of a man that indeed is awakened and that stands awakened before the glorious majesty in prayer  the prodigal also made his prayer to his father intentionally while he was yet a great way off  and so did the lepers too  and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off  and they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on us luke xvii 12 13  see here it has been the custom of praying men to keep their distance and not to be rudely bold in rushing into the presence of the holy and heavenly majesty especially if they have been sensible of their own vileness and sins as the prodigal the lepers and our poor publican was  yea peter himself when upon a time he perceived more than commonly he did of the majesty of jesus his lord what doth he do  when simon peter saw it says the text he fell down at jesus knees saying depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord luke v 38  oh when men see god and themselves it fills them with holy fear of the greatness of the majesty of god as well as with love to and desire after his mercy  besides by his standing afar off it might be to intimate that he now had in mind and with great weight upon his conscience the infinite distance that was betwixt god and him  men should know that and tremble in the thoughts of it when they are about to approach the omnipotent presence  what is poor sorry man poor dust and ashes that he should crowd it up and go jostlingly into the presence of the great godespecially since it is apparent the disproportion that is betwixt god and him esther when she went to supplicate the king her husband for her people made use neither of her beauty nor relation nor the privileges of which she might have had temptation to make use of especially at such a time and in such exigencies as then did compass her about but i say she made not use of them to thrust herself into his presence but knew and kept her distance standing in the inward court of his palace until he held out the golden sceptre to her then esther drew near and touched the top thereof esth v 1 2  men also when they come into the presence of god should know their distance yea and shew that they know it too by such gestures and carriages and behaviour that are seemly  a remarkable saying is that of solomon keep thy foot saith he when thou goest into the house of god and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider not that they do evil  and as they should keep their foot so also he adds be not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before god for god is in heaven and thou upon earth therefore let thy words be few eccles v 1 2  three things the holy ghost exhorteth to in this text  the one is that we look to our feet and not be forward to crowd into gods presence  another is that we should also look well to our tongues that they be not rash in uttering any thing before god  and the third is because of the infinite distance that is betwixt god and us which is intimated by these words for god is in heaven and thou upon earth  the publican therefore shewed great wisdom holy shame and humility in this brave gesture of his namely in his standing afar off when he went up into the temple to pray  but this is not all  secondly the publican in standing afar off left room for an advocate and highpriest a daysman to come betwixt to make peace between god and his poor creature  moses the great mediator of the old testament was to go nigher to god than the rest of the elders or those of the people exod xx 21  yea the rest of the people were expressly commanded to worship standing afar off  no man of the sons of aaron that had a blemish was to come nigh  no man that hath a blemish of the seed of aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the lord made by fire  he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his god lev xxi 21  the publican durst not be his own mediator he knew he had a blemish and was infirm and therefore he stands back for he knew that it was none of him that his god had chosen to come near unto him to offer the fat and the blood ezek xliv 1315  the publican therefore was thus far right he took not up the room himself neither with his person nor his performances but stood back and gave place to the highpriest that was to be intercessor  we read that when zacharias went into the temple to burn incense as at the time his lot was the whole multitude of the people were praying without luke i 9 10  they left him where he was near to god between god and them mediating for them for the offering of incense by the chiefpriest was a figurative making of intercession for the people and they maintained their distance  it is a great matter in praying to god not to go too far nor come too short in that duty i mean in the duty of prayer and a man is very apt to do one or the other  the pharisee went so far he was too bold he came into the temple making such a ruffle with his own excellencies that there was in his thoughts no need of a mediator he also went up so nigh to god that he took up the room and place of the mediator himself but this poor publican he knows his distance and keeps it and leaves room for the highpriest to come and intercede for him with god  he stood afar off  not too far off for that is the room and place of unbelievers and in that sense this saying is true for lo they that are far from thee shall perish psalm lxxiii 27 that is they whose unbelief hath set their hearts and affections more upon their idols and that have been made to cast god behind their backs to follow and go awhoring after them  hitherto therefore it appears that though the pharisee had more righteousness than the publican yet the publican had more spiritual righteousness than the pharisee and that though the publican had a baser and more ugly outside than the pharisee yet the publican knew how to prevail with god for mercy better than he  as for the publicans posture of standing in prayer it is excusable and that by the very father of the faithful himself  for abraham stood praying when he made intercession for sodom gen xviii 22 23  christ also alloweth it where he saith and when ye stand praying forgive if ye have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses mark xi 25 indeed there is no stinted order prescribed for our thus behaving of ourselves in prayer whether kneeling or standing or walking or lying or sitting for all these postures have been used by the godly  paul kneeled down and prayed acts xx 36  abraham and the publican stood and prayed  david prayed as he walked 2 sam xv 30 31  abraham prayed lying upon his face gen xvii 1718  moses prayed sitting exod xvii 12  and indeed prayer effectual fervent prayer may be and often is made unto god under all these circumstances of behaviour  for god has not tied us up to any of them and he that shall tie himself or his people to any of these doth more than he hath warrant for from god  and let such take care of innovating it is the next way to make men hypocrites and dissemblers in those duties in which they should be sincere  true which of those soever a man shall choose to himself for the present to perform this solemn duty in it is required of him and god expects it that he should pray to him in truth and with desire affection and hunger after those things that with his tongue he maketh mention of before the throne of god  and indeed without this all is nothing  but alas how few be there in the world whose heart and mouth in prayer shall go together  dost thou when thou askest for the spirit or faith or love to god to holiness to saints to the word and the like ask for them with love to them desire of them hungering after them  oh this is a mighty thing and yet prayer is no more before god than as it is seasoned with these blessed qualifications  wherefore it is said that while men are praying god is searching of the heart to see what is the meaning of the spirit or whether there be the spirit and his meaning in all that the mouth hath uttered either by words sighs or groans because it is by him and through his help only that any make prayers according to the will of god rom viii 26 27  whatever thy posture therefore shall be see that thy prayers be pertinent and fervent not mocking of thine own soul with words while thou wantest and art an utter stranger to the very vital and living spirit of prayer  now our publican had and did exercise the very spirit of prayer in prayer  he prayed sensibly seriously affectionately hungering thirsting and with longing after that for which with his mouth he implored the god of heaven his heart and soul was in his words and it was that which made his prayer prayer even because he prayed in prayer he prayed inwardly as well as outwardly  david tells us that god heard the voice of his supplication the voice of his cry the voice of his tears and the voice of his roaring  for indeed are all these acceptable  affection and fervent desire make them sound well in the ears of god  tears supplications prayers cries may be all of them done in formality hypocrisy and from other causes and to other ends than that which is honest and right in gods sight  for god would search and look after the voice of his tears supplications roarings prayers and cries  and if men had less care to please men and more to please god in the matter and manner of praying the world would be at a better pass than it is  but this is not in mans power to help and to amend when the holy ghost comes upon men with great conviction of their state and condition and of the use and excellency of the grace of sincerity and humility in prayer then and not till then will the grace of prayer be more prized and the specious flounting complimentary lips of flatterers be more laid aside  i have said it already and will say it again that there is nowadays a great deal of wickedness committed in the very duty of prayer by words of which men have no sense by reaching after such conclusion and clenshes therein as make their persons be admired by studying for and labouring after such enlargements as the spirit accompanieth not the heart in  o lord god make our hearts upright in us as in all points and parts of our profession so in this solemn appointment of god  if i regard iniquity in my heart said david the lord will not hear my prayer  but if i be truly sincere he will and then it is no matter whether i kneel or stand or sit or lie or walk for i shall do none of these nor put up my prayers under any of these circumstances lightly foolishly and idly but to beautify this gesture with the inward working of my mind and spirit in prayer that whether i stand or sit walk or lie down grace and gravity humility and sincerity shall make my prayer profitable and my outward behaviour comely in his eyes with whom in prayer i now have to do  and had not our publican been inwardly seasoned with these christ would have taken but little pleasure in his modes and outward behaviour  but being so honest inwardly and in the matter of his prayer his gestures by that were made beauteous also and therefore it is that our lord so delightfully delateth upon them and draweth them out at length before the eyes of others  i have often observed that which is natural and so comely in one looks odiously when imitated by another  i speak as to gestures and actions in preaching and prayer  many i doubt not but will imitate the publican and that both in the prayer and gestures of the publican whose persons and actions will yet stink in the nostrils of him that is holy and just and that searcheth the heart and the reins  well the publican stood and prayed he stood afar off and prayed and his prayers came even to the ears of god  and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven c  we are now come to another of his postures  he would not says the text so much as lift up his eyes to heaven  here therefore was another gesture added to that which went before and a gesture that a great while before had been condemned by the holy ghost himself  is it such a fast that i have chosen a day for a man to afflict his soul  is it to bow down his head as a bulrush isa lviii 5  but why condemned then and smiled upon now  why  because done in hypocrisy then and in sincerity now  hypocrisy and a spirit of error that he shall take no pleasure in them but sincerity and honesty in duties will make even them comely in the sight of men may i not say before god  the rechabites were not commanded of god but of their father to do as they did but because they were sincere in their obedience thereto even god himself maketh use of what they did to condemn the disobedience of the jews and moreover doth tell the rechabites at last that they should not want a man to stand before him for ever  and jeremiah said unto the house of the rechabites thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel because ye have obeyed the commandment of jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done according unto all that he hath commanded you therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel jonadab the son of rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever  he would not lift up his eyes to heaven  why  surely because shame had covered his face  shame will make a man blush and hang his head like a bulrush shame for sin is a virtue a comely thing yea a beautyspot in the face of a sinner that cometh to god for mercy  god complains of the house of israel that they could sin and that without shame yea and threateneth them too with sore repeated judgments because they were not ashamed it is in jer viii  their crimes in general were they turned every one to his course as the horse runneth into the battle  in particular they were such as rejected gods word they loved this world and set themselves against the prophets crying peace peace when they cried judgment judgment  and were not ashamed when they had committed abomination nay they were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore shall they fall among them that fall  in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down saith the lord ver 12  oh to stand or sit or lie or kneel or walk before god in prayer with blushing cheeks for sin is one of the most excellent sights that can be seen in the world  wherefore the church taketh some kind of heart to herself in that she could lie down in her shame yea and makes that a kind of an argument with god to prove that her prayers did come from her heart and also that he would hear them jer iii 2225  shame for sin argueth sense of sin yea a right sense of sin a godly sense of sin  ephraim pleads this when under the hand of god i was saith he ashamed yea even confounded because i did bear the reproach of my youth  but what follows  is ephraim my dear son is he a pleasant child for since i spake against him i do earnestly remember him still  therefore my bowels are troubled for him  i will surely have mercy upon him saith the lord jer xxxi 19 20  i know that there is a shame that is not the spirit of an honest heart but that rather floweth from sudden surprisal when the sinner is unawares taken in the actin the very manner  and thus sometimes the house of israel were taken  and then when they blushed their shame is compared to the shame of a thief  as the thief is ashamed when he is found so is the house of israel ashamed they their kings their princes and their priests and their prophets  but where were they taken or about what were they found  why they were found saying to a stock thou art my father and to a stone thou hast brought me forth  god catched them thus doing and this made them ashamed even as the thief is ashamed when the owner doth catch him stealing his horse  but this was not the publicans shame  this shame brings not a man into the temple to pray to stand willingly and to take shame before god in prayer  this shame makes one rather to fly from his face and to count ones self most at ease when farthest off from god jer ii 26 27  the publicans shame therefore which he demonstrated by hanging down his head was godly and holy and much like that of the prodigal when he said father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son luke xv 21 i suppose that his postures were much the same with the publicans as were his prayers for the substance of them  o however grace did work in both to the same end they were both of them after a godly manner ashamed of their sins  he would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven  he could not he would not  which yet more fully makes it appear that it was shame not guilt only or chiefly though it is manifest enough that he had guilt by his crying god be merciful to me a sinner  i say guilt was not the chief cause of hanging down his head because it saith he would not for when guilt is the cause of stooping it lieth not in the will or in the power thereof to help one up  david tells us that when he was under guilt his iniquities were gone over his head  as an heavy burden they were too heavy for him and that with them he was bowed down greatly  or as he says in another place mine iniquities have taken hold upon me so that i am not able to look up psalm xxxviii xl  i am not able to do it guilt disableth the understanding and conscience shame makes all willingly fall at the feet of christ  he would not  he knew what he was what he had been and should be if god had not mercy upon him yea he knew also that god knew what he was had been and would be if mercy prevented not wherefore thought he wherefore should i lift up the head  i am no righteous man no godly man i have not served god but satan this i know this god knows this angels know wherefore i will not lift up the head  it is as much as to say i will not be an hypocrite like the pharisee  for lifting up of the head signifies innocency and harmlessness of life or good conscience and the testimony thereof under and in the midst of all accusations  wherefore this was the counsel of zophar to jobif saith he thou prepare thine heart and stretch out thine hand towards him if iniquity be in thine hand put it far away and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles for then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot yea thou shalt be steadfast and shalt not fear job xi 1315  this was not the publicans state  he had lived in lewdness and villany all his days nor had he prepared his heart to seek the lord god of his fathers he had not cleansed his heart nor hands from violence nor done that which was lawful and right  he only had been convinced of his evil ways and was come into the temple as he was all foul and in his filthy garments and amidst his pollutions how then could he be innocent holy or without spot and consequently how could he lift up his face to god  i remember what abner said to asahel turn thee aside said he from following me wherefore should i smite thee to the ground how then should i hold up my face to joab thy brother  2 sam ii 22  as if he had said if i kill thee i shall blush be ashamed and hang my head like a bulrush the next time i come into the company of thy brother  this was the publicans case  he was guilty he had sinned he had committed a trespass and now being come into the temple into the presence of that god whose laws he had broken and against whom he had sinned how could he lift up his head how could he do it  no it better became him to take his shame and to hang his head in token of guilt and indeed he did and did it to purpose too for he would not lift up no not so much as his eyes to heaven  true some would have done it the pharisee did it though if he had considered that hypocrisy and the leaning to his own righteousness had been a sin he would have found as little cause to have done it as did the publican himself  but i say he did it and sped therein he went down to his house as he came up into the temple a poor unjustified pharisee whose person and prayer were both rejected because like the whore of whom we read in the proverbs after he had practised all manner of hypocrisy he comes into the temple and wipes his mouth and saith i have done no wickedness prov xxx 20  he lifts up his head his face his eyes to heaven he struts he vaunts himself he swaggers he vapours and cries up himself saying god i thank thee that i am not as other men are  true had he come and stood before a stock or stone he might have said thus and not have been reprehended for such are gods that see not nor hear neither do they understand  but to come before the true god the living god the god that fills heaven and earth by his presence and that knows the things that come into the mind of man even every one of them i say to come into his house to stand before him and thus to lift up his head and eyes in such hypocrisy before him this was abominable this was to tempt god and to prove him yea to challenge him to know what was in man if he could even as those who said how doth god see know can he judge through the dark cloud  job xxii 13 psalm lxxiii 11  but the publicannohe would not do this he would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven  as who should say o lord i have been against thee a traitor and a rebel and like a traitor and a rebel before thee will i stand  i will bear my shame before thee in the presence of the holy angels yea i will prevent thy judging of me by judging myself in thy sight and will stand as condemned before thee before thou passest sentence upon me  this is now for a sinner to go to the end of things  for what is gods design in the work of conviction for sin and in his awakening of the conscience about it  what is his end i say but to make the sinner sensible of what he hath done and that he might unfeignedly judge himself for the same  now this our publican doth his will therefore is now subjected to the word of god and he justifies him in all his ways and works towards him  blessed be god for any experience of these things  he would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven  he knew by his deeds and deservings that he had no portion there nor would he divert his mind from the remembering and from being affected with the evil of his ways  some men when they are under the guilt and conviction of their evil life will do what they can to look any way and that on purpose to divert their minds and to call them off from thinking on what they have done and by their thus doing they bring many evils more upon their souls for this is a kind of striving with god and a shewing a dislike to his ways  would not you think if when you are shewing your son or your servant his faults if he should do what he could to divert and take off his mind from what you are saying that he striveth against you and sheweth dislike of your doings  what else mean the complaints of masters and of fathers in this matter  i have a servant i have a son that doth contrary to my will  o but why do you not chide them for it  the answer is so i do but they do not regard my words they do what they can even while i am speaking to divert their minds from my words and counsels  why all men will cry out this is base this is worthy of great rebuke such a son such a servant deserveth to be shut out of doors and so made to learn better breeding by want and hardship  but the publican would not divert his mind from what at present god was about to make him sensible of no not by a look on the choicest object he would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven  they are but bad scholars whose eyes when their master is teaching of them are wandering off their books  god saith unto men when he is teaching them to know the evil of their ways as the angel said to the prophet when he came to shew him the pattern of the temple son of man says he behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears and set thine heart upon all that i shall shew thee for to the intent that i might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither ezek xl 4  so to the intent that god might shew to the publican the evil of his ways therefore was he brought under the power of convictions and the terrors of the law and he also like a good learner gave good heed unto that lesson that now he was learning of god for he would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven  looking downwards doth ofttimes bespeak men very ponderous and deep in their cogitations also that the matter about which in their minds they are now concerned hath taken great hold of their spirits  the publican hath now new things great things and longlived things to concern himself about  his sins the curse with death and hell began now to stare him in the face  wherefore it was no time now to let his heart or his eyes or his cogitations wander but to be fixed and to be vehemently applying of himself as a sinner to the god of heaven for mercy  few know the weight of sin  when the guilt thereof takes hold of the conscience it commands homewards all the faculties of the soul  no man can go out or off now  now he is windbound or as paul says caught now he is made to possess bitter days bitter nights bitter hours bitter thoughts nor can he shift them for his sin is ever before him  as david said for i acknowledge my transgressions  and my sin is ever before mein my eye and sticketh fast in every one of my thoughts psalm li 3  he would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven but smote upon his breast  this was the third and last of his gestures he smote upon his breast to wit with his hand or with his fist  i read of several gestures with the hand and foot according to the working and passions of the mind  it is said balak smote his hands together being angry because that balaam had blessed and not cursed for him the children of israel  god says also that he had smitten his hands together at the sins of the children of israel  god also bids the prophet stamp with his feet and smite with his hand upon his thigh num xxiv 10 ezek xxii 13 vi 11 xxi 12 upon sundry occasions and at several enormities but the publican here is said to smite upon his breast and  1  smiting upon the breast betokeneth sorrow for something done this is an experiment common among men and indeed therefore as i take it doth our lord jesus put him under this gesture in the act and exercise of his repentance because it is that which doth most lively set it forth  suppose a man comes to great damage for some folly that he has wrought and he be made sorrowful for being and doing such folly there is nothing more common than for such a man if he may to walk to and fro in the room where he is with head hung down fetching ever and anon a bitter sigh and smiting himself upon the breast in his dejected condition  but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner  2  smiting upon the breast is sometimes a token of indignation and abhorrence of something thought upon  i read in luke that when christ was crucified those spectators that stood to behold the barbarous usage that he endured at the hands of his enemies smote their breasts and returned  and all the people says luke that came together to that sight beholding the things which were done smote their breasts and returned luke xxiii 48  smote their breasts that is in token of indignation against and abhorrence of the cruelty that was used to the son of god  here also we have our publican smiting upon his breast in token of indignation against and abhorrence of his former life and indeed without indignation against and abhorrence of his former life his repentance had not been good  wherefore the apostle doth make indignation against sin and against ourselves one of the signs of true repentance 2 cor vii 11 and his indignation against sin in general and against his former life in particular was manifested by his smiting upon the breast even as ephraims smiting upon the thigh was a sign and token of his  surely says he after that i was turned i repented  and after that i was instructed i smote upon my thigh  i was ashamed yea even confounded because i did bear the reproach of my youth jer xxxi 19  man when he vehemently dislikes a thing is very apt to shew a dislike to that thing by this or another outward gesture as in snuffing or snorting at it or in deriding or as some say in blowing of their noses at it ezek viii 17 mal i 13  but the publican here chooseth rather to use this most solemn posture for smiting upon the breast seems to imply a more serious solemn grave way or manner of dislike than any of those last mentioned do  3  smiting upon the breast seems to intimate a quarrel with the heart for beguiling deluding flattering seducing and enticing of him to sin for as conviction for sin begets in man i mean if it be thorough a sense of the sore and plague of the heart so repentance if it be right begets in man an outcry against the heart forasmuch as by that light by which repentance takes occasion the sinner is made to see that the heart is the fountain and wellspring of sin for from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts adulteries covetousness c mark vii 2123  and hence it is that commonly young converts do complain so of their hearts calling them wicked treacherous deceitful desperate ones  indeed one difference between true and false repentance lieth in this  the man that truly repents crieth out of his heart but the other as eve upon the serpent or something else  and that the publican perceived his heart to be naught i conclude by his smiting upon his breast  4  smiting upon the breast seems to intimate one apprehensive of some new sudden strange and amazing thing as when a man sees some strange sight in the air or heareth some sudden or dismal sound in the clouds why as he is struck into a deep damp in his mind so it is a wonder if he can keep or hold back from smiting upon his breast  now oftentimes a sight of god and sense of sin comes to the sinner like a flash of lightning not for short continuance but for suddeness and so for surprisal so that the sinner is struck taken and captivated to his own amazement with what so unexpectedly is come upon him  it is said of paul at his conversion that when conviction of his bad life took fast hold of his conscience he trembled and was astonished acts ix 6 and although we read not of any particular circumstance of his behaviour under his conviction outwardly yet it is almost impossible but he must have had some and those of the most solid sort  for there is such a sympathy betwixt the soul and the body that the one cannot be in distress or comfort but the other must partake of and also signify the same  if it be comfort then it is shewn by leaping skipping cheerfulness of the countenance or some other outward gesture  if it be sorrow or heaviness of spirit then that is shewed by the body in weeping sighing groaning shaking of the head a louring countenance stamping smiting upon the thigh or breast as here the publican did  we must not therefore look upon these outward actions or gestures of the publican to be empty insignificant things but to be such that in truth did express and shew the temper frame and complexion of his soul  for christ the wisdom of god hath mentioned them to that very end that in and by them might be held forth and that men might see as in a glass the very emblem of a converted and truly penitent sinner  he smote upon his breast  5  smiting upon the breast is sometimes to signify a mixture of distrust joined with hope  and indeed in young converts hope and distrust or a degree of despair do work and answer one another as doth the noise of the balance of the watch in the pocket  life and death is always the motion of the mind then and this noise continues until faith is stronger grown and until the soul is better acquainted with the methods and ways of god with a sinner  yea were but a carnal man in a converts heart and could see he could discern these two to wit hope and fear to have continual motion in the soul wrestling and opposing one another as doth light and darkness in striving for the victory  and hence it is that you find such people so fickle and uncertain in their spirits now on the mount then in the valleys now in the sunshine then in the shade  now warm then frozen now bonny and blithe then in a moment pensive and sad as thinking of a portion nowhere but in hell  this will cause smiting on the breast nor can i imagine that the publican was as yet farther than thus far in the christians progress  6  smiting upon the breast seems to intimate that the party so doing is very apprehensive of some great loss that he has sustained either by negligence carelessness foolishness or the like  and this is the way in which men do lose their souls  now to lose a thing a great thing the only choice thing that a man has negligently carelessly foolishly or the like why it puts aggravations into the thoughts of the loss that the man has sustained and aggravations into the thoughts of them go out of the soul and come in upon a sudden even as the bailiff or the kings serjeantatarms and at every appearance of them makes the soul start and starting it smites upon the breast  i might multiply particulars but to be brief we have before us a sensible soul a sorrowful soul a penitent soul one that prays indeed that prays sensibly affectionately effectually one that sees his loss that fears and trembles before god in consideration of it and one that knows no way but the right way to secure himself from perishing to wit by having humble and hearty recourse to the god of heaven for mercy  i should now come to speak something by way of use and application but before i do that i will briefly draw up and present you with a few conclusions that in my judgment do naturally flow from the text therefore in this place i will read over the text again  two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee the other a publican  the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican  i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess  and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner  from these words i gather these several conclusions with these inferences  1  it doth not always follow that they that pray do know god or love him or trust in him  this conclusion is evident by the pharisee in the text he prayed but he knew not god he loved not god he trusted not in god that is he knew him not in his son nor loved nor trusted in him  he was though a praying man far off from this  whence it may be inferred that those that pray not at all cannot be good cannot know love or trust in god  for if the star though it shine is not the sun then surely a clod of dirt cannot be the sun why a praying man doth as far outstrip a nonpraying man as a star outstrips a clod of earth  a nonpraying man lives like a beast the ox knows his owner and the ass his masters crib but this man doth not know but this man doth not consider isa i 3  the prayerless man is therefore of no religion except he be an atheist or an epicurean  therefore the nonpraying man is numbered among the heathens and among those that know not god and is appointed and designed by the sentence of the word to the fearful wrath of god psal lxxix 6 jer x 25  2  a second conclusion is that the man that prays if in his prayer he pleads for acceptance either in whole or in part for his own good deeds is in a miserable state  this also is gathered from the pharisee here he prayed but in this prayer he pleaded his own good deeds for acceptance that is of his person and therefore went down to his house unjustified  and he is in this condition that doth thus  the conclusion is true forasmuch as the pharisee mentioned in the parable is not so spoken of for the sake of that sect of men but to caution forewarn and bid all men take heed that they by doing as he procure not their rejection of god and be sent away from his presence unjustified  i do therefore infer from hence that if he that pleadeth his own good doing for personal acceptance with god be thus miserable then he that teacheth men so to do is much more miserable  we always conclude that a ringleader in an evil way is more blame worthy than those that are led of him  this falls hard upon the leading socinians and others who teach that mens works make their persons accepted of god  true they say through christ but that is brought in merely to delude the simple with and is an horrible lie for we read not in all the word of god as to personal justification in the sight of god from the curse and that is the question under consideration that it must be by mans righteousness as made prevalent by christs but contrariwise by his and his only without the deeds works or righteousness of the law which is our righteousness  wherefore i say the teachers and leaders of this doctrine have the greater sin  3  a third conclusion is they that use high and flaunting language in prayer their simplicity and godly sincerity is to be questioned as to the doing of that duty sincerely  this still flows from our text the pharisee greatly used this  for higher and more flaunting language can hardly be found than in the pharisees mouth nor will ascribing to god by the same mouth laud and praise help the business at all  for to be sure where the effect is base and rotten the cause cannot be good  the pharisee would hold himself that he was not as other men and then gives thanks to god for this  but the conclusion was most vilely false and therefore the praise for it could not but be foolish vain and frivolous  whence i infer that if to use such language in prayer is dangerous then to affect the use thereof is yet more dangerous  prayer must be made with humble hearts and sensible words and of that we have treated before wherefore high flaunting swelling words of vanity become not a sinners mouth no not at any time much less when he comes to and presents himself before god in that solemn duty of prayer  but i say there are some that so affect the pharisees mode that they cannot be well if in some sort or other they be not in the practice of it not knowing what they say nor whereof they affirm but these are greatly addicted to hypocrisy and desire of vainglory especially if the sound of their words be within the reach of other mens ears  4  a fourth conclusion is that reformation and amendment though good and before men are nothing as to justification with god  this is manifest by the condition of our pharisee  he was a reformed man a man beyond others for personal righteousness yet he went out of the temple from god unjustified his works came to nothing with god hence i infer that the man that hath nothing to commend him to god of his own yet stands as fair before god for justification and so acceptance as any other man in the world  5  a fifth conclusion is it is the sensible sinner the self bemoaning sinner the selfjudging sinner the selfabhorring sinner and the selfcondemning sinner whose prayers prevail with god for mercy  hence i infer that one reason why men make so many prayers and prevail no more with god is because their prayers are rather the floatings of pharisaical fancies than the fruits of sound sense of sin and sincere desires of enjoying god in mercy and in the fruits of the holy ghost
