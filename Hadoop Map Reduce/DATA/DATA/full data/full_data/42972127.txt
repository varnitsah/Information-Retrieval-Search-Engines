                   329     a monk of cruta     chapter i  the blackrobed phantom death   father adrian  i am here  i saw the doctor talking with you aside how long have i to live he told you the truth repeat his words to me  the tall gaunt young priest drew nearer to the bedside and shook his head with a slow pitying gesture  the time was shortshort indeed yet why should you fear your confession has been made i myself have pronounced your absolution the holy church has granted to you her most holy sacrament  fear bah i have no fear it is a matter of calculation shall i see morning break  you may but you will never see the midday sun  the dying man raised himself with a slow painful movement and pointed to the window  throw up the window  he was obeyed a servant who had been sitting quietly in the shadows of the vast apartment with his head buried in his hands rose and did his masters bidding  what hour is it  three oclock  gomez strain your eyes seaward is there no light on the horizon  none the storm has wrapped the earth in darkness listen  a torrent of rain was swept against the streaming window pane and a gust of wind shook the frame in its sockets the watcher turned away from the window with a mute gesture of despair no eye could pierce that black chaos he sank again into his seat and looked around shuddering the high vaulted chamber was lit by a pair of candles only leaving the greater part of it in gloom grim fantastic shadows lurked in the corners and lay across the bare floor even the tall figure of the priest on his knees before a rude wooden crucifix seemed weird and ghostly the heavy mildewed bedhangings shook and trembled in the draughts which filled the room and the candles flickered and burnt low in their sockets gomez watched them with a sort of anxious fascination his masters life was burning out minute for minute with those candles twentyfive years of constant companionship would be ended in a few brief hours gomez was not disposed to trouble much at this but he bethought himself of a snug little abode in piccadilly where the discomforts now surrounding them were quite unknown surely to die there would be a luxury compared with this he began to feel personally aggrieved that his master should have chosen such an outoftheway hole to end his days in then came a rush of thought and he was grave he knew why yes he knew why  the dying man lay quite still almost as though his time were already come once he raised himself and the feeble light flashed across a grey haggard face and a pair of burning eyes but his effort was only momentary he sank back again and lay there with his eyes half closed and breathing softly he was nursing his strength  one two three four five the harsh clanging of a brazen clock somewhere in the building had penetrated to the chamber followed by a deep resonant bell the man on the bed lifted his head  how goes the storm he asked softly  gomez stood up and faced the window  the storm dies with the night sir he answered the wind has fallen  when does day break  gomez looked at his watch  in one hour sir  stay by the window gomez and let your eyes watch for the dawn  the priest frowned surely the time has come when you should quit your hold on earthly things he said quietly what matters the dawn soon you will lose yourself in an everlasting sleep and the dawn for you will be eternity take this crucifix and pray with me  the dying man pushed it away with a gesture almost contemptuous  is there no light on the sea yet gomez he asked anxiously  gomez leant forward till his face touched the window pane he strained his eyes till they ached but the darkness was impenetrable yet staywhat was that a feeble yellow light was glimmering far away in the heart of that great gulf of darkness he held his breath and watched it steadily then he turned round  there is a light in the far distance sir he said i cannot tell what it may be but there is a light  a wave of excitement passed over the strong wasted features of the man upon the bed he half raised himself and his voice was almost firm  push my bed to the window he ordered  the two men priest and servant bent all their strength to the task and inch by inch they moved the great creaking structure when at last they had succeeded and paused to take breath the light in the distance had become stronger and more apparent together the three men watched it grow master and servant with breathless eagerness the priest with a show of displeasure in his severe face suddenly gomez gave a little cry  the dawn he exclaimed pointing to the north of the light morning is breaking  sure enough a grey pallid light was stealing down upon the water the darkness was becoming a chaos of grey and black of towering seas and lowlying clouds with cold white streaks of light falling through them and piercing the curtains of night there was no vestige of colouringnothing but cold grey and slate white yet the dawn moved on and through it the yellow light in the distance gleamed larger and larger  hold me up ordered the man on the bed prop me up with pillows  they did as he bade them and for the first time his face was fully revealed in the straggling twilight a flowing grey beard still plentifully streaked with black rested upon his chest and the eyes steadily fixed upon the window pane were dark and undimmed a long illness had wasted his fine features but had detracted nothing from their strength and regularity of outline his lips were closely set and his expression though painfully eager was not otherwise displeasing there was none of the fear of death there nor was there anything of the passionless resignation of the man who has bidden farewell to life and made his peace with god and man nor in those moments of watching had his face any of the physical signs of approaching death  ah  they started at the sharp almost triumphant exclamation which had escaped from his white lips and followed his long quivering finger above that glimmering light was a faint dim line of smoke fading on the horizon  it is a steamer indeed the priest said with some interest she is making for the island  when is the supply boat due gomez asked  not for a fortnight the priest answered it is not she it is a stranger  there was no other word spoken soon the dawn moving across the great waste of waters pierced the dark background behind the steamers light the long trail of white curdling foam in her track gleamed like a silver cleft in a dark gulf the dim shape of her sails stole slowly into sight and they could see that she was carrying a great weight of canvas then into the grey air a rocket shot up like a brilliant meteor and the sound of a gun came booming over the waters  can she make the bay gomez asked suddenly look at the surf  they all removed their eyes from the steamer and fixed them nearer home the darkness had rolled away and the outlook though a little uncertain in the misty morning light was still visible right before the window a little to the left a great rocky hill many hundreds of feet high ran sheer down into the sea and facing it on the right was a lower range of rocks running out from the mainland inside the natural harbour thus formed the sea was quiet enough but at the entrance a line of white breakers and huge ocean waves were leaping up against the base of the promontory and dashing over the lower range of rocks beyond the sea was wild and rough and the steamer was often almost lost to sight in the hollow of the waves  ah  the faces of all three men underwent a sudden change three rockets one after another shot up into the sky from the top of the rocky hill leaving a faint violet glow overhead the dying man set his teeth hard and his eyes glistened  three rockets he muttered what is the meaning of that signal father he asked  the priest looked downward pityingly it is a warning that the entrance to the bay is unsafe he answered take comfort it is the hand of god keeping from you those who would distract your dying thoughts from heaven take comfort and pray with me  he seemed strangely deaf to the priests words and made no movement or sign in response only he kept his eyes the more steadfastly fixed upon the steamer now plainly visible his face showed no disappointment it seemed almost as though he might have seen across the grey sea and heard the stern orders thundered out from a slim motionless figure on the captains bridge right ahead helmsman never mind the signal theres fifty pounds for every man of you if we make the bay its not so bad as it looks back me up like brave lads and ill remember it all your lives  almost too he might have heard the answering cheer for a faint smile parted his white lips as he saw the steamer ploughing her way heavily straight ahead paying no heed to the warning signal  on she came the priest and the servant started as they saw her intention and a sharp ejaculation of surprise escaped from the former side by side they watched the labouring vessel with strained eyes her hull and shape were now visible in the dim morning twilight as she rose and fell upon the waves it was evident that she was a large handsome pleasure yacht daintily but strongly built  close up against the high bare window the three watchers unconsciously enough formed a strikinglooking group the priest tall pale and severe stood in the shadow of the bedcurtains an impressive and solemn figure in his dark flowing robes but with the impassibility of his features curiously disturbed he who had been preaching calm was himself agitated he had drawn a little on one side so that the cold grey light should not fall upon his face and betray its twitching lips and quivering pallor but if either of the men who shared his watch had thought to glance at him the sickly candlelight would have shown at once what he was so anxious to conceal it was little more than chance which had brought this man to die in his island monastery and under his care little more than chance which had revealed to him this wonderful secret but the agony of those last few hours and the gloomy words of the priest who leant over his bedside had found their way in between the joints of the dying mans armour of secrecy word by word the story had been wrested from him in the cold and comfortless hour of death the strong worldly man felt his physical weakness loosen the iron bands of his will and he became for a time almost like a child in the hands of the keen swiftlyquestioning priest he had not found much comfort in the mumbled prayers and absolution which were all he got in exchange for his lifes secretand such a secret he had not indeed noticed the fixed faraway gaze in the priests dark eyes as he knelt by the bedside but his prayers his faint words of comfort had fallen like drops of ice upon his quickened desire to be brought a little nearer to that mysterious shadowy essence of goodness which was all his mind could conceive of a god it had seemed like a dead form of words lifeless hopeless monotonous and all that faint striving to attain to some knowledge of the truthif indeed truth there washad been crushed into ashes by it as he had lived so must he die he told himself with some return of that philosophic quietude which had led him stouthearted and brave through many dangers and at that moment when he had been striving to detach his thoughts from their vain task of conjuring up useless regrets there had come what even now seemed to be the granting of his last passionate prayer the man whom he had longed to see once more before his eyes were closed forever upon the world with such a longing that his heart had grown sick and weary with the burden of it had been brought as though by a miracle almost to his side he knew as though by some strange instinct the measure of his strength he had no fear of dying before his hearts dearest wish could be gratified if only that fiercely labouring vessel succeeded in her brave struggle he knew that there would be strength left to him to bear the shock of meeting to bear even the shock of the tidings which could either sweeten his last few moments or deepen the gloom of his passage into the unknown world and so he lay there with fixed glazed eyes and shortened breath watching and waiting  the supreme moment came the steamer had reached the dangerous point and the waves were breaking over her with such fury that more than once she vanished altogether from sight only to reappear in a moment or two quivering and trembling from stern to hull like a living creature after all the struggle was a brief one though it seemed long to the watchers at the window in less than ten minutes it was over she had passed the line of breakers and was in the comparatively smooth water of the bay heading fast for the shore under leeway of the great wall of towering rocks at the foot of which she seemed dwarfed almost into the semblance of a boys toy vessel within a quarter of a mile from the shore she anchored and a boat was let down from her side  a new lease of life seemed to have come to the man on the bed the morning sun had half emerged from a bank of angry purplecoloured clouds and its faint slanting beams lay across the white coverlet of the bed and upon his face his eyes were bright and eager and the deathlike pallor seemed to have passed from his features his voice too was firm and distinct  place my despatchbox upon the table here gomez he ordered  gomez left his seat by the window and opening a portmanteau brought a small black box to the bedside his master passed his hand over it and drew it underneath the coverlet  i am prepared he murmured half to himself father according to the physicians reckoning how long have i to live  barely an hour answered the priest without removing his eyes from the boat whose progress he seemed to be scanning steadfastly is your eternal future of so little moment to you he went on in a tone of harsh severity that you can give your last thoughts your last few moments to affairs of this world tis an unholy death take this cross in your hands and listen not to those whose coming will surely estrange you from heaven let the world take its own course but lift your eyes and heart in prayer everlasting salvation or everlasting doom awaits you before yonder sun be set  i have no fear father was the quiet reply what is is a few frantic prayers now could alter nothing and besides my work on earth is not yet over speak to me no more of the end nothing that you or i could do now would bring me one step nearer heaven gomez your eyes are good whom do you see in the boat  gomez answered without turning round from the window mr paul is there sir steering  thank god  there are others with him sir  others who  strangers to me sir there is a man a gentleman by his dress and appearance and a childa girl i think two sailors from the yacht are rowing  the dying man knitted his brows and his fingers convulsively clutched at the bedclothes he had lost something of that calm and effortless serenity which seemed to have fallen upon him since the safety of the steamer had been assured  the boat is quite close gomez can you not describe the stranger  i can only see that he is thin rather tall and i think elderly sir he is very much wrapped up as though he were an invalid  lift me up so that i can see them father adrian will help you  the priest shook his head the effort would probably cost you your life he said and it would be useless before you could see them the boat would be round the corner  so near god grant me strength gomez give me a tablespoonful of the brandy  gomez moved silently to his side and poured out the brandy afterwards his master closed his eyes and there was an intense silence in the chamberthe deep breathless silence of expectancy  the monastery itself a small and deserted one tenanted only by a few halfstarved monks of one of the lower orders of the church was wrapped in a profound gloom there was no sound from the halfruined chapel or the long empty corridors the storm had ceased and the casements no longer rattled in the wind to the man who lay there nursing his fastebbing strength it seemed indeed like the silence before the one last tragedy of death looming so black and so grim before him  it was broken at last away at the end of the corridor the faint sound of hurrying footsteps and subdued voices reached the ears of the three watchers they came nearer and nearer halting at last just outside the door there was a knock a quick impetuous answer and the visitors entered ushered in by the priest who had met them on the threshold  of the two men one advanced hastily with outstretched hand and pitying face to the bedside the other moved only a step or two further into the room and stood looking intently yet without any salutation or form of recognition at the dying man the former when he reached the bed sank on his knees and took the white hand which lay upon the coverlet between his  father my father i would have given the world to have found you better tell me that it is not true what they say you will pull round now that i have come  there was no answer the dying man did not even look into the handsome young face so close to his his eyes bright and unnaturally large were rivetted upon the figure at the foot of the bed his breath came quickly and he was shivering an inarticulate sort of moan came from his lips  father you are agitated and no wonder to see him here you had my letter preparing you nothing that i could do would stop his coming  it was gomez who answered advancing out of the gloom there has been no letter  there was an instants silence then the younger man rose up pale as death god what a fool i was to trust to mails in this outoftheway hole father i shall never forgive myself blind idiot that i was to bring him in like this  it seemed as if no one save he possessed the power of speech there was a dead silence he looked from one to another of the figures in that silent drama in fastgrowing despair the face of the man whom he had brought there revealed little although in a certain way its expression was remarkable the lips were parted in a slow quiet smile not in itself sardonic or cruel although under the circumstances it seemed so for it was difficult to associate any idea of mirth with the scene which was passing in that grim gloomy chamber something of the awe inseparable from this close approach of death was visible in the faces of all the other watchers not so in his it was the contrast which seemed so strange he stood there with his hands thrust deep into the pockets of his long travelling coat returning the fixed glazed stare of the dying man with a sort of indifferent good humour perhaps a very close observer might have detected a shade of mockery in those soft black eyes and faintly twitching lips but the light in the room was too obscure for any one there to penetrate beneath the apparent indifference it was he who broke that deep tragic silence and his voice light and even gay struck a strange note in that solemn chamber of death  so you are dying martin mon ami how odd if any one had told me one short month ago that i should have been here to watch your last moments and start you on your journey to hell bah how mad i should have thought them tis a pleasure i never anticipated  his words seemed to dissolve the lethargy which his presence had cast over the dying man he turned away towards the younger figure by his side  how came he here he asked feebly  listen and i will tell you was the low reply i sought him first at monaco but he had not been heard of there for two years then i found traces of him at algiers and followed up the clue to cairo athens syracuse and belgrade it was at constantinople i found him at lastan officeractually an officer in the turkish army monsieur le captaine my interpreter called him the young man added with a fine scorn in his raised voice imagine it well i gave him your letter delivered the messages and awaited his pleasure he kept me waiting for two days before he vouchsafed one word of answer on the third day he announced his intention of accompanying me here nothing that i could say made any difference his answer should be given to you in person or not at all i wrote to you three days before we started that letter you never had forgive me father for the shock as for you he continued turning abruptly towards the motionless figure at the foot of the bed i have kept my word and brought you here in safety though no one in the world will ever know how near i came to breaking it and throwing you into the dardanelles ah i was sorely tempted i can tell you speak your answer and go this is no place for you to linger in  upon my word you are courteous very but my dear friend martin as this is to be our farewell i must really see you a little more distinctly  for the first time the man in the long overcoat changed his position and came a little nearer to the bed the movement showed him the priest kneeling with closed eyes and uplifted hands before an iron crucifix  ah we are not quite alone then martin cher ami the gentleman in the long robe appears to be listening  he is as dead answered the man on the bed slowly he is a monk you can speak  he raised himself slightly on the bed one hand remained grasping his despatchbox under the bedclothes the other was held by the young man who knelt by his side his face was curiously changed all the effect of his unlookedfor visitors arrival seemed to have passed away his eyes were bright and eager his white lips were closely set and firm  you can speak he repeated  his visitor was leaning over the foot of the bed now and the smile had quite gone leaving his face cold and white he spoke a little quicker than before  here is your answer martin de vaux you offer me a fortune on condition that i give up to you on your deathbed the power by which i hold those whom you love my slaves money is dear to me as it is to most men but i would die sooner than touch yours curse you and your money and your family not for all the gold that was ever coined would i yield up my power my day will come and may the evil spirit bring you tidings of it down into hell curse you martin de vaux now you know my mind  the dying man was strangely calm from under the bedclothes came the faint sound of the opening and shutting of the despatchbox  yes i know your mind he repeated quietly you mean me to die with the torturing thought that i have left a poisonous reptile to suck the life and blood from those i love and the honour from a grand old name but i will not we will take our next journey together victor  a sudden change had crept into his tone before the last sentence and before it had died away the priest and the man by the bedside had leaped to their feet in horror he whom they had thought too weak to stir was sitting bolt upright in bed his eyes blazing and his hand extended there was a line of fire a loud report and then a single cry of agony the man who had leaned over the foot of the bed lay on the ground just as he had fallen shot dead through the heart and a child darkskinned and thin who had rushed in at the sound of the report was sobbing passionately with her arms wound around him across the bed still grasping the pistol but with his hands hanging helplessly down lay the man who had fired the shot the effort had killed him  the priest was the first in the room to move he slowly bent over both bodies and then turned round to the other man  dead he asked with a dry choking gasp  both dead  the priest and his companion shocked and unnerved looked at one another in silence the childs sobs grew louder and the morning sunlight stole across the bare floor and fell upon the white still faces  the tragedy was over and the seeds of another sown     chapter ii  the new art   a tall fair young man stood in the small alcove of lady swindons drawingroom with his eyes fixed upon the door he was accurately dressed in the afternoon garb of a london man about town and carried in his hand or rather in his hands for they were crossed behind him that hallmark of western civilizationa wellbrushed immaculate silk hat neither in his clothes nor personal appearance was there any striking difference between him and the crowd of other young men who thronged the rooms except perhaps that he was a trifle better made and pleasanter to look at than most of them and that the air of boredom so apparent on most of their faces and in their manners was in his case perfectly natural as a matter of fact he hated afternoon receptions and was only waiting for a favourable opportunity to make his exit unnoticed  paul my boy you dont look happy exclaimed a voice in his ear  paul de vaux turned upon the newcomer sharply not likely to arthur you know i hate all this sort of thing and as far as i can see its just a repetition of the usual performancestale speeches lionizing gossip and weak tea i consider youve brought me here under false pretences wheres the startling novelty you promised me  all in good time was the cool reply youll thank your stars youre here in a minute or two  paul de vaux looked at his brother incredulously some sell of yours i suppose he remarked at any rate no one here whom i have spoken to seems to be expecting anything unusual  arthurno one ever called him anything elselaughed and beat an impatient tattoo upon the floor with his foot he was several inches shorter than his brother and altogether unlike him yet he too was goodlooking in a certain way  thats just the beauty of it he said lady swindon has prepared a little surprise for her guests shes just that sort of woman you know denison told me about it at the club a few minutes before you came in for lunch i shouldnt have bothered you to come if i hadnt known there was something good on  i dislike surprises his brother answered wearily half the pleasure of a thing lies in anticipation and surprises rob one of that let us go arthur there are plenty here to enjoy this novelty whatever it is come and have a weed at my rooms and well talk over something for tonight  arthur shook his head and laid his hand upon pauls coatsleeve you dont know whats coming off old fellow i wouldnt miss it for anything great scott theres the bishop wonder how hell like it and theres lady may over there paul youre booked old man if she looks this way  paul leant forward with a faint show of interest and looked in the direction indicated i thought that the westovers went north yesterday he remarked lady may said that they expected it  likely enough gad the performance is going to commence arthur exclaimed quickly paul you are going to have a new sensation you are going to see the most beautiful woman in the world  there was a little hush and every one had turned towards the upper end of the room some heavy curtains had been rolled aside disclosing a space only a few yards square which had been covered by a tightly stretched drugget there was a little curious anticipation amongst the uninitiated then the comparative silence was broken by the strains of a waltz from a violin somewhere in the background no one had ever heard it before there was a wilder dreamier air with it than anything waldteufel had ever written and while every one was wondering whose music it could be a woman glided out from behind a screen and stood for a second swaying herself slightly in the centre of the drugget even that slight rhythmical motion of her body seemed to bring her into perfect sympathy with the curious melody which was filling the hushed room and while the people watched her already in varying degrees under the spell of that curious fascination which her personality and the exercise of her art seldom failed to excite she commenced to dance  long afterwards paul de vaux tried to describe in words that dance and found that he could not for there was indeed a charm beyond expression or portrayal in the slow almost languid movements full of infinite and inexpressible witchery every limb of her body and every feature of her face followed with a sort of effortless grace the movements of her feet yet the general effect of the whole was suggestive of a sweet and dainty repose voluptuous yet refined glowing with life yet dreamily restful in a certain sense her physical movements even her body itself seemed merged and lost in the artistic ideal created and born of her performance and so it was that he carried away that day no vivid thoughtportrait of her features only a confused dream of a beautiful dusky face rising above a cloud of amber draperies the lips slightly parted in a wonderful smile and a pair of heavilylidded eyes which more than once had rested upon him soft dark and lustrous after all it was but a tangled web of memories yet such as it was it became woven into the pattern of his life wonderfully soft and brilliant beside some of those dark gloomy threads which fate had spun for him  the performance ended as such performance should end suddenly and without repetition her disappearance was so swift and yet so graceful that for a moment or two people scarcely realized that she was gone it was wonderful what a difference her absence made to the room the little stretch of drugget looked mean and bare to paul de vaux it seemed as though some warm beautiful light omniscient and richly coloured had suddenly burnt out and left a damp chilliness in the air the silence was gloomy enough after that wonderful music but the babble of tongues which presently arose was a hundred times worse he found himself chafing and angry at the commonplacisms which everywhere greeted his ear lady swindons afternoon entertainment had been a great success and every one was telling her so more or less volubly there were some there a handful of artists and a few thoughtful men who were silent or who spoke of it only amongst themselves in subdued voices they recognised in what had happened that afternoon the dawn of a new art or rather the regeneration of an old one and they discussed in whispers its possible significance and influence she was an artist that woman no one doubted it but the woman was there as well as the artist who was she would she realize the sanctity of her mission and keep herself fit and pure for its accomplishment had she character to sustain her and imagination to idealize her calling she was on a pinnacle now but it was a pinnacle as dangerous as the feet of woman could press if only she could keep herself unspotted from the world which would do its best to drag her down they all felt painter poet and musician that her influence with the age might rank with their own but was it possible a certain dianalike coldness had been apparent to those who had the eyes to see it even in her most voluptuous movements they knew that it was not assumed for the sake of adding piquancy to her performanceit was there indeed but side by side with it there were unprobed depths of passion in her soft deep eyes a slumbering passion even in the sinuous graceful movements of every limb some day the struggle would come even if it had not already commenced the woman against the artistthe woman tempted and flattered by a thousand tongues and dazzled with visions of all those things so naturally sweet to her her own nature even so keenly susceptible to love and sympathy siding with the enemy this all against what only that inward worshipping of all things sweet and pure and lofty which is the artists second life the odds were heavy indeed no wonder that the select few who spoke of her that afternoon should shake their heads and look grave     chapter iii  the dancing girl   what do you think of it  paul started he had been standing like a man in a dream with folded arms looking across the room with idle eyes and unconsciously ignoring many salutations his brothers tone sounded oddly in his ears and he looked flushed and a little nervous  what did i think of it it was a difficult question to answer he repeated it and was glad when arthur spared him the necessity of replying by adding his own opinion  it was glorious magnificent im going to find out more about her  he strolled away and joined one of the little groups of men who were discussing the performance paul at first had made a gesture as though to detain him but on second thoughts he had changed his mind better let him go and find out what he could  he himself watched carefully for his opportunity and then left the room he felt like a man who has received a silent shock something fresh had come into his life noiselessly insidiously without effort he pressed on his hat and passed down the steps out into the street scarcely conscious of what he was doing  the rush of fresh air somewhat revived him and he stood still for a moment to collect his thoughts he felt the need of absolute solitude for a while to help him to realizeor at any rate to understandthis thing which had happened and with almost feverish haste he called a hansom from the other side of the road the man whipped up the horse but hesitated as he reached the pavement looking around paul saw the cause of his indecision a woman standing only a few yards behind had called him at the same time and was waiting also for his approach  there was a gaslamp between them and as their eyes met he recognised her even in that flickering light and through her veil there was no mistaking those wonderful eyes as a rule he was possessed of as much savoir faire as most men of his class but at that moment it had deserted him he stood there on the edge of the pavement without moving or saying anything simply looking at her startled at her sudden appearance and magnetised by her close presence he had heard no footfall behind him and the fact of her being alone seemed so strange to him that he simply could not realize for a moment that it was indeed she who stood so close to him the cabman leaving them to decide who had the prior claim upon him sat motionless with his eyes discreetly fixed upon his horses ears it was an odd little tableau insignificant enough to a spectator save perhaps for the curious look in the womans face and softly flashing eyes yet it left its mark for ever in the lives of the two principal figures  the curious sensation which had kept paul standing there dazed and tonguetied passed away yet it did not immediately occur to him to raise his hat and walk on as in any ordinary case he would have done he was conscious of the exact nature of the situation but he felt a strong disinclination to leave the spot nor strangely enough did she seem to expect it yet something had to be done  he moved a step nearer her he was no schoolboy this tall gravelooking young englishman the lines across his fair smooth forehead and by his closeset mouth spoke for themselves he had seen life in many aspects and in a certain indian jungle village there were natives and coolies who still spoke admiringly of the wonderful nerve and pluck of the english sahib during a terrible and unexpected tiger rush but at that moment his nerve seemed to have deserted him he could almost hear his heart beat as he took that step forward he had intended to have made some trifling apology and to have handed her into the cab but the words would not come some instinct seemed to revolt at the thought of uttering any such commonplacism she was standing on the edge of the pavement close to the step with her skirts in one hand slightly raised he held out his hand to her in silence  she gave him hers and yet she did not at once step into the cab she seemed to be expecting that little speech from him which he found impossible to frame and seeing that it did not come recognising perhaps his suppressed agitation behind that calm almost cold gravity of demeanour she spoke to him  it is a shame to take your cab and leave you in the rain i am sorry  afterwards her admirers spoke of her voice as being one of her chief charms to paul it sounded like a soft strain of very sweet throbbing music reaching him from some far distant world yet curiously enough it went far to dissolve the spell which her presence seemed to have laid upon him he was able to look at her steadily and standing upon the wet pavement in the cold grey light of that november afternoon their eyes met in a long searching gaze he was able even to notice trifles he saw the rich fur which lined her plain black cloak and he could even admire the absolute perfection with which it followed the lines of her slim supple figure he saw the glowing eyes shining out from her dusky face and the coils of brown hair not very securely fastened under her turban hat as she put out her foot to enter the cab he could even catch a glimpse of the amber draperies concealed by her cloak a dancer a public dancer his eyes swept over her again taking in every detail of her simple but rich toilette and he shivered slightly then he answered her it is of no consequence thank you i can walk  but you will get very wet let us make a compromise you may come with me i am going only a very little distance and then you can take the cab on to your home or wherever you want to go to  she stepped in taking it for granted that he would accept her offer and he followed her at once he was not in the least surprised from the first he had not expected to leave her and her invitation seemed perfectly natural to him she gave the cabman her address through the trapdoor and they drove off together  at the corner of the square two men were standing together talking and as the hansom passed within a yard or two of them both glanced idly in and then started paul who had been looking straight ahead of him and seeing nothing turned round startled by a familiar exclamation just in time to see his brother arthur and leslie horton gazing after the cab the incident troubled him as much for her sake as his own but looking into her face he could not see that she was in any way disturbed although she must have seen the two men and would probably have recognised them as having been present at lady swindons reception her face was quite unmoved but in a moment or two she asked a question  who was the younger and better looking of those two men the one with violets in his coat like yours  it was my brother he answered simply i am afraid too that he recognised you  so far as i am concerned that is of no consequence at all she answered lightly  he turned away with a sudden sinking of the heart he knew too well that her carelessness was not assumed how was he to interpret it  their drive was finished in silence and they pulled up before a handsome though somewhat sombrelooking house in a back street  my rooms are here she remarked  he stepped on to the pavement and assisted her to alight the thought of leaving her so abruptly was painful to him and yet he dreaded to hear her invite him to go in with her nevertheless she did so  if you are not in a hurry perhaps you will come in and let me give you a cup of tea she said looking him full in the face  his heart sank what was he to think now and yet he was absurdly glad that he was not to leave her  do you mean it he asked  of course i should not have asked you else are you very much shocked she added with a mocking gleam in her eyes it is not proper is it i confess i did not think of that but do come she added with a sudden bewitching smile  i shall be delighted he answered gravely enough but truthfully he turned to pay the cabman and followed her into the house  my rooms are upstairs she remarked leading the way the luxury of a first floor is at present beyond me  her words pleased him but their effect died away when she opened a door on the first landing and ushered him in such of the interior of the house as he had seen was handsomely furnished but the room in which he stood was almost like a fairy chamber curtains divided it in the centre and beyond he could see a table laid for dinner  that half i use for a diningroom she remarked pointing towards it with one of her gloves which she had just taken off it makes this room small but it is a convenient arrangement do sit down  he bowed but remained standing with his elbow resting upon the draped mantelboard she took off her hat and coat hanging them over the back of a chair and advanced towards him  she was in her dancing dress a floating mass of yellow draperies and the firelight gleamed strangely upon her dusky perfect face with its olive colouring and soft glowing eyes she came so close to him that a faint odour from the handkerchief in her hand stole up to him  he was playing with an ornament on the shelf and his fingers tightened convulsively around it it snapped in two in his hand he did not notice it he leaned forward towards her and his strong voice vibrated with feeling  and it was for this then adrea kiros that you ran away from the convent st lucile my god     chapter iv  adreas diary   today i have made my entrance in the first scene of the drama of life today therefore i commence my memoirs everything before goes for nothing  as i have removed myself altogether from all association with the humdrum existence which might have been mine i am naturally friendless for the present so far as the other sex is concerned i fancy that that could be easily remedied but no women are likely to care about making my acquaintance and i am glad of it i hate womenmen too i think at any rate there will be no one of whom i shall make a confidant so i have chosen you my silent friend i gave a guinea for you in bond street and with your dainty morocco case and binding i think you are well worth it at any rate you will be faithful so far as silence is concerned  today has been an eventful one i have made my debut as a dancer and paul de vaux has been here in this house alone with me that is hard to realize but it is so he has altered since he used to pay me periodical visits at the conventand so have i i imagine yet he recognised me how pale and stern he looked when he stood up on the hearthrug and called me by my name he is very handsomehandsomer now even than on that day when he stood by in that chamber of death and saw my father murdered without lifting his hand ah paul de vaux paul de vaux that was an evil day for you did you never think that that little brown girl as you called her would grow up some day or did you think that she would forget bah what fools men are  he remembered me how grave he looked and yet how tender his voice sounded he did not forget that he was my guardian and i his ward how bewildered and anxious he was was i living quite alone had i no friends did i think it wise to lay myself open to so much notice  he had come close to my chair and was leaning down so that his head nearly touched mine really when i looked up i thought that he was going to take me into his arms i looked up and laughed softly into his face  he said no more i invited him to dine with me and promised to dance to him afterwards i even let my hand rest for a moment upon his shoulder and whisperedbut nimporte he behaved just as i would have had him behave he took up his hat and walked straight out of the room it was rude but it was magnificent ah paul de vaux you may struggle as long as you like but in the end you will be mine     chapter v  the faroff muttering of the storm to come   paul  paul had walked unannounced into his mothers favourite little sittingroom at vaux court tired and travelstained she rose to her feet and looked at him anxiously  dont be alarmed mother he said stooping down and kissing her theres nothing at all the matter  arthur is well  quite well i was with him yesterday afternoon theres nothing the matter london was boring me thats all and i thought id run down here and have a look at the old place and perhaps a days hunting  relieved of her anxiety mrs de vaux was unaffectedly pleased to see her eldest son she was a fine whitehaired old lady dignified and handsome but with very few soft lines about her comely face  i am delighted to see you of course paul the meet is at dytchley woods tomorrow i hope youll have a good day take your coat off i have rung for some tea  thanks how bright and cheerful the fire seems i walked from the station and it was miserably cold  of course it was i wish i had known you were coming we have so little work for the carriage horses  i did not make up my mind until half an hour before the train started paul answered dick carruthers wanted me to run over to paris with him for a couple of days and i was undecided which to do i heard that it was cold and wet there though and there is always a charm about this old place which makes me glad to come back to it  there is not such another place in england his mother remarked pouring out the tea although this is such an outlandish county there have been a dozen people here this week asking to be allowed to see over the abbey i always give permission when you are away and there is no one stopping here  paul drank his tea and stretched himself out in his low chair with an air of comfort  i am glad you let them see the place mother he said it is only right what class of people do you have as a rule clergymen and ecclesiastical architects i suppose  chiefly there are a good many americans though and yesterday or the day before a roman catholic priest he spent the day in the cloisters and wandering about the abbey i believe  paul looked up suddenly and drew his chair back out of the firelight for the first time his mother noticed how pale and ghastly his face was  paul are you ill she asked anxiously what is the matter with you  nothing i am only tired it is a long journey you knowand the walk from the station indeed it is nothing else i am quite well  his mother resumed her seat she had risen in sudden alarm her sons face had frightened her  you look just as your poor father used to look sometimes she said softly it always frightened me it was as though you had a pain somewhere or had suddenly seen a ghost you are sure you are well  quite mother you need have no fear arthur and i have your constitution i think  his tone was deeper almost hollow he still kept his chair back amongst the shadows mrs de vaux was only partially satisfied  i am afraid you have been keeping too late hours paul or reading too much lord westover was saying the other day that you were in a very bohemian setjournalists and artists and those sort of people i am afraid they keep awful hours  lord westover knows nothing about it paul answered wearily ordinary london society would tire me to death in a fortnight there is another class of people though whose headquarters are in london far more cultured and quite as exclusive with whom association is a far greater distinction i can go anywhere in the first set because i am paul de vaux of vaux abbey and have forty thousand a year i am permitted to enter the other only as the author of an unfashionable novel which a few of them have thought leniently of which seem the worthier conditions  i am answered paul of course in a sense you are right i am an old woman and the twaddle of a london drawingroom would fall strangely upon my ears now but i had my share of it before arthur was born if i were a man i should want varietya little sauceand you are right to seek for it and now wont you go and have a bath and change your things you still look pale and i think it would refresh you shall i ring for reynolds i suppose you have not brought your own man  he stretched out his hand and arrested her fingers upon the bell in a moment mother it is so comfortable here and i really think it is my favourite room  he looked round approvingly it was a curious hexagonal chamber with an oakbeamed ceiling curving into a dome the walls were hung with a wonderful tapestry of a soft rich colour and every piece of furniture in the room was of the louis quinze period there was scarcely a single anachronism the martin de vaux of forty years ago had been an artist and a man of taste and when he had brought home his bride a dukes daughter he had spent a small fortune on this apartment since then it had always been her favourite and she was always glad to hear any one praise it  i seldom sit in any other she remarked complacently the blue drawingroom is open tonight but that is because lord and lady westover are dining here i am afraid may will not be able to come she has a cold or something of the sort i wonder whether it is true what they say that she is delicate  paul did not appear much interested he had a purpose in lingering here and it had nothing to do with may westovers health there was a little information he wished to obtain without exciting his mothers curiosity but it was not exactly an easy matter  i was interested in what you said about the visitors here he remarked i daresay to americans this place must be very interesting  you would think so if you saw some of them they are a great deal too inquisitive and familiar for reynolds he detests them it is far more interesting to think of that catholic priest who was here the other day he lingered about the place as though he had known it all his life and loved it and reynolds says he prayed for two hours in the chapel  did you see him yourself  yes in the distance i did not notice him particularly i wished afterwards that i had reynolds report of him pleased me so much i daresay he was conjuring up pictures of the days when the old abbey was full of greyhooded monks and the chapel was echoing day and night to their solemn chants and prayers sometimes in the gloaming i can almost fancy myself that i see them kneeling in long rows in those rich stalls and hear the rustle of their gowns as they pass slowly down the aisles i think he must have found it sad to linger about in that beautiful chapel so cold and empty and bare that is why i like roman catholics they have such a strong reverential affection for their places of worship and take such a delight in adorning them it is almost like a personal love  paul moved uneasily in his chair and looked steadily into the fire then you did not notice him particularly  notice him notice whom  this priest or whoever he was  i did not see his face paul if that is what you mean i only remember that he was tall you seem very much interested in him no doubt reynolds could tell you anything you wish to know here he is you had better ask him  a greyheaded manservant had entered bearing a lamp mrs de vaux turned to him  reynolds mr paul is interested in hearing about the priest who spent so much time looking over the abbey yesterday can you describe him  reynolds set down the lamp and turned respectfully around not very well im afraid sir he said doubtfully they all seem so much alike you know sir in those long gowns he was tall rather thin and no hair on his face at all i cant say that i noticed anything else except that he spoke in rather a foreign accent  you are sure he was a priest i suppose paul asked carelessly we hear so much now of impostors and of things being stolen from places of interest that it makes one feel suspicious  i am quite sure he was no impostor sir reynolds answered confidently he was too interested in the place for that he knew its history better than any one who has ever been here in my day if he had been one of those sneaking sort of fellows looking about for what he could get he would have offered me money and tried to get rid of me for a time i think sir  thats true paul remarked were you with him all the time then  very nearly sir he did not like my leaving him at all he was afraid of missing something worth seeing besides he did not ask to come into the house at all not even to see the pictures he spent all his time in the ruins  that ends the matter of course paul answered shortly there is nothing out there to attract pilferers sorry i said anything about it  he asked whether you spent much of your time here and when you would be down again sir reynolds remarked as he turned to quit the room  paul looked up and then stood quite still for a moment without speaking a great fear had fallen upon him out of the shadows of the past he seemed to see again that deathbed scene and the tragedy which had brought down the curtain upon two lives almost he could fancy himself again upon his yacht with the salt sea spray beating against his face and the white breakers hissing and seething around him as they made the dangerous passage towards that faint light which flickered and gleamed in the distant monastery tower they are safe they reach the land they are hurried into that great gloomy bedchamber where chill draughts rustled ghostlike amongst the heavy faded hangings and the feeble candlelight left weird shadows moving across the floor and upon the walls again he heard the rattling of the windowpanes bare and exposed to every gust of wind the faroff thunder of the sea like a deep continuous undernote and from an almost unseen corner of the chamber the monotonous broken rhythm of sad prayers for the dying mumbled by that dark curiouslooking priest and then when the background of the picture had formed itself in his memory he saw the deed itself he saw the white stricken face suddenly ablaze with that last effort of passionate life he saw the outstretched arm the line of fire and the sudden change in the countenance of the man who stood at the foot of the bed he saw the cool cynicism replaced by a spasm of ghastly fear and he heard the low gurgling cry dying away into a faint moan of terror as the murdered man sank on to the floor a crumpled heap and last of all he saw that little brown girl with her tumbled hair and tearstained face clasping the dead body and glaring at every one in the room with a storm of hatred and impotent fury in her flashing eyes and that last recollection brought him like a flash back to the presentbrought him swift bewildering memories of adrea shaking his heart and bringing the hot colour streaming into his face he remembered where he was and why he had left london he remembered too that he was not alone and with a little start he awoke to the present  reynolds had left the room and his mother was watching him curiously he found it hard to meet her steady questioning gaze without flinching  paul she said slowly you are in trouble  he shook his head it is nothing mothernothing at all i ought to beg your pardon for letting my thoughts run away with me so  she was too proud to ask him for his confidence and at that moment the rumbling of a gong reached them from the distant hall mrs de vaux rose  there are a few people dining here paul so you will not be late  i will be down mother the usual time i suppose  yes eight oclock  they left the room together but parted in the hall mrs de vaux stayed to speak to the housekeeper for a moment and paul ascended the broad staircase alone on the first corridor he paused standing before the deepcushioned sill of a higharched window and gazing at the ruined portion of the abbey the air outside was frosty and clear and though the moon as yet was only faintly yellow every arch and cloister was clearly visible paul gazed down at them as he had done all his life with reverent eyes there was something almost awesome in the graceful yet bold outline and in the great age of those rugged mossgrown pillars and arches so ecclesiastical in their shape and suggestivenessas indeed they might well be for they were practically the ruins of the old monastery chapel but as he looked the expression in his eyes suddenly changed a dark figure had passed slowly out from the shadow of the arches and stood looking up towards the house rigid solemn and motionless paul covered his face with his hands and sank down upon the cushioned windowsill     chapter vi  an ashen grey delight   mr de vaux  paul turned quickly around in his saddle towards the young lady who had addressed him he looked into a fair thoughtful face whose general amiability was discounted just then by a decided frown  i beg your pardon lady may didnt you say something just now  didnt i say something just now she repeated with fine scorn upon my word mr de vaux i think that you must have left your wits in london what is the matter with you  the matter why nothing im sorry  oh pray dont apologise she interrupted hastily i think ill ride on and catch papa up  he laid his hand upon her rein please dont lady may he begged i know ive been inattentive im very sorryreally i am let me try and make up for it  she looked into his face and she was mollified he was evidently in earnest  oh very well she said you mustnt think that i complained without due cause though for i spoke to you three times before you answered me oh its all right she went on as he commenced to frame another apology i dont mind now but i really should like to know what is the matter with you you have ridden all day like a man who valued neither his own life nor his horses some of your jumps were simply reckless i have heard other people say so too i like bold riding but there is a limit and though ive ridden two hounds since papa gave me my first pony ive never seen any one try to jump annisforth brook below the bridge beforeand dont want to again she added with a little shudder i know you ride fine horses but you are not generally foolhardy i saw your dark bay mare being taken home at colbourne spinneys and i dont think shell be fit to ride again this season old harrison had tears in his eyes when he saw her  harrison is an old woman about horses i never touched meg with the spurs she was as fresh as paint and there was no holding her  you cant deceive me or yourself lady may continued calmly you have been riding for a fall all day and you may think yourself pretty fortunate that you havent a broken neck it seemed as though you were trying for one and now that you havent succeeded you have nearly ridden ten miles alone with me and scarcely opened your mouth you are very provoking mr de vaux i wish i had ridden home with captain fellowes  he was on the point of reminding her that the arrangement had not been of his making but he checked himself after all lady may had some grounds for her irritation they had been friends since they had been children and paul knew that every one expected him someday to ask lady may to become the mistress of vaux abbey there had been a little more than intimacy even in their friendship up till twelve months ago and paul had certain recollections of their last interview which had made him more than once a trifle uneasy as a matter of fact lady may had quite made up her mind that paul de vaux would certainly ask her to marry him some time and she had on his account refused two very eligible offers their people desired it and in her heart lady may was conscious that paul was a little more to her than any other man could be so she felt herself at first aggrieved by his long silence during their ride home which to tell the truth she had carefully planned for and afterwards was just on the verge of being seriously offended  dont be angry with me please he said quietly you are right something is the matter i am worried  she was sympathetic and kindly at once im so sorry please forgive me for bothering you you used to tell me your troubles once are we too old now  he shook his head i hope we never shall be he said i cant tell you all but one thing is this i had a letter from a man in town todaya man whom i can trustabout arthur you know what an impressionable sensitive boy he is anyone who once obtains an influence over him can do nearly what they like with him he seemsso my correspondent tells meto have become completely fascinated with aadanceradrea kiros i think she calls herself  i have heard of her lady may murmured she dances only at private houses i think everyone says she is wonderful  she iswonderful paul said slowly he was about to say more but he checked himself lady may was watching him and he knew that he could not speak of adrea kiros unmoved so he went on  i am not complaining for after all it is perfectly natural but arthur is certainly his mothers favorite son you know how strict she is in some of her notions so you can understand what a shock it would be to her if any rumors were to reach her ears it would be a terrible blow to her but apart from that the thing is serious in itself arthur was always delicate and cismy friendspeaks of him as looking ghastly ill the girl is probably only amusing herself although she seems to have given him plenty of encouragement but i know adadrea kiros she is no ordinary girl of her class in the whole world i doubt if there breathes a more dangerous woman he wound up in a low tone  lady may was quite sympathetic now but a little mystified i am so sorry she said softly ought you not to go to london and try what your influence can do with him that is disinterested advice at any rate she added with a little laugh for i dont want you to go but arthur always seemed to look up to you so you might be able to get him away dont you think it would be a good thing if you could get him down here we would make it as lively as possible for him up at the castle and i dont know how your preserves are but ours have been scarcely touched yet between the two of us at any rate he could have as much shooting as he liked and i would ask the fergusson girls to come and stay she went on getting more and more in love with her plan he was so much taken with amy you know when they were down here before we could get up some theatricals or something and have quite a good time what do you think of my plan  he was thankful for her long speech for it had enabled him to get over the slight agitation which the thought of that unavoidable journey to london had called up in him from the first he had felt that it was his duty to go he had received this disquieting letter two days ago and since then he had telegraphed twice and written to arthur without getting any reply yes he must go and mingled with that reluctance and nameless apprehension which he felt at the thought of returning into her neighbourhood he was acutely conscious all the time of a certain vague but sweet pleasure at the thought that fate had so ordained it perhaps it would be necessary for him to see her a thrill of pleasure passed through him at the thought followed almost immediately by a reaction of keen and bitter disgust with himself he set his teeth and quite unconsciously dug his spurs into his horses sides with the natural result that she reared up almost unseating him and then plunged forward he had to gallop her along the road for a few hundred yards and then turned round and rejoined lady may fortunately she had not seen the commencement of the little episode  whatever was the matter she asked  i fancy my spurs must have pricked her he said apologetically i was riding quite carelessly  well please dont let it happen again she begged eyeing his mares flanks suspiciously dandy is very tired now and is generally good tempered but i dont think he would stand much of that sort of thing  im really very sorry he said  she nodded all right and now what do you think of my plan are you going to london  i think your plan is a very good one indeed and i shall run up to town tomorrow he said it is very good of you to be so interested  he looked down into her face a fair sweet face it was and then glanced away over the bare moorland which stretched on one side of them it was a late november afternoon and a faint yellow light was lingering in the west where the sun had just set colouring the clouds which stretched across the sky in long level streaks a fresh healthy breeze strong with the perfume of the sea blew in their teeth and afar off they could hear the waves dashing against the ironbound line of northern cliffs inland the country was more cultivated but hilly and broken up with masses of lichencovered rock and little clumps of thin fir trees he knew the scenery so well the rugged barren country with its great stretches of moorland and little patches of cultivated land with its silent tarns its desolation and the evervarying music of the sea they all meant home to him and he loved them it had always been so and yet he felt it at that moment as he had never felt it before the prospect of that journey to london was suddenly loathsome to him the clear physical healthfulness of his northcountry home was triumphant for the moment over that other passion which seemed to him then weak and artificial it seemed to him also looking down into lady mays fresh thoughtful face that she was somehow in accord with these surroundingsthat she was indeed the link the safeguard which should bind him to them the good influence which should keep him fit to breathe gods pure air and to keep himself as he had ever striven to sans peur et sans reproche paul was no sentimentalist in the idle and common sense of the word in his attitude to everyday life he was essentially practical sometimes perhaps a little too practical but he was capable of strong feeling and it came then with a rush he leant over towards lady may and laid his hand upon her saddle  you are very kind and sympathetic he said softly you are always kind  she looked up at him pleased and with a soft look in her deep grey eyes you do not give me very much opportunity she said quietly at one time you used to tell me all your troubles do you remember  yes i remember he answered almost in a whisper for they were riding up a grassgrown avenuea back way to the abbeyand their horses hoofs sank noiselessly into the soft turf sometimes i have dared to hope that those days may come again  she was silent and her head was turned away lest he might see the tears trembling in her eyes so they rode on for a moment or two walking their horses in the dim twilight she in the shadow of the grey wall and the overhanging trees and he very close to her with his hand still upon her saddle and his reins loose in his hand  if ever they did if ever i was so fortunate he went on in a low tone you would find your office no sinecure i have troubles or rather one trouble and a great one may  she looked at him for a moment her eyes full of sympathy she dimly remembered the time when strange stories were current in the county of martin de vaux and their echo had remained for years it was not for her to inquire about them and she never had done so but that their burden should have fallen upon paul it was hard her heart was sore with the injustice of it a woman is a swift and censorious judge of any one who brings trouble upon the man she loves  he was a little closer to her still and suddenly the hand which carried her small whip felt itself grasped in strong fingers and held tightly  may  it was not his fault this time that his mare stood still and then ran backwards dislodging the topmost stones from the grey stone wall with her hind quarters and then plunging violently this time there was cause for her alarm a tall forbiddinglooking figure stood in the middle of the avenue grasping the rein of lady mays terrified horse he had come out of the twilight so suddenly and his attire was so unusual that paul and lady may were almost as surprised as the animals pauls first instinct was one of anger  what the  he stopped short the man who had startled them so had quieted lady mays horse with a few soothing words and now stood out of the deep shade of the overhanging trees into the centre of the avenue even here his face was scarcely visible but his figure and attire were sufficient he wore the long robes and shovel hat of a roman catholic priest  paul broke off in the middle of his exclamation and the arm which had been grasping his whip tightly sank nervelessly to his side he was thankful for the twilight which concealed the grey shade which had stolen into his face yet now that the blow had fallen he was calmer than he had been in some of his anticipations of it for it had indeed fallen in the dusky twilight he had recognised the face of the priest changed though it was he rode up and addressed him  have you lost your way he asked quietly this is a private road and the gate at the other end is locked  the priest looked at him steadily for a moment and then drew on one side as though to let them pass  i am sorry that i startled your horses he said in a soft pleasant voice marked with a strong foreign accent i was standing with my back to you waiting for the moon to rise behind the ruins there and the soft ground made your approach noiseless and if i am trespassing i am sorry the steward at the abbey yonder gave me permission to wander anywhere around the ruins i have perhaps exceeded a little his bounds  it is of no consequence paul said you find the ruins interesting then  very  there are some pictures in the abbey you might care to seemostly modern but there is a rubens and two giorgiones  the priest removed his hat i thank you but i am only interested in ecclesiastical art these ruins are more to me than any picturessave those which rome alone possesses he added i spend all my evenings here and hope to be allowed to for the short time that i remain in the neighbourhood  you have my permission to come and go as you please i am mr de vaux paul said touching his horse with the whip goodevening  goodevening sir goodevening madam i thank you  they rode on down the avenue paul silent and absorbed and making no attempt to pursue the conversation at the bend of the lane he turned round in his saddle the priest was standing with his back to them motionless and silent as a figure of stone     chapter vii  who are you and what your mission   the winter moon soft and bright and full looked down upon the ruins of vaux abbey a strange beauty lay upon the bare rockstrewn hillside and desolate moor afar off a grey brawling stream was touched by its light and in its place a band of gold seemed coiled around the grey sleeping hill a black reedgrown tarn at the foot of the abbey gleamed and quivered like a fair silver shield the dark pines which crowned their sandy slopes lost their forbidding frown in an unaccustomed softness and every harsh line and broken pillar of the ruined chapel was toned down into a rich sad softness a human face too uplifted to the sky so silent and motionless that it seemed almost set into the side of one of those groined arches had lost all its harshness and worldliness in the glow of that falling light it might have been the face of a saint save for the vague unhappiness which shone in the clear dark eyes for at that moment spirituality wistfulness and reverence seemed carved into the white still features but there was disquiet too and after a while as though some cloud had passed across the moon a dark shade stole into the white face the brows were contracted into a frown and the eyes filled with restless doubt father adrian moved away from the shadow of the pillar and stood tall and motionless on the ruined chapel floor with his eyes fixed upon the distant landscape after a moment or two his lips began to move and he commenced to speak aloud in a low deep tone  six nights has my voice gone up to god from amongst these silent ruins six nights i have prayed in rain these fair still evenings mock me whose is their beauty if it be not gods and if there be a god and if the blessed virgin our holy mother indeed dwells amongst the stars why are their faces turned from me oh that man knew a little more or a little lessenough to pierce the mystery of yon starcrowned heavens or so little as to gaze on them unmoved and unfeeling what is our little knowledge a mockery a dreary hopeless mockery i had better have rotted in that miserable monastery a soulless lifeless being than have stepped out to struggle with a world which is only a terrible riddle to me i cannot reason with it i cannot laugh or weep with it i am in it but not of it why was i sent oh i why was i sent  the snapping of a twig caused him to turn suddenly round paul de vaux was advancing through the ruins with a loose cloak thrown over his evening clothes  father adrian turned round to meet him the two men stood for a moment face to face without speaking both recognised that this interview was to be no ordinary one and in a certain sense each seemed to be measuring the others strength it was paul who spoke first  we have met before father adrian  yes  you will scarcely wonder that i am surprised to see you here in england have you left the monastery at cruta  i left it a month after you did  but your vowswere they not for life paul asked  father adrian smiled scornfully i was not bound to cruta he answered there had been complaints and i was there to investigate them the monastery was poverty and diseasestricken it is closed now forever  then you are no monk  father adrian shook his head i am and i am not in my youth i served my novitiate but i never took the oaths the cloisters are for holier men than i  then who are you  i amfather adrian priest of the roman catholic church i can tell you no more  the moonlight was falling full upon his dark striking face paul with bent brows scanned every feature of it intently father adrian bore the scrutiny without flinching and without discomposure only once the colour mounted a little into his cheeks as the eyes of the two men met  what brings you to vaux abbey father adrian paul asked at length  to see your home was the quiet reply  what do you want with me it must be something more than curiosity which has brought you all this way what is it  father adrian was silent yet his silence was not one of confusion he was looking down through the gaps in the ruined chapel walls at the dark gothic front of the old abbey paul waited for an answer and it came at last  i wished to see the home of martin de vaux the englishman who died in my arms at the monastery of cruta for six nights i have prayed for his soul in purgatory amongst the ruins here he died in grievous sin  have you come to remind me of it paul asked bitterly perhaps you have repented of your silence and have come to break the widows heart by telling her the story of his last moments perhapsperhaps in those dark hours he told you his secrettold you why he had come to cruta  he did said the priest gravely  my god  it was a great shock to paul hitherto he had feared only one thing that the story of his fathers tragical death might come to light and break his mothers heart now there was more to fearfar more he looked into father adrians face with a new and keener interest he recognised at once that everything dear to him in life might be at this mans mercy  you were intrusted with this secret by a dying man paul said with a little hoarseness in his tone it is to you as the secrets of the confessional  the priest shook his head gently he refused to confess he told me distinctly that it was as man to man he spoke to me  paul looked away into the night with white stricken face and cursed his fathers weakness supposing that this priest had discovered that his conscience would not allow him to keep the secret what more likely why else was he herewhy else did he disclaim the confessional there was only one other alternative perhaps he desired to trade upon his secret yet how was that possible of what use could money be to him what could he gain by it besides his was not the face of an adventurer  i do not understand paul said at last once more let me ask you father adrian why are you here  father adrian looked thoughtfully away you ask more than i can tell you he said gravely the time has not yet come we shall meet again farewell  the priest turned away but paul laid his hand on his shoulder  if there is anything which you ought or mean to tell me tell me now he demanded hoarsely i can bear everything but suspense i know onlythat there was a secret no more proceed tell me more  the priest shook his robe free from pauls restraining hand and turned away  not yet not yet my mind is not yet clear we shall meet again farewell  but  farewell  the priest had passed from the ruins and was already out of sight in the gathering darkness  come back father adrian one word more  farewell  the priest did not turn his head paul was left alone gazing after him with stern troubled face and anxious heart it was a danger which he had always foreseen always dreaded henceforth he must live like a man who paces day by day the brink of a volcano at any moment the blow might fall     chapter viii  i am weary of a hopeless love   paul and arthur shared a bachelor residence in mayfair shared it that is to say insomuch as paul had purchased it and was the sole proprietor and arthur used it whenever he could get leave from his regiment it was here paul found his brother on the morning of his arrival in london  they shook hands in silence paul did not wish to say anything for a moment his brothers appearance had choked him it was one oclock but he was still in his dressinggown with sunken pale cheeks save for one bright spot and with faint dark rims underneath his eyes there were a pile of blue papers and some ominouslooking envelopes on the table before him and paul could not help noticing the intense pallor of the hand which rested upon them  i wish you would let a fellow know what time you were coming arthur said rather peevishly but with an attempt at a smile i didnt expect you till evening so i was having a shack before dressing i was late last night  paul banished his gravity as far as possible and stood with his hands in his pockets leaning against the mantelpiece he heartily disliked the part of mentor and he did not wish to play it unless he were obliged  it was beastly early to get up he said but the connection at normanton is so much better one has to wait two hours by the late train and normanton is such a hole i dont know that i should have come up to town at all just yet he continued after a slight pause only that im on the committee at the club this term you know and i havent attended a single meeting yet besides i promised westover to put him up this time and the halfyearly meetings tomorrow you know got any engagement if not you might dine with me there always a full night election time you know  beastly sorry but my leaves up to night arthur answered ruefully i shall have to go down to aldershot by the four oclock train and do a weeks close grind  paul nodded im sorry id have liked you to run down home with me for a few days and see the mater the westovers have some very nice people coming to the castle and are going to get up some theatricals lady may says they must have you will you come in a week if i work the colonel  im afraid i cant arthur answered with a slight flush in his cheeks i have some engagements for next week andandim sure i cant manage it  the materll be disappointed paul said quietly she is counting on seeing you and its some time since you were down isnt it tell you what old man id try and manage it if i were you  i cant promise i will if i can manage it ill write you from aldershot  you dont look quite the thing paul said kindly nothing the matter is there  nothing at all arthur assured him hastily im quite well a bit of a head thats all  not too many of those bits of paper about eh paul asked pointing to an oblong strip of blue paper which lay face uppermost on the table  arthur coloured and threw a book over it  i am sorry i saw it paul went on but it was there to be seen wasnt it  oh yes thats all right i oughtnt to have left it about thats all im not exactly a croesus like you you know paul and now and then im obliged to raise the wind somehow yes i know what youre going to say my allowance is a good one and i ought to make it do but you see sometimes i cant  i hope you wont mind my asking arthur but is that an acceptance of your own  arthur nodded there are a few accounts which i must pay he said so im going to ask plimsoll to do it for me hes a decent fellow of his sort you know lots of fellows go to him  paul stretched out his hand give it to me he said and i will discount it for you thanks  paul took it and just glancing at the amount threw it into the fire i havent my cheque book here he said but we will call at the bank on our way to the club and i can get the money im glad i saw it  its awfully good of you arthur said hesitatingly i shouldnt have thought of asking you i must owe you an awful lot already  never mind what you owe me ill write it all off arthur and this last amount too if youll do me a favour come down home with me next week as soon as you can get leave  arthur rose to his feet and then leaning against the mantelboard buried his face in his hands i cant leave london paulor if i did it could only be for a day he said in a low tone i wish i could tell you why but i cant you wouldnt understand  i think i know paul said quietly there is some one whom you do not care to leave is that not it  arthur looked up quickly his face was very white and his lip was quivering  who told you that what do you know  i know nothing i want you to tell me perhaps i could help you there is alady in the case isnt there  arthur stood up on the hearthrug and spoke with a subdued passion trembling in his tone  yes its adrea kiros the dancer i daresay youve heard all about it i dont see why you shouldnt i cant leave her i know all that you would say it doesnt make any difference she isnt good well i know it she doesnt care for me i dont believe she does shes as cruel as a woman can be sometimes when i am away from her the thought of going back makes me shudder and yet i could no more keep away than lift the roof from this house of course this sounds like rigmarole to you you think im raving i dont blame you only it is so and i cant help it i am as much a prisoner as any poor devil in newgate  paul laid his hand upon his brothers shoulder and looked kindly into his face arthur im very sorry and dont think i dont understand i do i do not know much of aof adrea kiros but i know enough to tell me that she is a very dangerous woman cant i help you somehow  ii dont think you can i dont think any one can arthur exclaimed unsteadily he had been prepared for a lecture for good advice for a little contempt even but his brothers attitude was unexpected and it almost unnerved him it is the uncertainty of it all that is so tormenting he went on sometimes she is so kind and sweet and thoughtful that i could almost worship her and then without any cause she will suddenly become cold and hard and cruel till i hate myself for bearing quietly all that she says but i do i cant help it i am never quite happy even when she is in one of her sweetest moods for i never know how long it will last the moment i leave her i begin to get anxious and wonder how she will be the next day  try what a change will do arthur his brother begged  arthur shook his head its no use ive tried if i went away i should only be miserable and hurry back by the first train oh if only i could make you understand he cried with a little passionate gesture which gained pathos and almost dignity from the expression on his white sorrowing face adrea is as necessary to me as the air we breathe the sun has no light and the day no ending till i have seen her she is the measure of all things to me joy grief happiness misery it is her hand that deals them out to me she can play upon the chords of my being as she chooses a look or word from her can pull me down into hell or transport me into a seventh heaven who gave her this power i cannot tell but she has it she has it  paul said no more perhaps he recognised that for the present at any rate it was useless he walked up and down the room for a few minutes in sympathetic silence when he spoke again he made no reference to the subject but arthur understood get your things on and come out to lunch with me he said pleasantly i am too hungry to be sympathetic and we can call at coutts on the way  arthur nodded and disappeared paul took his chair for a while and as he sat there gazing into the fire his face grew grey and haggard was adrea kiros seeking vengeance on the son of her fathers murderer he wondered if so it seemed as though she were indeed succeeding how could he save arthur and what would happen if those rumours should reach his mothers ears as some day they certainly would at any rate he would see adrea himself before he left london he had made up his mind that if arthur refused to listen to him that should be his course  things somehow seemed brighter when they walked down to the club together dress makes so much difference to a man and arthur spruce and debonair with a gardenia in his buttonhole and every part of his attire almost faultily faultless according to the canons of london fashion presented a very different appearance to the tragicallooking personage of half an hour ago there was a slight air of subdued feverishness about him though not altogether healthy and the dark rims had not quite vanished from underneath his eyes  paul i wonder whether you will do something for me he asked as they were crossing pickadilly i hate asking you  ill try paul answered what is it  i dont believe youll like it butthe fact is adrea wants you to go and see her i promised that i would do my best to get you to call with me this afternoon if you dont mind i wish you would he added wistfully  i will go with you certainly if you wish it paul answered not too cordially for he did not wish his brother to know that it was what he had already planned to do did she tell you that we had already a slight acquaintance  yes you rode home in a cab together from lady swindons didnt you there was only one and it was raining so you shared it adrea told me that  paul nodded he meant after he had seen adrea to consider whether it would not be best to tell his brother everything but for the present her story was enough they turned into pall mall and almost immediately arthurs hat was in his hand and he was on the edge of the pavement colouring with pleasure a small victoria had pulled up by the side and paul found himself face to face with adrea  she was muffled up in rich brown furs and almost invisible but her dark eyes flashed into his from underneath her thick veil after the first greeting she scarcely noticed arthur it was paul upon whom her eyes were bent  you are in london again then mr de vaux she remarked have you discovered that after all the country is a little triste in this land of damp and fogsthe country in november i meanor is it only important business which has brought you up  the latter he answered as it happens i am glad to see that the damp and fogs which you complain of have not affected your health  i am quite well thanks she answered how long are you staying in town  for less than a week i think  well it is too cold to talk here will you come and let me give you some tea this afternoon after the fashion of you strange islanders i want you to please  paul looked her straight in the face you are very kind i shall be glad to he answered  she nodded about five oclock i go to sleep till then shall you come arthur she added carelessly  i cannot so late as that he answered despondently  ah i forgot you are going down to aldershot arent you dont overwork yourself  she nodded and the carriage drove on arthur watched it until it was out of sight she might have said a little earlier he remarked despondently she knew i couldnt come so late as that  paul passed his arm through his brothers and was silent he knew very well that adrea had thought of this when she had made the arrangement  they lunched together and paul did his utmost to make the time pass pleasantly for his brother when they parted too late in the afternoon he referred once more to mrs de vauxs desire that he should come down to the abbey for a few days  i want you to think of it seriously arthur he said as they shook hands through the carriage window the mother is very anxious to have you and i am sure we can make things pleasant for you i shall speak to drummond about leave if i see him tomorrow  arthur assented dubiously and without any enthusiasm  awfully good of you to want me he remarked i daresay ill be able to come ill try anyhowjust for a day or two  the train steamed off and paul walked slowly back to his carriage  where to sir the man asked  paul hesitated for a moment then he gave adreas address and was driven away     chapter ix  ah how fair my weakness finds thee   paul found no one in the hall of the house where adrea lived to take him to her so after waiting a few minutes for her maid whom the porter had twice fruitlessly summoned he ascended the stairs alone and knocked at the door of her rooms  at first there was no reply he tried again a little louder and this time there was a sound of some one stirring within  come in celeste was the drowsy answer  he turned the handle and walked in carefully closing the door behind him at first the room appeared to be in semidarkness for a clear spring days sunshine was brightening the streets which he had just left and here the heavy curtains were closely drawn as though to keep out every vestige of daylight but gradually his eyes grew accustomed to the shaded twilight and he could make out the familiar objects of the room for although it was only his second visit they were familiar already in his thoughts  strangely enough it seemed to him after his first hasty glance around that the room was empty but just then a sudden gleam from the bright fire fell upon adreas hair and he saw her he stood for a moment silent and motionless she was curled up on a huge divan drawn close to the fireplace with her limbs doubled under her like a panthers and her arms from which the loose sleeves had fallen back clasped halfbare underneath her head the peculiar grace of movement and carriage which had made her dancing so famous was even more striking in repose for there was a faint insidious suggestion of voluptuous movement in those motionless crouching limbs and the abandon of the shapely dusky head with its crown of dark wavy hair thrown back amongst the cushions it was beauty of a strange sort the beauty almost of some wild animal but paul felt a most unwilling admiration steal through his senses as he gazed down upon her her teagown a wonderful shade of shimmering green tumbled and disarranged out of all similitude to its original shape followed the soft perfections of her outline with such peculiar faithfulness that it seemed to suggest even more than it concealed leaving the gentle tracery of her figure outlined there like a piece of living greek statuary she turned slightly upon the couch and a slipperless little foot stole out from a sea of lace and white draperies which her uneasy movement had left exposed and swayed slowly backwards and forwards trying to reach the ground her eyes were still closed but she was not sleeping for in a moment or two she spoke in a low drowsy tone  celeste i told you not to disturb me for an hour it isnt five oclock yet is it  he roused himself and moved a step further into the room it is still a quarter to five i think he said i have come before my time  she opened her eyes and then seeing him sprang into a sitting posture her hair which had escaped all bounds was down to her shoulders and her gown still further disarranged by her hasty movement floated around her in wonderful curves and angles had she been a past mistress in the art of picturesque effects she could have conceived nothing more striking paul felt all the old fear upon him as he watched the firelight gleaming upon her startled dusky face and the faint pink colouring wonderfully suggestive of a blush steal into her cheeks it seemed to him that she was as beautiful as a woman could be and yet so different from lady may  she rose and with a shrug of the shoulders and a quick graceful movement shook out her skirts and pushed the hair back from her face then she held out her hand and paul found himself compelled against his will to stand by her side  how strange that i should have overslept like this and have taken you for celeste she said yet perhaps it was natural for monsieur paul save celeste no one yet has permission to enter my chamber unannounced how comes it that i find you here to laugh at my deshabille  he was silent for a moment while she looked at him questioningly her soft delicate voice with its very slight but piquant foreign intonation had often sounded in his reluctant yet charmed ears since their last meeting but now that he heard it again he felt how weak were his imaginings and what sweet music it indeed was  i am sorry he answered and the constraint which he was placing upon his voice made it sound hard and cold the porter rang for your maid twice whilst i waited in the hall but as she did not come i thought i had better try and find the way myself  and i mistook your knock for celestes and let you discover me comme cela well you were not to blame see i will just arrange my hair here and you need not look at me unless you like  she stood up in front of a mirror over which she lighted a shaded candle and for a moment or two her white hands flashed deftly in and out amongst the dark silky coils of disordered hair paul sat down and taking up a magazine which he found lying on the divan tried to concentrate his thoughts upon its contents but he could not every moment he found his eyes and his thoughts straying to that slim lithe figure watching the play of her arms and the grace of her backward pose when she looked suddenly round on the completion of her task their eyes met  monsieur paul you are like all your sexcurious she said lightly tell me then do you admire my coiffure  very much he answered glancing at the loose grecian knot into which she had gathered her disordered hair and confined it with a band of dull gold it is quite oriental and it seems to suit you not that i am any judge of such matters he added quickly  she moved away with a little low laugh and lit two or three more of the shaded candles or fairy lamps which were placed here and there on brackets round the room then she rang the bell and gave some orders to the maid  so you think my hair looks oriental she said sinking down upon a huge cushion in front of the fire that is what the papers call me sometimesoriental my early associations asserting themselves you see i think i remember more of constantinople than any place she went on dreamily with her eyes fixed on the fire i was only a child in those days but it seemed to me then that nothing could be more beautiful than the city of mosques and the golden horn on a clear summer evening why do i think of those days she added shaking her head impatiently such folly and yet i always think of them when i am lonely  he was suddenly and deeply moved with altogether a new feeling towards herone of responsibility she was alone in the world and it was his fathers hand which had rendered her so how empty and barren had been his conception of the burden which that deed had laid upon him like a flash he seemed to see the whole situation in a new light if indeed she had drifted into ruin the sin lay at his door he should have found her a mother it should have been his care to have watched her continually and to have assured himself that she was contented and happy in those few moments the whole situation seemed to change and he even felt a hot flush of shame at his own coldness towards her he forgot the dancer the woman of strange fascinations the idol of the jeunesse dorée of west london clubdom and he remembered only the fact that she was a lonely orphan with a most womanly light in her soft dark eyes and that he had failed in his duty towards her paul was essentially a manly man selfcontained and with all his feelings very much at his control but at that moment he felt something like a rush of tenderness towards this strange darkeyed girl who lay coiled up at his feet involuntarily he stretched out his hand and laid it with an almost caressing gesture upon her hair  she started around as though electrified and looking up saw the change in his face it was the first kindly look or speech she had had from him since they had met in london and it had come so suddenly that it seemed to have a strange effect upon her a deep flush stole into her face and her eyes gleamed brilliantly she drew a long breath and underneath her loose gown he could see her bosom rising and falling quickly yet it all seemed so softened and womanly that the thoughts which he had once had of her seemed like a distant nightmare to him the ethical and physical horror of her beingof her ever becomingwhat he feared rose up strong within him and deepened at once his sense of responsibility towards her and his newborn tenderness he took her hand gently and was startled to find how cold it was  so you do feel lonely adrea sometimes he said softly although you have so many acquaintances  the colour burned deeper for a moment in her cheeks she looked at him half reproachfully half indignantly  acquaintances you mean the people who come to see me i hate them all sometimes they amuse me a little but that is all they are nothing  and you have no women friends  none how should i but i do not care i do not like englishwomen  but adrea it is not good for youthis isolation from your sex  at the sound of her christian name coming from his lips so gently almost affectionately she looked up quickly it seemed to him almost as though some softening change had crept over her was it the firelight he wondered or was it fancy  good for me she said softly have you just thought of that monsieur paul  again he felt that pang of conscience and yet was she not a little unjust to him  you took your life into your own hands he reminded her you chose for yourself  yes yes she answered drawing a little nearer to him till her head almost rested upon his knees i do not blame you  it would have been so easy before to have found a home for you he went on and now you have made it so difficult  there is no need she interrupted proudly i could keep myself now i do not want anything from you monsieur paulsave one thing  she raised her face to his and it seemed to him to be all aglow with a wonderful new light there was no mistaking the soft entreaty of those strange dark eyes so close to his or the tremor in his tones and then before he could answer her before he could summon up resolution enough to draw away she had stolen softly into his arms and with a little murmur of content had rested her small dusky head with its coronet of dark braided hair upon his shoulder and twined her hands around his neck  paul monsieur paul i am lonely and miserable love me just a little only a little she pleaded  it was the supreme moment for both of them to her coveting this love with all the passionate force of her fiery oriental nature time seemed to stand still while she rested passively in his arms neither altogether accepted nor altogether repulsed and to him as he sat there pale and shaken fighting fiercely against this great temptation which threatened his selfrespect his liberty of body and soul life seemed to have turned into a grim farce full of grotesque lights and shadows mocking and gibing at all which had seemed to him sweet and pure and strong her warm breath fell upon his cheek and her eyes maddened him a curiously faint perfume from her clothes floated upon the air and oppressed him with its peculiar richness he was a strong man but at that moment he faltered it seemed as though some unseen hand were weaving a spell upon him as though his whole environment was being drawn in around him and he himself were powerless yet even in that moment of intoxication his reason did not altogether desert him he knew that if he opened his arms to receive that clinging figure and drew the delicate tearstained face full of mute invitation down to his to be covered with passionate kisseshe knew that at that moment he would sign the deathwarrant to all that had seemed fair and sweet and comely in his life forever he must live without selfrespect a dishonoured man in his own eyes perhaps some day in hersfor he had no more faith in her love than in his  he held her hands tightly in hishe had unwound them gently from his neckand stood up face to face with her upon the hearthrug the soft firelight threw up strange ruddy gleams which glowed around her and shown in her dark eyes fixed so earnestly and so passionately upon his  adrea he said and his low hoarse tone sounded harsh and unfamiliar to his ears you do not know  she interrupted him she threw her arms again around his neck and her upturned face almost met his  i do know i do know i understandeverything only icannot live without you paul  her head sank upon his shoulder he could not thrust her away very gently he passed his arms around her and drew her to him he knew that he could trust himself for him the battle was over even as she had crept into his arms there had come to him a flash of memorya sudden swift vision the walls of the dimly lit dainty little chamber with all its charm of faint perfume soft lights and luxurious drapings had opened before him and he looked out upon another world a bare northumbrian moor with its tumbled masses of grey rock its lowhanging misty clouds and silent tarns stretched away before his eyes a strong fresh breeze saltsmelling and bracing cooled his hot face the roar of a great ocean thundered in his ears and an angry sunset burned strange colours into the western sky and with these actual memories came a healthier tone of feelingsomething indeed of the old northcountry puritanism which was in his blood the sea spoke to him of the vastness of life and dared him to cast his away soiled and tarnished for the sake of a brief passionate delight the breeze natures very voice whispered to him to stand true to himself and taste once more and for ever the deep joy of pure and perfect communion with her the voices of his past life spoke to him in one long sweet chorus and held up to him those ideals to which he had been ever true and blended with all were memories faint but sweet of a fair womanly face into whose clear grey eyes he could never dare to look again if he yielded now to this fierce temptation a new strength came upon him and brought with it a great tenderness  adrea my child he said softly you make me almost forget that i am your guardian and you are my ward sit down here i want to talk to you  he led her dumb and unresisting to a chair and stood by her side  adrea  she interrupted him throwing his arms roughly from her shoulder and springing to her feet  how dare you touch me how dare you stand there and mock me oh how i hate you hate you hate you  her voice and every limb trembled with passion and her face was as pale as death before her anger he bowed his head and was silent against the sombre background of dark curtains her slim form seemed to gain an added strength and dignity  you have insulted me paul de vaux do i not owe you enough already without putting this to the score dare you think that it was indeed my love i offered youyou who stood by and saw my father murdered that you might be spared from shame and disgrace bah listen to me and go you have a brother good i shall ruin him shall break his heart and when the task is over i shall cast him away like an old glove oh it will be easy never fear i shall do it arthur is no cold hypocrite like you he is my slave and when i have ruined him have set my foot upon him it will be your turn monsieur paul de vaux listen i will know my fathers secret i will know why he was murdered i will discover everything some day the whole world shall knowfrom me now go out of my sight i say go go go  with bowed head and face as white as death paul walked out of the room with her words ringing in his ears like the mocking echoes of some hideous nightmare     chapter x  i am but a slave and yet i bid thee come   were there any letters for me this morning mother paul asked  only one for you i think mrs de vaux answered from across the teatray i believe you will find it in the library shall i send for it  paul shook his head it will keep he answered lightly i can get it on my way upstairs have we anything left to tell lady may  i think not lady may replied from the depths of an easy chair drawn up to the fire altogether it has been a glorious day and such a scent i dont know when i have enjoyed anything so much  nor i paul answered heartily the going was superb and that second fox took us over a grand stretch of country really if it hadnt been for the walls here and there we might have been in leicestershire may i have some more tea mother  mrs de vaux stretched out her hand for his cup and smiled gently at their enthusiasm she had been a hunting woman all her life and though she seldom even drove to a meet now she liked to have her son come in to afternoon tea with her and talk over the run of late too he had seemed so pale and listless that she had been getting a little anxious she had begun to fear that he must be out of health or that the monotony of vaux abbey was wearying him and that he would be leaving her again soon but today she had watched him ride up the avenue with lady may and it seemed to her that there was a change in his bearinga change for the better and looking at him now she was sure of it a faint glow was in his cheeks and his eyes were brighter his manner too to lady may pleased her more he had ridden home with her from their conversation they seemed to have been together almost all day and there seemed to be a spirit of bon comeradie between the two as they talked over their doings which certainly pointed to a good understanding altogether mrs de vaux was pleased and hopeful  and indeed she had reason to be for his long day in the open country with lady may had been like a strong sweet tonic to paul for the first time since his return to vaux abbey he had felt that a time might come when he would be able to escape altogether from those lingering bittersweet memories which were all that remained to him now of adrea on the bare windy moor with the glow of physical exercise and excitement coursing through his veins and lady mays pleasant voice in his ears that little scene in the roselit chamber seemed for a moment very far away adrea with her soft passionlit eyes and dusky oriental face her lithe voluptuous figure and the faint perfumes of her rustling draperies seemed less to him then than a short while ago he could have believed possible he could not think of that scene without a shudderit had left its mark in a certain way for everbut it was not so constantly present to him he knew that for the first time a woman had tempted him sorely he knew too and he alone how nearly he had yielded his sudden passion her strange eastern beauty and the fascination which it had exercised over him together with the soft sensuousness of her surroundings had formed a strong coalition and today he recognised for the first time how much he owed his victory to the girl who was riding by his side even in those breathless moments of hesitation he had found time to consider that if he yielded to adreas pleading he could never again take lady mays hand or meet her frank open gaze the pure healthfulness of life which had been so dear to him would be tainted for ever the moorland breezes of his northern home would never strike the same chords in his nature again all these recollections had flashed across his mind at that critical moment lending strength to resist and crush his passion and today he had commenced to reap his reward today he had tasted once more the sweets of these things and found how dear they still were to him he could still look into lady mays fair pure face unshamed and find all the old pleasure in listening to her frank girlish talk and he could still bare his head to the sweeping winds and lift his face to the sun and gaze with silent admiration at the faint deepening colours in the western sky as lady may and he rode homeward across the moor in the late afternoon all these joys would have been lost to him for everthese and many others adrea could never have repaid him for their loss  so paul who had come home from london pale and silent with the marks of a great struggle upon him lay back in an arm chair and watched the firelight play upon lady mays fair face with more than a passive interest mrs de vauxs cherished scheme had never been so near its accomplishment for if she could have read pauls thoughts she would have known that he was thinking of lady may more tenderly than he had ever done before meeting his steadfast almost wistful gaze she became almost confused and suddenly rising she shook out the skirts of her riding habit and took up her hat and whip  it has been such a delightful rest she said looking away from paul and speaking to his mother i shall never forget how good that tea tasted but i really must go mrs de vaux my poor animal is quite done up and i shall have to walk all the way home  i dont know whether i did right paul said rising but i sent your groom straight on home with the mare and ordered a brougham for you she has had a long day and i thought it would be more comfortable for you  she flashed a grateful glance at him how thoughtful and how kind you are of course it will be nicer i was beginning to feel a little selfish too for keeping betty out of her stable so long  as a reward we will keep you a little longer he remarked it is only six oclock  she shook her head no i wont stop thanks there are some tiresome people coming to dine tonight and i must go home goodbye lady de vaux  paul strolled down the hall with her and handed her into the carriage for the first time in his life he held her hand a little tighter and a little longer than was necessary  shall you be at home tomorrow afternoon lady may he asked quietly  she looked up at him for a moment and then her eyes drooped and her heart beat a little faster she understood him  yes she answered softly  i shall ride over then goodbye  goodbye  he lingered on the doorstep for a minute watching the carriage roll down the avenue when it had disappeared he turned back into the hall and after a moments hesitation entered the library  it was a large sombrelooking apartment scarcely ever entered by anyone save paul the bookcases reached only halfway up the walls the upper portion of which was hung with oil portraits selected from the picture gallery at the lower end of the room the shelves had been built out at right angles to the wall lined with books and in one of the recesses soformedalmost as large as an ordinarysized chamberpaul had his writingtable surrounded by his favourite volumes it was a delightful little miniature library facing him six rows of black oak shelves held a fine collection of classical literature on his left the lower shelves contained rare editions of the early english dramatists and the upper ones were given up to poetry from chaucer to swinburne the righthand shelves were wholly french from quaint volumes of troubadours poetry to alfred de musset and de maupassant it was here paul spent most of his time when at the abbey  the meet had been rather a long way off that morning and he had left before the arrival of the postbag from the neighbouring town mrs de vaux had distributed the letters and the one she had spoken of lay at the edge of the table he stretched out his hand to take it upwithout any presentiments without any thought as to whom it might be from an invitation doubtless or a begging letter he imagined as he caught sight of the large square envelope but suddenly before his fingers had closed upon it he started and stood quite still leaning over the back of his chair his heart was beating fast and there was a mist before his eyesa mist through which he saw as though in a dream the walls of his library melt away to be replaced by the dainty interior of that little room in grey street with all the dim luxury of its soft colouring and adornment he saw her too the centre of the picturesaw her as she seemed to him before that final scenesaw her halfkneeling halfcrouching before him with her beautiful dark eyes yearning and passionate fixed upon his in mute but wonderfully eloquent pleading oh it was folly but it was sweet marvellously sweet every nerve seemed thrilled with the exquisite pleasure of the memory so suddenly called up to him and his lips quivered with the thought of what he might have said to her the strange voluptuous perfume which crept upwards from that letter seemed in a measure to have paralysed him he stood there like a man entranced with the dim firelight on one side and the low horned moon through the high window on his left casting a strange vivid light on his pale facepaler even than usual against the scarlet of his huntingcoat that letter what could it contain was it a recall or a fresh torrent of anger he stood there quite still leaning over the back of the highbacked oak chair emblazoned with the de vaux arms and making no motion towards taking it up  a sound from outsidethe low rumbling of a gongroused him at last and he pushed the chair hastily away from him his first impulse was one of anger of shame that he a strong man as he had deemed himself should have been so moved by a simple flood of memories it seemed ignoble to him and a frown gathered on his forehead as he reached forward and picked up the letter yet his fingers trembled as they tore it open and his eyes ran over the contents rapidly      18 grey street london w thursday      monsieur paul my hand trembles a little when i sit down to     write to you and think of our

adrea     chapter xi  adreas diary      a figure from the past i see once more as in a dream   this evening i have had an adventure i am thankful for it has occupied my thoughts for awhile and for anything that does that i am grateful i had been in the house all day restless and nervous and towards dusk i put on my cloak and a thick veil and went out into the street i scarcely noticed which way i went it was all the same to me a dull purple bank of clouds hung low down in the west and the air was close and still byandby i heard thunder and big raindrops fell upon the pavement a storm was threatening and i longed for it to come and clear the air  i must have been walking for nearly an hour when it came at last and the rain fell in great sheets i looked around for a cab but there was none in sight i had no idea where i waslondon is so vast and largeand though by the distant roar of wheels i could tell that i was not far from a great thoroughfare the street in which i was seemed to be deserted just by my side was a dark tunnel gloomy and vaultlike in appearance but in that downpour any refuge was welcome and i stepped back underneath it it was like going into the bowels of the earth and every now and then there was a roar over my head which made me almost dizzy but from round the corner i could see that it was only the sound of trains passing and repassing so i decided to stay until i could see a cab  opposite to me was a man with a truckload of oranges and by his side a boy seated before a redhot swinging can containing chestnuts there was no one else in the street although at the bottom of it crowds of people and a constant stream of vehicles were hurrying along on the other side of the way was a tall and grimlooking building discoloured with smoke and age it was evidently a hospital or institution of some sort the windows were long and narrow and one or two of them i could see were of stained glass there was no brass plate by the front door nor any sign in the absence of anything else to do i began to frame surmises as to what the place might be the spotlessly white doorsteps and polished bell interested me they seemed out of tone with the character of the place and its surroundings so utterly bare and dreary i began to wish that a caller would come and ring the bell so that i could get a peep at the interior but no one did although i noticed that more than one hurrying passerby glanced up at it curiously  the thunder died away but the rain still came down heavily if it had not been for my curious interest in that great ugly building opposite i should have risked a wetting and made my way down to the busy thoroughfare in the distance but i was anxious to see some one enter or leave the place or for something to happen which would give me an idea as to its character so i waited half an hour passed and my curiosity remained unsatisfied there was no sign of life about the place not even a tradesman had called nor had that forbiddinglooking portal once been opened it was still raining fast but there were signs of finer weather and right overhead was a break in the clouds i should certainly be able to leave now in a few minutes but strangely enough all my impatience seemed gone the grimlooking building opposite had fascinated me i had no desire to leave the place until i had found out all about it  it was odd that curiosity of mine all my days i shall wonder at it on the face of it it seemed so unreasonable and yet it led to so much i have no creed and i know nothing about philosophies or perhaps tonights adventure might have meant even more to me but indeed it seems as though some unseen hand led me out and brought me into that deserted street from tonight there must be changes in my life i cannot escape from them as yet i am too much in a whirl to ask myself whether i wish to  to return to that house when i saw that the storm was clearing and that i should be able to leave in a few minutes i determined to make an effort to satisfy my curiosity i crossed the road and addressed the man who was sitting on the handles of his barrow of oranges  do you know what place that is opposite i asked pointing across the road  he took out a filthy pipe from his mouth and spat upon the pavement i think that he must have noticed my look of disgust for he answered me surlily no i dont  i turned to the boy do you i asked  he shook his head not for certain maam i believe its some sort of a roman catholic place though them gents in long clothes and shovel hats is allus going in and hout ullo bill here she be again shes atrying it on aint she  the man looked up and grunted i followed the boys glance and saw a tall dark woman walking swiftly along on the other side of the road from the very first her figure was somehow familiar to me and  she stopped outside the closed door and hesitated for a moment as though doubtful whether to ring or not during her moment of hesitation she glanced round and i recognised her she could not see me for i was in the shadow of the underground tunnel  blarmed if she aint come again the man growled shes as regular as clockwork wonder what she wants  i felt my knees trembling i could not have crossed the road at that moment if it had been to save my life the boy looked up at me curiously  happen you know her lady he remarked shes been here at this time or thereabouts pretty near every day for a fortnight  happen i know her yes that was the boys odd phrase it rang in my ears and i found myself gasping for breath my eyes were fixed upon that tall slender figure clothed in sober black waiting upon the doorstep with bowed head and standing very still and motionless it was like an effigy of patience there were not two women in the world like that it was impossible she was in england and alonefree what did it mean should i run to her or hide away i glanced over my shoulder where the black shadows of the tunnel were only dimly lit by the feeble gaslight i could steal away and she would never see me yet as i thought of it the grimy barren street and the solemnlooking building faded away before my eyes the sun and wind burned my face the wind salt with ocean spray and echoing with the hoarse screaming of the seabirds that rode upon it i was at cruta again panting to be free stealing away in the twilight down the narrow path amongst the rocks to where that tiny boat lay waiting like a speck upon the waters and it was she who had helped methe sadfaced woman who had braved the terrible anger of the man whom we had both dreaded again i heard her gentle words of counsel and the answering lies which should have blistered my lips for i lied to her not hastily or on impulse but deliberately in cold blood anything i cried to myself to escape from this rock this living death so i lied to her and she helped me no wonder that i trembled no wonder that i half made up my mind to flee away into the sheltering darkness of that noisomelooking tunnel  it takes long to set down in writing the thoughts which flashed through me at that moment yet when i had made up my mind the woman was still there waiting meekly before the closed door  you were speaking of her i said to the boy who was halfsitting halfcrouching against the side of the tunnel what was it you said i did not hear  man and boy commenced to tell me together their strange london talk puzzled me and i could only extract a confused sense of what they said the woman to whom they rudely pointed had called at the building opposite every day for a fortnight at about this hour to make some inquiry day by day she had turned away after one brief question asked and answered with bowed head and dejected manner yet day by day she returned and repeated it ever the same disappointment the same despair  they knew nothing more her regular visits had awakened a certain curiosity in them and they had commenced to look for them and indulge in a little mild speculation as to her one day meeting with a different reception nothing more there was a shade of pity in the boys tone and i gave him a shilling then i crossed the road  as i left the kerbstone the door opened and i heard her question  has father adrian called or written or sent any address yet please  the man who had opened the door only a few inches kept in the background and i could see nothing of him but i heard his grim monosyllable reply  no father adrian has not visited or communicated with us  she turned away with a meek thank you and found herself face to face with me my heart smote me when i saw how poor were her clothes and how thin her features  at first she did not know me but i raised my veil and whispered her name softly in her ear  she threw up her hands and swayed backwards and forwards upon the pavement  adrea adrea she cried wildly my god  a cab drove up and i called it she had just strength enough to enter it leaning heavily upon my arm then she fainted     chapter xii  we are like shooting stars whose meeting is their ruin   tonight i have had another shock i was sitting alone in my room downstairs dreaming over the fire when a footstep sounded upon the stairs at first i thought that it might be paul and i sprang up and stood listening intently what a little fool i was i felt the colour burning in my cheeks and my heart was beating i listened to the tread and the madness passed away it was a mans footsteps but not pauls  they halted at my door and there was a firm deliberate knock before i could reply the handle was turned and a figure stood upon the threshold  my little chamber was in darkness but the clear cold voice struck a vague note of familiarity  i seek adrea kiros are these her rooms are you she  i struck a match with trembling fingers and looked eagerly towards the doorway a man stood there dark stern and forbidding looking steadfastly towards me my memory had not deceived me it was father adrian  you have found me out i said slowly come inside and close the door  he moved slowly forward and stood in the middle of the room his face was as white as marble and as steadfast but his dark eyes which seemed to be challenging mine to meet them were full of smouldering fire i summoned up all my courage and threw myself into a low chair with a little laugh  you are not exactly cordial i said if you have anything to say to me wont you sit down  if i have anything to say to you he repeated and his whole tone seemed vibrating with hardly subdued passion if i have anything to say to you is this your greeting  why no not if you come as a friend but when you stand and glare at me comme cela what do you expect nothing very cordial surely  he advanced a step further towards me i watched him steadfastly and i knew that the old madness was not dead i was glad it made the struggle between us more even  have i no cause to look at you sternly adrea he demandedyou who deceived us you who lied to us to win our aid where would you have been now had it not been for me at cruta would to god my hand had withered before it had set you free  you are very kind  girl are you mad at cruta you were thoughtless and gay but god knows your heart was pure now you are a paid dancing girl  i turned upon him suddenly rising to my full height and looking him straight in the face he did not flinch but a faint colour rose to his forehead as he continued  stop i said you are talking of those things which you do not understand you could not possibly understand you and i are different we belong to different worlds the things of your world are not the things of mine leave me now and for ever and let us go our own ways we measure things by different quantities you are a priest and very much a priest and i am a woman and very much a woman for the past i am grateful for its sake i forget the insults of the present now go  i knew quite well that he would not take me at my word nor did he  adrea i cannot go and lose all knowledge of you for ever he said sadly for my own sake i would say would to god that i could but it is impossible within me there is a voice which whispers fly but i cannot your future is still as dear to me as in the old days oh adrea i have sorrowed and mourned lest our last parting had been for ever and now alas i would that it had been i would to god that i had never found you out  you can forget it i said coldly  i can never forget it he answered fiercely girl you seem to me sometimes like a scourge your memory is a very nightmare of sin you have brought me nothing but pain and remorse and anguish of heart for all my suffering there is no brighter side yet i cannot forget it  despite his fierce words which for a moment had burned in my ears i pitied him in the old days he had been my champion and it was his hand together with hers which had aided my escape from cruta so i spoke to him softly  i am sorry as i said we are of different moulds and we belong to a different branch of humanity we are neither of us inclined to change let us go our own ways and apart  he was close by my side now and his hand was resting on the back of my chair i laid mine upon it for a moment it was cold as ice and shaking the old madness was upon him indeed  you were kind to me at cruta i continued i do not forget it and i thank you for it but we are as far apart as the poles and we must continue so  the position between us seemed reversed he stood by my side pale and passionate with his clear eyes full of a strange wistfulness  all that you say is in a measure true he said in a low tone yet do not send me away from you some day you may see things differently some day trouble may come to you and i may be your helper there is only one thing i would have you look upon me as a brother and i would have you give me a brothers confidence  i would gladly be friends with you i answered only do not seek more than i choose to tell you as for the things you charge me with there is truth and falsehood in them it is true that i have earned my living by dancing but it has been in private only of course you know nothing about it how should you but i am not a ballet dancer as i believe you think  you are not upon the stage then  no nor do i dance in short skirts some day i will give you an exhibition in this room now dont look like that i added quickly i was only joking i would not defile the air around your saintliness for the world but i want to tell you this my dancing is recognised as an art i rank everywhere with the men and women who are called artists the men and women who are ever striving to realize in some manner a particular ideal of beauty through different channels the highest development of physical beauty in the human form is in grace of motion i aim at the beautiful in illustrating this i didnt know it myself until a great painter told me so but i am beginning to understand i dont expect you to you must take it on trust  it sounds strange to me but i do not doubt that there is truth some truth in it he admitted gravely  you and i look upon life and all its connections with different eyes i continued what may seem sin to you may be justified to me yet i will stoop to answer your unspoken question as i was at cruta so i am now it may be that i am better for i have done a good action  he held up his hand but i took no notice  i will tell it you a few days ago chance brought in my way a most unhappy woman she had escaped from an odious captivity only to find herself alone friendless and penniless in a strange city the man on whom she had counted for help she could not find he had given her an address where she might always hear of him day by day she inquired there in vain it may have been through no fault of his but she was in sore straits  her name  i found her and brought her home she lives with me she is here  the door was opening as i spoke and she entered they stood face to face silent with the shock of so sudden a meeting then he stepped quickly forward and taking her hands drew her to him i slipped away and left them alone together     chapter xiii  the path that leads to madmens kingdoms   a northcountry storm of rain and wind had suddenly blown up from the sea and the few remaining followers of the de vaux hounds were dispersed right and left making for home with all possible speed the sky had looked dull and threatening all day long and with the first shades of twilight the rain had commenced to fall in a sudden torrent there had been some little hesitation on the part of the master about drawing this last cover for the hounds had had a rough day and the field was small and directly the storm broke the horn was blown without hesitation the pack was recalled and the huntsman cracking his whip started for home at a long swinging trot the days sport was over  there were only a handful of horsemen waiting outside when the signal was given and with collars turned up to their ears and cigars alight they were very soon riding down the hill to the village whose lights were beginning to twinkle out from the darkness in the valley below at the crossroads paul who had been riding in the midst of them wheeled his horse round and took the road to vaux abbey amidst a chorus of farewells  are you going for the abbey de vaux captain westover asked reining in his horse better come home with me and dine ill send you back tonight and theyll look after your mare all right in the stables come along  paul shook his head ill get home thanks he answered a wetting wont hurt me and theres only a mile or two of it  captain westover shrugged his shoulders just as you like my people would be very glad to see you by the bye you were to have called last week werent you lady may was asking where you were this morning come and dine tomorrow night  thanks unless i send word over to the contrary i will then goodnight  goodnight  captain westover cantered on after the others and paul turned off in the opposite direction riding slowly with bent head and loose bridle in his pocket was adreas letter scarcely a week old and now that the physical excitement of the day was over his thoughts as usual were full of it again it was an uphill battle that he was fighting all day long he had been striving to forget it he had spared neither himself nor his horses in the desperate attempt to reach such a stage of physical exhaustion as should make his mind a blankas should free it at any rate from those torturing memories and the fierce restlessness which they begat he had tried his utmost and he had failed his pink huntingcoat and tops immaculate at the start were covered with thick mud and his horse his second mount was scarcely able to put one foot before the other yet he had failed utterly hunger and fatigue seemed things far away to him wherever he lookedout into the grey mists which came rolling across the moor soaking him with moisture or down into the road fast becoming a bog or up into the dim skyhe seemed to see the pages of adreas letter standing out before him word for word phrase for phrase every sentence of it seemed to him as vivid and real as though it had been spoken in his ears nay he could almost fancy that he saw the great tears welling slowly out of those soft dark eyes and could hear the passionate quiver in her faltering tones day by day it had been a desperate struggle with him to resist the mad desire which prompted him to order a dogcart drive to the nearest town and catch the mail train to london beyond thathow she would receive him what he would say to hereverything was chaos he dared not trust himself to think about it  yet whenever he suffered his thoughts to dwell upon this matter at all the reverse side of it all sooner or later presented itself clear and insistent above the emotion which swayed him came ever that uncompromising questionwhere lay his duty in this matter it was the true and manly side of his nature developed by instinct and long training and refusing now to be overborne and swept away by this surging tide of passion it rang in his ears and it demanded an answer away in the distance on the opposite side of the valley his vacant eyes rested idly upon the many lights and dim outline of westover castle what place had lady may in his heart was there room for herand adrea could he see adrea day by day and never pass the barrier which he himself had set up between them what did he wish what was right just then everything was to him so vague and chaotic  he had been riding for nearly an hour with his reins quite loose upon his horses neck and trusting entirely to her to take the homeward route suddenly his mare came to an abrupt halt and paul looked around him in surprise at first he had not the faintest idea as to his whereabouts then a dull roar coming from across a narrow strip of moorland on his left gave him a clue and he saw what had happened instead of turning inland to vaux abbey his horse had kept straight on and had brought him almost to the seaa good five miles out of his way  the situation was not a cheerful one they were ten miles from home and ironsides completely done up was trembling ominously at the knees and looking around at him pitifully paul himself was wet to the skin and as he dismounted for a moment to ease his stiff limbs he was conscious of a distinct inclination to shiver the grey mists were rolling up all round them and directly pauls feet touched the ground he felt himself sink ankledeep in the wet soft sand it was all horribly uncomfortable and more than that it was serious for immediately he had passed his hand over his horses flanks and felt her knees paul knew that she was not in a condition for him to mount her again there was no hope of reaching vaux abbey without rest and refreshments for ironsides at any rate  he looked steadily around him and began to get some faint idea as to his whereabouts his mare must have been deceived by following a private road which led to a cottage belonging to an old halfpay officer major harcourt they had evidently passed the cottage and pursued the road almost to its termination for where they now were it was little better than a sheeptrack leading through a closed gate a few yards in front of them into a scattered pine plantation and down to the sea the only thing to do was to retrace their steps until they came to the cottage and there beg shelter for a while  weve made a mess of it old girl paul said soothingly patting his mares neck and passing his arm through the bridle come on then well see whether we cant find an empty stall for you at major harcourts  they retraced their steps the mare limping wearily along by pauls side and every now and then stopping to look at him in despair paul found a grim humour in the situation it was the quagmire into which thoughts of adrea had led him a parable sent to show him the folly of such thoughts and whither they tended he laughed a little bitterly at the thought once when a very young man he had thought himself a fatalist after all perhaps it was the best thing to be conscience and duty were wearisome guides a course of voluntary drifting would be rather a relief  suddenly the mare pricked up her ears and neighed paul looked steadily through the mist and quickened his pace scarcely a hundred yards ahead was the dim outline of the cottage nestled up against a pine grove and facing the sea  paul was fairly well acquainted with major harcourt and although he had seen nothing of him for some time he had not the slightest compunction in claiming shelter for himself and his horse he led her up the trim winding drive to the front door and rang the bell  is major har paul began as the door was opened then he broke off abruptly  the manservant who had opened the door and was standing on the step peering out into the darkness was a familiar figure to him it was gomez     chapter xiv  the poison of honey flowers   the recognition was not immediately simultaneous gomez standing on the step was in the full light of the hall lamp but paul was still amongst the shadows  dont you know me gomez paul asked stepping forward i am paul de vaux  a shade passed across the mans face and he laid his hand quickly upon his heart as though to cease some sudden pain then he stood on one side holding the door open  i beg your pardon mr paul i could not see your face out there wont you walk in sir  paul dropped his mares bridle and stepped inside the polished white stone hall with its huge fire in the centre looked warm and comfortable and away in the distance there was a cheerful rattle of teacups  what are you doing here gomez paul asked shaking the wet from his hat i understood that you were going to take the underbailiffs place  higgs has not left yet sir gomez answered i have been living here as caretaker for major harcourt  caretaker isnt he at home then  gomez shook his head looking keenly at paul all the time major harcourt does not winter here now sir he has let the place furnished  what a confounded nuisance to whom has he let it paul asked quickly you see my plight and my horse is worse off still we lost our way going home from dunston spinnies  major harcourts tenant is a lady gomez answered after a moments hesitation she only arrived yesterday  paul shrugged his shoulders he was annoyed but there was no help for it  well will you see her at once and represent matters i want a loose box for the night for my horse and a rest for myself and afterwards a conveyance for the abbey if possible tell her my name i daresay she wont mind who is she  gomez said nothing for a moment then he drew paul back to the door and pointed out into the darkness  mr paul he said in a quick hoarse whisper at the back of that hedge there is a road which leads straight up to the abbey it is a matter of six miles or so i know and you are tired but that is nothing take my advice sir and believe me it is for your good get out of this house as soon as you can and go home though you have to walk every step ill look after your horse and you can send for it in the morning  paul looked into the mans face astonished what nonsense gomez he exclaimed do you know what you are talking about why im tired out and almost starved here i am and here i shall stop unless your mistress is as inhospitable as you are  gomez bowed and closed the door very good sir you will have your own way of course but remember in the future that i was faithful i warned you come this way sir i will send your horse round to the stables the name of the lady of the house is madame de merteuill  a little uneasy and very much mystified paul followed him across the hall and was silently ushered into a long low drawingroom a room of nooks and corners furnished in oldfashioned style but with perfect taste and dimly lit with soft shaded lamps there was a bright fire blazing on the hearth and a pleasant sense of warmth in the air  at first it seemed as though the room was empty but in a moment a tall palefaced lady with wonderfully dark eyes and grey hair rose from an easy chair behind the piano and looked at him at first questioningly  i am afraid that you will consider this an unwarrantable intrusion paul said bowing but the fact is i lost my way riding home from the hunt and my horse cannot go a yard further as for myself you can see what state i am in i saw your lights and have some acquaintance with major harcourt and not knowing that he had left i ventured here to throw myself upon his hospitality my name is de vauxpaul de vaux and although it is some distance to the abbey i believe that we are nextdoor neighbours  it was beginning to dawn upon paul that he had somehow stumbled upon a very strange household during the whole of his speech the lady whom he was addressing had stood silent and transfixed with wideopen eyes and a terrible shrinking look of fear upon her face she must be mad paul concluded swiftly what an ass gomez was not to have told him while he was wondering how to get away she spoke  your name de vaux paul de vaux near vaux abbey  he bowed looking at her with fresh interest his name seemed familiar to her in a moment or two the unnatural lethargy left her and she spoke to him though still in a curiously suppressed tone  i beg your pardon you are welcome i was a little startled at first  she rang the bell gomez answered it  bring some fresh tea and some sandwiches and wine she ordered tell them in the stables to see that this gentlemans horse has every attention  gomez received his orders in silence and withdrew with darkening face paul looked after him with surprise  gomez does not seem particularly pleased to see me again he remarked what is the matter with the man i wonder  it is only his manner i think she said softly he was your fathers servant was he not  yes how did you know that he asked quickly ah i beg your pardon he told you of course you will find him a faithful servant  she bowed her head but made no reply indeed paul found it very difficult to start a conversation of any sort with his new neighbour to all his remarks she returned only monosyllabic answers looking at him steadily all the while out of her full dark eyes in a faraway wistful manner as though she saw in his face something which carried her thoughts into another world it was a little uncomfortable for paul and he was not sorry when gomez reappeared bearing a tray with refreshments  she handed him his tea in silence and paul who would have been ashamed to have called himself curious but who was by this time not a little puzzled at her manner made one more effort at conversation  i think you said that you were quite strange to this part of the country he remarked we who have lived here all our lives are fond of it but im afraid youll find it rather dull at first there is very little society  we do not desire any she said hastily we came hereat least i came herefor the sake of indulging in absolute seclusion it is the same with my stepdaughter in london she had been forced to keep late hours and her health has suffered the doctor prescribed complete rest i too desired rest so we came here a london house agent arranged it for us  so there was a stepdaughter who lived in london and who went out a great deal the mention of her gave paul an opportunity  i wonder if i have ever met your daughter in town he said pleasantly i am there a good deal and i have rather a large circle of acquaintances  the implied question seemed to disconcert her she coloured and then grew suddenly pale her eyes no longer looked into his they were fixed steadfastly upon the fire  it is not at all probable she said nervously lacing and interlacing her slim white fingers no it is scarcely possible you would not be likely to meet her your friends would not be her friends she knows so few people ah  she started quickly the door had opened but it was only gomez who had come in with a tray for the empty teathings there was a dead silence whilst he removed them paul scarcely knew what to say his hostess puzzled him completely perhaps this stepdaughter whose name together with her own she seemed so anxious to conceal was mad and she had brought her down here instead of sending her to an asylum or perhaps she herself was mad he glanced at her furtively and at once dismissed the latter idea her face careworn and curiously pallid though it was was the face of no madwoman it was the face of a woman who had passed through a fiery sea of this worlds trouble and sufferingsuffering which had left its marks stamped upon her features but of his own accord he would never have put it down as the face of a weak or erring woman  there was a mysteryof that he felt sure but it was no part of his business to seek to unravel it the best thing he could do he felt was to get up and go he could scarcely maintain a conversation without asking or implying questions which seemed to painfully embarrass his hostess  im very much obliged to you he said rising and holding out his hand i feel quite a new man if you dont mind id like to leave my mare here until tomorrow she really isnt fit to travel my man shall come for her early  pray do she answered quickly ah  she had started and clutched at the back of her chair with trembling fingers her eyes wide open and startled were fixed upon the door  paul too turned round and uttered a little cry his heart beat fast and the room swam before him he stood for a moment perfectly still with his eyes fastened upon the figure in the doorway     chapter xv  and most of all would i fly from the cruel madness of love   it was adreaadrea herself she stood there in the shadow of the doorway with her lips slightly parted and her great eyes soft and brilliant flashing in the ruddy firelight it was no vision it was she beyond a doubt  even when the first shock had passed away he found himself without words the wonder of it had dazed him he had thought of her so often in that quaint dainty little chamber in grey street that to see her here so unexpectedly without the least warning or anticipation was like being suddenly confronted with a picture which had stepped out of its frame and that she should be here too of all places here in this bleak corner of the kingdom where blustering winds swept bare the sullen moorland and the sea was always grey and stormy what strange fate could have brought her here away from all the warmth and luxury of london to this halfdeserted old manor house on the verge of the heath his mind was too confused in those first few moments to follow out any definite train of thought the most natural conclusion that she had come to him did not enter his imagination  his first impulse as his senses became clearer was to glance around for the woman who had called adrea her stepdaughter she was gone she must have stepped out of the room by the opposite doorway and with the knowledge that they were alone he breathed freer  adrea he said it is really you then  his words necessarily commonplace dissolved the situation she laughed softly and came further into the room  it is i she said did you think that i was an elf from spiritland  he had never shaken hands with herit was a thing which had never occurred to either of them but a sudden impulse came to him then he took a hasty step forward and clasped both her little white hands in his so they stood for another minute in silence and a strange soft light flashed in her upturned eyes she was very near to him and there was an indefinable sense of yielding in her manner amounting almost to a mute invitation he felt that he had only to open his arms and that strange beautiful face with its mocking quivering mouth would be very close to his the old battle was forced upon him to fight all over again and alas he was no stronger  it was almost as though she had seen the hesitationthe conflict in himfor with a sudden imperious gesture she withdrew her hands and turned away from him there was a scarlet flush creeping through the deep olive of her cheeks and her eyes were dry and brilliant paul who had never studied women or their ways looked at her surprised and a little hurt  you are surprised to see me here of course she said sinking into a low easychair and taking up a firescreen of peacocks feathers as though to shield her face from the fire well it is quite an accident i wrote you rather a silly letter the other day but you must not think that i have followed you down here  i did not think so he answered hastily the idea never occurred never could have occurred to me  she continued without heeding his interruption i will explain how we came to take this cottage a relative of mine came to me suddenly from abroad she was in great trouble and was in search of a very secluded dwellingplace where she might live for a time unknown i also was in bad health and the doctor had ordered me complete rest and quiet we went to a house agent and told him what we wantedto get as far away from every one as possible we did not care how lonely the place was or how far from london the further the better this house was to let furnished and at a low figure i did not know that vaux abbey was in the same county even it suited us and we took it  i understand paul answered and now that you are here are you not afraid of finding it dull  she turned away from him biting her lip you do not understand me you never will no i shall not be dull  i beg your pardon adrea i  be quiet she interrupted impetuously you think that i am too frivolous to live away from the glare and excitement of the city of course to you i am just the dancing girl nothing more do not contradict me i hate your serious manner i hate your patronage dont contradict me i say tell me this how did you find me out why are you here  i have been out hunting and i lost my way paul answered quietly i know major harcourt and thinking he was still living here i called for a rest and to put my horse up your stepmother has been very kind and hospitable  adrea looked at him curiously indeed she has been kind to you has she who told you that she was my stepmother  i thought i understood you to say so  did i perhaps so i dont remember so she was kind to you was she she has no cause to be  no cause to be why not  she shrugged her shoulders oh i dont know im talking a little at random i think you angered me monsieur paul i am a silly girl am i not do you know that i have thrown up all my engagements until next season i do not think that i shall dance again at all  i am glad to hear it  but i shall go on the stage  there is no necessity for that is there  necessity you mean that i have not to earn my bread that may be true but what would you have me to do i am not content to be one of your english young ladiesto sit down and learn to cook and darn and read silly books until fate is kind enough to send me a husband not so i have ambition i have an artists instincts although i may not yet be an artist i must live i must have light and colour in my life  paul was very grave he did not understand this new phase in adreas development there was a curious hardness in her tone and a recklessness in her speech which were strange to him and with it all he felt very helpless he could not play the part of guardian and reprove her he scarcely knew how to argue with her women and their ways were strange to him and besides adrea was so different  he stood up on the hearthrug toying with his long ridingwhip puzzled and unhappy adrea was angry with him he knew and though he was very anxious to set himself right with her he felt that he was treading on dangerous ground he was neither sure of himself nor of her  i am afraid i am a very poor counsellor adrea he said slowly but it seems to me that you want women friends your life has been too lonely too devoid of feminine interests  she laugheda mirthless unpleasant little laugh women friends good you say that i have none it is true there have been no women who have offered me their friendship in this country you call yourself my guardian why do you not find me some  you have made it very difficult he reminded her  she threw a scornful glance at him good that is generous you mean to say that i have made myself unfit for the friendship of the women of your family i thank you monsieur paul i think that our conversation has lasted long enough let me pass i am going to leave you  he moved quickly towards the door and barred her passage there was a dark flush in his cheeks and a gleam in his eyes up till then his manner had been a little deprecating but at her last words it had suddenly changed he felt that she was unjust and he was indignant  adrea you talk like a child he said sternly i made no such insinuation as you suggest you know that i did not sit down  she obeyed him the quick change in his manner had startled her and taken her at a disadvantage she felt the force of his superior will and she yielded to it  he leaned over her chair and his voice grew softer adrea you are very very unjust to me he said do you wish to make me so unhappy i wonder for a week i have been thinking of scarcely anything else save our last parting and now if i had not stopped you almost by force you would have left me again in anger  his tone had grown almost tender and as though unconsciously his hand had rested upon her gleaming coils of dark braided hair she looked up at him and in the firelight he could see that her eyes were soft and dim  you have really thought of me she said in a low tone you have really been unhappy on my account  i have he admitted very unhappy  something in his tonein the reluctance with which he made the admission angered her she moved a little further away and her voice grew harder  yes you have been unhappy she said and why it was because you were ashamed to find yourself thinking of me you paul de vaux a citizen of the world and a man of culture thinking of a poor dancing girl with only her looks to recommend her that was where the sting lay that was what reddened your cheek you men you are as selfish as devils  she stamped her foot her voice was shaking with passion paul stood before her with a deep flush on his pale cheeks silent like a man suddenly accused her words were not altogether true but they were winged with at any rate the semblance of truth  she continueda little more quietly but with her tone and form still vibrating  what do you fear what is that you struggle against i have seen you when it has been your will to take meinto your arms to hold my hands then i have seen you conquer the desire and you run away as though afraid of it why do you fear that i shall seek to compromise youis not that the english word do you think that i want you to marry me is it because you dare not that youyou do not offer to take my hand even tell me now why is it  for your own sake adrea  for my own sake she repeated scornfully do you believe it yourself do you really think that it is true i will tell you why it is it is because you have no thought no imagination you say to yourself she is not of my world i cannot marry her  there was a silence a burning coal fell upon the hearth and flamed up the glow reached pauls face he was very pale and his eyes were dry and brilliant suddenly he moved forward and clasped adreas hands tightly in his  but adrea are you sure that you love me  a sudden change swept into her face her dark eyes grew wonderfully soft  yes she answered looking up to him with a swift brilliant smile i am sure  he held out his arms his resistance was at an end it had grown weaker and weaker during those last few moments now it was all over swept away by a sudden tumultuous passion so strange and little akin to the man that it startled even himself afar off in his mind he was conscious of a dim sense of shame as he held her close in his arms and felt her warm trembling lips pressed against his but it was like an echo from a distant land it seemed to him that a deep widening gulf lay now between him and all that had gone before his old self was dead a new man had sprung up with a new personality and the time had not yet come for regrets     chapter xvi  twixt you and me a noisome shadow cast   adrea  it was a cry which seemed to ring through the room an interruption so sudden and strange that they started apart like guilty children gazing towards the lifted curtain which divided the apartment with wondering halffearful faces the woman whom adrea had called her stepmother stood there pale and bloodless with her great black eyes flashing and behind her a tall dark figure was gazing sternly at them  adrea was the first to recover her composure she was a little further away and she could see only her stepmother  what do you want she exclaimed quickly i desire to be alone why do you stand there  there was no answer then the momentary silence was broken by a quick startled cry from paul which seemed to cleave the semidarkness of the room  my god  the dark figure had moved forward and was standing pale and austere before them it was father adrian  there was a moments intense silence then paul turned swiftly round to where adrea stood a little behind him but the suspicions which had commenced to crowd in upon him vanished before even they had taken to themselves definite shape her surprise was as great as his and as their eyes met she shuddered with the memory which his presence had recalled  paul de vaux i had no thought of meeting you here father adrian said sternly  paul met his gaze haughtily there was a rebuke almost a threat in the priests tone which angered him whatever his presence here might betide he was in no way responsible for it to father adrian  nor i you he answered i imagined that you were staying at the monastery  i am staying there  madame de merteuill stepped slowly into the room she was still trembling and had all the appearance of a woman sore stricken by some unexpected calamity even her voice was faint and broken  father adrian is a visitor here onlyan unexpected onelike yourself  why is he here adrea asked slowly has he come to see us again what does he want  father adrian turned towards her grave and severe i have come to see madame de merteuill i bring her a message from an old man whom by her absence she is wronging you i did not expect to find hereand thus  she made no answer the priest drew a little nearer to her and his thin ascetic face seemed suddenly ablaze with scorn and anger  child your destiny is surely to bring sorrow upon all those who would watch over you and shape your life aright where you have been living and how since your flight i do not know you have hidden yourself well you have shown more than the ordinary selfishness of childhood you have thought nothing of those who may have troubled for you i do not ask for your confidence this is enough for me i find you here in his armshis of all men in the world false to your church false to your sex false to your fathers memory shameless  she did not flinch from before him she looked him in the face coldly and without fear  you are a priest and you do not understand be so good as to remember that i am no longer now in your power or under your authority you cannot threaten to make me a nun any longer remember that i am outside your life now and outside your religion  you can be brought back he said calmly i have powers  powers which i defy your religion is a cold dry farce and i hate it you cannot frighten me you cannot alarm me in the least you can do ugly things i know in the name of your church and if you had me back at the convent or on that awful island i should be frightened at you here i am not  instinctively she glanced toward paul already in her thoughts he was assuming the protector he would not suffer harm to come to her he was strong and rich and powerful the horror of days gone by had already grown faint with her it was little more than memory it was gone and could not come again  i have not come here to talk with you child he answered quietly my errand has been with madame de merteuill and it is accomplished i go now paul de vaux our ways lie together for a mile or more and i have a word to say to you let us go  paul was slowly recovering from a state of mental stupor and with his discovery something of the glamour of his late intoxication was passing away he had no regret there was nothing which he would have recalled but his eyes were stronger to pierce the mists and he was able to bring the weight of impersonal thought to bear upon all that had passed between adrea and himself wheresoever it might lead there was a tie between them now which could not be lightly severed  it is time i went paul answered adrea i will come and see you tomorrow  she looked at the priest suspicious and troubled what does he want with you paul she whispered dont go with him  i must he answered sadly he has something to say to me which i wish to hear i will come and see you tomorrow  if you must then until tomorrow but paul  she drew him on one side beware of him oh beware of him she said quickly her eyes full of fear he is a fanatic a jesuit dont trust him have little to say to him hush dont answer me he is watching goodnight beloved my beloved     chapter xvii  if love you choose then love shall be your ruin   paul and his companion walked down the avenue in silence and turned into the narrow stony road which wound across the moor the storm was over and the rain had ceased above them only faintly visible as though seen through a canopy of delicate lace the stars were shining in a cloudless sky through the wreaths of faint grey mist far off the sound of the sea came rolling across the moor to their ears now loud and threatening as it beat against the iron cliffs and thundered up the coombs now striking a shriller note as the huge waves ever beaten off retreated dragging beach and shingle with them it had been an ocean gale and the very air was salt and brackish with flavours of the sea here and there great piles of seaweed had been carried in a heterogeneous mass to their feet and the ground beneath them was soft and sandy but the storm had died away as suddenly as it had come the tall stark pine trees which a few hours ago had been bending like whips before the rushing wind stood now stiff and stark against the wan sky there was not even motion enough in the air to clear away the white mists which hung around only the troubled sea remained to mark the passage of the storm  paul was in no mood for talking he recognised the fact that what had happened to him that evening must to a certain extent colour his whole life he wanted to think it over quietly now that he was away from the influence of adreas passionately beautiful face and pleading eyes he had an inward sense of great disappointment in himself and he was anxious to see how far this was justified he was prepared for a rigid selfexamination and he was impatient to begin upon it but while he was still upon the threshold of his meditations his companions voice sounded in his ear  paul de vaux i have a word or two to say to you  paul awoke with a start certainly he said gravely i am ready  father adrian continued speaking slowly and keeping his eyes fixed steadily upon paul only a few nights ago we met amongst the ruins of your old abbey you will remember that i spoke to you of your fathers last hours of a strange story confided to my keepinga story of sin and of sorrowa story casting its shadow far into the future you remember this  perfectly  at first you seemed to consider that this story told to me on his deathbed by a man who was at least repentant should be held sacredsacred to me as a priest of the holy church and sacred to you as his son yet as you saw afterwards it was not so the confession was made to me as a man and withal it was made by one outside the pale of any religion whatever it was mine to do as i chose with it is mine now  if it is anything which concerns me or the honour of my family you should tell me if it involves wrongs which should be righted or in any way concerns the future you should tell me you must have come for that purpose you must mean to eventually or why should you have found your way to this outoftheway corner of the world let me hear it now father adrian  it will darken your life  i do not believe it at any rate i will judge for myself let me hear it  the priest looked away into the darkness and his voice was low and hoarse you do not know what you ask he said no i shall not tell you yet it is for your own sake sometimes i think that i will go away and never tell you  why not you came here for no other reason  father adrian shook his head i did not come to tell you it was your home i came to see many hundreds of years ago vaux abbey was a monastery sacred to the saint whose name i unworthily bear my visit here was half a pilgrimage but he went on his brows contracting and his eyes gleaming fire since i came i have been perilously near striking the blow which i have power to strike you bear a name which for centuries was foremost in the history of our sacred church for generation after generation the de vauxs were good catholics and the benefactors of their church your chapel was richly adorned and five priests dwelt here always with old sir roland de vaux and now where is your chapel once the most beautiful in england it is a pile of ruins like your faith i wander round in your villages your tenants have gone the way of their lord roman catholicism is a dying power hideous chapels have sprung up in all your districts the true faith is neglected and who is to blame for it all your recreant family you who should have been the most zealous upholders of religion have drifted down the stream of fashion nerveless and indifferent oh it is heresy rank heresy to think of a de vaux such as you dwelling indifferent amongst the mighty associations of your name and home i wander about amongst those magnificent ruins of yours æsthetically beautiful but nevertheless a living burning reproach and i ask myself whether i do well in holding my peace i cannot tell i cannot tell  paul was moved in spite of himself by the vehemence of his companions words the horrors of that deathbed scene at cruta had never grown dim to him he had always felt that his father had only decided to keep something back from him in those last moments after a bitter struggle and he was now quite sure that whatever it might have been the secret had been confided to this priest  i want to ask you a question he said whatever this mystery may be to which you are constantly alluding i am of course ignorant but you seem to have some understanding with the two women whom we have left this evening i want to know whether adrea is concerned in it  she is not  nor madame de merteuill  i cannot tell you  they were in the abbey grounds close to the ruins and the moorland lay behind them with its floating mists and vague obscurity here the sky was soft and clear and every pillar amongst the ruins stood out against the empty background of sea and sky father adrian paused  i will come no further he said i am a saner man away from your despoiled home there is just a last word which i have to say to you  paul stood still and listened  i have borne much father adrian said much tempting and many impulses but i have zealously put a watch upon my tongue and i have spared you for the future your happinessnay your future itselfis in your own hands i saw your father kill the only relative adrea had in this world we saw the deed done though we have both held our peace concerning it paul de vaux i am inclined to spare you a great blow which it is in my power to strike i am inclined to spare you but i make one hard and fast condition adrea is not for you she must be neither your wife nor your friend nor your ward there must be no dealings no knowledge between you the one of the other there is blood between you it can never be wiped out the stain is forever lift up your hand to heaven and swear that you will never willingly look upon her face again or as god is my master i will bring upon your name and your family and you swift and everlasting shame  his hand fell to his side and his voice which had been vibrating with passion died away in a little suppressed sob paul looked at him steadily the perspiration was standing out upon his forehead in great beads and his eyes were dry and brilliant the man was shaken to the very core and in the strange upheaval of passion he had altogether lost his sacerdotality it was the man who had spoken the man passionate and sensuous deeply moved through every chord of his being the priest had fallen away from him the remembrance of it seemed almost grotesque paul too had caught much of the passionate excitement of the moment  time he said hoarsely i must have time a few days only i ask no questions only how long  a week the priest answered a week tonight we meet here     chapter xviii  softly glimmering through the laurels at the quiet evenfall   do you know who has taken major harcourts cottage mr de vaux lady may asked  paul was silent for a moment he sat quite still in his saddle and gazed across the moor with his hand shading his eyes  i beg your pardon lady may he said i thought that i heard the dogs you asked me  about major harcourts cottage do you know who has taken it  i am not sure about the name it is a foreign lady and her stepdaughter i believe there is a clergymanor a roman catholic priest rathertoo but he may be only a visitor  indeed  the monosyllable was expressive paul glanced at his companion with slightly arched eyebrows what had she heard something evidently for there had been a coolness in her manner all the morning and her clear grey eyes were resting now upon the many gables of the cottage just below them with distinct disapproval now that he thought of it paul remembered that a dogcart from the castle had whirled past him as he had turned out of the drive last night doubtless he had been seen and recognised well after all what did it matter the time when he had meant to ask lady may to be his wife seemed very far back in the past now between that part of his life and now there was a great gulf fixed last night had altered everything  he had certainly not meant to hunt that morning but it had been forced upon him quite early reynolds had come to his room to inquire whether he should provide breakfast for thirty or fifty and had reminded him that the meet was in front of the abbey so against his will paul had been compelled to entertain the hunt and join in it himself lady may had been specially invited to breakfast but she had not come and paul had only just seen her for the first time at the cover side she had greeted him coldly and though they had somehow taken up a position a little apart from the others very few words had passed between them her frank delicate face was clouded and her manner was reserved  i believe my brother knows who they are she continued after a short silence he saw them at the station  paul bit his lip and turned away the mystery of lady mays manner was explained now  did he tell you then  lady may toyed with her whip and then looked paul straight in the face yes he told me the name of the younger one it is adrea kiros the dancing girl mr de vaux may i ask you a question  certainly  lady may looked straight between her horses ears and a slight flush stole into her cheeks you must not think that i was listening it was not so at all but last night as i was passing the billiardroom i heard my brother and captain mortimer talking they were coupling your name with thismiss adrea kiros they spoke of her coming down here as though you must have known something of it they were blaming you as though you were responsible for her coming we have been friends mr de vaux and so far as i am concerned our friendship has been very pleasant but if there is any truth in what they saidwell you can guess the rest i want you to tell me yourself i am never content to accept hearsay evidence against my friends i prefer to be unconventional as you see please tell me  will you put your question a little more definitely lady may paul asked slowly  certainly has that young person come here at your instigation did you arrange for her to come here  i did not no one could have been more surprised to see her than i was  lady may was growing very stiff she sat up in her saddle and drew the reins through her fingers you know her  i do  you visited her in london  i did  you were at the cottage last evening  i was i lost my way and  lady may touched her horse with her spur thank you mr de vaux she said haughtily i will not trouble you any more please dont follow me  paul watched her ride down the hillside and join one of the little groups dotted about outside the coverside with a curious sense of unreality after a while he broke into a little laugh and shaking his reins lit a cigar this was a new character for him altogether he knew himself that no man had kept his life more blameless than he if anything he felt sometimes that he had erred upon the other side in thinking and speaking too hastily of those who had been less circumspect and now it had come to this the woman whose good opinion he had always valued next to his mothers had deliberately accused him of what must have seemed to her a flagrant outrage on decency her words were still ringing in his ears please dont follow me lady may had said that to him it was a little hard to realize  a commotion around the cover below was a welcome diversion to him just then a fox had got clear away and hounds were in full cry paul pressed his hat down and settled into his saddle with a grim smile the physical excitement was just what he wanted and in a few minutes he was leading the field with only the master by his side and captain westover a few yards behind  at the first check captain westover rode up to him i want just a word or two with you de vaux he said drawing him on one side  paul drew himself up in his saddle and sat there glum and unbending i am at your service he answered i have had the pleasure already of a short conversation with your sister this morning  captain westover nodded i suppose so i want to beg your pardon first for what i am going to say de vaux if i make an ass of myself dont scruple to say so but i want to ask you this why in thunder did you let adrea whatshername the dancing girl come down here  it was no business of mine i did not know that she was coming  captain westover stroked his moustache and looked puzzled look here old man he said slowly you go to see her in london dont you  i have been  just so and you were down at the cottage last night werent you  i was  well hang it all then you must have known something about her coming you know it cant be just a coincidence bevan  bevan are my solicitors and by the purest accident one day i learned that miss adrea enjoys a settlement of a thousand a year from you they didnt tell me of course i happened to catch sight of your check on the table one day and overheard old sam bevan give some instructions to a clerk sorry but i couldnt help it youre the first person ive breathed it to  i am her guardian paul exclaimed angrily  captain westover whistled you may call it what you like old fellow i dont mind i can assure you you dont seem inclined to listen to any advice so i wont offer any more but if youll forgive my saying so youre doing a dd silly thing goodmorning  on the whole paul did not enjoy his days hunting and before it was all over he found himself once more in an embarrassing situation for as he rode past the gates of the cottage on his way home adrea was there breathless and laughing with her dusky hair waving loosely around her shapely head  i saw you coming she said a little shyly and i was afraid that you would not stop so i ran out as fast as i could it was silly of me you were coming in werent you  i think not paul answered gravely look how thick in mud i am and how tired my horse looks  she looked up at him with pleading eyes and parted lips do come she said i have been expecting you all day  she held the gate open and stood looking up at him a curiously picturesquelooking figure in the grey twilight her gown was like no other womans it was something between a greek robe and a teagown of a dull orange hue and her dusky hair was tied up with a bow of ribbon of the same colour everything about her was strange even the faint perfume which hung about her clothes and which brought him sudden swift memories of that moment when she had lain in his arms and his lips had met hers paul felt the colour steal into his pale cheeks as he leaped to the ground and passed his arm through his horses bridle  i will come cara mia he said softly  she clasped her hands through his other arm and whispered something in his ear as they turned up the avenue together just then the sound of horses hoofs in the road made them both turn round captain westover and lady may were riding by together with their eyes fixed upon paul and his companion     chapter xix  blood calls aloud for blood and not for hands entwined   it was with a strange conflict of feelings that paul with adrea by his side passed across the square low hall of the cottage plentifully decorated with stags heads and other sporting trophies and into the drawingroom it was a room which had been built too of quaint shape made up of nooks and corners and recesses and with dark oak beams stretching right across the ceiling the furniture was all oldfashioned and of different periods but the general effect was harmonious though a trifle shabby paul knew it well many an evening he had come in to tea there after a cigar and a chat with the old major and lounged in that low chair by mrs harcourts side but it scarcely seemed like the same room to him now the major and his wife had been oldfashioned people and their personality and talk and surroundings had created a sort of atmosphere which paul had grown almost to associate with the place he missed it directly he entered the room what it was that had worked the change it was hard to tell adrea had been far too charmed with its quaintness to seriously alter anything a little stiffness in the arrangement of the furniture had been corrected and the few antimacassars carefully removed otherwise nothing had been changed the great bowls of yellow roses and chrysanthemums and the piles of modern books and music lying about might have been partly responsible for it and the faint perfume which he had grown to associate altogether with adrea and which seemed wafted into the air as she gathered up her skirts on her way into the room had a foreign flavour in it but after all it was adrea herself who changed the atmosphere so completely she was so different from other women in her strange eastern beauty and the leopardlike grace of her movements that she could not fail to create an atmosphere around her yes it was she herself who had worked the change just as she had worked so wonderful a change in him paul told himself  at first they had thought that the room was empty and adrea who had entered a little in advance turned round to paul and held out her hands with a sudden sweeping gesture of invitation even in that moment as he moved towards her paul had time to feel a quick glow of admiration at the artistic elegance of her pose and colouring her proud dusky face and brilliant eyes found a perfect background in the deep orange of her loose gown and the velvet twined amongst her dark hair her arms stretched out towards him were half bare where the lace had fallen back and a world of passionate love and invitation was glowing in her face as she leaned slightly towards him as if impatient of his slow advance but before his hands had touched hers a voice from the further end of the room had broken in upon that eloquent silence  adrea you did not see me  they stood for a moment as though paralysed then adrea turned slowly round with darkening face i did not i thought that you were upstairs  she glided out of the shadows a slim tall figure dressed with curious simplicity and with white bloodless face i am going away she said coming quite close to them and fixing her full deep eyes upon adrea i am going away at once but adrea there is one wordjust one word  say it adrea interrupted impatiently  she glanced at paul he made a movement as though to quit the room but adrea prevented him you need not go she said anything that is to be said can be said to you as well as to me i prefer to have no secrets you were going to say something to me she added turning to her companion  yes i have no objection to say it before mr de vaux i simply want to ask you whether you consider him a proper visitor in this house  i choose it i am mistress here  for a moment an angry reply seemed to quiver upon the womans lips but it died away  you are right i thank you for reminding me of it she said quietly and yet adrea hear me you are doing an evil thing was your fathers murder so light a thing to you that you can join hands with his murderers son remember that day think of your father lying across that chamber floor stricken dead in a single moment by martin de vauxby his father it is not seemly that you two should stand there hand in hand it is not seemly for you to be under the same roof it is horrible  there was a moments silence then adrea threw open the door and pointed to it  go she ordered coldly you have had your say and that is my answer you were my fathers friend i believe that he loved you it was for his sake that i offered you shelter it was for his sake that i brought you here but remember this if you wish to stay with me let me never hear another word from you on this subject  she went out silently adrea closed the door and turned round with all the hardness fading swiftly out of her features a moment before there had been a look of the tigress in her eyes and paul watching her had shuddered it was gone now she came close up to paul and led him to a chair  was i very undignified she said laughing i am afraid i was i was very angry  he shook his head you were not undignified he said but you were very severe i think that she will go away  adreas face hardened again i do not care i would hate the dearest friend i had on earth who tried to come between us oh paul paul dont you feel as i do as though the world were empty and my mind swept bare of memoriesas though there were no background to it all nothing save you and i and our love  paul drew her to him for him at that moment there was no past nor any future the dreamy abandon of her manner seemed to have raised an echo within him  listen what is that adrea exclaimed suddenly  there was the ring of a horses hoofs in the avenue and immediately afterwards a loud peal at the bell paul and adrea looked at one another breathlessly who could it be  the outer door was opened and closed and then quick steps passed across the hall the drawingroom door was thrown open and arthur de vaux pale and splashed with mud from head to foot stood upon the threshold     chapter xx  the new strong wine of love   the situation although it was only a brief one was for a moment possessed of a singularly dramatic force the grouping and the colouring in that dimly lit drawingroom were all that an artist could desire and the facial expressions bordered upon the tragic of all men in the world his brother was the last whom of his own choosing paul would have wished to see  there was a brief silence arthur breathless through his hasty entrance could only stand there upon the threshold his face white to the lips and his eyes flashing with passionate anger and dismay to him the situation was more than painful it was horrible to have believed ill of paul from hearsay would have been impossible his confidence in his elder brother had been unbounded he had always looked up to him as the mirror of everything that was honorable and chivalrous even now perhaps there might be some explanationsome partial explanation at any rate paul was standing back amongst the shadows and his face was only barely visible doubtless it was only surprise which held him silent in a moment he would speak and explain everything it was this thought which loosened arthurs tongue  paul he cried and stepping forward into the room and adrea you here and together tell me what it means i have a right to know i will know  he had determined to be cool to bear himself like a man but their silence maddened him adrea it is true showed no signs of guilt or confusion in her cold questioning face but the deceit if deceit there had been was not hers it was paul who was responsible to him and it was paul who should have spokenpaul who stood there with a hidden face a silent immovable figure  are you stricken dumb he cried angrily you can see who i am cant you paul speak to me tell me whether there is any truth in these stories which are flying about the county with no one to contradict them  what might have been the tragedy of the situation vanished for paul at the sound of his brothers words after all it was not the just anger of a deceived man with which he was confronted but the empty scream of a boys passion arthurs infatuation had but skimmed the surface of his light nature he was pricked not wounded yet though in a sense this realization brought its relief paul felt humbled into the dust he was actually conscious of his own humiliation so far as a nature such as his could be conventional he had become so in deference to the opinion of those who looked up to him as the head of a great house and of whom much was to be expected both socially and politically what must become of that opinion now arthurs words too plainly foreshadowed  he moved forward into the centre of the room and faced his brother there was only a small table between them  i do not know who sent you here arthur he said or what reports you have heard but it seems to me that any explanation you may wish had better be deferred until our return home  arthur struck the table violently with his ridingwhip i will not wait he cried here is the proper place i have been deceived and cajoled bybyyou adrea and by my own brother it is shameful you hypocrite paul you to come up to london and solemnly lecture me about a dancing girl you dd hypocrite  before his passion pauls grave and steadfast silence gained an added dignity adrea with a red spot burning on her cheeks sailed between the two  arthur you are mad she said turning suddenly upon him with her eyes afire have i ever deceived you have i ever pretended to care for you bah no you are only an unformed hysterical boy before you were indifferent to me now i am very quickly growing to hate you begone leave this house  he stood quite still white and trembling the scorn of her words had fallen like ice upon his heart then he turned and groped for the door as though there were a mist before his eyes  i suppose you are quite right he faltered out i didnt see it quite the same way thats all i understand now  the door opened and shut in a moment or two the sound of his horses hoofs were heard in the avenue growing rapidly less distinct as he galloped away into the darkness to paul it sounded like the knell of his selfrespect but adrea felt only the relief her eyes full of soft invitation sought his but he did not move he stood there silent and motionless with his face turned towards the window those dying sounds meant so much to himso much that she could never understand  the consciousness of her near presence suddenly disturbed him he turned round her warm breath was upon his cheek and her white arms were twined about his neck  paul she whispered do not look so miserable please come and talk to me  her arms tightened around him he looked down at her with a peculiar helplessness their light weight seemed to him like a chain of iron weighing him down down down  he had told himself that he had come to bid her farewell that father adrians words vague though they were yet had a definite meaning and were worthy of his regard but at that moment their memory was like a dying echo in his ears this first passion of his life was strong upon him and everything else was weak the future was suddenly bounded for him by a pair of white clinging arms and a dark beautiful face pressed close to his he saw no more he could see no further     chapter xxi  adreas diary      by love stalks hate his brother and his mate   i am scarcely calm enough to write yet i must write my heart is full my very pulses are throbbing with excitement what is it that has happened it is all confused in my mind let me try and set it down clearly then perhaps i shall be able to see my way  yesterday it seemed to me that my being was all too small for one passion now it holds two the one perhaps intensifies the other that is possible for they are opposites and one has grown out of the other now i cannot tell which is the stronger the love or the hate  i love one man and i hate another perhaps i should say i love one man because i hate another you my dumb confidant may be trusted with names so i will be clearer still i love paul de vaux and i hate father adrian  oh that he should have dared that he should have dared to speak so to me if only paul had been there he should have beaten him if i had had the strength and the means i would have killed him where he stood and silenced those thin cruel lips for ever i could have stabbed him to the heart and my hand would never have faltered  let me try to recall that scene it is not difficult his words are ringing still in my ears and his white passionate face seems to follow and mock me wherever i look i see it out there in the white moonlight and it rises up from the dark corners of the room it haunts me and i hate it i hate him as a woman hates any one who comes between her and the man she loves  we were alone paul and i at least we thought so i had heard no one enter nor had he but suddenly a voice rang out and filled the room a fierce cruel voice so changed and hardened with passion that i scarcely recognised it but when we sprang up and peered through the twilight of the chamber we saw him standing close to usso close that he might even have heard our whispered words to one another  there had been some ceremony at the monastery amongst the hills where most of his time here is spent and he had evidently come straight from there his flowing black robes were splashed with mud and torn by brambles and his white face was livid with exhaustion and anger his dark eyes burned like fire in their hollow depths and his right hand was raised above his head as though he had been on the point of striking or denouncing us i shall not forget his appearance while i live it will haunt me to my dying day  i think that it is the mystery of it all which tortures me so what has paul to fear from him whence comes his power what evil is it which he holds suspended over his head there is only one that i can imagine father adrian must hold the key to that awful deathbed scene at the monastery of cruta as i write the words my hand shakes my heart sickens with the horror of that memory well have i cause to shrink from all thought of that hideous nighti to whom the son of martin de vaux has become the dearest amongst men what was it paul said to me he knows something which my father told him whilst he lay dying is it that knowledge which gives him this strange power i did not believe in it i would not have believed in it but in that dreadful moment i turned to paul and i saw his face  a volley of words seemed trembling on father adrians lips yet he did not speak we waited for the storm to burst we waited till i could bear the silence no longer and i felt that if it was not broken i should go mad so i drew near to him and spoke a single word in his ear then i glided back to pauls side  spy  he treated the insult as one might treat the bite of an insect in the face of some imminent danger he did not reply to it he did not appear to have heard it his eyes traveled over me as though they had been sightless and challenged pauls in the excitement of the moment his words sounded tame and almost meaningless  this is your answer then paul de vaux let it be so i accept your decision  there was no defiance in pauls answer his manner was quite subdued i think that both his words and his tone surprised me  you have seen i am in your hands  i looked from one to the other troubled i felt that there was a hidden meaning in their words which i could not understand there was something between them from which i was excluded but this much i knew there was a threat in father adrians words and it was i who was the cause of it oh if this man should bring evil upon paul the thought of it is like madness to me see there goes my pen i cannot write when i think of it  i have opened my window the very air is sad with the moaning of the sea and the rustling of the night breeze in the thick tangled shrubbery below but to me it is sweet and grateful i am in no mood for pleasant sounds or sights the dreariness of the night finds its echo in my heart the damp breeze cools my forehead tonight i feel conscious of a new strength it is the strength of hate my mind is full of dim purposes time will aid them to gather strength as they group themselves together action will suggest itself to time i leave them  let me go back to my recital of what passed between us three a strange lethargic calm seemed to have fallen upon paul he turned to me without even a single trace of the passion which had lit up his face a few moments before  i must go he said quietly farewell  i could scarcely believe that he meant it that he was going away without another word at what was really this priests unspoken bidding but it was so from that moment the fear of father adrian which had grown up in my heart leaped into a new strength i was angry and full of resistance  why should you go i cried i have much to say to you  i must go now adrea he answered simply when i came i had no thought of staying it is late  i felt my face grow hot with passion as i turned swiftly round towards father adrian it is you who should go i cried why have you come here why are you always creeping across my life like a dark noisome shadow go away begone i will not be left with you  he turned a shade paler but he did not sacrifice his dignity as i hoped that he would by answering me with anger he did not even answer me at all he looked over my head at my lover  tomorrow night he said calmly  tomorrow night paul answered  i stood between them angry but helpless a log of wood had just fallen from the fire on to the hearth and in its sudden blaze i could see their faces distinctly the utter contrast between the two men threw each into strong relief paul in his scarlet coat and riding clothes pale and impassive but débonnaire and father adrian his strange black garb mudbespattered and disordered and his dark angry face livid with the passion so hardly suppressed it was odd to think of them as creatures of the same species odder still to think that there should be this link between them  i walked with paul to the door holding to his arm and talking halfgaily halfreproachfully all the way we stood on the step together while his horse was being brought round and in the halflights he stooped down and kissed me but his manner had changed even his lips were cold and his eyes were no longer bright there was a faraway look in them and his face was white and set there were tears in my eyes as i watched him ride away on his great brown horse and listened to the distant thunder of hoofs across the moor his face had told its own story he was nerving himself to face some expected danger from whose hands surely from father adrians  the thought worked within me i stood for a moment trying to quiet my passion as i turned away i heard the stableyard doors open and a carriage laden with luggage drove slowly out and without coming to the front at all turned down the avenue i ran out heedless of my slippers and called to it to stop the man obeyed me and i caught it up breathless the blinds were closely drawn but i opened the door as i expected it was she who sat inside closely veiled and weeping  you were going then without a single word of farewell i cried reproachfully is that kind have i deserved it from you  she threw up her veil her eyes were red and swollen with weeping she looked at me pleadingly  do not blame me more than you can help she said it was a great shock to me to see youwith the son of martin de vaux it was more than a shock it was a horror to me he is like his father he is very like his father  i knew that she had passed through a fiery sea of suffering and i kept back the anger which threatened me i pointed upwards  we cannot keep the dark clouds from gathering in the sky nor can we make love come and go at our bidding we are but creatures it is fate which ordains  she bowed her head fate or the unknown god i am not your judge child i do not leave you in anger  why do you go then and leave me here alone it is not kind it is not what i should expect from you  the tears started again into her eyes but she shook them away i cannot explain as yet she said you will think me ungrateful i fear i cannot help it i must go farewell adrea  a sudden thought came to me it was an inspiration you are not going of your own free will i cried some one has been influencing you  her face was suddenly full of nervous terror hush hush she cried he will hear you let me go now let me go i beseech you  i held her hands it is father adrian who is sending you away i cried passionately he is my enemy i hate him why should you obey him stay with me do do stay  she looked at me as one would look at an ignorant child who blasphemes you are talking wildly father adrian is far from being your enemy you do not understand  her voice had changed the note of sympathy had died away i turned away from the carriage door in despair father adrians power was greater than mine  you can go i said bitterly you would have left me here without one word at his bidding as you say i do not understand  she leaned forward with a strange light in her eyes child she whispered i am going to cruta  the carriage drove away and i walked back to the house the air seemed full of voices and the grey rising mists loomed into strange shapes cruta she was going to cruta what power had this man in his hands to send my lover from me with a heart like a stone and this woman back into the living hell from which she had just freed herself it was my turn now would he be able to subdue me to his bidding the thought made me shudder  i ran upstairs into my room and bathed my forehead and rearranged my gown then i set my teeth together and went down to him it was to be a battle well i was prepared                                       it is over now i know his strength and i know his weakness what passed between us i shall put down tomorrow tonight i am weary     chapter xxii  oh heart of stone yet flesh to all save me   this is exactly what happened after i regained the house i went upstairs for a few minutes to arrange my hair and bathe my eyes then i walked straight down to the drawingroom and i told myself that i was prepared for anything that might take place  father adrian did not hear me enter so i had the advantage at the onset of taking him by surprise he was standing in the centre of the hearthrug with his arms folded and his eyes cast down upon the ground his eyebrows almost met in a black frown and a curious grey pallor had spread itself over his face when i entered noiselessly moving the curtains from the outer chamber he was muttering to himself and i strained my hearing to catch the meaning of his words  tonight must end it i heard him say she herself shall decide greater men have travelled the path before me as for him my pity has grown faint it is the will of the church i myself am but the instrument he stands between the church and her rights between me andher  his cheeks flushed and his expression suddenly changed he whispered a name it was mine his eyes were soft and his lips were parted the priest had vanished his face was human and manly i saw it but my heart was as cold as steel  father adrian i said quietly i am here  he started and looked towards me if my heart could have been softened even to pity it would have been softened by that look but a womans great selfishness was upon me the man i loved was in some sort of danger at his hands there was no room in my heart for any other thought i was adamant  he was silent for a moment then he faced me steadily and spoke so you have learned to love this englishman this de vaux the son of old martin de vaux answer me simply yes or no  i have  i did not hesitate what need was there for hesitation i answered him defiantly and without faltering  you will never marry him you will not even become his mistress  i made no answer at first i laughed that was all  who will prevent me  i shall  how  the means are ready to my hand  my heart sank but i forced a smile what are they  he considered a moment i can strip paul de vaux of every acre and every penny he possesses i can break his mothers heart i can proclaim his father a murderer  i do not understand i do not believe  the words left me boldly enough but there was a lump in my throat and my heart was sick  listen he drew a small gold crucifix from his breast and solemnly kissed it then holding it in his hand he repeated  i can beggar paul de vaux by my proven word i can take from him everything precious in life i can take from him his name and his honours i can break his mothers heart i can proclaim his father a murderer all this i can and will do save you listen to me  he kissed the crucifix and replaced it in his inner pocket i had begun to tremble the stamp of truth was upon his words still i tried to face him boldly  even if this is so what has it to do with me i cried  you know he answered in your heart you know yet if you willlisten he continued in a low tone you love paul de vaux  it is true  and you believe that he loves you  i do  listen then three nights ago i lifted that curtain by the side of one who has left you for ever and i saw you in his arms i followed him out of the house i walked by his side to vaux abbey and i told him what i have told you i wasted no time in idle threats i told him what power was mine and i said choose he was silent  choose between what i interrupted  i bade him swear that he would never willingly look upon your face again or prepare himself to face all the evils which it was in my power to bring upon him  and he  he asked for timefor a week  a storm of anger was suddenly stirred up within me i turned upon him with flashing eyes and quivering lips discretion and restraint were gone i was like a tigress i lacked only the power to kill  and by what right did you dare to thrust yourself between us i cried what have i to do with you or you with me  he held up his hands for a moment as though to shut out the sight of my face ablaze with scorn and hatred there was a short silence then he spoke in a low tone vibrating with intensity of feeling  you know in your heart you know he said into my life has come the greatest humiliation which can befall such as i am in sorrow and bitterness it has eaten itself into my heart i am accursed in my own sight and in the sight of god  i mocked at him i am not your confessor i laughed go and tell your sins to those of your own order i am a woman and you are a priest why do you look at me with that light in your eyes am i a prayerbook is there anything saintly in my face that you should keep your eyes fixed upon it so steadily  i had hoped that my words would madden him and he would lose his selfcontrol to my surprise they had but little effect he seemed scarcely to have heard  what have you to do with me or i with you he repeated in a voice which was rapidly gaining strength and passion god knows yet as surely as we both live our lots are intertwined the one with the other  a godly priest i laughed what have you to do with me what of your vows oh how dare you try to play the lover with me you hypocrite  he shrank back as though in pain i laughed outright glad that i had made him feel  adrea he said slowly i was never a hypocrite to you in your presence i have never breathed a word of my religion think for a moment of those days at cruta did i not refuse to confess you why you know because of those long dreamy days we spent together not as priest and penitent but as man and woman do you remember themthe cliffs with their giant shadows standing out across the blue waters of the harbour the hollows where we sat amongst the perfumed wild flowers gazing across the sea and watching the white sails in the distance the nights with their white moonlight and silent grandeur ay adrea look me in the face if you can and tell me that you have forgotten them you cannot you dare not it was you who brought me those books of wild passionate poetry whose music entered into my very soul it was you who tempted me with soft words with your music with your beauty into that world of sense which holds me prisoner for ever what i once was i can never be again it is you who worked the changeyou who awoke my mans heart and set it beating for ever at your touch at your movements at the sight of you it is you who taught me how to lovewho opened to me the rosecovered gates of hell there is no drawing back you who have dragged me down shall share my fall with me for better or for worse you shall not escape no other man shall have you i have paid the price and i will have you  i wrenched myself free from the arms which were closing around me and stood trembling before him  fool i cried you have dared to think of me like that because i chose to make use of you at cruta make use of you yes that is what i did i wanted to escape you and she were the only ones who could help me save for that i had never wasted a moment upon you i never thought of you as a man you were only a priest i never wished to see you again you are in my way now you stand between me and the man i love i hate you  his dark eyes were lit up with a sudden fire and a deep flush stained his cheeks for the first time i seemed to see the man in him as well as the priest and i saw that he was handsome it did not interest me i noticed it only as an incident  i do not believe it he exclaimed you are not so false as you would have me believe adrea  his hand was on my wrist and his dark eyes strangely softened were fixed pleadingly upon mine something in his manner even in his tone seemed to remind me of paul i was magnetized for a moment i could not move and during that moment his hands closed upon mine  adrea is such a love as i can offer you worth nothing what did you tell me once was your lifes ideal was it not the love of a strong true man always faithful always loving no one could love you more tenderly than i no one could be more faithful until i saw you no womans face had dwelt in my thoughts for a single instant in my heart you reign alone adrea no one has been there beforeno one will come after such as it is it is a kingdom of your own  i do not understand you i said slowly withdrawing my hands you talk to me of a mans love a mans faithfulness what do you know of it you are a priest  he threw up his hands with a sudden cry of agony his face was white and blanched  do i not know it he exclaimed in a low fierce tone do you think i yielded easily to the poisoned web you have woven around me the horror of it all has darkened my days and made hideous my nights and yet you can taunt me with ityou for whom i yield up conscience and futureyou for whom i give my soul no other man could love as i love adrea  i looked him straight in the face and i did not spare him what was the use the truth was best  it is folly i said if your religion is worth anything to you let it help you now let it teach you to forget me go away from here and leave unharmed the man i love if you do not i shall hate you  he caught hold of my dress he was on his knees before mea bent imploring figure  too late too late he cried my religion has gone when love for you crept into my heart i became worse than a heretic it was sin and the sin has spread oh have mercy upon me adrea have mercy upon me just a little of your love it may not be much at first but it will grow adrea you must tryyou shall try  i shook my gown from his trembling fingers and looked down upon him with contempt in my heart and contempt in my face the flickering firelight cast a faint glow upon his blanched wan features and their utter humility filled me with an unreasoning and unreasonable loathing i did not try to soften my words i spoke out just as i felt and watched him rise slowly to his feet like a hunted and stricken animal without a pitying word or glance as he rose upright his head dropped he did not look at me he did not speak a single word he walked slowly to the door with steps that faltered a little and walked out of the room and out of the house  i watched him down the avenue wondering at his strange silence it had a curious effect upon me i would rather have heard threatseven a torrent of anger there was something curiously ominous in that slow wordless exit i watched him uneasily full of dim shapeless fears  outside the gate he paused in the middle of the road to the left was the monastery where he had stayed to the right was vaux abbey i heard my heart beat while he paused and my face was pressed against the window for nearly a minute he stood quite still with downcast head thinking then he turned deliberately to the right and set his face towards vaux abbey                                       that was early in the evening yesterdaytwentyfour hours ago since then not a soul has been near the house early this morning i saw father adrian coming along the road from vaux i ran upstairs and locked myself in my room after forbidding the servants to let him enter from the windows i watched him to my surprise he never even glanced in he walked past the gates and took the road to the monastery i saw him slowly ascend the hill and vanish out of sight in the darkening twilight once just before he reached the summit he paused and looked steadily down here i could not see his face but i saw him raise his right hand for a moment toward the sky then he turned round and pursued his way                                       if some one does not come to me soon i shall go mad another hour has passed my mind is made up i shall go to vaux abbey     chapter xxiii  my lips are charged with truth and justice bids me speak   an early darkness had fallen upon the earth black clouds had sailed across the young moon and the evening breeze had changed into a gale there was no rain as yet but every prospect of it near at hand a mass of lurid yellowish clouds hung low down over the bending woods and the wind whistled drearily amongst the fir trees paul de vaux wrapped his cloak tightly around him and standing on the turfcovered floor of the ruined chapel peered forward into the darkness looking for the man whom he had come to meet even then he heard his voice before he could distinguish the dim outline of father adrian standing by his side  so you have come paul de vaux and in good time it is well  i am here paul answered shortly if what you have to say to me will take long come up to the house it is dark and cold and there is a storm rising  the priest shook his head i have no wish to find shelter under the roof of vaux abbey he said coldly you are well protected against the weather and so am i let us stay here  paul strove to look into his face but the darkness baffled him he could only see its outline nothing of his expression as you will he answered speak i am ready  i have dealt in no idle threats paul de vaux was the stern answer i gave you a chance and you have thrown it away perhaps i did ill ever to offer it to you but at any rate remember this it is no idle vengeance which i am dealing out to you this night it is our holy and despoiled church calling for justice i speak in her name  there was a moments silence paul knew by his companions bowed head and laboured utterance that he was suffering from some sort of emotion but the darkness hid from him the workings of his pale features when he spoke his voice was low and solemn  paul de vaux turn back in your mind to another night such as this when the thunder of sea and wind shook the air and the anger of god seemed fallen upon the earth on that night your father lay dying in the island monastery of cruta and while you were risking your life in the storm to reach him i knelt by his side praying for his soul that it might not sink down amongst the damned in hell he was a brave man but with the icy hand of death closing around him fear touched his heart it was no craven fear he lay there still and quiet but his heart was troubled in the midst of my prayers he stopped me and took the crucifix into his own hand  father he said i have no faith in dying repentances i have scouted religion all my life and on my deathbed i will not cry for comfort to a divinity which is a myth to me yet as man to man listen while i tell you a secret and when i have finished do you pray for me  shall i go on paul de vaux shall i tell you all that your fathers dying lips faltered out to me  all every word keep nothing back paul spoke quickly almost feverishly he knew a little but something told him that this priest knew more he began dimly to suspect the nature of the revelation which was to come  you shall know everything father adrian continued in the same hushed tone so low that paul had to bend forward to catch the words as they fell from his lips if martin de vaux had been of our religion and had sought me as a priest of the church a seal would have been set upon my mouth but it was not so despite all my ministrations he died as he had lived in heresy and grievous sin after all it is only right that you his son should know what he forebore to tell you yet in my weakness i might have spared you if you yourself had not brought down this blow upon your head  paul raised his hand and father adrian paused listen he said in a low deep tone there are secret pages in the lives of most of uspages blurred and scarred with misery and suffering and sin but there is a differencea great difference some are turned over with firm and penitent fingers and although their scarlet record may never be blotted out yet by sacrifice and atonement the fruits of the sin itself may die and dying cast no shadow into the future a sin against humanity can often be righted by human justice towards the close of my fathers days i knew for the first time that there was in his life one of those disfigured pages he told me nothing i sought to know nothing father adrian paul went on with a sudden strain of passion in his tone and a gesture half unseen in the darkness if the shadow of his sin rests upon any human being if it still lives upon the earth then tell me all that is in your heart to tell for there is work to be done but if that page be locked and sealed if those who suffered through it are dead and the burden which darkened my fathers days is his alone then spare his memory strike at me if you will deal out your promised vengeance but let it fall on me alone  paul ended his speech with a little burst of passion ringing in those last few words he was conscious of a deep and fervent desire to hear nothing to listen to nothing which could teach him to hold less dear his fathers memory he shrank with a human and perfectly natural feeling from hearing evil of the dead that last evil deed the murder in that grim bare chamber of death had haunted him with vivid and painful intensity but it was a crime by itself it was horrible to imagine that it might indeed be the culmination of a life of license and contempt of all human laws he had tried to think of it as something outside his fathers life something done in a momentary fit of madness and that the man who suffered by it was some monster unfit for the companionship of his fellowsunfit to live there were still tales to be heard in the county and about town even of the wild doings of martin de vaux in his younger days but none of these had reached his sons ears he would have been the last person likely to hear of them  there was a short silence and before father adrian spoke again the lowlying clouds were swept over their heads by a gale from seaward and the wind commenced to whistle and shriek in the pine wood and roar amongst the crumbling ruins which scarcely afforded them protection from the blinding rain any further conversation was impossible paul lifted up his voice and shouted in his companions ear  these walls are not safe we must go into the house will you come  father adrian hesitated and then assented wrapping his cloak around him in a few moments they were inside the library having entered through a private door and met no one breathless paul threw off his cloak which was dripping with rain and turned round almost fiercely upon his companion  now speak he said i am ready to hear all  the priest looked at him steadily for a moment and then with his pale face turned towards the fire he commenced to speak  sin is everlasting he said slowly your fathers sin lives and on you the burden must fall if you had kept the covenant which i placed before you i might have spared you you yourself have chosen you must hear all listen  it was by chance that i was spending two months in charge of the monastery of st jerome at cruta when your father arrived he continued without any pause he sought our hospitality and he at once obtained it for two days he dwelt with us spending his time for the most part in idle fashion wandering about along the seashore or on the cliffs but always with the look on his face of a man who does but dally with some fixed purpose his doings were nothing to me but by chance from one of the brethren i learnt that he was no stranger to the islandthat once many years ago he had been the guest of the lord who ruled the little territory and whose castle overshadows the monastery  on the third day of his stay he remained within his guestchamber until sundown writing as the vesperbell rang i met him in the corridor dressed for walking and from his countenance i judged that whatever his mission to the island might be he was about to bring it to an end he passed me without speech almost as though he had not seen me and left the monastery a few minutes afterwards looking down from the windows to watch the brethren come in from their field tasks i saw him take the road up to the castle  it was in the middle of the night when he returned midnight had come and gone and every one in the monastery was asleep when the hoarse clanging bell down in the yard rang slightly as though pulled by feeble fingers i threw my cloak over my shoulders and descended to admit him when the last of the huge bolts had been withdrawn and i threw the door open i found him leaning against the wall with his fingers clutched together in agony and his bloodless features convulsed with pain the moonlight was falling right across his face pale and ghastly with pain and by its light i seemed to see something dark dropping from him on the white flags i leaned forward horrorstricken and i saw that it was blood  my god  paul was standing very still and rigid with his eyes fastened upon the priest as yet he scarcely realized anything more than that he was being told a very horrible story but he was conscious of a feverish impatience quite beyond his control when father adrian paused at his exclamation he beat the ground with his foot impatiently go on go on he said hoarsely  i had no time to ask questions the priest continued quietly directly he left the support of the wall and endeavoured to move towards me your father threw up his arms with a sharp cry of pain and almost fell upon his face i was just in time to catch him and exerting all my strengthfor he was a powerful mani dragged him up the steps and along the corridor to the nearest empty cell there i laid him down upon a bed of ferns and then hurried out to summon one of the brethren who was skilled in medicine  in a few moments he returned with me by his direction i gave your father brandy and other restoratives while he cut open his coat to find out if he could the nature of the wound it was easily discovered he had been stabbed by a long dagger just below the heart had the dagger entered onesixteenth of an inch higher he must have bled to death upon the spot  we bound up the hurt as well as we could and with the help of other of the monks we carried him up to the guestchamber and put him to bed in about half an hour he recovered consciousness and called me to his side  pencil paper he whispered  i handed him both after several futile efforts he succeeded in writing a few words then he folded up the note and handed it to me  if you will send it without delay he whispered i will give one hundred pounds to the monastery  i never hesitated for our funds were in a desperate state but first i glanced at the direction it was addressed to                                      paul de vaux esq                                       co the english consul                                                          palermo  i promised that it should be sent and as you know it was then i sent the others out of the room and inquired about his hurt he set his lips firm and shook his head  it was an accident he faltered no one was to blame  i told him briefly that it was impossible the nature of his wound was such that it was clearly the work of an assassin in a certain sense we were the upholders of the law on the island and i pointed this out to him sternly he only shook his head and closed his eyes neither then nor at any other time could i gain from him one single word as to his doings on that night he would tell me nothing  you saw him going toward the castle paul interrupted did you make inquiries there  the priest shook his head slowly no i made no inquiries he answered it was no matter for my interference the castle although it is a huge place was deserted save for a few native servants whose patois was unintelligible to me there were only two who dwelt therethe old count himself and one otherto whom i could have gone several nights after your fathers illness i left the monastery and tried to see the count he would not even have me admitted and on my return your father who had guessed the reason of my absence sent for me he judged of the ill success of my mission by my face and he instantly appeared relieved he then called me to the bedside and made me an offer he would give me as a further contribution to our exhausted funds a large sum of money on this conditionthat i took no further steps in any direction towards ascertaining the nature of his accident as he chose to call it and that i should not mention it to you as the cause of his illness or refer to it in any way if you arrived while he was there i hesitated for some time but in the end i consented the money in itself was a great temptationyou see i am frank with youand apart from that your father at that time was on the verge of his fever and at such a critical time i feared the ill results of not falling in with his wishes so i promised and i kept my promise no onenot even youknew that he died from that dagger thrust and during the remainder of my stay on the island i asked no questions concerning his visit to the castle  but did you hear nothing were there no reports paul asked  father adrian hesitated there were no reports about your father he said but the castle itself was always the object of the most unbounded superstition on the part of the inhabitants they told strange tales of midnight cries of lights from blockedup chambers and of the old count who still dwelt there although he had not been seen outside the castle walls for many a year he was reported to have sold himself to the evil one and at the very mention of his name the people crossed themselves in terror and glanced uneasily over their shoulders  idle tales cried paul angrily tell me father adrian did you know this count of cruta  there was a moments silence father adrians face was turned away and he seemed in no hurry to answer yes i knew him  you knew him what is he like tell me  the priest shook his head i have nothing to tell you he said in a low tone  you mean that you will not tell me  the priest inclined his head paul turned upon him fiercely he was my fathers murderer he cried  it may be so but remember that nothing is known remember too that your fathers last wish was to keep secret the manner of his death  paul seemed scarcely to have heard him he was walking restlessly up and down the apartment presently he stopped in front of father adrians chair  you have told me what happened to my father on the island he said now tell me the story of his life which you say that he confided to you i must know what took him there     chapter xxiv  the shattered vase of loves most holy vows   paul had not thought of ringing for lights and save around the fireplace the room was wrapped in solemn darkness father adrians chair had been amongst the shadows and paul had seen nothing save his outline since they had entered the room but now his curiosity stirred by the sudden silence of the priest he caught up the poker and broke the burning log in the grate so that the flames threw a quick light on his face  its extreme pallor struck him forcibly it was a perfectly bloodless face and the dark eyes as black as jet accentuated its pallor yet there was no lack of nervous strength or emotion the thin lips were quivering and the eyes were soft with feeling somehow it seemed to paul that this mans interest in the story which he had come to tell was no casual one that he himself was mixed up in it in a manner which as yet he had chosen to conceal his colourless face was alight with human interest and sympathies who was this priest and why had he come so far to tell his story paul felt that a mystery lay behind it all  you must not think father adrian commenced slowly that your father told me the whole history of his life it was one episode only the memory of which weighed heavily upon him as death drew near he did not tell me all concerning it what he did tell me i will try and repeat to you  it was late in the afternoon of the day before your arrival that he called me to his bedside only a few hours ago we had told him that he must die and since then he had been very silent i came and knelt before him and was commencing a prayer when he stopped me  i want you to listen while i tell you one of the worst actions of my life he said in a low tone weakened by the suffering through which he had passed the memory of it has haunted me always it is the memory of it which has brought me here i am not confessing to you mind only after i have told you this story i want you to pray for me  thirty years ago i was in palermo and was introduced there to the count of cruta we met several times and on his departure he invited me to come over here for a weeks shooting i was wandering about on pleasure with no fixed plans and i did not hesitate for a moment i should like nothing better than to come i told him and accordingly we returned here together  the count was a widower with one daughter irene for a young man i was not particularly impressionable and up till then i had thought very little about women neverthelessperhaps i should say all the more for that reasoni fell in love with irene in a weeks time i had all but told her so and finding myself alone with her father one night after dinner i boldly asked him for her hand somewhat to my surprisefor considering the difference in our years we had become very friendlyhe refused me pointblank the first reason which he gave staggered me irene was already engaged to a roumanian nobleman who would be coming soon to claim her but apart from that he went on he would never have consented to the match on the score of our different religions i tried to argue with him but it was useless he would not even discuss the matter his daughters hand was promised and his word was passed  on the morrow i appealed to irene and here i met with more success she confessed that she loved me and to my surprise she consented at once when i proposed that she should run away with me our arrangements were made in haste and secrecy my yacht lay in the harbour and at midnight irene stole down to the shore where i met her and rowed her on board a few minutes later we weighed anchor and steamed away with the rusty old guns from the castle firing useless shots high over our heads  i want to make my story as short as i can so i will not attempt to offer any excuses for my conduct or to seek to palliate it in any way irene had trusted herself to me and i betrayed her trust i did not marry her she did not leave me she did not even openly upbraid me but nevertheless it hung like a dark cloud over her life by degrees she became altered she tried to drown her memory by frivolity by all manner of gaiety and excitement and our life in paris afforded her many opportunities  the old count of cruta made two efforts to rescue his daughter from me the first time he came alone and before his righteous fury i was for a moment abashed give me back my daughter he thundered with his back to my closed door and a pistol pointed to my head i rang the bell and irene came dressed for the evening and humming a light opera tune then i saw to what depths of callousness i had dragged her and i shuddered she listened to the old mans stormy eloquence and when he had finished his passionate appeal she shrugged her shoulders slightly she was perfectly happy she declared and she would die sooner than go back to that triste cruta had he had a pleasant journey she asked and would he stay and dine i saw her father shudder and the words seemed frozen upon his lips he looked at her in perfect silence for a full minutelooked at her from head to foot at her soft white dress with its floating sea of dainty draperies and at the diamonds on her neck and bosom then his eye seemed to blaze with anger  girl he cried sternly you have dragged down into the mire one of the proudest names in europe curse you for it as for you sir he added turning to me you are a dishonoured scoundrel a cur  he was right i was a blackguard but had it not been for those last words of his i should straightway have offered to have married irene on the morrow the words were on my lips but the contempt of that monosyllable maddened me the better impulse passed away  you should have given her to me when i asked for her hand i answered you cur he repeated i looked at him steadily you are an old man i said or i should throw you down my stairs now go irene has nothing to say to you nor have i  he lingered on the threshold for a moment surveying us both with a calm dignity before which i felt ashamed  as you remind me i am an old man he said quietly and i have alas no son to chastise you as you deserve but the season of old age is the season of prophecy listen martin de vaux pointing towards me you shall taste the bitterest dregs of sorrow and remorse in the days to come for this your evil deed you may scoff both of youyou may say to yourselves that an old mans words are words of follybut the day will come it is writ in the book of fate and my eyes have seen it pile sin upon sin and pleasure upon pleasure say to yourselves let us eat and be merry for tomorrow we shall die for so it is written and my eyes have seen it  he was gone almost before the echo of his words had died away i called after him but there was no answer but the sound of a shutting door i looked at irene she was calmly buttoning her glove  the carriage is waiting she reminded me coolly  i gave her my arm and laughed we drove to the opera     chapter xxv  a beckoning voice from out a shadowy land   midnight rang solemnly out from the abbey clock the priest paused in his story to count the strokes and paul drew out his watch with an incredulous gesture  you must stay here tonight he said it will be too late for you to leave  he rang the bell and ordered a room to be prepared father adrian who had been lost in a fit of deep abstraction looked up and shook his head as the servant quitted the room i shall not stay here he said quietly it is impossible  paul pointed to the clock you have more to tell me he said and it is already late if you are staying at the monastery of st bernard it is nearly eight miles away and you cannot possibly return  i have not so far to go father adrian answered and this is the hour i always choose for walking do you wish to hear the rest of your fathers confession  paul stood on the hearthrug with bowed head and folded arms i am ready he said go on  father adrian remained silent for nearly a quarter of an hour then he recommenced his story  from the time of the old counts visit your father went on i noticed a gradual change in irene she grew thin and pale and nervous disliking more and more every day to go out and becoming suddenly averse to all our previous pursuits and pleasures we mixed amongst a bohemian set in paris and we had a good many acquaintances of a certain sort amongst them was a man whom i always disliked yet who managed somehow to establish himself upon terms of intimacy with us his name was count victor ferdinand hirsfeld and his nationality was rather a puzzle to me for he chose to maintain without any apparent reason a sort of mystery about it with irene he was ever more intimate than with me and more than once i noticed references in their conversation which seemed to point to some previous acquaintance between them i asked irene no questions for i trusted her but i watched count hirsfeld closely i felt convinced that under the mask of friendship he was trying to win irene from me and though i never for one moment believed that he would succeed i was anxious to obtain some proof of his intentions that i might punish him often after his visits which seemed to be carefully chosen for a time at which i was nearly certain to be out i found irene in tears but when i sought to make her explain she had always some excuse  we had lived together for three years when without any warning irene left me i came home one night from a dinner at the english embassy and found her gone there was no message not a single line of adieu not a ghost of a clew by which i could trace her it was a shock to me but when the first wrench was over i knew that it was something of a relief in my heart i was tired of the irregular life we had been leading and longing to return to england and my old home irene herself was no longer dear to me while she had remained faithful to me i had considered myself in a certain sense bound to her although the bonds had commenced to gall now that she had left me of her own accord i was free i troubled little as to what had become of her youth is always selfish she had either gone home to her father or had run away with count hirsfeld i determined at once of the two i was inclined to believe the latter from the fact of her having left no message for me and also as i found that he too had quitted paris suddenly i purposely did not attempt to find out for had i discovered the latter to be true i should have felt bound to call count hirsfeld out the next time i met him and i hated duelling so with a light heart i disposed of my paris establishment selling even the house and everything likely to remind me of a page of my history which i desired to blot out  i returned to england and settled down at vaux abbey in a few months my life with irene lay back in the past like a troubled dream and i did my best to forget it it was all hateful and tiresome to me my mind was full now of healthier and more wholesome thoughts and purposes i felt like a man commencing life anew even my conscience had almost ceased to trouble me irene had left me of her own will nor had she been driven to it by any unkindness on my part i would forget her i had the right to forget her  about six months had passed and i was in the full enjoyment of my altered life one night when the abbey was full of guests a servant whispered in my ear as we sat at dinner that a gentlemana foreigner the man believedhad just been driven over from the nearest railway station and was in the library waiting to see me i knew in a moment that some sort of a resurrection of that buried past was at hand and though i nodded carelessly and kept my countenance my heart sank like lead as soon as i could make an excuse i left the table with a brief apology to my guests and made my way to the library  i had expected to find there irenes father judge of my surprise when i found count hirsfeld advancing to meet me pale and travelstained from the shadows of the room i stopped short and stood with my hands behind me  mr de vaux i bring you a letter he said simply i am here as a messenger and as a messenger only nothing but the prayers of a dying woman would have induced me to stand beneath your roof  your presence certainly needs some explanation i answered coldly give me the letter  he handed it over and i took it to the lamplight the handwriting seemed unfamiliar to me but when i glanced at the last page i saw that it was signed irene i read it through hastily                                             cruta      martin      i left you meaning never to speak or write your name     again but fate has been too strong for me when you see my     handwriting you may fear that i want to burden you once more     with my presence which has grown so wearisome to you you     need not soon there will be nothing left of me but a memory     even that i know will not survive long for i am dying life     is only a matter of days and hours with me now for me only     a few more suns will rise and set i am dying else i had not     taken up my pen to write to you      martin ones last hours are a time for plain speaking i     have never suffered one word of reproach to pass my lips but     you have wronged me deeply you have turned what should have     been the sweetness of my life into bitterness and gall i do     not remind you of this to heap idle reproaches on your head     i remind you of it simply because on my deathbed i am going     to ask you what in the past i scorned to do i am going to ask     you to marry me      i could not hope to make you understand all that i have     suffered during these last few months of my illness i would     not if i could it is not worth while my father although     he knows that i am dying will scarcely speak to me he has     forgotten that i am his daughter save when he laments it     he sits alone day by day brooding upon the dishonour of his     race the priest who prays for me speaks words of doubtful     comfort as though after all he doubted whether salvation     were possible for me the horror of it all has entered into my     soul the sin of the past is ever before my eyesblack and     threateningand a great desolation reigns in my heart      and from it all i turn to you martin to save me you can do     it you only you lose nothing you risk nothing and you will     throw some faint light of consolation upon this my dreary     passage through the shadowland of death once you loved me     far off and dim though that time may seem to you you would be     faithful always you swore as side by side we stood on board     your yacht on the night of our flight and watched the shores     of cruta grow dimmer and dimmer and the whitefaced dawn     break quivering upon the waters you would be faithful always     the words come back to me as i lie here in this great dreary     bedchamber with a coldfaced priest muttering comfortless     prayers by my side dying alone without a single kindly face     to lighten my passage to the grave yet do not read this as     a reproach read it only as the prelude to this my last appeal     to you marry me martin it would cost you so little just     a hurried journey here a few sentences over my bedside a     weeks waiting at the most and you could see me in my grave     and feel yourself free again is it too great a thing to do     to make light the heart of a dying woman i pray god that you     may not think so you have generosity i appeal to it come     i beseech you it is the prayer of a dying woman i summon you     to cruta                                             irene  back again in the meshes of my old sin the letter fluttered down from between my fingers on to the floor and i stood with folded arms and bowed head arraigned at the bar of my own judgment i had marred a girls fair young life the memory of those old daysmy passionate persuasions and prayersswept in upon me yes she had trusted me and i had deceived her her sin and her death lay at my door the hideous rascality of the thing oppressed me i had been false to my name and traditions  a cold low voice from the other end of the room broke in upon my surging thoughts it was count hirsfeld who spoke  forgive me for disturbing your doubtless pleasant reflections but time flies and time is very precious to me just now i await your answer  it is not necessary i replied i shall be at cruta before you     chapter xxvi  late thou comest cruel thou hast been   i sped through england and across the continent southwards as fast as express train and steamer could carry me count hirsfeld shared the special which carried me from our nearest country station to the great northern junction from whence the scotch mail bore us to london here we parted company travelling the remainder of the way separately on the evening of the second day the steamer which i had hired at palermo dropped anchor in the bay of cruta under the shadow of the grim black castle and a small rowingboat landed me beneath the cliffs before night fell  i made my way up the narrow winding path alone and passing across the paved courtyard rang the hoarse brazen bell at the principal entrance a servant bearing a torch had opened the door and was beckoning me to follow him long before its echoes had died away  mademoiselle irene i asked him in a hushed anxious tone she lives  she lives he repeated sombrely  i followed him along the wide stone corridors and up countless steps at last he paused before a door and after listening for a moment knocked softly at it  it was opened by a monk whose face was hidden by the folds of his deep cowl he motioned me to enter and immediately closed the door  i found myself in a spacious lofty bedchamber bare and dimly lit facing me two pale solemnvisaged monks stood on either side of a drawn curtain as though guarding the plain iron bed which lay beyond and towards which i had taken one impulsive step forward their presence and an indefinable gloombeyond even the gloom of a chamber of deathwhich in the dim twilight seemed to hang about the very air of the place chilled me there was little furniture and no pictures hung upon the walls save a wooden cross near the foot of the bed before which two candles were burning i looked around for some one to whom i could address myself but there was no one beyond these darkcoated silent monks who seemed more like shadows from another world  while i stood in the middle of the room hesitating the priest who had admitted me passed by and took up his station at the foot of the bed he motioned me to stand a little nearer and suddenly the drear silence of the room was broken by the low monotonous chant of prayers i bowed my head and kneeling by the bedside i took up the responses and once for a moment clasped the white cold hand which lay upon the coverlet and which was all that i could see of the woman whom i was making my wife  the ceremony seems to me now like some fardistant dream of which i retain only the vaguest recollection when it was all over i laid my hand upon the curtain to draw it back but the monk nearest to me held my hand in a viselike grip and before i could move a voice from the other end of the room where the shadows were deepest arrested me  touch that curtain or dare to look upon my daughters face martin de vaux and you die for her souls sake i have permitted this now go  i peered through the darkness and i saw the tall gaunt frame of the count of cruta standing near the entrance i hesitated for a moment  irene is my wife i answered i offer no excuse to you for my conduct but at least i have the right to try and win her forgiveness  he moved a step forward and his voice shook with passion you have no rights you are dishonoured you are a villain what you to reason with me under my own roof away out of my sight lest i forget my word and deal you out your deserts  my heart was hot with shame and anger but i lingered let her speak i answered pointing to the bed it is she against whom i have sinned and her word i will obey irene may i not stay by your side tell me that you forgive  i clutched passionately at the curtain resolved to tear it aside and plead with irene upon my knees but i was held from behind in a strong viselike grasp and one of the monks who stood there on guard sternly wrested the curtain from my hands  away with him cried the count his voice shaking with passion rudolph do you hear  i nerved myself for a struggle but in that moments pause a thin white hand stole from behind the curtain and held mine for a moment  martin go quickly said a faint weak voice so altered that i scarcely recognised it as the voice of irene it is my wishmy command  one word irene i cried struggling to free myself just one word  farewell  irene you are my wife have you nothing else to say to me  farewell  there was no sweetness no regret in that single word i bowed my head in despair and went                                       there was a long pause father adrian was leaning back in his chair with halfclosed eyes as though exhausted paul standing opposite to him motionless and silent as a figure of stone was listening to every word with grave anxious face  will you hear the rest of the story now the priest asked after a prolonged silence  paul bowed his head i am waiting he said simply  i will continue then in your fathers own words as near as possible this is what he told me  i lingered in the island for several days staying at the monastery unwilling to go away and yet frustrated in every attempt i made to enter the castle on the fourth day at sunrise i was awakened suddenly by the deep tolling of the castle bell i dressed hastily and hurried up there but i was thrust from the door and forbidden to enter i learned the truth however from one of the servants irene was dead on the next day i saw the little funeral procession start from the castle and directly they entered the grounds of the monastery i joined them the old count bowed and aged with grief stayed the ceremony and bade them with a sudden flash of his old anger thrust me from the place but the priest by whose side i had taken my stand raised his hand and forbade them to touch me i was in sanctuarymy feet were on holy groundand though the count of cruta and count hirsfeld who knelt by his side trembled with anger at my presence i remained and on my knees by my wifes grave i uttered the first prayer my lips had framed since childhood through the pine trees which fringed the cliffs i could see the path where she and i had met in the days when i was her fathers guest and when i had knelt at her feet a passionate lover the sunlight flashed upon the blue waters below and the seabirds flew screaming around our heads it was all just as it had been in the old days the same for me but never more for her the long black coffin was lowered into the grave and reverently count hirsfeld stepped forward and covered it with armfuls of exquisite white flowers whose perfume made faint the odorous air and i had no flowers to throw nothing but the tribute of a passionate grief and a heart wellnigh broken with sorrow and remorse  the ceremony was over and the blackrobed monks and priest had passed away in a long solemn procession her father count hirsfeld and i remained there alone and over irenes grave i leaned forward speaking gently and humbly to him praying for one word of forgiveness his only answer was a look of scorn and he turned away from me with loathing he would not hear me speak to him i was his daughters murderer  i left the island that night and returned to england for several years i lived a very retired life attending to my duties upon the estate and seldom travelling beyond it the memory of irene seemed to haunt me but as time went on a change came over my spirits i was young and although i still bitterly regretted the past its influence became weaker and weaker what was done could not be undone such reparation as was possible i had made brooding over my sin would never make it the less i reasoned thus with myself and the final result was inevitable i commenced to mix more with my fellows to look up my old friends in townin fact to take up again the threads of my life which i had once regarded as broken for ever  after a while i married and then more than ever irene and that portion of my past which was bound up with her seemed like some vague fardistant nightmare fast assuming a very remote place in my thoughts i loved my wife as i had never loved irene and for a time i was intensely happy a son was born to me and in my joy i feasted half the county at vaux abbey i had desired nothing so much as this for the de vaux estates and mines immense as they are are all strictly entailed a son was wanted to complete my happiness and a son i had but already although i knew it not a storm was gathering for me  it was about a fortnight after the festivities and i had just come in with some friends from an afternoons shooting when i was told that a gentleman from abroadthe servant believedwas waiting to see me in the library even as he spoke the words i seemed to know who it was my heart sank and the presentiment of some coming evil was strong upon me i hesitated and then feverishly anxious to know the worst i turned away with some careless excuse to my guests and entered the library  it was count hirsfeld who stood there waiting for my arrival with a calm evil smile upon his lips which instinctively i felt to be the herald of some coming trouble for me yet my courage did not altogether desert me  count hirsfeld your presence here demands an immediate explanation i said sternly had i been at home you would not have been admitted  i come he answered slowly with his eyes fixed steadily upon my face as an ambassador from your wife  from my wife i repeated you do not know her what do you mean  he shrugged his shoulders i regret that my meaning is not clear he said i repeat that i come as an ambassador from your wife irene de vaux i have brought you a message from her  a message from the dead i gasped  dead by no means he answered with a slow cruel smile irene is living is it possible that you did not know it     chapter xxvii  grim figures traced by sorrows fiery hand   the lamp which stood on pauls writingtable had gone out and only a few dull red embers remained in the grate by moving a single yard backwards paul was almost lost in the deep shadows which hung about the room whilst such light as there was fell directly upon the priests pale face during those last few moments his voice had grown a shade more solemnmore intense paul who stood looking out at him from the darkness with dazed senses like a man in a dream never doubted for an instant although perhaps he scarcely realized the full meaning of the story to which he was listening  it must have been in this very room father adrian continued looking around him that your father and count hirsfeld stood face to face but you are naturally impatient i will take up the story again in your fathers own words to me                                       it was several moments before i could collect myself sufficiently to answer count hirsfeld everything seemed dim and unreal around me only that calm mocking face remained steadfast and his words rang in my ears  it is a lie i gasped we stood together by her grave she is dead  the calmness suddenly vanished from my tormentors face and manner his eyes were ablaze with mingled triumph and hate you thought so you poor fool he hissed out at me across the table bah you were a fool you were easily deceived listen  you thought it a light thing to carry off the only daughter of the last count of cruta twas easily done no doubt but you made for yourself enemies of men from whose vengeance you were bound to suffer one was the count whose daughter you had dishonoured and whose proud name you disgraced the other was myself the man whom she was to have marriedmyself who loved her do you think that because i did not seek you out and shoot you as you deserved that i forgot there were men on the island who loved their lord and who at the word from him would have hunted you down and murdered you if he restrained them do you imagine he was willing to bear this great dishonour without striking a blow bah it was my word that said wait my counsel which saved you from death as too light a punishment there is another way i said so we waited  it was my persuasions which induced irene to leave you and return to her father it was i who pointed out to her your great selfishness and raised in her the longing for revenge it was i who laid the plot into which you fell  a few words more it is all so simple irene was about to become a mother and you believing her to be on her deathbed married her the child was born on the next dayyour son and heir meanwhile irenes waiting maid who had been for long in a consumption died it was her funeral which you attended with such interesting penitence irene herself was fast recovering she was never in any real danger she lives with her old father and the boy lives with her we waited we read of your marriage and the count cried let us strike but i said no let us wait time went on we read again of the birth of a son and heir to you and of the great rejoicings irene held your boy in her arms and she frowned go now she commanded tell martin de vaux that his son and heir is here and his wife is here tell him that they are weary of his absence so i came  there was a dead silence my throat and lips were dry i could not speak count hirsfeld watched me with folded arms it was his vengeance  it is not true i stammered out at last i will not believe it irene is dead  i tried to speak confidently but i failed in my heart i believed the count  he shrugged his shoulders you have reason he remarked why should you believe me come to cruta and you will see for yourself you can see the headstone at the foot of the grave sacred to the memory of marie faithful servant of irene of cruta you can see the doctor who attended her and your wife at the same time better still you can see your wife and your infant son what do you say  i will not go i cried passionately i will not see them it was base treachery  one must use the weapons of craft against villains he said there is no baseness to equal yours you are repaid in your own coin that is all  i sank into a chair the insult moved me to no fit of anger i was numbed  if this be true i asked what does irene ask for i will not go back to her or see her or acknowledge her in any way she can have money that is all  naturally she requires an allowance count hirsfeld answered and a large one to enable her to bring up her son in accordance with his position  she shall have the allowance she shall have what she asks for i declared but i will never acknowledge the boy or her if he takes the name of de vaux or forces himself upon me in any way it shall be open war the english courts will annul that marriage  i think not he answered coolly besides you married into a noble family did you nota dukes daughter how pleasant her position would be while such a case was being tried and your son  i stopped him angrily i repeat that i will not acknowledge them money they can have and the boys future shall be my care but not if he ever dares to call himself de vaux  the count shrugged his shoulders i am but an ambassador he said i will convey what you have said to your wife you shall hear her decision  he went away and for a fortnight i was left in misery at the end of that time i had a letter signed irene it was cold and short it told me that so far as she herself was concerned she had no desire or intention of claiming her position as my wife all she demanded was an allowance to be paid to her order at a certain bank in palermo at regular intervals for the support of herself and for the proper education and bringing up of her son as to his future she could not pledge herself to anything for when the time came he should decide for himself she would bring him up in ignorance but on his twentyfifth birthday she should tell him the whole story and place all the necessary papers in his hands if he chose to use them and claim the de vaux estates he would easily be able to do so if on the other hand he decided to remain as he was she should not attempt in any way to alter his decision  the letter was a great relief to me fiveandtwenty years was a long respite the boy might diea thousand things might happen before then at any rate i was enough of a philosopher to seal down that secret page in my history and to live as though it had never existed  fiveandtwenty years is a long time but it passed away it is the portion of my life which i look back upon with the most pleasure i did my utmost to atone for a wasted youth and in some measure i succeeded my fears had grown fainter and fainter and when the blow came it was like a thunderbolt falling from a clear sky one morning i received a letter in irenes writing a little fainter and less firm than of old but still familiar to me it contained only a few lines she had told her son all and he elected to assert his rightful name and position in future he intended to call himself de vaux and on my death he would claim the estates  i read the letter and determined on instant action in a week my son paul and i were on board my yacht starting for the mediterranean we made for palermo and here we separatedpaul at all hazard to find count hirsfeld to whom i made a splendid offer if he would aid me in inducing irene to change her purpose i for cruta to see irene                                       this is almost the end of your fathers confession to me father adrian continued at cruta he sought the hospitality of the monastery where he was taken ill he wrote an urgent letter to you and immediately he was able to walk he went up to the castle i have already told you of the manner of return of that visit he told me scarcely anything and he told me nothing at all concerning the wound which he received there only i gathered that he was more than ever anxious to see count hirsfeld it was while waiting for your return that he made this confession to me i have finished                                       the white morning light was stealing into the room through the uncurtained windows the fire had burnt out and there was only a handful of ashes in the grate outside in the park a grey mist was hanging about in the hollows and over the treetops and something of its damp chilliness seemed to have found its way into the apartment paul who had been leaning heavily upon the mantelpiece with his head buried in his hands looked up and shivered then he glanced quickly across towards the opposite easychair father adrian was still there and at pauls movement he rose to his feet  this has been a terrible night for you i fear he said quietly i am sorry to have given you so much pain if i could i would have spared you  i thank you paul answered wearily it was right that i should know why did you not tell me at cruta  it seemed to me that your fathers death was enough for you to bear perhaps i was wrong  paul made no answer his thoughts seemed suddenly to have travelled far away father adrian watched his pale stricken face with cold pitiless eyes  you are weary he said softly i shall leave you now but i have something more to say to you on this matter it is no part of your fathers confession it is from myself can i come tomorrow or the next day  come in a week paul answered i shall be able to talk calmly then about this  father adrian hesitated a week well let it be so then farewell     chapter xxviii  adreas diary      spring blossoms on the land and anguish in the heart   tonight i shall close my diary for a long while very likely for ever i am heartily thankful for it these last few days have been so wretched full of so much miserable uncertainty that their record has grown to be a wearisome task it has ceased to give me any relief it has become nothing but a burden how could it be otherwise when the days themselves have been so grey so full of shadows and disappointments you have been a relief to me sometimes my silent friend but what lies before me is not to be recorded in your pages  twentyfour hours have passed since i made my last entry it was night then and it is night now all that lies between seems phantasmagoric and unreal i ask myself whether it has really happened and when the days events rise slowly up before my memory i almost fail to recognise them yet i have but to close my eyes and lean back and it all crowds in upon me in the future i know that this day will stand out clear and distinct from all the rest of my life  it was early in the morning when i started for vaux abbey across the moorland road so long have i seen this bleak county wrapped in mists and sea fogs that today i scarcely recognised it there was a clear blue sky streaked with little patches of white windswept clouds and the sunactually the sunwas shining brilliantly how it changed everything the grey hungry sea which i had never been able to look upon without a shudder seemed to have caught the colouring of the sky and a million little scintillations of glistening light rose and fell at every moment on the bosom of the tiny whitecrested waves and the moorland too was transformed its bare rockstrewn undulations lost all their harshness of outline and colouring in the sweet glancing sunlight and afar off the line of rugged hills which i had never seen save with their heads wreathed in a cloud of white mist stood out clear and distinct against the distant horizon tinged with a dim purple light  why did it all make such an impression upon me i wonder i cannot say but nothing in all my life ever struck so deep a note of sadness i feel it now i shall feel it always there was madness in my blood when i started i think but before my walk was half over it had increased a thousandfold every little sound and sight seemed to aggravate it i missed the dull sighing and moaning of the wind in the black copsesa sound which had somehow endeared itself to me during these last few daysand in its place the soft murmur of what seemed almost a summer breeze amongst the tall pinetops stirred in me an unreasonable anger the face of the whole country seemed smiling at me what mockery what right had the earth to rejoice when grief and anxiety were driving me mad for it was indeed a sort of madness which laid hold of me i clenched my hands and muttered to myself as i walked swiftly along the road was deserted and i met no one once a dark bush away off seemed to me to take a mans shape i stopped short could it be father adrian returning to the abbey i felt my breath come quickly as i stood there waiting the idea excited me i found myself trembling with a passion that was not of fear and suddenly stooping down i picked up a sharp flint and grasped it tightly between my fingers then i moved stealthily on and the thing defined itself after all it was only a bush not a man at all i tossed my weapon on one side with a strained little laugh the sense of excitement passed away but it left an odd flavour behind it i found myself deliberating as to what i had meant to do with that stone if it had really been father adrian and if i had succeeded in stealing silently up behind him perhaps i scarcely realized my full intention but a dim sense of it remained with me it was the development of a new instinct born of this swiftlybuiltup hatred i have my reasons for writing of this i wish to distinctly mark the period of the event which i have just recorded  there was no fear of my mistaking the way to vaux abbey for it stood upon a hill and had been within sight ever since i had taken the moorland road i was unused to walking and the road was rough but i do not remember once feeling in any way fatigued or footsore although one of my shoes had a great hole in it and was almost in strips my mind was too full of the end of my journey to be conscious of such things i had only one fear that i should be too late that somehow the threatened blow would have been struck and paul in some way removed from me it was fear more than hope which buoyed me up but anyhow it answered its purpose for in less than three hours after i had started i found myself before the great halldoor of vaux abbey  a deep hollow peal followed my nerveless little pull at the chain bellrope and almost immediately the door opened a greyhaired manservant in black livery looked down at me in surprise  i wish to see mr paul de vaux i announced is he in  the man hesitated i believe so miss he said doubtfully but he is engaged on some important business and has given orders that no one is to disturb him lady de vaux is at home  my business is with mr paul de vaux i said will you tell him that it is some one from the hermitage and i think that he will see me  the man did not answer me in words but motioned me to follow him my courage was failing me a little and i was certainly inclined not to look around but nevertheless the place made an impression on me the great hall which we were crossing was like the interior of some richly decorated church the ceiling was domeshaped and the base of the cupola was surrounded by stained glass windows which cast a dim light down upon the interior the white stone flags were here and there covered by eastern rugs thrown carelessly down but for the most part were bare and as slippery as marble so slippery that once i nearly fell and only saved myself by catching at an oak bench just as i recovered myself i saw the figure of a woman descending the huge double oak staircase which terminated opposite to us my guide paused when he saw her and i was also compelled to  here is her ladyship he said  i watched her slowly advance toward us a fine stately old lady carrying herself with unmistakable dignity although she was forced to lean a good deal on a goldmounted black ebony stick and as i looked at her i thought of father adrians words i can break his mothers heart and i leant eagerly forward in the chastened twilight with my eyes anxiously fixed upon her she came slowly on towards me and when she was a few yards away she spoke to the servant  does this young lady wish to see me richards  she spoke to the man but she looked towards me and evidently expected me to address her for a moment i could not a little gasp of relief had quivered upon my lips and my eyes were suddenly dim to look into lady de vauxs face stately calm and kind seemed like a strong antidote to my fears of father adrian it was quite evident that nothing unexpected had happened during the last twentyfour hours father adrians threat had been an empty one in the presence of lady de vaux the fears which had been consuming me departed she was so unmoved so indifferent how could a little jesuit priest hurt such a one as she  the thoughts chased one another quickly through my mind but still my hesitation was apparent after waiting in vain for me to speak the servant who was conducting me answered lady de vauxs question  the young lady asked for mr paul your ladyship it was doubtful whether i might disturb him  for mr paul lady de vaux looked at me leaning forward on her stick and with her eyebrows a little uplifted my son is particularly engaged and has left word that he does not wish to be disturbed for several hours she said if you have anything to say to him you can say it to me i am lady de vaux  thank you i must wait and see your son i answered  she moved away with a slight and distinctly haughty inclination of her head you can show this young lady into the waitingroom richards she directed take her name in to mr paul when he rings by the bye she added pausing in her slow progress over the hall and looking me once more steadily in the face what is your name  you would not know it i answered i have come from the hermitagenear here  she did not speak to me for a moment but i saw the colour rising into her cheeks and her fingers were trembling it was foolish of me to have told her a glance into her face showed me that she had heard something she knew something of me she was looking at me as at some object almost beneath her contempt yet she spoke quite calmly  you are adrea kiros the dancing girl  i answered her quite coollyi believe respectfully she was pauls mother yet i could see that she was going to be very rude to me  you can have nothing to say to my son she declared it is infamous that you should have followed him hereto his own house be so good as to quit it at once mr de vaux shall be informed later of the honour of your visit and if he has anything to say to you he can find other means save an interview under this roof richards  she pointed across the hall towards the entrance i stood quite still struggling with my passion if she had been any other woman i should have struck her across the lips  i shall remain i answered i am here to see mr de vaux i shall see him dont dare to touch me man i added fiercely as richards laid his hand upon my shoulder  he shrank back hastily i even believe that he muttered an apology perhaps they saw that i was not to be trifled with for lady de vaux suddenly changed her tactics  follow me she said sweeping round with an imperious gesture you shall see my son you shall hear from his own lips what he thinks of thisintrusion perhaps you will leave the abbey at his bidding if not at mine  i followed her in silence carrying myself proudly but with fastbeating heart what would he think of my coming would he call it an intrusion at any rate he could not be pleased for even if he received me kindly he would have his mothers anger to face yet how could i have kept away  we halted all three of us before a closed door at the back of the hall there was no answer to the mans somewhat ostentatious knock and lady de vaux after a moments waiting turned the handle of the door and swept into the room i kept close behind her  i can remember it now i shall always remember itthe dim peculiar light which tired our eyes the moment we had stepped inside it was easy to discover the reason the heavy velvet curtains were still drawn in front of the high windows and on a distant table a lamp was only just flickering out at first it seemed as though the great chamber was empty there was no one to be seen and it was not until we reached a deep recess at the further end that we discovered paul  at the sight of him we both stood stilllady de vaux moved in spite of her stately composure and i spellbound he was sitting before an oak writing desk covered with papers and in the midst of them his head was resting upon his bowed arms he neither spoke nor moved nor seemed indeed in any way conscious of our approach the window fronting him was unlike all the others uncurtained and wide open and a flood of sunshine was streaming in upon his bowed head and mingling with the sicklier light of the rest of the apartment it was a strange and ghastly combination not only in itself but in the sort of halo it seemed to cast around his dark bowed head ah paul my love my love how my heart ached for you  he is asleep lady de vaux said fearfully paul  i held out my hand to check her let him alone i whispered hoarsely i will go away dont you see that he is resting  she took no notice of me nor of my backward movement but leaned over towards him as though to touch his arm a sort of fury came upon me i knew that the paul whom she was trying to recall from the land of unconsciousness would never again be the paul of the past father adrian had kept his word the blow which he had threatened had fallen paul i looked at your dear bowed head until the tears dimmed my eyes and the great room swam around me for in my heart i felt that it was i who had brought this thing upon you i who could have saved you by a single word  paul wake up it is i your mother  i snatched hold of her hand and drew it away let him rest i cried fiercely he will waken soon enough  she looked at me in dignified astonishment how dare you presume to dictate to me in this fashion she exclaimed and why should he not be awakened it is past midday paul  the crouching figure moved he had heard then i held my breath longing to escape yet compelled to watch with fascinated eyes the rising of that bowed head there was no start or hurried awakening if indeed he had been asleep at all he simply turned his head and looked at us with surprise without any emotion of any sort  i hid my face in my hands and sobbed lady de vaux was silent with horror for there was something inexpressibly awfully moving in the silent passionless sorrow which seemed written with an unsparing hand onto that white face all combativeness had passed away but resignation had not come to take its place and apart from the outward evidence of the agony through which he had passed its physical traces were very apparent deep black lines seemed furrowed into the flesh under his dull eyes and the firm handsome mouth was drawn and quivering it was such a change as might have been worked by some deadly eastern poison eating away the corporal frame to think that it had worked from withinthat burning and terrible sorrow had caused itwas horrible  lady de vaux was the first to speak the icy composure of her manner was gone her voice was strained and anxious  why paul what have you been doing here all night do you know that it is past midday has anything happened are you ill  ill no i think not he seemed to be speaking from a great way off nothing about him was natural he was on his feet but i expected every moment to see him reel and fall  but paul what have you been doingwriting lady de vaux asked anxiously then as though warned by his strange appearance she checked his mechanical answer never mind never mind you are tired i can see wont you go and lie down for awhile come i will go with you  she had forgotten me until she found that he paid no heed to her words that his eyes travelled past her and remained fixed upon me then she turned swiftly upon me  you had better go she said in a low imperative whisper ask them to show you into my room and wait there for me  i took no notice of her my eyes were fixed upon paul i felt that he was going to speak to me and he did  adrea adrea he said slowly how is it that you are here you did not come with him did you no no of course not and yet how is it that you are here  i feared father adrian and his threats and i was alone quite alone andand i could bear it no longer i was obliged to come  his face grew a trifle more animated i could see that he was recovering the dumb stupor which had held his features rigid was passing away  yes i am glad you are here i want to talk to you i had some important business which kept me writing here all night and must have fallen asleep i will go and change my things and come back to you  he looked down at his crumpled shirtfront and disordered tie and then moved slowly towards the door lady de vaux hesitated for a moment with a dark frown upon her face and then laid her hand upon his arm  your explanation should surely have been addressed to me paul she said coldly who is this young lady  she is a friend of mine paul answered and  i heard you call her adrea lady de vaux continued may i ask whether it is indeed miss adrea kiros  i have told you that is my name lady de vaux i answered promptly you have possibly heard of me  lady de vaux turned her back upon both of us and left the room without a word     chapter xxix  adreas diary      love blossoming in the roses holds a dagger in her hands   we were alone paul and i in that great solemn room full of pale phantomlike lights and quivering shadows he was standing a few yards away from me with his head half averted and his eyes full of a great hopeless despair in silence i approached him and took his deathcold hand in mine  it is no matter i whispered i do not care for your mother her words are nothing i will not leave younot till you tell me everything  everything he echoed the word and looked at me helplessly everything tell you everything  suddenly there was a change the numbed helpless look left his face and his features were relaxed he was himself again a strong brave man only shaken by the storm  adrea forgive me did you think that i was going mad i have had a terrible shock and i have been up all night listening to a story which brings great suffering and misery upon me  his eyes had suddenly a faraway look in them so sad that i felt the tears rush into mine i pressed his hand to let him know that i understood but i kept my face turned from him ah love is a strange thing indeed if i had not cared paul i could have sympathised with you so nicely and made so many pretty speeches but i love you and it made me feel very strange and solemn i had nothing to say my heart was too full did you understand i wonder will you ever understand paul my love my love it is so sweet to say that over and over to myself in this dark chamber where there is no one to hear me or to see me looking so foolish you make me feel so different paul that is because you yourself are so different from all the men i know from all the men i have ever seen  we stood there quite silent for some moments then he drew a quick stifled breath and caught hold of my hands i cannot breathe in this place he said looking half fearfully around the very air seems tainted with that horrible story and its ghosts are lurking in every corner  let me draw the curtains i whispered the sunlight will banish them you are dazed  he held my hand tightly and drew me towards the window never mind the curtains we will go out out over the moor  he was feverishly impatient to be gone but i held him back your clothes i reminded him and you have no hat  he looked down doubtfully at his disordered evening dress and then released my hands wait for me here he begged promise that you will not go away that nothing shall make you go  i promised  see i shall lock the door he continued as he reached the threshold no one can come in and disturb you  please to have some tea and a bath i begged i do not mind waiting you will be ill if you do not mind  he was gone about half an hour once some one came and tried the door but i took no notice at last i heard the key turn in the lock and he entered did you think that i was long he asked coming up to me with a smile  i shook my head my eyes were full of tears and there was a lump in my throat i could not speak he had changed all his clothes and was carefully dressed in a brown tweed shooting suit and gaiters but the correctness and order of his external appearance seemed only to emphasize the ravages which one single nights suffering had wrought upon his strong handsome face hard cruel lines had furrowed their way across his forehead and under his eyes were deep black marks his bronze cheeks were white and sunken and a bright red spot burned on one of them but it was a change of which the details could give no idea his face had caught the inflection of his inward agony and retained it it was there if not for the world to see at any rate terribly evident to me to those who loved him  he was quite calm now however it was as though the fires of suffering had burnt themselves out leaving behind them a silent charred desolation he took my arm and together we left the room passing through the high french windows and along an open terrace until we reached the gardens we turned down a broad walk bordered by high yew hedges at the bottom of which was a little gate leading into the park the air was fragrant with the perfume of violets and early stocks and hyacinths mingled every now and then with a more delicate perfume from the greenhouses on the other side of the redbrick wall how beautiful it all seemed in that sweet dancing sunlightthe songs of the birds the blossoming fruittrees and pinkbudded chestnuts the scents which floated about on the soft west breeze and the constant humming of bees and other winged insects only in england could there have been so sudden a change from the grey mists and leaden skies of yesterday even in that moment of extreme tension i could not help an exclamation of admiration as we came to an end of the gravelled walk and paul held open for me a little iron gate  how beautiful your home is i cried how you must love it  a look almost of agony passed across his face it came and went in a moment yes i love it he answered but it is not my home henceforth i have no home i may well be thankful that i have even a name  i looked at him waiting for an explanation but he walked on in silence it was not until we were halfway across the park that i spoke i do not understand i said softly will you not tell me something of your trouble  i would that i could adrea he answered his voice was so gentle and yet his face was so stern but no i cannot it is a secret it is only a blotted page of our family history made clear to me but it alters everything  does it make you poorer i asked falteringly  he looked down in my eyes bravely but his voice shook as he answered if it be trueas i scarcely doubtit takes from me everything my money my home my future it brings everything but disgrace upon us adrea and even that must touch our name even though the living are spared the memory of the dead must suffer  i felt the tears flowing down my cheeks but i dashed them away i do not understand i  of course not and i cannot explain yet it is simple i have an elder brother of whom i never heard to whom everything belongs i am going to find him  where is he i cried he shook his head that i cannot tell father adrian knows but he will not speak i am going in search of him myself i am going to cruta  to cruta the name rang in my ears and earth and trees and sky seemed reeling before me then i clutched him by the arm and cried out hysterically  you shall not go there the place is horrible you shall not go  he stood still and looked at me in wonderment we had crossed the park now and were on the edge of the bare moorland his figure alone stood out in solitary relief against the sky i was half mad with fear and dismay he did not understand how could he  it is at cruta that i can learn all that there still is for me to learn he said i shall start for there tonight  oh it was horrible what could i say how was i to stop him how much dare i tell i caught hold of his hands and held them tightly  paul i want to ask you something when you heard from the convent that relations had claimed me and taken me away and then a year afterwards you found me therein londona dancing girl what did you think  he answered me at once and without hesitation i thought that you had misled the lady superiorthat you were weary of your life there and had run away  i shook my head i knew that you thought so and i never denied it but it was not so i was not unhappy at the convent but one day i was sent for and bidden prepare for a journey some relatives had sent for me and i was to go and to where it was to cruta paul it was old count of cruta who claimed me i cannot tell you anything of the time i spent there shut up in the gloomy castle it was horrible beyond all words even the memory of it makes me shudder if only i could tell you but i must not i can tell you this though in less than six months i felt myself going mad and one night i stole down to the beach and unfastened a small boat and rowed away scarcely caring what happened to me so that i could but escape from that awful place it was a desperate chance i was out all day without food or water rowing and drifting until cruta lay like a speck in the distance then by chance i was picked up by an english yacht and they brought me to london i arrived there helpless and miserable and ah how lonely i dared not go back to the convent for fear i should be sent back to cruta there was only you i went to your bankers and they told me that you were abroadon the continent by chance they asked me there my name and by chance again i told them it truthfully they told me that they had money for me there i had only to sign a receipt and they gave me more than i asked forten times more then i remembered the address of an english girl who had been at the convent with me and she gave me a home for a time it was through her dancing mistress that i becamea dancing girl i have told you this paul because i want you to promise me not to go to cruta it is an evil place they are mad there promise me  he looked at me gravely and very tenderly but his tone was firm adrea it is necessary that i go there he said i cannot rest for a moment until i know for certain whether a story which i have just been told is a true one the proof lies in cruta it is no whim which is taking me there i must go  my heart was sick with dread yet what could i do i said nothing only i covered my face with my hands and wept  adrea you are a foolish child he said bending over me what is there for me to fear at cruta look up and tell me  i shook my head you would not heed me i answered sadly i dare not tell you but there is one thing i added hastily will you do it for me simply because i ask you  if it be possible yes  i stood still on a little hillock and faced him eagerly then do not go to cruta until tomorrow i begged it will make no difference to you  and what difference will it make to you he asked perplexed  never mind promise he hesitated for a moment with a frown on his forehead and his face turned seaward  well i will promise then  i caught hold of his hand and held it tightly you are very good to me i said allons let us move onward  we had reached the hermitage and i had spoken scarcely a single word of comfort an icy coldness seemed to have stolen into my heart i had ceased to think of paul or of my love there was something else another passion which made me blind yet i let him come in with me and yielded myself up for a while to the dream of loving and being loved by him while i lay in his arms with my head upon his shoulder and every now and then felt his light caressing touch upon my facewhy then the world for me was bounded by that little room and i had no thoughts which travelled outside it but it lasted only while he was with me when he stood up and said that he must go i did not seek to keep him  shall i come again he asked as we stood hand in hand before the door  i shook my head not tonight love i shall be better alone i am weary and i have my things to collect  i knew he would be surprised he withdrew his hand and manlike was almost angry i forgot you will leave here i suppose  i shrugged my shoulders what should keep me paul i could not live here alone every stone and tree would be full of barren memories no tomorrow i go to london i have sent all the servants away today except gomez you will be with me early  i will be outside your window before you are up he promised with a touch of gaiety in his tone see that gomez has breakfast for two  he passed down the avenue and out of sight i closed the door with a little shudder and turned round gomez was by my side through the gloom i could see that his dark eyes were full of fire and his olive features were set and grim  what do you want gomez i asked quickly  he drew close to my side the priest he muttered has hehas he dared  his breath was coming quickly he spoke english but slightly and in the excitement the words seemed to stick in his throat  i interrupted him he has told mr de vaux some strange horrible story what do you know of it  all all all i was therein the chamber my masters words to himi heard them all he has told then he has threatened oh if only i had known when he was here  the mans fierce face and gesture told their own tale i beckoned him to follow me into the room where paul and i had been sitting and closed the door  you were martin de vauxs faithful servant i said do you want to see his son driven from his home and robbed of his lands  the man moved his lips making a curious sound and drew a long gurgling breath he was shaking with excitement  who should do it  the priest i answered softly  because of the words the story of which my master spoke to him at his death in the monastery  yes because of that  ah he stole up to my side with a noiseless animal movement and whispered in my ear his eyes were burning his face was full of evil meaning yet i did not shrink from him i welcomed him with a smile he whispered into my ear it was like the hiss of a snake but i smiled i whispered back again he nodded ah the way before me was growing clear at last was it not fate that had brought gomez ready to my hand ay fate a good fate a kind fate we stood close together in that dimly lit room and though we were alone in the house we spoke in whispers to one another when i moved to the door gomez followed me  i came down in ten minutes clad in a long dark cloak with a small hat and a thick veil i took a stick from the rack and there was something else in my deep pocket  alone he whispered as i moved towards the door  alone i answered make a good fire in the drawingroom and let there be food and wine there  for two he asked with an evil smile  for two     chapter xxx  adreas diary      a land that is lonelier than a ruin   a cold twilight followed close upon the day the sky was strewn with dark clouds and a wild wind blew in my face i was on an unknown road and in all my life i had seen nothing so dreary  on one side about a hundred yards away was the sea on the other was a broken stretch of bare moorland covered with only the scantiest herbage and piles of barren grey rocks some were lying together in quaint grotesque shapes others stood out alone against the sky and broken fragments of all sizes covered the ground choking and destroying all vegetation there was no background of woods or trees there was nothing between that barren stony surface and the leaden sky what turf there had been had lost its colour and never a fragment of moss had grown upon one of those weatherbeaten boulders the sea air had stained them and the grey evening mists had rotted them until their surface was honeycombed with indentations but neither had softened or toned down their fierce ugliness even in the bright sunlight such a country as this must still have been a country of desolation and a light heart must sometimes have lost its gaiety and felt oppressed to me as i hurried along with the cold evening settling down around me that walk was horrible strange shadows seemed to dog my path and stalk solemnly along by my side footsteps seemed to follow behind me and every stone i dislodged made me start sometimes i fancied that i heard strange whisperings in my ears and i started round shivering and trembling to find myself alone once i stopped short was that a dead man in the way how my heart beat no it was only a long boulder of rock listen was not that the scream of a dying man my own voice raised in helpless terror drowned the sound and while i stood there ready to sink to the ground a great seagull came circling round my head and the blood flowed warm in my veins once more how sad and mournful was that solitary cry and slow hopeless flapping of the wings who was it said that the evil spirits of dead men dwell imprisoned in those sadcrying birds it was very very human that cry bah was i getting superstitious and fainthearted before my task was begun i set my teeth and stepped boldly onwards for a while i had no more fancies  throughout that hideous walk my whole imagination seemed coloured with a reflection of the purpose towards which i was tending i do not write this in any morbid fit few women have passed through what i have passed through fewer still have stopped to record their sensations it is strange that it should afford me any satisfaction to record them here but it is so i have begun and i must go on this part of my life is drawing rapidly to a close and with its close i shall seal this little book up and put it away for ever  the night grew darker and the road was fast becoming little more than a rude cattletrack a little distance ahead of me from some building as yet unseen a strong clear light was steadily burning save for it i might have feared that i had lost my way for as yet i had passed no sign of human habitation but that light was sufficient gomez had told me of it it was the light which burned always from dusk to morning from the tower of the monastery of st bernard                                       two things seemed strange to me or rather seem strange to me now when i look back upon that walk the first was my utter indifference to all physical pain there was a hole in my boot and i found afterwards that my foot must have been bleeding most of the time i never felt it i was conscious of neither pain nor fatigue the second thing which surprises me is that as i drew near to my journeys end i grew calmer i had no desire to draw back i had no fear the thing which was before me never assumed any definite shape it was therein the backgrounda dim floating purpose never once oppressing me never forcing its way forward in my mind for more definite consideration and only showing itself at all in a vague lurid glow which seemed to change even the shapes of all the gruesome surroundings of my dismal walk towards the end of my expedition this became even more marked my thoughts had recoiled from the present to the past vague pictures of the days that had gone by seemed floating before my eyes i saw myself in the convent garden with all my little world enclosed in those four walls and i heard the shrill laughter of the girls with whom i was walking and i even fancied that i could catch the perfume of the lilac trees which drooped over the smoothly kept lawn and then the picture faded away and from the vessels side i saw cruta a purpletopped island rising like some precious jewel from the sea i shuddered at the memory of that face which soon became a living dread to me and i heard again the passionate voice of a darkrobed man reading poetry and crushing with white nervous fingers the hyacinths whose odour was making the air faint i saw his white sad face in which the struggle of the man against himself was already bornborn alas in those long mornings by the sea at my unconscious bidding and soon cruta too faded away and you paul my love my dear dear love your face came to me almost my eyes closed almost i stayed here to dream ah how the magic of this love this wonderful love lightens my little world my heart is stirred to music my blood is dancing i am chilled no longer ah paul it is for you that i strike this blow for you that i tread this stony way it is sweet to think of it i go on as blithely as ever a village maiden stepped forward to her wedding the way is as sweet to me as a garden of roses your face too is dying out of my thoughts paul farewell farewell                                       the valley of the shadow of death did any one speak those words what an evil fancy yet the air seemed full of whisperings the valley of the shadow of death yes it might be that and these cold grey boulders the spirits of the evil ones risen up out of hades is there a hell i wonder how chill and dark the air seems there is death about                                       the sound of a single bell broke in upon my thoughts i raised my eyes my journey was accomplished before me was a grim stern building and attached to it a chapel it was the monastery of st bernard     chapter xxxi  adreas diary      farewell to the dead ashes of life   the path which i had been following led straight up to the bare arched door of the building i had reached it unmolested and rang the bell  what a hoarse clanging sound i shivered as i stood there listening to its gloomy echoes until they died away no one came the place seemed wrapped in an austere silence i listened but i could hear no sound within only the dull melancholy sighing of the wind amongst a sickly avenue of firs behind  i stretched out my hand and rang again almost before the echoes had died away i heard footsteps within a heavy bolt was withdrawn and a darkrobed monk stood on the threshold before me he recoiled for a moment at seeing a woman and i thought that he would have closed the door but he did not  what would you have at this hour sister he asked sternly the chapel is closed and morning is the time for dispensing charity  i have come in search of a priest who is only a visitor here i said father adrian he is called  he seemed still indisposed to admit me is your business urgent he asked doubtfully father adrian is at his devotions and must not be lightly disturbed  it is urgent i answered  he beckoned me to follow him and in silence led me a few yards down a bare stone corridor then he threw open the door of a small room and bade me enter  this is the guestchamber he said wait here and i will summon father adrian  he closed the door and disappeared the interior of the room in which he had left me was bare and chilling i turned from it to the window almost opposite was a small eminence and at its summit a rude cross of calvary a dark figure with clasped hands and bent head was slowly descending the path  even at that distance i thought i recognised the walk and as he came nearer i saw that he was wearing the ordinary garb of a roman catholic priest instead of the monks robes i stood close to the window watching him and as he crossed the open space before the door he raised his eyes and saw me how he started and how his eyes seemed to burn in their sockets doubtless he would have turned paler but he was already deathly white he stood there swaying from side to side with his eyes fastened wildly upon me as though an apparition had appeared before him then he took a quick step forward i heard the great front door creak and groan upon its hinges and almost as soon as i could turn round he was on the threshold before me  adrea adrea he cried in a low suppressed whisper which shook with passion you here what has happened stand in the light let me see your face  i moved a step towards him and raised my veil i am lonely i said softly was it very wrong of me to come here  he stood before me with hungry incredulous eyes fastened upon my face as though he would see through it into my false heart yet i did not flinch i was actress enough for my part i watched him tremblewatched the colour flush into his face and die away it was a very storm of passion which shook him before he could find the words to answer me  adrea adrea have you come here to mock me as you are a woman i implore you to spare me speak the truth  i answered him softly with my eyes fixed upon the ground i came because i was lonely let us go away from here come home with me  home with you home with you he repeated my invitation he scarcely seemed to understand  yes i was very silly the other day i did not understand you i did not understand myself and you see i have humbled myself very much i have come to tell you so am i forgiven  i raised my eyes to his and added in a half whisper wont you come home with me and read aloud as we used to on the rocks at cruta  he stood there as though fascinated i began to feel impatient but i dared not show any signs of it  suddenly he took a quick step towards me and before i could prevent it he had thrown himself at my feet on the cold stone floor and was holding my hands tightly in his  adrea he cried his voice choked with passion is this thing true my brain reels with the delight of it but oh forgive me if i seem to doubt i know nothing of women but surely your lips could never lie you are not mocking me oh adrea my love lift up your eyes and swear that this is no dream i am dizzy with joy speak to me let me look into your face i am not doubting you yet say it once more tell me it is not a dream  i lied to him with my face and with my eyes and with my lips it is no dream i said softly i have come to you adrian because i want you no one else would do  he stood up pale and shaken his voice was still full of deep throbbing earnestness adrea he cried today i have been fighting a grim fight look into my face and mark its traces i am desperate for hours i have knelt on what was once a hallowed spot in vain in vain on my knees before the cross of calvary i have striven to pray as a man wrestles for his life with the waves of a great ocean alas alas in the twilight i fancied always that your face was moving amongst the shadows and even the breeze which rustled in the shrubs around seemed ever to be murmuring your name oh my love my love sometimes i wonder that i have lived through the anguish of these days but it is over you have come to me and the evil days are past i renounce my priesthood it has become only a barren farce to me heaven or hell what matters it i leave here with you tonight never to return never never never  he pressed hot kisses upon my hands they stung me like molten lead but i did not withdraw them then he rose up and held out his arms to me with a great yearning stealing into his dark eyes but i kept him away  not here not here i cried i heard footsteps outside let us go  you are right he answered wait for me i have but few preparations to make  he left me and i breathed freely again i had no fears no hesitation i never dreamt of turning back but i began to find my task more difficult even than i had imagined it was his touch his passionate looks and words which were so hard to endure my lips could lie but it was hard to govern my looks and oh how i hated him  soon he was backtoo soon for me and then we left the place he had changed his clothes and to my surprise he wore an ordinary dark walking suit and a long ulster he had discarded the priest altogether  at the bend he looked back there was a rift in the clouds just behind the hill of calvary and the rude cross stood out vividly against the sky at last he murmured at last farewell to the dead ashes of life it is rest to have ended the struggle even to have fallen my new life is here  he touched my hand fondly and held it within his own how deathly cold your hand is adrea he said it is the night air you are well are you not he added anxiously  quite well only tired  he took my arm i could not resist him only i walked the more swiftly he tried to check me but i shook my head i am cold and tired i told him this desolate walk frightened me and even with you i think i am a little nervous let us hurry hark what was that  a bittern in the marshes why adrea how frightened you are it is not like you  i know it i answered but tonighttonight the air seems full of whisperings and strange sounds yes i am frightened  i shivered as i spoke he would have drawn me closer to him but i waved him away how could he know anything of the horrors of that walk for me strange phantoms seemed ever rising from the sea stalking across the path and away over the moor and passing and repassing grinning and whispering in my ear sometimes it seemed as though i could have touched them by stretching out my hand but when i tried my fingers closed upon thin air what were they why had they come to torment me was it because they scented an evil deed would they haunt me for ever like this what folly if i gave way so i should soon be altogether unnerved and my task was still before me i closed my eyes and opened them again they had gone it was good i had conquered                                       it was late and we had eaten and drunk together he was lying back in an easychair flushed and strange to say wonderfully handsome the hollows in his cheeks seemed suddenly filled up and his eyes were soft and bright i sat at his feet looking into the firelight  will you answer me some questions adrian i asked there has been so much mystery around us lately and like a woman i am curious  yes i will tell you anything he answered am i not your slave dearest only ask me them quickly there are many things i have to talk about what was that he added quickly is there any one else in this room  i shook my head no one it was fancy tell me who was madame de merteuill  my mother  your mother  yes and the old count of cruta is my grandfather madame de merteuill is his daughter but that is not her real name  there was a high screen just behind his chaira japanned one which seemed to have been badly used for there was a great hole in it while we had been talking a strange thing had happened a mans hand had slowly been thrust through and a crumpled piece of paper was dropped upon the carpet i moved to his side and raised the cushion in his chair before i could help it he had caught my face and pressed a hot burning kiss upon my cheek i dared not struggle i had to yield and endure for a moment his passionate embrace then i dropped my handkerchief upon the piece of paper and picked up both hastily  will you tell me something else please  anything you ask you know that i will  the de vaux estates  are mine i am the son of martin de vaux paul de vaux has no claim at all if i had remained in the church it was my intention to found a great monastery here but now  well  everything is yours  there was a moments silence i drew the piece of paper from my pocket as though by accident and read it to myself there were only a few hastily scrawled lines  i dare not do it i am afraid i will put the knife on the floor  i glanced towards the hole the hand was there holding a long gleaming dagger it laid it noiselessly upon the carpet and was withdrawn i went over to his side and knelt down there  and what will become of paul de vaux i asked  he laughed grimly he must take his chance he knows the whole story he has known since last night adrea tell me once more he pleaded you never loved him reallysay that you never did  are you jealous sir i asked lightly my left hand was wandering down his side ah there was his heart how it was beating my right hand was on the floor cautiously feeling its way towards the screen it reached the dagger i clutched it by the hilt now was the time there was his heart i knew the exact spot  adrea are you ill he asked how white and strange you look ah                                       it was done lucrezia borgia could not have bungled less he lay doubled up in the chair with a long genoese dagger buried in his heart and it was i who had done it  gomez crawled from behind the screen and looked first at him and then at me with protruding eyes he tried to speak but his teeth chattered  it is done i said calmly and you are saved paul my love i whispered to myself be a man gomez we must carry it into the wood lift him gently there must be no blood here  it took all our strength to move him and we had to drag him yard by yard down the avenue and across the road into the little wood  my pen is weary of horrors the memory of that hour is not to be written about but when he turned away i took the flowers which he had begged for from my corsage and threw them down amongst the wet leaves it was my sole moment of relenting     chapter xxxii  the lord of cruta   a strange figure stood on the edge of the castle cliff looking across the bay of cruta to the sea he was tall loose jointed and gaunt and the long grey beard and unkempt locks of flowing hair which streamed behind in the breeze showed that he was an old man but his eyes set back in deep hollows and fringed with long bushy grey lashes were still dark and piercing great passions had branded his face with deepset lines but had failed to belittle him on the contrary his presence though forbidding and awesome was full of latent strength and dignity to the islanders who never mentioned their lords name save with bated breath and after having zealously crossed themselves he was the object of the most unbounded superstition his personality and the strangeness of his habits appalled them they scarcely believed him a being of the same world as their own the most ignorant amongst them firmly believed that the sea obeyed his uplifted hand and that when he spoke the thunder rolled amongst the hills when stories were told of the mystery and strange isolation in which he lived they nodded their heads and were willing to believe everything no one ever met him or had speech with him for twenty years had passed since he had issued from the castle gates but sometimes most often when a storm was brewing they could see a tall dark figure standing on the giddy edge of the castle wall which overhung the sea or walking with slow stately movements up and down the narrow footpath at the summit of the cliff if the moon had risen or the sky were clear beyond they could see the huge gaunt figure outlined with grim distinctness against the empty background always with his face to the sea and with a long black cloak flowing behind it was not often that they saw him but when they did they told one another in whispers and though the sky were cloudless and the sea calm the women whose husbands were out in their fishing boats beyond the bay told their beads and prayed for their safe return and those who had remained behind prepared for rough weather once at a marriage feast when all the little village was making merry the whisper had gone about that the count was walking and immediately they had all departed for their homes in fear and silence and the luckless bride and bridegroom had hastened to the priest and besought him to unloose the knot that they might celebrate their wedding on some less illomened day  tonight the storm was already breaking when the count appeared on the castle wall and turned his face seaward one by one the fishing smacks were crossing the gathering line of surf and gaining the deep still waters of the bay as they passed underneath the towering mass of granite rock against the base of which the waters were boiling and seething the men in the boats gazed fearfully up at that black speck far away above their heads and crossed themselves the count had stood there for an hour they whispered ever since that piledup mass of angry lurid clouds had first gathered and a warning breath of wind had swept across the smooth glasslike surface of the water now troubled and restless not one of them doubted but that his coming had brought the storm but there was not one of them who dared to utter a word of complaint only they stood up in their boats and shielding their eyes with an uplifted hand from the fierce rays of the sinking sun gazed out seaward searching for the boats not yet in safety  suddenly a little murmur arose from amongst them and a word was passed from one to another of their little crafts the blinding glare of the sun and its reflection stretched far away across the surface of the sea had dazzled their eyes and for the last quarter of an hour they had seen nothing on the westward horizon but now the bright silver light was fading into a dull glorious purple and full upon its bosom a strange sail was seen making direct for the harbour the sunlight was still flashing upon its white sailslittle specks of gold upon a background of richer colouringand they saw that she was a handsome shapelylooking vessel very different to the dirty italian lugger which put in at their harbour for a few hours week by week  will she need a pilot cried francesco rising in his boat and watching the stranger let us wait here and see if she signals for one  let us all go there will be something for each cried another  we will race antonio answered whose boat was the fastest the first to reach her shall have the strangers money  no no that is not fair chorused the others we will draw lots  then up rose old guiseppe the father of them all he shook his head and turned a sorrowing face seawards peace children you are like chattering seabirds squabbling over a bait which will never be yours yonder ship will need no pilot she is no stranger to cruta  they looked at her and shook their heads we have never seen her before they said  some of you are too young to remember her the old man continued and you were all away when she was here within a twelvemonth ago but i know her three times has she entered this harbour and each time has she left sorrow and grief behind her it is the ship of the english lord who stole away the daughter of our count many years ago  there was a little murmur of suppressed wonder then as though moved by a common instinct every face was turned upward to the castle wall  the count had gone but even as they looked he reappeared leading another figure by the hand they held their breath with wonder no one had ever seen him there save alone and now a woman stood by his side they could see nothing of her save her long hair flowing in the breeze and the bare outline of her figure who was she guiseppe must know who was she they asked him eagerly  he shook his head better not ask he answered better not know strange things have happened up there it is not for us to chatter of them  one night as i sailed homeward antonio said in a low tone i heard strange cries from the castle the night was still and the breeze brought the sound to my ears they came from up above and when i strained my eyes i fancied that i could see a white figurethe figure of a womanstanding on the castle walls she was crying for help but suddenly as though a hand were placed over her mouth her cries ceased and the figure vanished it was three nights before the english lord died at the monastery  ferdinand stood up on that same night he said in a low hoarse whisper i saw a figure steal up the path to the castle it was the english lord on the morrow i traced him back again with drops of blood they led right into the monastery courtyard two days afterwards he died  silence all of you commanded guiseppe with shaking voice are these things to be spoken of thus openly know you not you children that the winds have ears and he listens there above us  it is a thousand feet muttered antonio to him our boats can seem only as specks upon the water  you fool answered guiseppe do you think that the man whose presence brings storm and wind upon us is like ordinary men do you think he cannot hear what he chooses  ave maria cried antonio crossing himself i would as soon face the devil himself as the count i shall ask father bernard to say a prayer for me tonight  do and i hope his penance will be a stiff one answered guiseppe grimly come let us trim our sails and get homeward the english ship will not want us and we can watch who lands from the beach  twould be no such bad thing if she struck on the rocks if she brings such ill luck to the castle muttered antonio as he unfurled the sail and grasped the tiller there would be some pickings for us beyond doubtsome pretty pickings     chapter xxxiii  the dawn of a short sweet life   the little group of fishing smacks homelylooking and uncleanly on close examination presented a very different appearance from the deck of the english yacht fast nearing the harbour their brown sails had gleamed purple in the dying sunlight and their rude outline seemed graceful and shapely as they rose and fell on the long waves paul who stood on the captains bridge of his yacht uttered a little cry of admiration as they sailed out from the shadows of the huge rock and fell into a rude semicircle across the bay  what colouring one sees in these southern waters he remarked did you notice the glinting light on those sails  his companion who was holding firmly the rail by his side looked up and smiled yes she said softly it is beautiful we have seen more beautiful things on this voyage i think than i ever saw before in my life i have never been so happy you are not angry with me now for coming are you  he looked down into her wistful upturned face and then away to the distant line where sea and sky met no i am not angry he said softly  adrea was very beautiful the fresh sea air and the southern sun had been as kind to her as to one of their own daughters only a very faint delicate shade of pink had stained her clear transparent skin harmonising exquisitely with the slight olive hue of her complexion the strong breeze had loosened the coils of her dark hair and it was waving and flowing in picturesque freedom about her face there was a change too in her appearance greater than any the wind or sun could effect her dark eyes were glowing with a new life and a soft wistful joy shone in her face those few days had been like heaven for her she had been alone for the first time with the man she loved sailing upon a sunlit sea hour after hour with his voice ever in her ears and his tall figure by her side the sense of his presence was ever upon her bringing with it a calm sweet restfulness a happiness beyond anything which she had ever imagined  and it was heaven too after hell thrust away in a dark corner of her memory was the recollection of a day and a night full of grim phantasmal horrors which were fast becoming little more than a dream to her the time was not yet come for remorse in that deep glow of passionate and selfforgetful devotion quickened now into fullest and sweetest life by his constant proximity even sin itself for his sake seemed justified to her everything too which lay behind her brief stay in that bare windswept country was fast assuming a far distant place in her thoughts it was such a change from her little rooms in grey street dainty and homelike though they had been from the brilliantly lit drawingrooms where she had performed and the same wearisome compliments ever in her ears the bonds of town life had always galled her she was an artist although she had denied it she had become subject to her environment but it had been an imprisonment nature was her mother and nature had claimed her now she knew it all she knew that she could never be a dancer again she had stolen out on to the deck each morning in her slippers and had seen the dawn break through the clouds and descend upon the quivering waters she had seen the eastern sky streaked with faint but marvellous colouring growing deeper and deeper until the suns rim had risen from out of the water grey had become mauve and white amber it was wonderful and by night she had leaned over the side of the yacht and looked up into a sky ablaze with trembling stars casting their golden reflections down upon the boundless waves which rose and fell beneathwaves which were sometimes green and sometimes golden in the wonderful phosphoric light which touched them with a weird splendour it was like the opening of a new world to adrea all that had gone before seemed harsh and artificial it was the dawn of a new life  paul had noticed the change to him it had appeared chiefly as an increased womanliness a gentle softness of speech and mannerism very charming and attractive those few days at sea together had been like a dream to him he had come on board as nearly brokenhearted as a strong man could be and fiercely anxious to reach his destination and know the whole cruel truth in a few hours all had been changed his sorrows seemed numbed he was no longer battling alone with his grief adrea knew all and as they sailed southwards together the sense of the present was strong enough to drive past and future from his thoughts the clouds cleared from his face and his heart was lightened it was adrea who had saved him from despair  he thought of this as she stood by his side and he answered her question before their eyes cruta was rising up from the sea the grim castle was there looking as old as the rocks on which it was perched the wide open harbour and the little fleet of fishing smacks the seabirds circled about their heads every moment brought the rocky little island more distinctly into view paul looked down into adreas face gravely  it is our destination adrea he said you must go now there will be a lot of surf crossing the bar and i shall have enough to do to run her in look behind it is just as well we are going into harbour  he pointed to the fastgathering clouds coming up from the westward and she paused with her foot on the ladder we leave the storm behind us she said there is fair weather ahead  she went down into her cabin and left paul upon the bridge with his eyes fixed upon the castle fair weather ahead how dared he hope for it the sun had finally disappeared now but some part of the afterglow still lingered in curious contrast to the lurid yellow and black clouds hurrying on behind him the old castle was bathed for a moment in a sea of purple lightevery line of it and the huge rock which it crowned standing out with peculiar vividness against the empty background but it was a brief glory even while paul was gazing the colouring faded away and it resumed its former aspect fair weather ahead every moment as memories of his former visit to the place thronged in upon him paul doubted it the more  he was close to the entrance of the harbour now and all his thoughts and energies were required to pilot his yacht safely in a few moments the brief line was passed and the islanders waiting about upon the beach saw the english vessel ride smoothly into harbourage under shadow of the huge castle rock presently she dropped an anchor and swung gracefully round a boat was lowered and made for the shore  there were plenty of hands willing to help pull her in paul stepped out on to the beach and looked around for some one to whom he could make himself understood  they were all islanders of the rudest class but seeing no one else paul lifted his hand to the castle and asked them the way in italian they understood him and pointed along the beach to a point where a rude road curved inland and reappeared a little higher up in zigzag fashion behind the rocks but no one offered to go a step with him on the contrary directly the question had left his lips they all shrunk away whispering and exclaiming amongst themselves  it is the son of the englishman cried antonio he is going into the lions mouth do not let us be seen with him the count may be watching  i wonder if he knows his danger guiseppe said thoughtfully he is young and brave looking it would be a good action to warn him  i would not risk it cried antonio  nor i echoed ferdinand  nor i chorused the others  guiseppe glanced at them in contempt then he stepped forward and laid his hand upon pauls shouldera strange picturesquelooking object in his bright scarlet shirt and trousers turned up to his knees he had been in italy once and he tried to speak the language of that country as well as he could  illustrious englishman he said go not to that castle the home of the count of cruta danger lurks there for youdanger and death it is our lord who lives there we are his vassals and we are dumb but he is wild and fierce and your countrymen are like devils to him strange things have happened up there be wise put back your boat weigh your anchor and sail away the stormy seas are dangerous but not so dangerous as the castle of cruta to an englishman of your features take the word of guiseppe and depart  paul shook his head he understood most of what guiseppe had said and he knew that it was kindly meant you are very good he said i thank you for your warning but i have important business with the count and i have come from england on purpose to see him here spend this for me he added throwing a handful of silver money amongst the little group of men yonder path will take me straight to the castle i suppose good evening  he strode away along the beach alone meanwhile a strange thing was happening the islanders were all gathered eagerly around the little shower of money but not one had offered to touch a piece  holy mother there are fifty pieces cried antonio if only i was sure that the count would not see me i would keep holiday for a month and start again with a fresh set of fishing nets  touch not the money advised guiseppe shaking his head the counts eyes are everywhere  it is very hard groaned ferdinand it has been such a bad season too  i know i know cried antonio excitedly we will go to the monastery and get father bernard to come and bless it he will claim half for the church but we can divide the other half and we shall each man have given six pieces in charity what say you shall we go  bravo antonio is right antonio is a sensible fellow they all cried then there was the sound of bare feet scampering over the hard sands as they hastened up to the monastery guiseppe was left alone  he waited until they were out of sight then he stooped down and carefully collecting all the coins placed them in his pouch ignorant fools he muttered the count can see no further than other men and at any rate he will not see these in my pocket  he stood up and gazed steadily along the path which paul had taken what am i to do now he continued it is to the englishmans father that i owe my boat and my little hoard of sayings he behaved to me as a prince did signor de vaux can i see his son hasten yonder to his doom without one effort to save him no the count is terrible but i need run no risk at any rate i will follow a little way  he walked swiftly along the beach and commenced the ascent to the castle in a few minutes the little band of fishermen returned carrying lanterns in their hands and with a priest walking amongst them they reached the spot and paused while the priest commenced to mumble a prayer he was scarcely halfway through when he was interrupted  the money is gone cried antonio  every piece echoed ferdinand  there was a moments blank silence then they all crossed themselves let us go home whispered antonio hoarsely the count knows he has been here  the priest turned away disgusted and the others followed him talking with bated breath amongst themselves and in the darkness no one noticed guiseppes absence     chapter xxxiv  a voice and figure from the distant past   it was a long steep ascent hewn out of the solid rock but at last paul stood before the great gates of the castle and paused to take breath hundreds of feet below him his yacht was riding at anchor looking like a toy vessel upon a painted sea and a little group of scattered lights showed him where the hamlet lay before him was the stern massive front of the castle wrapped in profound gloom but standing out in clear ponderous outline against the starlit sky there seemed to be no light from any part of it and the great iron gates leading into the courtyard were closed nor was there any sound at all not even the barking of a dog it was like a dwelling of the dead  a great rusty bellchain hung by the side of the gate and as there seemed to be no other means of communication with the interior paul pulled it vigorously its hoarse echoes had scarcely died away before several roughlooking islanders carrying flaring oil lamps trooped into the courtyard from the rear of the building and one of them drawing the bolts threw open the gates  i have come to see the count paul said addressing the nearest of them will you conduct me to him  the man replied energetically but in a patois utterly unintelligible he led the way across the courtyard towards the castle however and paul followed close behind they did not enter by the front but by a low nailstudded door at the extreme corner of the tower which the man immediately closed and locked behind him  paul looked around him curiously but in the semidarkness there was little to see he was in a corridor of which the walls were simply whitewashed and the floor bare stone but as they passed onward down several passages and up more than one flight of steps the proportions of the place expanded the ceilings grew loftier and the corridors wider yet there was no attempt anywhere at decoration or furniture of any sort the place was like an earlyday prisonhuge bare and damp once crossing a balustraded corridor there was a view of a huge hall down below bare save for a few huge skins thrown carelessly around and a great stack of firearms and other weapons which lined the walls on either side it was the only sign of habitation that paul had seen  suddenly his guide paused and held up his finger paul too listened and close at hand he heard to his surprise the muffled sound of voices chanting some sad hymn in a deep minor key the rise and fall of those mournful voices was wonderfully impressive what could it mean it was a dirge a funeral hymn its every note seemed to breathe of death  what is that paul asked is any one illdying  the man shook his head he could not understand he only motioned to paul to move silently and hurried on they were in a wide corridor with disused doors on either side but their feet fell no longer upon the bare stone a rough sort of drugget had been hastily thrown down in the centre of the passage and their movements roused no more strange echoes between the bare walls and the vaulted roof at every step forward they took the chanting grew more distinct and at last the man stopped at the end of the passage before a door softly tapped at it it was opened at once and paul found himself ushered into a great dimly lit bedchamber  he glanced around him with keen interest if the interior of the room was a little dilapidated it was full of the remains of past magnificence the walls were still covered with fine tapestry of which the design was almost obliterated although the texture and colouring still remained the furniture was huge and of the fashion of days gone by and the bedstead was elaborately carved and surmounted by a coat of arms further paul had but little opportunity to discover for as soon as his presence became known in the room a blackcowled monk left the bedside and approached him  we have been expecting you he said in italian and we fear now that you come too late our poor lady is beyond human skill  paul looked at him in astonishment i do not quite understand you it is the count of cruta whom i came to see  the priest started back and commenced fumbling with a lamp which stood on a table at the foot of the bed are you not the german doctor from palermo he asked bending over towards paul with his keen dark face alight with suspicion and distrust  paul shook his head i am no doctor at all he answered i am an englishman and my name is paul de vaux  ah there was a faint incoherent cry from the beda cry which faint though it was shook with stifled emotion both men turned round and paul could see that the others face was dark and stern  the woman who had been lying on the bed still and motionless as a corpse had raised herself with a sudden spasmodic movement her cheeks were sunken to the bone and her eyes were large and staring  the seal of death was upon her face but paul recognised her it was the woman whom he had seen last in the drawingroom of major harcourts house the woman whom adrea had called her stepmother  he took a sudden step forward and she held out her hands in a gesture half of welcome half of fear paul de vaux holy mother of god what has brought you herehere into the tigers den come close to me hasten  paul stepped forward but the priest stood between them holding out his hands in a threatening gesture sister forbear he cried sternly you have made your peace with god you have done with the world and all its follies close your eyes and pray fix your thoughts upon things above  she did not heed him she did not even look towards him her eyes were fixed upon paul and he read their message aright  this woman wishes to speak to me stand aside and let me go to her he exclaimed if she be indeed dying surely you should respect her wishes  he spoke imperatively for the priest stood in the way and prevented his approach pointing towards the door with a stern commanding gesture  there must be no converse between you and this woman he said i am no lover of violent deeds but if you insist upon forcing your way to her bedside i shall summon the count and you will pay for your rashness with your life your name and features are a certain death warrant in this house escape while you may and pax vobiscum remain and i cannot save you  paul glanced round the room two monks were standing with lighted tapers on the further side of the bed one of whom was mumbling a latin prayer the man who had brought him here was gone there was no one else in the room except the priest and himself  you are inhuman he said shortly the prayers of a dying woman are more to me than your threats stand on one side  paul laid his hand heavily upon the priests shoulder he was prepared even to have used force had it been necessary but it was not the latter moved away at once shaking his robes free from pauls touch with contemptuous gesture and calling one of the monks to him paul sank on one knee by the side of the dying woman and bent low down over her  madame de merteuill you have something to say to me he whispered what is it  her voice was very low and very faint she was even then upon the threshold of death each word came out with a painful effort but with a curious distinctness i am not madame de merteuill at all i am the daughter of the count of cruta  she paused to gather fresh strength and paul caught hold of some of the bedclothes and clutched them in his fingers convulsively this woman the daughter of the count of cruta this wan faded creature the girl whom his father had borne away in triumph his brain reeled with the wonder of it if only he had known a few weeks ago she should never have left the hermitage until she had told him everything was it too late now she was trying to speak to him was he upon the brink of a tremendous revelation was the whole past about to be made clear oh if the old count would keep away for awhile  her lips commenced to move he bent close over her determined not to lose a syllable you know the story about your father martin de vaux and me i  yes yes i know he assured her softly i have only heard it lately  from whom  from the priest who was always with you at de vauxfrom your son he added as the truth suddenly swept in upon him yes father adrian was this womans son  her corpselike face was fixed steadily upon him her words were monotonous and slow yet they preserved their distinctness you have come here to know the truth of the story he told you  yes i have come to discover it if i can  the holy saints must have brought you to me the story  yes  the story is false  paul bent lower still with strained hearing there had been a plot then after all oh if she should die without finishing her story he looked into her bloodless face and his pulses throbbed at feverheat  you know my story she murmured i commence at the time when i left your father in paris i had thought myself hardened in my sin i was mistaken repentance crept slowly but surely in upon me immediately after my fathers visit to us his words haunted me i began to steal away in the evening to vespers at the church of st cecilia one night a grave sweetfaced priest stood up in the pulpit and as his words sank into my heart my sin rose up before me black and grim and the burden of it grew intolerable after the service i sought him and i confessed on the morrow i left martin secretly and without adieu count hirsfeld aided my escape i came here  i came hoping for forgiveness but he my father could not forget the past i found him living in grim and fierce solitude shunned and dreaded by every one ever brooding over my sin and his dishonour he made me stay yet he cursed me  six months after my arrival adrian was born it was while i lay between life and death that i wrote that letter to your father afterwards i told my father what i had done the letter lay there i dared not send it without my fathers sanction i sent for him and told him all to my surprise he consented he did more than that he spoke of it to count hirsfeld and the count volunteered to take the letter to england their readiness made me worried and anxious i knew how they hated martin de vaux and i was suspicious i called the doctor to my side and questioned him closely he declared solemnly that i could not live a fortnight it was impossible i put my suspicions away it was for the honour of his name that my father had consented to receive martin beneath his roof there could be no other reason and i myself felt that the end was near my body was cold and there was a deadly faintness against which i was always struggling i dreaded only lest he should come too late  it was only the night before his arrival that i learnt the truth i was lying with my eyes closed and they thought that i was asleep the doctor and my father were talking together in whispers the crisis was over i heard them say in a few days adrian would be born and i should speedily recover if all went well i nerved myself and called my father to me i had overheard i said if martin came i would not marry him his anger was terrible both count hirsfeld and he had known from the commencement that i was likely to recover but they wished to see martin tricked into marrying me i was firm i would not consent i had written that letter believing myself to be dying if martin came i would not see him now if he was forced into my presence i should tell him the truth  my father left me speechless with rage for the next week my door was kept carefully locked and no one but the doctor and the nurse were permitted to enter yet i learnt afterwards all that happened marie my maid who was slowly dying of consumption was moved into the principal bedchamber and when martin arrived she was made to personate me it was the priest who gained her consent the priest who confessed her and gave her absolution his share of the spoil was to be the de vaux estates handed over to the church if ever they carried out their plot successfully martin came and as he thought granted that fervent prayer of mine they stood around him with drawn swords they would not allow him to approach the bed as soon as the ceremony was over he was thrust from the castle  it happened that in less than a week marie died from my bed which faced the window i saw the little funeral procession leave the castlemy father and count hirsfeld the chief mourners i saw martin following away off with sorrowing face and i was glad then that i had not deceived him i saw him weeping over the grave which he believed to be mine the day afterwards my son was born  as soon as adrian could crawl about he was taken from me by the priests they sent him to italy where he grew up a stranger to me when he returned i did not know him i spoke to him of that false marriage i wept for his lack of parentage he knew everything he spoke to me of it coldly but without unkindness he was a son of the church he said he needed no other mother  he dwelt for awhile at the monastery and it was while he was there that i became suspicious my father and he and the superior of the monastery were always together they seemed to be urging something upon him which he was loath to undertake by degrees i found it all out adrian was to go to england as my lawful son and claim the de vaux estates for the church at first he was unwilling but by degrees they won upon him warning was sent to martin de vaux and he came here swiftlyto his death i was kept a close prisoner but i found out everything that was happening for years afterwards adrian was undecided whether to go to england and claim the estates at last he decided unknown to me to go i escaped and followed him i tried my best to persuade him but failed i came back here illto dieto die  and adrea  adrea she knew nothing how could she  do you know who adrea was  she seemed surprised that anything else could for a moment occupy his mind after the story to which he had listened but she struggled to answer him she was count hirsfelds daughter he never spoke to me of her mother it was in constantinople i am afraid  he bowed his head i understand he said simply the colour had suddenly flooded into his cheeks and there was a mist before his eyes even in that supreme moment when her senses were failing and her eyes were growing dim she saw and understood  i wanted to be kind to her always she faltered we would have adopted her but she would not stay here she was unhappy and i helped her to escape i had my reasons  he had already guessed at them and he held out his hand he did not wish to hear any more there was a moments silence she was looking at him with dim wistful eyes  youyou are very like your father she said painfully will you kiss me  he stooped down and kissed the pale trembling lips and held her hands tightly her breath was coming fast and she spoke with difficulty  thank god they brought you here instead of the doctor i can dieat peace now but youyou are in danger you must escape from here you must not lose a minute oh you do not know you do not know the count is cruelbitterly cruel he will not come to me although i die he will not forgive although i have suffered agonies he is my father but he will not forgive me and youyou are in danger if he finds you they have gone for him ah i remember father andrew went for him he is afraid that i shall tell you the truth and that the church will not gain your property quick you must go kiss me once more paul and go go quickly these monks are wolves but they are cowards strike them down if they try to stop you dont hurt my father farewell farewell  i will stay with you till the end paul whispered  no no away i cannot die in peace and think of youin danger i want to pray leave me now paul dear martin martin my loveis it you  her mind was wandering and she saw her lover of old days in the man whose hand she clasped so frantically and paul although out in the passage he could hear the sound of hurrying feet could not tear himself away from her dying embrace a faint curious smile was parting her pallid lips and her dim eyes seemed suddenly to have caught a dim reflection of the light to come  martin martin there is a mist everywherebut i see you dear love wait for me let us go hand in handhand in hand through the valley of the shadow of death oh my love it has been a weary weary while hold me tighter martin i cannot feel your hand ah at last at last farewell sorrow and grief and suffering we are together once morea new worldbehind the clouds i am happy     chapter xxxv  from out lifes thunders to a strange sweet world   she was dead and after all her end had been crowned with peace she did not hear the door thrown roughly open the swelling of angry voices or the fastapproaching tramp of many feet nor did paul heed any of these signs of coming danger he had folded his strong arms around her and his lips pressed close to her seemed to draw the last quivering breath from her frail body it was only when her head sunk back and he knew that she was dead that he laid her reverently down and turned around  the room was full of strange flashes of light and grotesque shadows falling upon the white faces of half a dozen monks standing in front of them was father andrew and by his side was an old man tall and straight with snowwhite beard and hair he stood in full glare of a torch held by one of the monks behind him and his face seemed like the face of a corpse save for the steady malignant light in his jetblack eyes as paul turned round with his features suddenly visible in a stream of lurid light he raised his arm and pointed a long skinny finger steadily towards him  the son of the devil he cried his deep tremulous voice awakening strange echoes in the high vaulted chamber welcome welcome thrice welcome  paul straightened himself and reverently laid the little white hand which he had been clasping across the coverlet she is dead he said solemnly what i came here to learn from you i have learnt from her let me go  he moved a step forward but the old man remained there in the way motionless and around the door were gathered a solid phalanx of monks paul halted conscious at once of his danger the white faces of the monks were all bent upon him full of savage animal ferocity and a gleam of something still worse lit up the dark eyes of that old man their very silence was unnatural and oppressive paul bore it looking round amongst them with questioning eyes until he could bear it no longer  am i a prisoner he cried what do you want with me speak some of you count of cruta answer me  a dull hollow laugh echoed through the chamber paul turned away sick with horror it was like being in the power of a hoard of madmen the air of the place too seemed suddenly to have become stifling the perspiration was standing out upon his forehead in great beads it was a relief when the count spoke  you have done well paul de vaux to find your way herehere into the very presence of a dying woman and force from her lips a confession that has made you glad you think that you will go back now to your country and cheat me of my wellplanned vengeance you will hold up your head once more you will mock at the churchs rights you will go your way through the world rich and honoured you will call yourself by an old name you will pluck all the roses of life worthy son of a worthy father look at me who was it who blasted my life my happiness my honour my name a name grander and older than his as the oak is older and grander than the currant bush when he took my daughter into his arms he wrote the funeral of his race i played with him as a tiger plays with a miserable hindoo when life was sweetest to him i struck he came here for mercy i laughed and i was merciful i stabbed him to the heart the knife hangs side by side with the arms of the crusaders of cruta you are his son you are the next to die you will not leave these walls alive these monks know you it is you who hold the lands of de vaux which by right belong to their holy church you would go back to resist their just claims the good of the church demands that you should not go back you shall not go back the count of cruta demands that you shall not go back you shall not go back you shall be slain even where your father was slain but you shall not creep back to your hole to die your bones shall whiten and shrivel upon the rocks your blood shall be an honoured stain upon my floor monks of cruta there he stands he who alone can resist your just possession of the broad lands and abbey of de vaux the despoiled church cries to you to strike the end is great haul him away  they were around him like a pack of wolves their lean faces hungry and fierce and their long skinny fingers clutching at his throat and at his clothing one silently drew a knife and brandished it over him paul wrenched himself free with a tremendous effort but they were upon him again they forced him slowly backwards backwards even across the bed where that dead woman lay with her eyes as yet unclosed the great heat as much as their numbers was overpowering him his eyes were bloodshot and there was a choking in his throat again the long knife was lifted other hands held him motionless ready for the blow he was too weak to struggle now he saw the blue steel quivering in the air then he closed his eyes  what was that there was a shrill cry from one of the monks and paul finding their grasp relaxed started up they were cowering down like a flock of frightened animals the room seemed full of red fire the glass in the windows cracked it flew into pieces and a column of smoke curled in the door was thrown open guiseppe stood for a moment on the threshold  fly he cried fly the castle is on fire the flames are near  they rushed for the door like panicstricken cattle before a great prairie fire biting and trampling upon one another in their haste paul followed but the old count stood in his way trembling not with fear but with anger  cowards beasts he cried after the flying monks but you shall not escape me  he wound his long arms around his enemy but the strength of his manhood was gone and without effort paul threw him on one side then through the smoke he found himself face to face with guiseppe  this way signor he said coolly follow me closely  the old count was up again and seemed about to attack them suddenly he changed his mind and with a hoarse cry ran down an empty corridor guiseppe and paul turned in the opposite direction  we must fly signor the man cried he goes to the cellars he is a devil he will blow up the castle cover up your nose and your mouth  they hurried along wide deserted corridors down stone stairs and finally reached what seemed to be a circular underground passage round and round they went until pauls head swam but the air was cooler and every moment brought relief suddenly there was a cold breeze they turned one more corner and guiseppe stopped they were in an open aperture facing the sea barely twenty feet below a small boat with a single man in it was there waiting  dive cried guiseppe we must not wait for the rope  over they went almost simultaneously the shock of the cold water sent the blood dancing once more through pauls veins he came to the surface just after his guide cool and refreshed they scrambled into the boat and paul gave a little cry of wonder they were drifting on a sea of ruddy gold and the space all around them was brilliant with the reflection high above the flames were leaping up towards the sky and the dull singsong of their roar set the very air vibrating guiseppe still dripping seized an oar  pull for your lives pull he cried anxiously  his companion shrugged his shoulders but why  ask no questions you will see  they did see they were barely halfway to the yacht when there came the sound of a low rumbling from the castle suddenly it broke into a roar belching sheets of flame burst out on every side huge cracks in that brilliant light were suddenly visible in the walls creeping in a jagged line from the foundation to the turret fragments of the stone work flew outwards and upwards it seemed as though some mighty internal force were splitting the place up the men in the boat sat breathless and transfixed only guiseppe whispered it is the old count he is the devil he has blown the place up  there was another and then a series of explosions fragments of the rock and stone fell hissing into the water scarcely a hundred feet away great waves rolled towards them it seemed as though the earth underneath were shaking then it all died away and there was silence only the blackened walls of the castle remained with the dying flames still curling fitfully around them the air grew darker and the colour faded from the sea  it is the last of the count of cruta and his castle of horrors cried guiseppe god be thanked     chapter xxxvi  love than death itself more strong   i had no thought of writing in you again my silent friend only a little while ago i said to myself the time has gone by when solitude and heart hunger could drive me to your pages for consolation only a little while ago it is true and yet between the past and future is fixed a mighty gulf as i write these words i stand upon the threshold of death what death may mean i know not i have no religion to throw bright gleams of hope upon its dark mysteries i have no hope of any other life save the one i am quitting if i am resigned and calm it is because the lamp of my life has burnt out and i am in darkness i wait for death as a maiden waits for the first gleams of dawn on her marriage day  who said that love was everlasting they lied love is a dream a floating shadow full of golden lights quenched by the first breath of morning who should know if i do not know who has done more for love than ii whose hands are red with blood i who this night must die it was for his sake i struckfor his sake and now that the hour of my punishment must come i sit here alone and forsaken waiting for the signal which must end my life it was for his sake a deathwhite face rises up before me and a hoarse dying cry sobs ever in my ears i pass on my way through the valley of the shadow of death with no hope to cheer me forsaken friendless and shaken with dim fears am i alone he for whom i struck has turned from me oh the bitter cruelty of it it was he who taught me what love was and yet of love he knows nothing else i would not be here to meet my doom alone oh paul paul oh for one touch of your hand for one kind look my heart is sick and faint with longing am i indeed so low and vile a thing that you should turn away with never a single word of farewell o my love you are hard indeed if my hands are stained with bloodfor whose sake was it it was only a word i craved for paul only a worda look even was it too great a boon to grant                                       oh memory help me help me to keep sane just a few more hoursuntil the end comes it is a last luxury i will think of those golden days we spent together ere the blow fell ah how happy we were every breath of life was sweet every moment seemed charged with the delicious happiness the past with its haunting shadows and the memory of that grim deathly figure huddled up amongst the ferns in the bare pine wood had perished background and foreground had vanished in the bewildering joys of the present oh paul that was happiness indeed all measures of outside things seemed lost at times i found it hard to recollect in what country we were oh the world such as ours was is a sweet sweet world  at last the blow fell he came to me one morning as white as a sheet with an old soiled copy of the times in his hand  read adrea he cried thrusting it into my hand a horrible thing has happened  i let the paper fall through my fingers an agony of fear was upon me i know i know do not ask me to read it  you knew and you did not tell me  no ino  there was a deadly swimming before my eyes and a throbbing in my ears i sank back grateful for the unconsciousness which gave me respite however short when recovered i was on the verge of a fever and paul seeing my condition did not refer to the news which had been such a shock to him but for an hour the next day he was away from me writing letters home when he returned there was a restraint between us he was kind as ever but restless and unsettled as yet he had no suspicion but i could see that he was longing to get back to england the thought was like madness to me  then came the beginning of the end we were staying in a villa which we had rented for a month near florence and one day we drove into the city together to do some shopping paul was at the postoffice and i was crossing the square to go to him when of a sudden i felt a hand upon my dress and a hoarse whisper in my ear i started round in terror a man pale and holloweyed stood by my side it was gomez  listen quickly he said i must not stay by your side you are in danger the english police are upon your track  i caught hold of the railing to prevent myself from falling above my head a little flock of pigeons lazily flapped their wings against the deep blue sky all around the sunlit air was full of laughing voices and gaily dressed crowds of people were passing backwards and forwards only a few yards away already one or two were glancing in my direction curiously in a moment paul would come out of the postoffice looking for me i made a great effort and steadied myself  tell me what can i do  he answered me quickly keeping his back turned to the stream of people you must fly it may be already too late but in twentyfour hours you will certainly be arrested if you are in florence i have travelled night and day to find you the holy saints grant that it may not be too late call yourself by a strange name and if paul de vaux be with you see that he alters his also there are already two of the detectives in florence searching for you a third with a warrant may be here at any time get to the furthest corner of the world for everything is known farewell  he left me abruptly and although i felt that my doom had been spoken i walked firmly across the square to meet paul i would tell him everything he should be my judge my love should plead for me it would triumph yes it would triumph i was convinced of it as for the danger i was in i thought less of that  on the steps of the postoffice i met paul he held in his hand a bundle of papers one of which he had opened and as he raised his head and looked at me i saw that what i had dreaded had come to pass he looked like a man stricken down by some sudden and terrible blow he was white even to the lips and a strange light burned in his eyes  he laid his hand upon my arm was it my fancy or did he really recoil a little as he touched me let us go home he said hoarsely i havesomething to say to you  we entered the carriage which was waiting near and drove off we came together into this room it was barely two hours ago he closed the door and turned towards me i did not wait for his question i told him everything  ah me i had thought that love was a different thing i had sinned it is true but he was not my judge so i commenced humbled and sorrowful indeed but with no fear of what was before me but gradually as i watched his face a cold ghastly dread crept in upon me what did it meanthat blank look of horror his quiet withdrawal from the only caress i attempted i finishedabruptlyand called out to him piteously  paul paul why do you turn away oh kiss me paul it was horrible but it was to save you  he did not answer he did not hold out his arms or make any movement towards me i touched his arm and oh horrible he shuddered i crept away into a corner of the room with a strange burning pain in my heart  how long is it since you saw gomez he asked and his voice strained yet low seemed to come from a far distance  an hourperhaps morei cannot tell  he stood before the door like a ghost i must go and try to find him forgive me adrea i cannot talk now i will come back  so he left me i have not seen him since god only knows whether i shall see him again my heart is torn with the agony of it i cannot bear it any longer if he is not

adrea with that passionate prayer still quivering upon her lips dragged herself to the door and listened a moments agonised apprehension and then she staggered back faint with joy the door was opened and quickly closed paul stood before her  oh my love my love she murmured take me in your arms it is for the last time  he moved to her side and supported her adrea he said quietly i want you to change your things quickly and come with me there is a carriage at the door and i have chartered a steamer to take us to genoa from there we can sail tomorrow for new york gomez was right you are in danger here be brave little woman and all will be well  she clung to him passionately with her arms locked around his neck and her wet face close to his only a confused sense of his words reached her his tone and his embrace were sufficient  and you  i go with you of course we shall begin a new life in a new world come we have no time to lose  a new life in a new world she repeated the words dreamily still holding him to her then a sudden dizziness came it passed away but it reminded her that the end could not be far off  adrea do you not understand how cold your lips are try and bear up

his arms still around her it seemed to him that she had never been so lovely as in those last few minutes of her life it was wonderful to see her resigned as she was  there was a brief silence broken only by a sharp convulsed sob from the kneeling man adrea who heard it stretched out her hand and passed it caressingly along the side of his face he caught it and covered it with kisses  paul we have been happy together have we not  my darling you know it  she raised herself a little and spoke earnestly for meit has been like heavenand yet i am not surethat it would have lasted you would have
