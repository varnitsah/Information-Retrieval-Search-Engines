29001881	evolution and ethics and other essays  by thomas h huxley     preface  the discourse on evolution and ethics reprinted in the first half of the present volume was delivered before the university of oxford as the second of the annual lectures founded by mr romanes whose name i may not write without deploring the untimely death in the flower of his age of a friend endeared to me as to so many others by his kindly nature and justly valued by all his colleagues for his powers of investigation and his zeal for the advancement of knowledge i well remember when mr romanes early work came into my hands as one of the secretaries of the royal society how much i rejoiced in the accession to the ranks of the little army of workers in science of a recruit so well qualified to take a high place among us  it was at my friends urgent request that i agreed to undertake the lecture should i be honoured with an official proposal to give it though i confess not without misgivings if only on account of the serious fatigue and hoarseness which public speaking has for some years caused me while i knew that it would be my fate to follow the most accomplished and facile orator of our time whose indomitable youth is in no matter more manifest than in his penetrating and musical voice a certain saying about comparisons intruded itself somewhat importunately  and even if i disregarded the weakness of my body in the matter of voice and that of my mind in the matter of vanity there remained a third difficulty for several reasons my attention during a number of years has been much directed to the bearing of modern scientific thought on the problems of morals and of politics and i did not care to be diverted from that topic moreover i thought it the most important and the worthiest which at the present time could engage the attention even of an ancient and renowned university  but it is a condition of the romanes foundation that the lecturer shall abstain from treating of either religion or politics and it appeared to me that more than most perhaps i was bound to act not merely up to the letter but in the spirit of that prohibition yet ethical science is on all sides so entangled with religion and politics that the lecturer who essays to touch the former without coming into contact with either of the latter needs all the dexterity of an eggdancer and may even discover that his sense of clearness and his sense of propriety come into conflict by no means to the advantage of the former  i have little notion of the real magnitude of these difficulties when i set about my task but i am consoled for my pains and anxiety by observing that none of the multitudinous criticisms with which i have been favoured and often instructed find fault with me on the score of having strayed out of bounds  among my critics there are not a few to whom i feel deeply indebted for the careful attention which they have given to the exposition thus hampered and further weakened i am afraid by my forgetfulness of a maxim touching lectures of a popular character which has descended to me from that prince of lecturers mr faraday he was once asked by a beginner called upon to address a highly select and cultivated audience what he might suppose his hearers to know already whereupon the past master of the art of exposition emphatically replied nothing  to my shame as a retired veteran who has all his life profited by this great precept of lecturing strategy i forgot all about it just when it would have been most useful i was fatuous enough to imagine that a number of propositions which i thought established and which in fact i had advanced without challenge on former occasions needed no repetition  i have endeavoured to repair my error by prefacing the lecture with some matterchiefly elementary or recapitulatoryto which i have given the title of prolegomena i wish i could have hit upon a heading of less pedantic aspect which would have served my purpose and if it be urged that the new building looks over large for the edifice to which it is added i can only plead the precedent of the ancient architects who always made the adytum the smallest part of the temple  if i had attempted to reply in full to the criticisms to which i have referred i know not what extent of ground would have been covered by my pronaos all i have endeavoured to do at present is to remove that which seems to have proved a stumblingblock to manynamely the apparent paradox that ethical nature while born of cosmic nature is necessarily at enmity with its parent unless the arguments set forth in the prolegomena in the simplest language at my command have some flaw which i am unable to discern this seeming paradox is a truth as great as it is plain the recognition of which is fundamental for the ethical philosopher  we cannot do without our inheritance from the forefathers who were the puppets of the cosmic process the society which renounces it must be destroyed from without still less can we de with too much of it the society in which it dominates must be destroyed from within  the motive of the drama of human life is the necessity laid upon every man who comes into the world of discovering the mean between selfassertion and selfrestraint suited to his character and his circumstances and the eternally tragic aspect of the drama lies in this that the problem set before us is one the elements of which can be but imperfectly known and of which even an approximately right solution rarely presents itself until that stern critic aged experience has been furnished with ample justification for venting his sarcastic humour upon the irreparable blunders we have already made  i have reprinted the letters on the darkest england scheme published in the times of december 1890 and january 1891 and subsequently issued with additions as a pamphlet under the title of social diseases and worse remedies because although the clever attempt to rush the country on behalf of that scheme has been balked booths standing army remains afoot retaining all the capacities for mischief which are inherent in its constitution i am desirous that this fact should be kept steadily in view and that the moderation of the clamour of the drums and trumpets should not lead us to forget the existence of a force which in bad hands may at any time be used for bad purposes  in 1892 a committee was formed for the purpose of investigating the manner in which the moneys subscribed in response to the appeal made in the book entitled in darkest england and the way out have been expended the members of this body were gentlemen in whose competency and equity every one must have complete confidence and in december 1892 they published a report in which they declare that with the exception of the sums expended on the barracks at hadleigh the moneys in question have been devoted only to the objects and expended in the methods set out in that appeal and to and in no others  nevertheless their final conclusion runs as follows 4 that whilst the invested property real and personal resulting from such appeal is so vested and controlled by the trust of the deed of january 30th 1891 that any application of it to purposes other than those declared in the deed by any general of the salvation army would amount to a breach of trust and would subject him to the proceedings of a civil and criminal character before mentioned in the report adequate legal safeguards do not at present exist to prevent the misapplication of such property  the passage i have italicised forms part of a document dated december 19th 1892 it follows that even after the deed of january 30th 1891 was executed adequate legal safeguards to prevent the misapplication of the property did not exist what then was the state of things up to a week earlier that is on january 22nd 1891 when my twelfth and last letter appeared in the times a better justification for what i have said aboutthe want of adequate security for the proper administration of the funds intrusted to mr booth could not be desired unless it be that which is to be found in the following passages of the report pp 36 and 37  it is possible that a general may be forgetful of his duty and sell property and appropriate the proceeds to his own use or to meeting the general liabilities of the salvation army as matters now stand he and he alone would have control over such a sale against such possibilities it appears to the committee to be reasonable that some check should be imposed  once more let it be remembered that this opinion given under the hand of sir henry james was expressed by the committee with the trust deed of 1891 which has been so sedulously flaunted before the public in full view  the committee made a suggestion for the improvement of this very unsatisfactory state of things but the exact value set upon it by the suggestors should be carefully considered p37  the committee are fully aware that if the views thus expressed are carried out the safeguards and checks created will not be sufficient for all purposes absolutely to prevent possible dealing with the property and moneys inconsistent with the purposes to which they are intended to be devoted  in fact they are content to express the very modest hope that if the suggestion made be acted upon some hindrance will thereby be placed in the way of any one acting dishonestly in respect of the disposal of the property and moneys referred to  i do not know and under the circumstances i cannot say i much care whether the suggestions of the committee have or have not been acted upon  whether or not the fact remains that an unscrupulous general will have a pretty free hand notwithstanding some hindrance  thus the judgment of the highly authoritative and certainly not hostile committee of 1892 upon the issues with which they concerned themselves is hardly such as to inspire enthusiastic confidence and it is further to be borne in mind that they carefully excluded from their duties any examination of the principles government teaching or methods of the salvation army as a religious organization or of its affairs except so far as they related to the administration of the moneys collected by the darkest england appeal  consequently the most important questions discussed in my letters were not in any way touched by the committee even if their report had been far more favourable to the darkest england scheme than it is if it had really assured the contributors that the funds raised were fully secured against malversation the objections on social and political grounds to mr  booths despotic organization with its thousands of docile satellites pledged to blind obedience set forth in the letters would be in no degree weakened the sixpennyworth of good would still be outweighed by the shillingsworth of harm if indeed the relative worth or unworth of the latter should not be rated in pounds rather than in shillings  what would one not give for the opinion of the financial members of the committee about the famous bank and that of the legal experts about the proposed tribunes of the people  hodeslea eastbourne         july 1894                        contents                         i                                                    page evolution and ethics

windows of the room in which i write was in what is called the state of nature except it may be by raising a few sepulchral mounds such as those which still here and there break the flowing contours of the downs mans hands had made no mark upon it and the thin veil of vegetation which overspread the broadbacked heights and the shelving sides of the coombs was unaffected by his industry the native grasses and weeds the scattered patches of gorse contended with one another for the possession of the scanty surface soil they fought against the droughts of summer the frosts of winter and the furious gales which swept with unbroken force now from the 2 atlantic and now from the north sea at all times of the year they filled up as they best might the gaps made in their ranks by all sorts of underground and overground animal ravagers one year with another an average population the floating balance of the unceasing struggle for existence among the indigenous plants maintained itself it is as little to be doubted that an essentially similar state of nature prevailed in this region for many thousand years before the coming of caesar and there is no assignable reason for denying that it might continue to exist through an equally prolonged futurity except for the intervention of man  reckoned by our customary standards of duration the native vegetation like the everlasting hills which it clothes seems a type of permanence the little amarella gentians which abound in some places today are the descendants of those that were trodden underfoot by the prehistoric savages who have left their flint tools about here and there and they followed ancestors which in the climate of the glacial epoch probably flourished better than they do now compared with the long past of this humble plant all the history of civilized men is but an episode  yet nothing is more certain than that measured by the liberal scale of timekeeping of the universe this present state of nature however it may seem to have gone and to go on for ever is 3 but a fleeting phase of her infinite variety merely the last of the series of changes which the earths surface has undergone in the course of the millions of years of its existence turn back a square foot of the thin turf and the solid foundation of the land exposed in cliffs of chalk five hundred feet high on the adjacent shore yields full assurance of a time when the sea covered the site of the everlasting hills and when the vegetation of what land lay nearest was as different from the present flora of the sussex downs as that of central africa now is no less certain is it that between the time during which the chalk was formed and that at which the original turf came into existence thousands of centuries elapsed in the course of which the state of nature of the ages during which the chalk was deposited passed into that which now is by changes so slow that in the coming and going of the generations of men had such witnessed them the contemporary conditions would have seemed to be unchanging and unchangeable       see on a piece of chalk in the preceding volume of these     essays vol  viii p 1  but it is also certain that before the deposition of the chalk a vastly longer period had elapsed throughout which it is easy to follow the traces of the same process of ceaseless modification and of the internecine struggle for existence of living things and that even when we can get no further 4 back it is not because there is any reason to think we have reached the beginning but because the trail of the most ancient life remains hidden or has become obliterated  thus that state of nature of the world of plants which we began by considering is far from possessing the attribute of permanence rather its very essence is impermanence it may have lasted twenty or thirty thousand years it may last for twenty or thirty thousand years more without obvious change but as surely as it has followed upon a very different state so it will be followed by an equally different condition that which endures is not one or another association of living forms but the process of which the cosmos is the product and of which these are among the transitory expressions and in the living world one of the most characteristic features of this cosmic process is the struggle for existence the competition of each with all the result of which is the selection that is to say the survival of those forms which on the whole are best adapted to the conditions which at any period obtain and which are therefore in that respect and only in that respect the fittest the acme reached by the cosmic 5 process in the vegetation of the downs is seen in the turf with its weeds and gorse under the conditions they have come out of the struggle victorious and by surviving have proved that they are the fittest to survive       that every theory of evolution must be consistent not merely     with progressive development but with indefinite persistence     in the same condition and with retrogressive modification is a     point which i have insisted upon repeatedly from the year 1862     till now see collected essays vol ii pp 46189 vol iii     p 33 vol viii p 304 in the address on geological     contemporaneity and persistent types 1862 the     paleontological proofs of this proposition were i believe     first set forth  that the state of nature at any time is a temporary phase of a process of incessant change which has been going on for innumerable ages appears to me to be a proposition as well established as any in modern history  paleontology assures us in addition that the ancient philosophers who with less reason held the same doctrine erred in supposing that the phases formed a cycle exactly repeating the past exactly foreshadowing the future in their rotations on the contrary it furnishes us with conclusive reasons for thinking that if every link in the ancestry of these humble indigenous plants had been preserved and were accessible to us the whole would present a converging series of forms of gradually diminishing complexity until at some period in the history of the earth far more remote than any of which organic remains have yet been discovered they would merge in those low groups among which the boundaries between animal and vegetable life become effaced       on the border territory between the animal and the vegetable     kingdoms essays vol viii p 162  6 the word evolution now generally applied to the cosmic process has had a singular history and is used in various senses taken in its popular signification it means progressive development that is gradual change from a condition of relative uniformity to one of relative complexity but its connotation has been widened to include the phenomena of retrogressive metamorphosis that is of progress from a condition of relative complexity to one of relative uniformity  as a natural process of the same character as the development of a tree from its seed or of a fowl from its egg evolution excludes creation and all other kinds of supernatural intervention as the expression of a fixed order every stage of which is the effect of causes operating according to definite rules the conception of evolution no less excludes that of chance  it is very desirable to remember that evolution is not an explanation of the cosmic process but merely a generalized statement of the method and results of that process and further that if there is proof that the cosmic process was set going by any agent then that agent will be the creator of it and of all its products although supernatural intervention may remain strictly excluded from its further course  so far as that limited revelation of the nature of things which we call scientific knowledge has 7 yet gone it tends with constantly increasing emphasis to the belief that not merely the world of plants but that of animals not merely living things but the whole fabric of the earth not merely our planet but the whole solar system not merely our star and its satellites but the millions of similar bodies which bear witness to the order which pervades boundless space and has endured through boundless time are all working out their predestined courses of evolution       see evolution in biology essays vol ii p 187  with none of these have i anything to do at present except with that exhibited by the forms of life which tenant the earth all plants and animals exhibit the tendency to vary the causes of which have yet to be ascertained it is the tendency of the conditions of life at any given time while favouring the existence of the variations best adapted to them to oppose that of the rest and thus to exercise selection and all living things tend to multiply without limit while the means of support are limited the obvious cause of which is the production of offspring more numerous than their progenitors but with equal expectation of life in the actuarial sense without the first tendency there could be no evolution  without the second there would be no good reason why one variation should disappear and another take its place that is to say there would be no selection without the 8 third the struggle for existence the agent of the selective process in the state of nature would vanish       collected essays vol ii passim  granting the existence of these tendencies all the known facts of the history of plants and of animals may be brought into rational correlation  and this is more than can be said for any other hypothesis that i know of  such hypotheses for example as that of the existence of a primitive orderless chaos of a passive and sluggish eternal matter moulded with but partial success by archetypal ideas of a brandnew worldstuff suddenly created and swiftly shaped by a supernatural power receive no encouragement but the contrary from our present knowledge that our earth may once have formed part of a nebulous cosmic magma is certainly possible indeed seems highly probable but there is no reason to doubt that order reigned there as completely as amidst what we regard as the most finished works of nature or of man the faith which is born of knowledge finds its object in an eternal order bringing forth ceaseless change through endless time in endless space the manifestations of the cosmic energy alternating between phases of potentiality and phases of explication it may be that as kant suggests every cosmic 9 magma predestined to evolve into a new world has been the no less predestined end of a vanished predecessor      ibid vol iv p 138 vol v pp 7173     ibid vol viii p 321                       ii  three or four years have elapsed since the state of nature to which i have referred was brought to an end so far as a small patch of the soil is concerned by the intervention of man the patch was cut off from the rest by a wall within the area thus protected the native vegetation was as far as possible extirpated while a colony of strange plants was imported and set down in its place in short it was made into a garden at the present time this artificially treated area presents an aspect extraordinarily different from that of so much of the land as remains in the state of nature outside the wall trees shrubs and herbs many of them appertaining to the state of nature of remote parts of the globe abound and flourish moreover considerable quantities of vegetables fruits and flowers are produced of kinds which neither now exist nor have ever existed except under conditions such as obtain in the garden and which therefore are as much works of the art of man as the frames and glasshouses in which some of them are raised that the state of art thus created in the state of nature by man is sustained by and dependent on him would at once become 10 apparent if the watchful supervision of the gardener were withdrawn and the antagonistic influences of the general cosmic process were no longer sedulously warded off or counteracted the walls and gates would decay quadrupedal and bipedal intruders would devour and tread down the useful and beautiful plants birds insects blight and mildew would work their will the seeds of the native plants carried by winds or other agencies would immigrate and in virtue of their longearned special adaptation to the local conditions these despised native weeds would soon choke their choice exotic rivals a century or two hence little beyond the foundations of the wall and of the houses and frames would be left in evidence of the victory of the cosmic powers at work in the state of nature over the temporary obstacles to their supremacy set up by the art of the horticulturist  it will be admitted that the garden is as much a work of art or artifice as anything that can be mentioned the energy localised in certain human bodies directed by similarly localised intellects has produced a collocation of other material bodies which could not be brought about in the state of nature the same proposition is true of all the       the sense of the term art is becoming narrowed work of     art to most people means a picture a statue or a piece of     bijouterie by way of compensation artist has included in its     wide embrace cooks and ballet girls no less than painters and     sculptors  11 works of mans hands from a flint implement to a cathedral or a chronometer and it is because it is true that we call these things artificial term them works of art or artifice by way of distinguishing them from the products of the cosmic process working outside man which we call natural or works of nature the distinction thus drawn between the works of nature and those of man is universally recognized and it is as i conceive both useful and justifiable                      iii  no doubt it may be properly urged that the operation of human energy and intelligence which has brought into existence and maintains the garden by what i have called the horticultural process is strictly speaking part and parcel of the cosmic process and no one could more readily agree to that proposition than i in fact i do not know that any one has taken more pains than i have during the last thirty years to insist upon the doctrine so much reviled in the early part of that period that man physical intellectual and moral is as much a part of nature as purely a product of the cosmic process as the humblest weed       see mans place in nature collected essays vol vii and     on the struggle for existence in human society 1888 below  but if following up this admission it is urged 12 that such being the case the cosmic process cannot be in antagonism with that horticultural process which is part of itselfi can only reply that if the conclusion that the two are antagonistic is logically absurd i am sorry for logic because as we have seen the fact is so the garden is in the same position as every other work of mans art it is a result of the cosmic process working through and by human energy and intelligence and as is the case with every other artificial thing set up in the state of nature the influences of the latter are constantly tending to break it down and destroy it no doubt the forth bridge and an ironclad in the offing are in ultimate resort products of the cosmic process as much so as the river which flows under the one or the seawater on which the other floats nevertheless every breeze strains the bridge a little every tide does something to weaken its foundations every change of temperature alters the adjustment of its parts produces friction and consequent wear and tear  from time to time the bridge must be repaired just as the ironclad must go into dock simply because nature is always tending to reclaim that which her child man has borrowed from her and has arranged in combinations which are not those favoured by the general cosmic process  thus it is not only true that the cosmic energy working through man upon a portion of 13 the plant world opposes the same energy as it works through the state of nature but a similar antagonism is everywhere manifest between the artificial and the natural even in the state of nature itself what is the struggle for existence but the antagonism of the results of the cosmic process in the region of life one to another       or to put the case still more simply when a man lays hold of     the two ends of a piece of string and pulls them with intent     to break it the right arm is certainly exerted in antagonism     to the left arm yet both arms derive their energy from the     same original source                     iv  not only is the state of nature hostile to the state of art of the garden but the principle of the horticultural process by which the latter is created and maintained is antithetic to that of the cosmic process the characteristic feature of the latter is the intense and unceasing competition of the struggle for existence the characteristic of the former is the elimination of that struggle by the removal of the conditions which give rise to it the tendency of the cosmic process is to bring about the adjustment of the forms of plant life to the current conditions the tendency of the horticultural process is the adjustment of the conditions to the needs of the forms of plant life which the gardener desires to raise  the cosmic process uses unrestricted multiplication 14 as the means whereby hundreds compete for the place and nourishment adequate for one it employs frost and drought to cut off the weak and unfortunate to survive there is need not only of strength but of flexibility and of good fortune  the gardener on the other hand restricts multiplication provides that each plant shall have sufficient space and nourishment protects from frost and drought and in every other way attempts to modify the conditions in such a manner as to bring about the survival of those forms which most nearly approach the standard of the useful or the beautiful which he has in his mind  if the fruits and the tubers the foliage and the flowers thus obtained reach or sufficiently approach that ideal there is no reason why the status quo attained should not be indefinitely prolonged so long as the state of nature remains approximately the same so long will the energy and intelligence which created the garden suffice to maintain it however the limits within which this mastery of man over nature can be maintained are narrow if the conditions of the cretaceous epoch returned i fear the most skilful of gardeners would have to give up the cultivation of apples and gooseberries while if those of the glacial period once again obtained open asparagus beds would be superfluous and the training of fruit 15 trees against the most favourable of mouth walls a waste of time and trouble  but it is extremely important to note that the state of nature remaining the same if the produce does not satisfy the gardener it may be made to approach his ideal more closely although the struggle for existence may be at end the possibility of progress remains in discussions on these topics it is often strangely forgotten that the essential conditions of the modification or evolution of living things are variation and hereditary transmission selection is the means by which certain variations are favoured and their progeny preserved but the struggle for existence is only one of the means by which selection may be effected the endless varieties of cultivated flowers fruits roots tubers and bulbs are not products of selection by means of the struggle for existence but of direct selection in view of an ideal of utility or beauty amidst a multitude of plants occupying the same station and subjected to the same conditions in the garden varieties arise the varieties tending in a given direction are preserved and the rest are destroyed and the same process takes place among the varieties until for example the wild kale becomes a cabbage or the wild viola tricolor a prize pansy  16                     v  the process of colonisation presents analogies to the formation of a garden which are highly instructive suppose a shipload of english colonists sent to form a settlement in such a country as tasmania was in the middle of the last century on landing they find themselves in the midst of a state of nature widely different from that left behind them in everything but the most general physical conditions the common plants the common birds and quadrupeds are as totally distinct as the men from anything to be seen on the side of the globe from which they come the colonists proceed to put an end to this state of things over as large an area as they desire to occupy  they clear away the native vegetation extirpate or drive out the animal population so far as may be necessary and take measures to defend themselves from the reimmigration of either in their place they introduce english grain and fruit trees english dogs sheep cattle horses and english men in fact they set up a new flora and fauna and a new variety of mankind within the old state of nature their farms and pastures represent a garden on a great scale and themselves the gardeners who have to keep it up in watchful antagonism to the old regime considered as a whole the colony is a composite unit introduced into the old state of nature and 17 thenceforward a competitor in the struggle for existence to conquer or be vanquished  under the conditions supposed there is no doubt of the result if the work of the colonists be carried out energetically and with intelligent combination of all their forces on the other hand if they are slothful stupid and careless or if they waste their energies in contests with one another the chances are that the old state of nature will have the best of it the native savage will destroy the immigrant civilized man of the english animals and plants some will be extirpated by their indigenous rivals others will pass into the feral state and themselves become components of the state of nature in a few decades all other traces of the settlement will have vanished                      vi  let us now imagine that some administrative authority as far superior in power and intelligence to men as men are to their cattle is set over the colony charged to deal with its human elements in such a manner as to assure the victory of the settlement over the antagonistic influences of the state of nature in which it is set down he would proceed in the same fashion as that in which the gardener dealt with his garden in the first place he would as far as possible put a 18 stop to the influence of external competition by thoroughly extirpating and excluding the native rivals whether men beasts or plants and our administrator would select his human agents with a view to his ideal of a successful colony just as the gardener selects his plants with a view to his ideal of useful or beautiful products  in the second place in order that no struggle for the means of existence between these human agents should weaken the efficiency of the corporate whole in the battle with the state of nature he would make arrangements by which each would be provided with those means and would be relieved from the fear of being deprived of them by his stronger or more cunning fellows  laws sanctioned by the combined force of the colony would restrain the selfassertion of each man within the limits required for the maintenance of peace in other words the cosmic struggle for existence as between man and man would be rigorously suppressed and selection by its means would be as completely excluded as it is from the garden  at the same time the obstacles to the full development of the capacities of the colonists by other conditions of the state of nature than those already mentioned would be removed by the creation of artificial conditions of existence of a more favourable character protection against extremes of heat and cold would 19 be afforded by houses and clothing drainage and irrigation works would antagonise the effects of excessive rain and excessive drought roads bridges canals carriages and ships would overcome the natural obstacles to locomotion and transport mechanical engines would supplement the natural strength of men and of their draught animals hygienic precautions would check or remove the natural causes of disease with every step of this progress in civilization the colonists would become more and more independent of the state of nature more and more their lives would be conditioned by a state of art in order to attain his ends the administrator would have to avail himself of the courage industry and cooperative intelligence of the settlers and it is plain that the interest of the community would be best served by increasing the proportion of persons who possess such qualities and diminishing that of persons devoid of them in other words by selection directed towards an ideal  thus the administrator might look to the establishment of an earthly paradise a true garden of eden in which all things should work together towards the wellbeing of the gardeners within which the cosmic process the coarse struggle for existence of the state of nature should be abolished in which that state should be replaced by a state of art 20 where every plant and every lower animal should be adapted to human wants and would perish if human supervision and protection were withdrawn where men themselves should have been selected with a view to their efficiency as organs for the performance of the functions of a perfected society and this ideal polity would have been brought about not by gradually adjusting the men to the conditions around them but by creating artificial conditions for them not by allowing the free play of the struggle for existence but by excluding that struggle and by substituting selection directed towards the administrators ideal for the selection it exercises                   vii  but the eden would have its serpent and a very subtle beast too man shares with the rest of the living world the mighty instinct of reproduction and its consequence the tendency to multiply with great rapidity the better the measures of the administrator achieved their object the more completely the destructive agencies of the state of nature were defeated the less would that multiplication be checked  on the other hand within the colony the enforcement of peace which deprives every man of the power to take away the means of existence from another simply because he is the stronger 21 would have put an end to the struggle for existence between the colonists and the competition for the commodities of existence which would alone remain is no check upon population  thus as soon as the colonists began to multiply the administrator would have to face the tendency to the reintroduction of the cosmic struggle into his artificial fabric in consequence of the competition not merely for the commodities but for the means of existence when the colony reached the limit of possible expansion the surplus population must be disposed of somehow or the fierce struggle for existence must recommence and destroy that peace which is the fundamental condition of the maintenance of the state of art against the state of nature  supposing the administrator to be guided by purely scientific considerations he would like the gardener meet this most serious difficulty by systematic extirpation or exclusion of the superfluous the hopelessly diseased the infirm aged the weak or deformed in body or in mind the excess of infants born would be put away as the gardener pulls up defective and superfluous plants or the breeder destroys undesirable cattle only the strong and the healthy carefully matched with a view to the progeny best adapted to the purposes of the administrator would be permitted to perpetuate their kind  22                   viii  of the more thoroughgoing of the multitudinous attempts to apply the principles of cosmic evolution or what are supposed to be such to social and political problems which have appeared of late years a considerable proportion appear to me to be based upon the notion that human society is competent to furnish from its own resources an administrator of the kind i have imagined the pigeons in short are to be their own sir john sebright a despotic government whether individual or collective is to be endowed with the preternatural intelligence and with what i am afraid many will consider the preternatural ruthlessness required for the purpose of carrying out the principle of improvement by selection with the somewhat drastic thoroughness upon which the success of the method depends  experience certainly does not justify us in limiting the ruthlessness of individual saviours of society and on the wellknown grounds of the aphorism which denies both body and soul to corporations it seems probable indeed the belief is not without support in history that a collective despotism a mob got to believe in its own divine right by demagogic missionaries would be capable of more thorough 23 work in this direction than any single tyrant puffed up with the same illusion has ever achieved  but intelligence is another affair the fact that saviours of society take to that trade is evidence enough that they have none to spare and such as they possess is generally sold to the capitalists of physical force on whose resources they depend however i doubt whether even the keenest judge of character if he had before him a hundred boys and girls under fourteen could pick out with the least chance of success those who should be kept as certain to be serviceable members of the polity and those who should be chloroformed as equally sure to be stupid idle or vicious the points of a good or of a bad citizen are really far harder to discern than those of a puppy or a shorthorn calf many do not show themselves before the practical difficulties of life stimulate manhood to full exertion and by that time the mischief is done the evil stock if it be one has had time to multiply and selection is nullified       not that the conception of such a society is necessarily based     upon the idea of evolution the platonic state testifies to the     contrary                              ix  i have other reasons for fearing that this logical ideal of evolutionary regimentationthis pigeonfanciers polityis unattainable in the absence of any such a severely scientific administrator as we have been dreaming of human society 24 is kept together by bonds of such a singular character that the attempt to perfect society after his fashion would run serious risk of loosening them social organization is not peculiar to men other societies such as those constituted by bees and ants have also arisen out of the advantage of cooperation in the struggle for existence and their resemblances to and their differences from human society are alike instructive the society formed by the hive bee fulfils the ideal of the communistic aphorism to each according to his needs from each according to his capacity within it the struggle for existence is strictly limited  queen drones and workers have each their allotted sufficiency of food each performs the function assigned to it in the economy of the hive and all contribute to the success of the whole cooperative society in its competition with rival collectors of nectar and pollen and with other enemies in the state of nature without in the same sense as the garden or the colony is a work of human art the bee polity is a work of apiarian art brought about by the cosmic process working through the organization of the hymenopterous type  now this society is the direct product of an organic necessity impelling every member of it to a course of action which tends to the good of the whole each bee has its duty and none 25 has any rights whether bees are susceptible of feeling and capable of thought is a question which cannot be dogmatically answered as a pious opinion i am disposed to deny them more than the merest rudiments of consciousness but it is curious to reflect that a thoughtful drone workers and queens would have no leisure for speculation with a turn for ethical philosophy must needs profess himself an intuitive moralist of the purest water he would point out with perfect justice that the devotion of the workers to a life of ceaseless toil for a mere subsistence wage cannot be accounted for either by enlightened selfishness or by any other sort of utilitarian motives since these bees begin to work without experience or reflection as they emerge from the cell in which they are hatched plainly an eternal and immutable principle innate in each bee can alone account for the phenomena on the other hand the biologist who traces out all the extant stages of gradation between solitary and hive bees as clearly sees in the latter simply the perfection of an automatic mechanism hammered out by the blows of the struggle for existence upon the progeny of the former during long ages of constant variation       collected essays vol i animal automatism vol v     prologue pp 45 et seq  26                    x  i see no reason to doubt that at its origin human society was as much a product of organic necessity as that of the bees the human family to begin with rested upon exactly the same conditions as those which gave rise to similar associations among animals lower in the scale further it is easy to see that every increase in the duration of the family ties with the resulting cooperation of a larger and larger number of descendants for protection and defence would give the families in which such modification took place a distinct advantage over the others and as in the hive the progressive limitation of the struggle for existence between the members of the family would involve increasing efficiency as regards outside competition  but there is this vast and fundamental difference between bee society and human society in the former the members of the society are each organically predestined to the performance of one particular class of functions only if they were endowed with desires each could desire to perform none but those offices for which its organization specially fits it and which in view of the good of the whole it is proper it should do so long as a new queen does not make her appearance rivalries and competition are absent from the bee polity       collected essays vol v prologue pp 5054  27 among mankind on the contrary there is no such predestination to a sharply defined place in the social organism however much men may differ in the quality of their intellects the intensity of their passions and the delicacy of their sensations it cannot be said that one is fitted by his organization to be an agricultural labourer and nothing else and another to be a landowner and nothing else moreover with all their enormous differences in natural endowment men agree in one thing and that is their innate desire to enjoy the pleasures and to escape the pains of life and in short to do nothing but that which it pleases them to do without the least reference to the welfare of the society into which they are born that is their inheritance the reality at the bottom of the doctrine of original sin from the long series of ancestors human and semihuman and brutal in whom the strength of this innate tendency to selfassertion was the condition of victory in the struggle for existence that is the reason of the aviditas vitaethe insatiable hunger for enjoymentof all mankind which is one of the essential conditions of success in the war with the state of nature outside and yet the sure agent of the destruction of society if allowed free play within       see below romanes lecture note 7  the check upon this free play of selfassertion or natural liberty which is the necessary condition for the origin of human society is the product 28 of organic necessities of a different kind from those upon which the constitution of the hive depends one of these is the mutual affection of parent and offspring intensified by the long infancy of the human species  but the most important is the tendency so strongly developed in man to reproduce in himself actions and feelings similar to or correlated with those of other men man is the most consummate of all mimics in the animal world none but himself can draw or model none comes near him in the scope variety and exactness of vocal imitation none is such a master of gesture while he seems to be impelled thus to imitate for the pure pleasure of it  and there is no such another emotional chameleon by a purely reflex operation of the mind we take the hue of passion of those who are about us or it may be the complementary colour it is not by any conscious putting ones self in the place of a joyful or a suffering person that the state of mind we call sympathy usually arises  indeed it is often contrary to ones sense of 29 right and in spite of ones will that fellowfeeling makes us wondrous kind or the reverse however complete may be the indifference to public opinion in a cool intellectual view of the traditional sage it has not yet been my fortune to meet with any actual sage who took its hostile manifestations with entire equanimity indeed i doubt if the philosopher lives or ever has lived who could know himself to be heartily despised by a street boy without some irritation and though one cannot justify haman for wishing to hang mordecai on such a very high gibbet yet really the consciousness of the vizier of ahasuerus as he went in and out of the gate that this obscure jew had no respect for him must have been very annoying       adam smith makes the pithy observation that the man who     sympathises with a woman in childbed cannot be said to put     himself in her place the theory of the moral sentiments     part vii sec iii chap i perhaps there is more humour than     force in the example and in spite of this and other     observations of the same tenor i think that the one defect of     the remarkable work in which it occurs is that it lays too much     stress on conscious substitution too little on purely reflex     sympathy       esther v 913    but when haman saw mordecai in the     kings gate that he stood not up nor moved for him he was     full of indignation against mordecai    and haman told them     of the glory of his riches    and all the things wherein the     king had promoted him    yet all this availeth me nothing     so long as i see mordecai the jew sitting at the kings gate     what a shrewd exposure of human weakness it is  it is needful only to look around us to see that the greatest restrainer of the antisocial tendencies of men is fear not of the law but of the opinion of their fellows the conventions of honour bind men who break legal moral and religious bonds and while people endure the extremity of physical pain rather than part with life shame drives the weakest to suicide  every forward step of social progress brings 30 men into closer relations with their fellows and increases the importance of the pleasures and pains derived from sympathy we judge the acts of others by our own sympathies and we judge our own acts by the sympathies of others every day and all day long from childhood upwards until associations as indissoluble as those of language are formed between certain acts and the feelings of approbation or disapprobation it becomes impossible to imagine some acts without disapprobation or others without approbation of the actor whether he be ones self or any one else we come to think in the acquired dialect of morals an artificial personality the man within as adam smith calls conscience is built up beside the natural personality he is the watchman of society charged to restrain the antisocial tendencies of the natural man within the limits required by social welfare       theory of the moral sentiments part iii chap 3 on the     influence and authority of conscience                      xi  i have termed this evolution of the feelings out of which the primitive bonds of human society are so largely forged into the organized and personified sympathy we call conscience the ethical process so far as it tends to       worked out in its essential features chiefly by hartley and     adam smith long before the modern doctrine of evolution was     thought of see note below p 45  31 make any human society more efficient in the struggle for existence with the state of nature or with other societies it works in harmonious contrast with the cosmic process but it is none the less true that since law and morals are restraints upon the struggle for existence between men in society the ethical process is in opposition to the principle of the cosmic process and tends to the suppression of the qualities best fitted for success in that struggle       see the essay on the struggle for existence in human society     below and collected essays vol i p 276 for kants     recognition of these facts  it is further to be observed that just as the selfassertion necessary to the maintenance of society against the state of nature will destroy that society if it is allowed free operation within so the selfrestraint the essence of the ethical process which is no less an essential condition of the existence of every polity may by excess become ruinous to it  moralists of all ages and of all faiths attending only to the relations of men towards one another in an ideal society have agreed upon the golden rule do as you would be done by in other words let sympathy be your guide put yourself in the place of the man towards whom your action is directed and do to him what you would like to have done to yourself under the circumstances however much one may admire the generosity of such a rule of 32 conduct however confident one may be that average men may be thoroughly depended upon not to carry it out to its full logical consequences it is nevertheless desirable to recognise the fact that these consequences are incompatible with the existence of a civil state under any circumstances of this world which have obtained or so far as one can see are likely to come to pass  for i imagine there can be no doubt that the great desire of every wrongdoer is to escape from the painful consequences of his actions if i put myself in the place of the man who has robbed me i find that i am possessed by an exceeding desire not to be fined or imprisoned if in that of the man who has smitten me on one cheek i contemplate with satisfaction the absence of any worse result than the turning of the other cheek for like treatment  strictly observed the golden rule involves the negation of law by the refusal to put it in motion against lawbreakers and as regards the external relations of a polity it is the refusal to continue the struggle for existence it can be obeyed even partially only under the protection of a society which repudiates it without such shelter the followers of the golden rule may indulge in hopes of heaven but they must reckon with the certainty that other people will be masters of the earth  what would become of the garden if the 33 gardener treated all the weeds and slugs and birds and trespassers as he would like to be treated if he were in their place                    xii  under the preceding heads i have endeavoured to represent in broad but i hope faithful outlines the essential features of the state of nature and of that cosmic process of which it is the outcome so far as was needful for my argument i have contrasted with the state of nature the state of art produced by human intelligence and energy as it is exemplified by a garden and i have shown that the state of art here and elsewhere can be maintained only by the constant counteraction of the hostile influences of the state of nature further i have pointed out that the horticultural process which thus sets itself against the cosmic process is opposed to the latter in principle in so far as it tends to arrest the struggle for existence by restraining the multiplication which is one of the chief causes of that struggle and by creating artificial conditions of life better adapted to the cultivated plants than are the conditions of the state of nature and i have dwelt upon the fact that though the progressive modification which is the consequence of the struggle for existence in the state of nature is at an end such modification may still be effected 34 by that selection in view of an ideal of usefulness or of pleasantness to man of which the state of nature knows nothing  i have proceeded to show that a colony set down in a country in the state of nature presents close analogies with a garden and i have indicated the course of action which an administrator able and willing to carry out horticultural principles would adopt in order to secure the success of such a newly formed polity supposing it to be capable of indefinite expansion in the contrary case i have shown that difficulties must arise that the unlimited increase of the population over a limited area must sooner or later reintroduce into the colony that struggle for the means of existence between the colonists which it was the primary object of the administrator to exclude insomuch as it is fatal to the mutual peace which is the prime condition of the union of men in society  i have briefly described the nature of the only radical cure known to me for the disease which would thus threaten the existence of the colony and however regretfully i have been obliged to admit that this rigorously scientific method of applying the principles of evolution to human society hardly comes within the region of practical politics not for want of will on the part of a great many people but because for one reason there is no hope that mere human beings will ever possess enough intelligence to select the fittest and i 35 have adduced other grounds for arriving at the same conclusion  i have pointed out that human society took its rise in the organic necessities expressed by imitation and by the sympathetic emotions and that in the struggle for existence with the state of nature and with other societies as part of it those in which men were thus led to close cooperation bad a great advantage but since each man retained more or less of the faculties common to all the rest and especially a full share of the desire for unlimited selfgratification the struggle for existence within society could only be gradually eliminated so long as any of it remained society continued to be an imperfect instrument of the struggle for existence and consequently was improvable by the selective influence of that struggle other things being alike the tribe of savages in which order was best maintained in which there was most security within the tribe and the most loyal mutual support outside it would be the survivors       collected essays vol v prologue p 52  i have termed this gradual strengthening of the social bond which though it arrest the struggle for existence inside society up to a certain point improves the chances of society as a corporate whole in the cosmic strugglethe ethical process i have endeavoured to show that when the ethical process has advanced so far as to secure 36 every member of the society in the possession of the means of existence the struggle for existence as between man and man within that society is ipso facto at an end and as it is undeniable that the most highly civilized societies have substantially reached this position it follows that so far as they are concerned the struggle for existence can play no important part within them in other words the kind of evolution which is brought about in the state of nature cannot take place       whether the struggle for existence with the state of nature     and with other societies so far as they stand in the relation     of the state of nature with it exerts a selective influence     upon modern society and in what direction are questions not     easy to answer the problem of the effect of military and     industrial warfare upon those who wage it is very complicated  i have further shown cause for the belief that direct selection after the fashion of the horticulturist and the breeder neither has played nor can play any important part in the evolution of society apart from other reasons because i do not see how such selection could be practised without a serious weakening it may be the destruction of the bonds which hold society together it strikes me that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak the unfortunate and the superfluous who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race who if 37 they are consistent must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence whose whole lives therefore are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left but without them there is no conscience nor any restraint on the conduct of men except the calculation of selfinterest the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains and experience tells us how much that is worth every day we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which as they believe when cool they risk eternal punishment while they hold back from those which am opposed to the sympathies of their associates                   xiii  that progressive modification of civilization which passes by the name of the evolution of society is in fact a process of an essentially different character both from that which brings about the evolution of species in the state of nature and from that which gives rise to the evolution of varieties in the state of art  there can be no doubt that vast changes have taken place in english civilization since the reign 38 of the tudors but i am not aware of a particle of evidence in favour of the conclusion that this evolutionary process has been accompanied by any modification of the physical or the mental characters of the men who have been the subjects of it i have not met with any grounds for suspecting that the average englishmen of today are sensibly different from those that shakspere knew and drew we look into his magic mirror of the elizabethan age and behold nowise darkly the presentment of ourselves  during these three centuries from the reign of elizabeth to that of victoria the struggle for existence between man and man has been so largely restrained among the great mass of the population except for one or two short intervals of civil war that it can have had little or no selective operation as to anything comparable to direct selection it has been practised on so small a scale that it may also be neglected the criminal law in so far as by putting to death or by subjecting to long periods of imprisonment those who infringe its provisions prevents the propagation of hereditary criminal tendencies and the poorlaw in so far as it separates married couples whose destitution arises from hereditary defects of character are doubtless selective agents operating in favour of the noncriminal and the more effective members of society but the proportion of the population which they influence 39 is very small and generally the hereditary criminal and the hereditary pauper have propagated their kind before the law affects them in a large proportion of cases crime and pauperism have nothing to do with heredity but are the consequence partly of circumstances and partly of the possession of qualities which under different conditions of life might have excited esteem and even admiration  it was a shrewd man of the world who in discussing sewage problems remarked that dirt is riches in the wrong place and that sound aphorism has moral applications the benevolence and openhanded generosity which adorn a rich man may make a pauper of a poor one the energy and courage to which the successful soldier owes his rise the cool and daring subtlety to which the great financier owes his fortune may very easily under unfavourable conditions lead their possessors to the gallows or to the hulks moreover it is fairly probable that the children of a failure will receive from their other parent just that little modification of character which makes all the difference i sometimes wonder whether people who talk so freely about extirpating the unfit ever dispassionately consider their own history surely one must be very fit indeed not to know of an occasion or perhaps two in ones life when it would have been only too easy to qualify for a place among the unfit  40 in my belief the innate qualities physical intellectual and moral of our nation have remained substantially the same for the last four or five centuries if the struggle for existence has affected us to any serious extent and i doubt it it has been indirectly through our military and industrial wars with other nations                     xiv  what is often called the struggle for existence in society i plead guilty to having used the term too loosely myself is a contest not for the means of existence but for the means of enjoyment those who occupy the first places in this practical competitive examination are the rich and the influential those who fail more or less occupy the lower places down to the squalid obscurity of the pauper and the criminal upon the most liberal estimate i suppose the former group will not amount to two per cent of the population i doubt if the latter exceeds another two per cent but let it be supposed for the sake of argument that it is as great as five per cent       those who read the last essay in this volume will not accuse     me of wishing to attenuate the evil of the existence of this     group whether great or small  as it is only in the latter group that any thing comparable to the struggle for existence in the state of nature can take place as it is 41 only among this twentieth of the whole people that numerous men women and children die of rapid or slow starvation or of the diseases incidental to permanently bad conditions of life and as there is nothing to prevent their multiplication before they are killed off while in spite of greater infant mortality they increase faster than the rich it seems clear that the struggle for existence in this class can have no appreciable selective influence upon the other 95 per cent of the population  what sort of a sheep breeder would he be who should content himself with picking out the worst fifty out of a thousand leaving them on a barren common till the weakest starved and then letting the survivors go back to mix with the rest and the parallel is too favourable since in a large number of cases the actual poor and the convicted criminals are neither the weakest nor the worst  in the struggle for the means of enjoyment the qualities which ensure success are energy industry intellectual capacity tenacity of purpose and at least as much sympathy as is necessary to make a man understand the feelings of his fellows were there none of those artificial arrangements by which fools and knaves are kept at the top of society instead of sinking to their natural place at the bottom the struggle for the means 42 of enjoyment would ensure a constant circulation of the human units of the social compound from the bottom to the top and from the top to the bottom  the survivors of the contest those who continued to form the great bulk of the polity would not be those fittest who got to the very top but the great body of the moderately fit whose numbers and superior propagative power enable them always to swamp the exceptionally endowed minority       i have elsewhere lamented the absence from society of a     machinery for facilitating the descent of incapacity     administrative nihilism collected essays vol i p 54  i think it must be obvious to every one that whether we consider the internal or the external interests of society it is desirable they should be in the hands of those who are endowed with the largest share of energy of industry of intellectual capacity of tenacity of purpose while they are not devoid of sympathetic humanity and in so far as the struggle for the means of enjoyment tends to place such men in possession of wealth and influence it is a process which tends to the good of society but the process as we have seen has no real resemblance to that which adapts living beings to current conditions in the state of nature nor any to the artificial selection of the horticulturist  43 to return once more to the parallel of horticulture in the modern world the gardening of men by themselves is practically restricted to the performance not of selection but of that other function of the gardener the creation of conditions more favourable than those of the state of nature to the end of facilitating the free expansion of the innate faculties of the citizen so far as it is consistent with the general good  and the business of the moral and political philosopher appears to me to be the ascertainment by the same method of observation experiment and ratiocination as is practised in other kinds of scientific work of the course of conduct which will best conduce to that end  but supposing this course of conduct to be scientifically determined and carefully followed out it cannot put an end to the struggle for existence in the state of nature and it will not so much as tend in any way to the adaptation of man to that state even should the whole human race be absorbed in one vast polity within which absolute political justice reigns the struggle for existence with the state of nature outside it and the tendency to the return to the struggle within in consequence of overmultiplication will remain and unless mens inheritance from the ancestors who fought a good fight in the state of 44 nature their dose of original sin is rooted out by some method at present unrevealed at any rate to disbelievers in supernaturalism every child born into the world will still bring with him the instinct of unlimited selfassertion he will have to learn the lesson of selfrestraint and renunciation but the practice of selfrestraint and renunciation is not happiness though it may be something much better  that man as a political animal is susceptible of a vast amount of improvement by education by instruction and by the application of his intelligence to the adaptation of the conditions of life to his higher needs i entertain not the slightest doubt but so long as he remains liable to error intellectual or moral so long as he is compelled to be perpetually on guard against the cosmic forces whose ends are not his ends without and within himself so long as he is haunted by inexpugnable memories and hopeless aspirations so long as the recognition of his intellectual limitations forces him to acknowledge his incapacity to penetrate the mystery of existence the prospect of attaining untroubled happiness or of a state which can even remotely deserve the title of perfection appears to me to be as misleading an illusion as ever was dangled before the eyes of poor humanity and there have been many of them  that which lies before the human race is a 45 constant struggle to maintain and improve in opposition to the state of nature the state of art of an organized polity in which and by which man may develop a worthy civilization capable of maintaining and constantly improving itself until the evolution of our globe shall have entered so far upon its downward course that the cosmic process resumes its sway and once more the state of nature prevails over the surface of our planet       note see p 30it seems the fashion nowadays to ignore hartley though a century and a half ago he not only laid the foundations but built up much of the superstructure of a true theory of the evolution of the intellectual and moral faculties he speaks of what i have termed the ethical process as our

soleo enim et in aliena castra transire non tanquam transfuga sed tanquam explorator l annaei senecae epist ii 4  there is a delightful childs story known by the title of jack and the beanstalk with which my contemporaries who are present will be familiar  but so many of our grave and reverend juniors have been brought up on severer intellectual diet and perhaps have become acquainted with fairyland only through primers of comparative mythology that it may be needful to give an outline of the tale it is a legend of a beanplant which grows and grows until it reaches the high heavens and there spreads out into a vast canopy of foliage the hero being moved to climb the stalk discovers that the leafy expanse supports a world composed of the same elements as that below but yet strangely new and his adventures there on which i may not dwell must 47 have completely changed his views of the nature of things though the story not having been composed by or for philosophers has nothing to say about views  my present enterprise has a certain analogy to that of the daring adventurer i beg you to accompany me in an attempt to reach a world which to many is probably strange by the help of a bean it is as you know a simple inertlooking thing yet if planted under proper conditions of which sufficient warmth is one of the most important it manifests active powers of a very remarkable kind a small green seedling emerges rises to the surface of the soil rapidly increases in size and at the same time undergoes a series of metamorphoses which do not excite our wonder as much as those which meet us in legendary history merely because they are to be seen every day and all day long  by insensible steps the plant builds itself up into a large and various fabric of root stem leaves flowers and fruit every one moulded within and without in accordance with an extremely complex but at the same time minutely defined pattern in each of these complicated structures as in their smallest constituents there is an immanent energy which in harmony with that resident in all the others incessantly works towards the maintenance of the whole and the efficient performance of the part which it has to play in the economy of nature  48 but no sooner has the edifice reared with such exact elaboration attained completeness than it begins to crumble by degrees the plant withers and disappears from view leaving behind more or fewer apparently inert and simple bodies just like the bean from which it sprang and like it endowed with the potentiality of giving rise to a similar cycle of manifestations neither the poetic nor the scientific imagination is put to much strain in the search after analogies with this process of going forth and as it were returning to the startingpoint it may be likened to the ascent and descent of a slung stone or the course of an arrow along its trajectory or we may say that the living energy takes first an upward and then a downward road or it may seem preferable to compare the expansion of the germ into the fullgrown plant to the unfolding of a fan or to the rolling forth and widening of a stream and thus to arrive at the conception of development or evolution here as elsewhere names are noise and smoke the important point is to have a clear and adequate conception of the fact signified by a name and in this case the fact is the sisyphaean process in the course of which the living and growing plant passes from the relative simplicity and latent potentiality of the seed to the full epiphany of a highly differentiated type thence to fall back to simplicity and potentiality  49 the value of a strong intellectual grasp of the nature of this process lies in the circumstance that what is true of the bean is true of living things in general from very low forms up to the highestin the animal no less than in the vegetable kingdomthe process of life presents the same appearance note 1 of cyclical evolution nay we have but to cast our eyes over the rest of the world and cyclical change presents itself on all sides  it meets us in the water that flows to the sea and returns to the springs in the heavenly bodies that wax and wane go and return to their places in the inexorable sequence of the ages of mans life in that successive rise apogee and fall of dynasties and of states which is the most prominent topic of civil history  as no man fording a swift stream can dip his foot twice into the same water so no man can with exactness affirm of anything in the sensible world that it isnote 2 as he utters the words nay as he thinks them the predicate ceases to be applicable the present has become the past the is should be was and the more we learn of the nature of things the more evident is it that what we call rest is only unperceived activity that seeming peace is silent but strenuous battle in every part at every moment the state of the cosmos is the expression of a transitory adjustment of contending forces a scene of strife in which all the combatants fall in turn what is 50 true of each part is true of the whole natural knowledge tends more and more to the conclusion that all the choir of heaven and furniture of the earth are the transitory forms of parcels of cosmic substance wending along the road of evolution from nebulous potentiality through endless growths of sun and planet and satellite through all varieties of matter through infinite diversities of life and thought possibly through modes of being of which we neither have a conception nor are competent to form any back to the indefinable latency from which they arose thus the most obvious attribute of the cosmos is its impermanence it assumes the aspect not so much of a permanent entity as of a changeful process in which naught endures save the flow of energy and the rational order which pervades it  we have climbed our beanstalk and have reached a wonderland in which the common and the familiar become things new and strange in the exploration of the cosmic process thus typified the highest intelligence of man finds inexhaustible employment giants are subdued to our service and the spiritual affections of the contemplative philosopher are engaged by beauties worthy of eternal constancy  but there is another aspect of the cosmic process so perfect as a mechanism so beautiful as a work of art where the cosmopoietic energy 51 works through sentient beings there arises among its other manifestations that which we call pain or suffering this baleful product of evolution increases in quantity and in intensity with advancing grades of animal organization until it attains its highest level in man further the consummation is not reached in man the mere animal nor in man the whole or half savage but only in man the member of an organized polity and it is a necessary consequence of his attempt to live in this way that is under those conditions which are essential to the full development of his noblest powers  man the animal in fact has worked his way to the headship of the sentient world and has become the superb animal which he is in virtue of his success in the struggle for existence the conditions having been of a certain order mans organization has adjusted itself to them better than that of his competitors in the cosmic strife in the case of mankind the selfassertion the unscrupulous seizing upon all that can be grasped the tenacious holding of all that can be kept which constitute the essence of the struggle for existence have answered for his successful progress throughout the savage state man has been largely indebted to those qualities which he shares with the ape and the tiger his exceptional physical organization his cunning his sociability his curiosity and his imitativeness his ruthless and 52 ferocious destructiveness when his anger is roused by opposition  but in proportion as men have passed from anarchy to social organization and in proportion as civilization has grown in worth these deeply ingrained serviceable qualities have become defects after the manner of successful persons civilized man would gladly kick down the ladder by which he has climbed he would be only too pleased to see the ape and tiger die but they decline to suit his convenience and the unwelcome intrusion of these boon companions of his hot youth into the ranged existence of civil life adds pains and griefs innumerable and immeasurably great to those which the cosmic process necessarily brings on the mere animal in fact civilized man brands all these ape and tiger promptings with the name of sins he punishes many of the acts which flow from them as crimes and in extreme cases he does his best to put an end to the survival of the fittest of former days by axe and rope  i have said that civilized man has reached this point the assertion is perhaps too broad and general i had better put it that ethical man has attained thereto the science of ethics professes to furnish us with a reasoned rule of life to tell us what is right action and why it is so  whatever differences of opinion may exist among experts there is a general consensus that the ape and 53 tiger methods of the struggle for existence are not reconcilable with sound ethical principles  the hero of our story descended the beanstalk and came back to the common world where fare and work were alike hard where ugly competitors were much commoner than beautiful princesses and where the everlasting battle with self was much less sure to be crowned with victory than a turnto with a giant we have done the like thousands upon thousands of our fellows thousands of years ago have preceded us in finding themselves face to face with the same dread problem of evil they also have seen that the cosmic process is evolution that it is full of wonder full of beauty and at the same time full of pain they have sought to discover the bearing of these great facts on ethics to find out whether there is or is not a sanction for morality in the ways of the cosmos  theories of the universe in which the conception of evolution plays a leading part were extant at least six centuries before our era certain knowledge of them in the fifth century reaches us from localities as distant as the valley of the ganges and the asiatic coasts of the aegean to the early philosophers of hindostan no less than to those of ionia the salient and characteristic feature of the phenomenal world was its 54 changefulness the unresting flow of all things through birth to visible being and thence to not being in which they could discern no sign of a beginning and for which they saw no prospect of an ending it was no less plain to some of these antique forerunners of modern philosophy that suffering is the badge of all the tribe of sentient things that it is no accidental accompaniment but an essential constituent of the cosmic process the energetic greek might find fierce joys in a world in which strife is father and king but the old aryan spirit was subdued to quietism in the indian sage the mist of suffering which spread over humanity hid everything else from his view to him life was one with suffering and suffering with life  in hindostan as in ionia a period of relatively high and tolerably stable civilization had succeeded long ages of semibarbarism and struggle out of wealth and security had come leisure and refinement and close at their heels had followed the malady of thought to the struggle for bare existence which never ends though it may be alleviated and partially disguised for a fortunate few succeeded the struggle to make existence intelligible and to bring the order of things into harmony with the moral sense of man which also never ends but for the thinking few becomes keen er with every increase of knowledge and with every step towards the realization of a worthy ideal of life  55 two thousand five hundred years ago the value of civilization was as apparent as it is now then as now it was obvious that only in the garden of an orderly polity can the finest fruits humanity is capable of bearing be produced but it had also become evident that the blessings of culture were not unmixed the garden was apt to turn into a hothouse the stimulation of the senses the pampering of the emotions endlessly multiplied the sources of pleasure the constant widening of the intellectual field indefinitely extended the range of that especially human faculty of looking before and after which adds to the fleeting present those old and new worlds of the past and the future wherein men dwell the more the higher their culture  but that very sharpening of the sense and that subtle refinement of emotion which brought such a wealth of pleasures were fatally attended by a proportional enlargement of the capacity for suffering and the divine faculty of imagination while it created new heavens and new earths provided them with the corresponding hells of futile regret for the past and morbid anxiety for the future note 3 finally the inevitable penalty of overstimulation exhaustion opened the gates of civilization to its great enemy ennui the stale and flat weariness when man delightsnot nor woman neither when all things are vanity and vexation and life seems not worth living except to escape the bore of dying  56 even purely intellectual progress brings about its revenges problems settled in a rough and ready way by rude men absorbed in action demand renewed attention and show themselves to be still unread riddles when men have time to think the beneficent demon doubt whose name is legion and who dwells amongst the tombs of old faiths enters into mankind and thenceforth refuses to be cast out sacred customs venerable dooms of ancestral wisdom hallowed by tradition and professing to hold good for all time are put to the question cultured reflection asks for their credentials judges them by its own standards finally gathers those of which it approves into ethical systems in which the reasoning is rarely much more than a decent pretext for the adoption of foregone conclusions  one of the oldest and most important elements in such systems is the conception of justice society is impossible unless those who are associated agree to observe certain rules of conduct towards one another its stability depends on the steadiness with which they abide by that agreement and so far as they waver that mutual trust which is the bond of society is weakened or destroyed wolves could not hunt in packs except for the real though unexpressed understanding that they should not attack one another during the chase the most rudimentary polity is a pack of men living under the like tacit or expressed 57 understanding and having made the very important advance upon wolf society that they agree to use the force of the whole body against individuals who violate it and in favour of those who observe it this observance of a common understanding with the consequent distribution of punishments and rewards according to accepted rules received the name of justice while the contrary was called injustice early ethics did not take much note of the animus of the violator of the rules  but civilization could not advance far without the establishment of a capital distinction between the case of involuntary and that of wilful misdeed between a merely wrong action and a guilty one and with increasing refinement of moral appreciation the problem of desert which arises out of this distinction acquired more and more theoretical and practical importance if life must be given for life yet it was recognized that the unintentional slayer did not altogether deserve death and by a sort of compromise between the public and the private conception of justice a sanctuary was provided in which he might take refuge from the avenger of blood  the idea of justice thus underwent a gradual sublimation from punishment and reward according to acts to punishment and reward according to desert or in other words according to motive righteousness that is action from right motive 58 not only became synonymous with justice but the positive constituent of innocence and the very heart of goodness  now when the ancient sage whether indian or greek who had attained to this conception of goodness looked the world and especially human life in the face he found it as hard as we do to bring the course of evolution into harmony with even the elementary requirement of the ethical ideal of the just and the good  if there is one thing plainer than another it is that neither the pleasures nor the pains of life in the merely animal world are distributed according to desert for it is admittedly impossible for the lower orders of sentient beings to deserve either the one or the other if there is a generalization from the facts of human life which has the assent of thoughtful men in every age and country it is that the violator of ethical rules constantly escapes the punishment which he deserves that the wicked flourishes like a green bay tree while the righteous begs his bread that the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children that in the realm of nature ignorance is punished just as severely as wilful wrong and that thousands upon thousands of innocent beings suffer for the crime or the unintentional trespass of one  greek and semite and indian are agreed upon 59 this subject the book of job is at one with the works and days and the buddhist sutras the psalmist and the preacher of israel with the tragic poets of greece what is a more common motive of the ancient tragedy in fact than the unfathomable injustice of the nature of things what is more deeply felt to be true than its presentation of the destruction of the blameless by the work of his own hands or by the fatal operation of the sins of others  surely oedipus was pure of heart it was the natural sequence of eventsthe cosmic processwhich drove him in all innocence to slay his father and become the husband of his mother to the desolation of his people and his own headlong ruin or to step for a moment beyond the chronological limits i have set myself what constitutes the sempiternal attraction of hamlet but the appeal to deepest experience of that history of a no less blameless dreamer dragged in spite of himself into a world out of joint involved in a tangle of crime and misery created by one of the prime agents of the cosmic process as it works in and through man  thus brought before the tribunal of ethics the cosmos might well seem to stand condemned the conscience of man revolted against the moral indifference of nature and the microcosmic atom should have found the illimitable macrocosm guilty but few or none ventured to record that verdict  60 in the great semitic trial of this issue job takes refuge in silence and submission the indian and the greek less wise perhaps attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable and plead for the defendant to this end the greeks invented theodicies while the indians devised what in its ultimate form must rather be termed a cosmodicy for although buddhism recognizes gods many and lords many they are products of the cosmic process and transitory however long enduring manifestations of its eternal activity  in the doctrine of transmigration whatever its origin brahminical and buddhist speculation found ready to handnote 4 the means of constructing a plausible vindication of the ways of the cosmos to man if this world is full of pain and sorrow if grief and evil fall like the rain upon both the just and the unjust it is because like the rain they are links in the endless chain of natural causation by which past present and future are indissolubly connected and there is no more injustice in the one case than in the other every sentient being is reaping as it has sown if not in this life then in one or other of the infinite series of antecedent existences of which it is the latest term the present distribution of good and evil is therefore the algebraical sum of accumulated positive and negative deserts or rather it depends on the floating balance of the account for it was not thought necessary that a complete settlement 61 should ever take place arrears might stand over as a sort of hanging gale a period of celestial happiness just earned might be succeeded by ages of torment in a hideous nether world the balance still overdue for some remote ancestral error note 5  whether the cosmic process looks any more moral than at first after such a vindication may perhaps be questioned yet this plea of justification is not less plausible than others and none but very hasty thinkers will reject it on the ground of inherent absurdity like the doctrine of evolution itself that of transmigration has its roots in the world of reality and it may claim such support as the great argument from analogy is capable of supplying  everyday experience familiarizes us with the facts which are grouped under the name of heredity every one of us bears upon him obvious marks of his parentage perhaps of remoter relationships more particularly the sum of tendencies to act in a certain way which we call character is often to be traced through a long series of progenitors and collaterals so we may justly say that this characterthis moral and intellectual essence of a mandoes veritably pass over from one fleshly tabernacle to another and does really transmigrate from generation to generation in the newborn infant the character of the stock lies latent and the ego is little more 62 than a bundle of potentialities but very early these become acutalities from childhood to age they manifest themselves in dulness or brightness weakness or strength viciousness or uprightness and with each feature modified by confluence with another character if by nothing else the character passed on to its incarnation in new bodies  the indian philosophers called character as thus defined karmanote 6 it is this karma which passed from life to life and linked them in the chain of transmigrations and they held that it is modified in each life not merely by confluence of parentage but by its own acts they were in fact strong believers in the theory so much disputed just at present of the hereditary transmission of acquired characters that the manifestation of the tendencies of a character may be greatly facilitated or impeded by conditions of which selfdiscipline or the absence of it are among the most important is indubitable but that the character itself is modified in this way is by no means so certain it is not so sure that the transmitted character of an evil liver is worse or that of a righteous man better than that which he received indian philosophy however did not admit of any doubt on this subject the belief in the influence of conditions notably of selfdiscipline on the karma was not merely a necessary postulate of its theory of retribution but it presented 63 the only way of escape from the endless round of transmigrations  the earlier forms of indian philosophy agreed with those prevalent in our own times in supposing the existence of a permanent reality or substance beneath the shifting series of phenomena whether of matter or of mind the substance of the cosmos was brahma that of the individual man atman and the latter was separated from the former only if i may so speak by its phenomenal envelope by the casing of sensations thoughts and desires pleasures and pains which make up the illusive phantasmagoria of life this the ignorant take for reality their atman therefore remains eternally imprisoned in delusions bound by the fetters of desire and scourged by the whip of misery but the man who has attained enlightenment sees that the apparent reality is mere illusion or as was said a couple of thousand years later that there is nothing good nor bad but thinking makes it so if the cosmos is just and of our pleasant vices makes instruments to scourge us it would seem that the only way to escape from our heritage of evil is to destroy that fountain of desire whence our vices flow to refuse any longer to be the instruments of the evolutionary process and withdraw from the struggle for existence if the karma is modifiable by selfdiscipline if its coarser desires one after another can be extinguished the ultimate 64 fundamental desire of selfassertion or the desire to be may also be destroyed note 7 then the bubble of illusion will burst and the freed individual atman will lose itself in the universal brahma  such seems to have been the prebuddhistic conception of salvation and of the way to be followed by those who would attain thereto no more thorough mortification of the flesh has ever been attempted thanthat achieved by the indian ascetic anchorite no later monachism has so nearly succeeded in reducing the human mind to that condition of impassive quasisomnambulism which but for its acknowledged holiness might run the risk of being confounded with idiocy  and this salvation it will be observed was to be attained through knowledge and by action based on that knowledge just as the experimenter who would obtain a certain physical or chemical result must have a knowledge of the natural laws involved and the persistent disciplined will adequate to carry out all the various operations required the supernatural in our sense of the term was entirely excluded there was no external power which could affect the sequence of cause and effect which gives rise to karma none but the will of the subject of the karma which could put an end to it  only one rule of conduct could be based upon the remarkable theory of which i have endeavoured to give a reasoned outline it was folly to continue 65 to exist when an overplus of pain was certain and the probabilities in favour of the increase of misery with the prolongation of existence were so overwhelming slaying the body only made matters worse there was nothing for it but to slay the soul by the voluntary arrest of all its activities  property social ties family affections common companionship must be abandoned the most natural appetites even that for food must be suppressed or at least minimized until all that remained of a man was the impassive extenuated mendicant monk selfhypnotised into cataleptic trances which the deluded mystic took for foretastes of the final union with brahma  the founder of buddhism accepted the chief postulates demanded by his predecessors but he was not satisfied with the practical annihilation involved in merging the individual existence in the unconditionedthe atman in brahma it would seem that the admission of the existence of any substance whatevereven of the tenuity of that which has neither quality nor energy and of which no predicate whatever can be assertedappeared to him to be a danger and a snare though reduced to a hypostatized negation brahma was not to be trusted so long as entity was there it might conceivably resume the weary round of evolution with all its train of immeasurable miseries gautama got rid of even that 66 shade of a shadow of permanent existence by a metaphysical tour de force of great interest to the student of philosophy seeing that it supplies the wanting half of bishop berkeleys wellknown idealistic argument  granting the premises i am not aware of any escape from berkeleys conclusion that the substance of matter is a metaphysical unknown quantity of the existence of which there is no proof what berkeley does not seem to have so clearly perceived is that the nonexistence of a substance of mind is equally arguable and that the result of the impartial applications of his reasonings is the reduction of the all to coexistences and sequences of phenomena beneath and beyond which there is nothing cognoscible it is a remarkable indication of the subtlety of indian speculation that gautama should have seen deeper than the greatest of modern idealists though it must be admitted that if some of berkeleys reasonings respecting the nature of spirit are pushed home they reach pretty much the same conclusion note 8  accepting the prevalent brahminical doctrine that the whole cosmos celestial terrestrial and infernal with its population of gods and other celestial beings of sentient animals of mara and his devils is incessantly shifting through recurring cycles of production and destruction in each of which every human being has his transmigratory 67 representative gautama proceeded to eliminate substance altogether and to reduce the cosmos to a mere flow of sensations emotions volitions and thoughts devoid of any substratum as on the surface of a stream of water we see ripples and whirlpools which last for a while and then vanish with the causes that gave rise to them so what seem individual existences are mere temporary associations of phenomena circling round a centre like a dog tied to a post in the whole universe there is nothing permanent no eternal substance either of mind or of matter personality is a metaphysical fancy and in very truth not only we but all things in the worlds without end of the cosmic phantasmagoria are such stuff as dreams are made of  what then becomes of karma karma remains untouched as the peculiar form of energy we call magnetism may be transmitted from a loadstone to a piece of steel from the steel to a piece of nickel as it may be strengthened or weakened by the conditions to which it is subjected while resident in each piece so it seems to have been conceived that karma might be transmitted from one phenomenal association to another by a sort of induction however this may be gautama doubtless had a better guarantee for the abolition of transmigration when no wrack of substance either of atman or of brahma was left behind when in short a man had but to 68 dream that he willed not to dream to put an end to all dreaming  this end of lifes dream is nirvana what nirvana is the learned do not agree but since the best original authorities tell us there is neither desire nor activity nor any possibility of phenomenal reappearance for the sage who has entered nirvana it may be safely said of this acme of buddhistic philosophythe rest is silence  note 9 thus there is no very great practical disagreement between gautama and his predecessors with respect to the end of action but it is otherwise as regards the means to that end with just insight into human nature gautama declared extreme ascetic practices to be useless and indeed harmful  the appetites and the passions are not to be abolished by mere mortification of the body they must in addition be attacked on their own ground and conquered by steady cultivation of the mental habits which oppose them by universal benevolence by the return of good for evil by humility by abstinence from evil thought in short by total renunciation of that selfassertion which is the essence of the cosmic process  doubtless it is to these ethical qualities that buddhism owes its marvellous successnote 10 a system which knows no god in the western sense which denies a soul to man which counts the belief in immortality a blunder and the hope of it a sin 69 which refuses any efficacy to prayer and sacrifice which bids men look to nothing but their own efforts for salvation which in its original purity knew nothing of vows of obedience abhorred intolerance and never sought the aid of the secular arm yet spread over a considerable moiety of the old world with marvellous rapidity and is still with whatever base admixture of foreign superstitions the dominant creed of a large fraction of mankind  let us now set our faces westwards towards asia minor and greece and italy to view the rise and progress of another philosophy apparently independent but no less pervaded by the conception of evolutionnote 11  the sages of miletus were pronounced evolutionists and however dark may be some of the sayings of heracleitus of ephesus who was probably a contemporary of gautama no better expressions of the essence of the modern doctrine of evolution can be found than are presented by some of his pithy aphorisms and striking metaphors note 12 indeed many of my present auditors must have observed that more than once i have borrowed from him in the brief exposition of the theory of evolution with which this discourse commenced  but when the focus of greek intellectual activity shifted to athens the leading minds 70 concentrated their attention upon ethical problems  forsaking the study of the macrocosm for that of the microcosm they lost the key to the thought of the great ephesian which i imagine is more intelligible to us than it was to socrates or to plato socrates more especially set the fashion of a kind of inverse agnosticism by teaching that the problems of physics lie beyond the reach of the human intellect that the attempt to solve them is essentially vain that the one worthy object of investigation is the problem of ethical life and his example was followed by the cynics and the later stoics even the comprehensive knowledge and the penetrating intellect of aristotle failed to suggest to him that in holding the eternity of the world within its present range of mutation he was making a retrogressive step the scientific heritage of heracleitus passed into the hands neither of plato nor of aristotle but into those of democritus but the world was not yet ready to receive the great conceptions of the philosopher of abdera it was reserved for the stoics to return to the track marked out by the earlier philosophers and professing themselves disciples of heracleitus to develop the idea of evolution systematically in doing this they not only omitted some characteristic features of their masters teaching but they made additions altogether foreign to it one of the most influential of these importations was the transcendental 71 theism which had come into vogue the restless fiery energy operating according to law out of which all things emerge and into which they return in the endless successive cycles of the great year which creates and destroys worlds as a wanton child builds up and anon levels sand castles on the seashore was metamorphosed into a material worldsoul and decked out with all the attributes of ideal divinity not merely with infinite power and transcendent wisdom but with absolute goodness  the consequences of this step were momentous for if the cosmos is the effect of an immanent omnipotent and infinitely beneficent cause the existence in it of real evil still less of necessarily inherent evil is plainly inadmissible note 13 yet the universal experience of mankind testified then as now that whether we look within us or without us evil stares us in the face on all sides that if anything is real pain and sorrow and wrong are realities  it would be a new thing in history if a priori philosophers were daunted by the factious opposition of experience and the stoics were the last men to allow themselves to be beaten by mere facts give me a doctrine and i will find the reasons for it said chrysippus so they perfected if they did not invent that ingenious and plausible form of pleading the theodicy for the purpose of showing firstly that there is no such 72 thing as evil secondly that if there is it is the necessary correlate of good and moreover that it is either due to our own fault or inflicted for our benefit theodicies have been very popular in their time and i believe that a numerous though somewhat dwarfed progeny of them still survives so far as i know they are all variations of the theme set forth in those famous six lines of the essay on man in which pope sums up bolingbrokes reminiscences of stoical and other speculations of this kind      all nature is but art unknown to thee      all chance direction which thou canst not see      all discord harmony not understood      all partial evil universal good      and spite of pride in erring reasons spite      one truth is clear whatever is is right  yet surely if there are few more important truths than those enunciated in the first triad the second is open to very grave objections that there is a soul of good in things evil is unquestionable nor will any wise man deny the disciplinary value of pain and sorrow but these considerations do not help us to see why the immense multitude of irresponsible sentient beings which cannot profit by such discipline should suffer nor why among the endless possibilities open to omnipotencethat of sinless happy existence among the restthe actuality in which sin and misery abound should be that selected  73 surely it is mere cheap rhetoric to call arguments which have never yet been answered by even the meekest and the least rational of optimists suggestions of the pride of reason as to the concluding aphorism its fittest place would be as an inscription in letters of mud over the portal of some stye of epicurusnote 14 for that is where the logical application of it to practice would land men with every aspiration stifled and every effort paralyzed why try to set right what is right already why strive to improve the best of all possible worlds let us eat and drink for as today all is right so tomorrow all will be  but the attempt of the stoics to blind themselves to the reality of evil as a necessary concomitant of the cosmic process had less success than that of the indian philosophers to exclude the reality of good from their purview  unfortunately it is much easier to shut ones eyes to good than to evil  pain and sorrow knock at our doors more loudly than pleasure and happiness and the prints of their heavy footsteps are less easily effaced before the grim realities of practical life the pleasant fictions of optimism vanished  if this were the best of all possible worlds it nevertheless proved itself a very inconvenient habitation for the ideal sage  the stoical summary of the whole duty of man live according to nature would seem to imply that the cosmic process is an exemplar for human 74 conduct ethics would thus become applied natural history in fact a confused employment of the maxim in this sense has done immeasurable mischief in later times it has furnished an axiomatic foundation for the philosophy of philosophasters and for the moralizing of sentimentalists but the stoics were at bottom not merely noble but sane men and if we look closely into what they really meant by this illused phrase it will be found to present no justification for the mischievous conclusions that have been deduced from it  in the language of the stoa nature was a word of many meanings there was the nature of the cosmos and the nature of man in the latter the animal nature which man shares with a moiety of the living part of the cosmos was distinguished from a higher nature even in this higher nature there were grades of rank the logical faculty is an instrument which may be turned to account for any purpose the passions and the emotions are so closely tied to the lower nature that they may be considered to be pathological rather than normal phenomena the one supreme hegemonic faculty which constitutes the essential nature of man is most nearly represented by that which in the language of a later philosophy has been called the pure reason it is this nature which holds up the ideal of the supreme good and demands absolute submission of the will to its behests it is 75 which commands all men to love one another to return good for evil to regard one another as fellowcitizens of one great state indeed seeing that the progress towards perfection of a civilized state or polity depends on the obedience of its members to these commands the stoics sometimes termed the pure reason the political nature unfortunately the sense of the adjective has undergone so much modification that the application of it to that which commands the sacrifice of self to the common good would now sound almost grotesque note 15  but what part is played by the theory of evolution in this view of ethics  so far as i can discern the ethical system of the stoics which is essentially intuitive and reverences the categorical imperative as strongly as that of any later moralists might have been just what it was if they had held any other theory whether that of special creation on the one side or that of the eternal existence of the present order on the othernote 16 to the stoic the cosmos had no importance for the conscience except in so far as he chose to think it a pedagogue to virtue the pertinacious optimism of our philosophers hid from them the actual state of the case it prevented them from seeing that cosmic nature is no school of virtue but the headquarters of the enemy of ethical nature the logic of facts was necessary to convince them 76 that the cosmos works through the lower nature of man not for righteousness but against it and it finally drove them to confess that the existence of their ideal wise man was incompatible with the nature of things that even a passable approximation to that ideal was to be attained only at the cost of renunciation of the world and mortification not merely of the flesh but of all human affections the state of perfection was that apatheianote 17 in which desire though it may still be felt is powerless to move the will reduced to the sole function of executing the commands of pure reason even this residuum of activity was to be regarded as a temporary loan as an efflux of the divine worldpervading spirit chafing at its imprisonment in the fleshuntil such time as death enabled it to return to its source in the allpervading logos  i find it difficult to discover any very great difference between apatheia and nirvana except that stoical speculation agrees with prebuddhistic philosophy rather than with the teachings of gautama in so far as it postulates a permanent substance equivalent to brahma and atman and that in stoical practice the adoption of the life of the mendicant cynic was held to be more a counsel of perfection than an indispensable condition of the higher life  thus the extremes touch greek thought and 77 indian thought set out from ground common to both diverge widely develop under very different physical and moral conditions and finally converge to practically the same end  the vedas and the homeric epos set before us a world of rich and vigorous life full of joyous fighting men       that ever with a frolic welcome took      the thunder and the sunshine   and who were ready to brave the very gods themselves when their blood was up a few centuries pass away and under the influence of civilization the descendants of these men are sicklied oer with the pale cast of thoughtfrank pessimists or at best makebelieve optimists the courage of the warlike stock may be as hardly tried as before perhaps more hardly but the enemy is self the hero has become a monk the man of action is replaced by the quietist whose highest aspiration is to be the passive instrument of the divine reason by the tiber as by the ganges ethical man admits that the cosmos is too strong for him and destroying every bond which ties him to it by ascetic discipline he seeks salvation in absolute renunciationnote 18  modern thought is making a fresh start from the base whence indian and greek philosophy set out and the human mind being very much what 78 it was sixandtwenty centuries ago there is no ground for wonder if it presents indications of a tendency to move along the old lines to the same results  we are more than sufficiently familiar with modern pessimism at least as a speculation for i cannot call to mind that any of its present votaries have sealed their faith by assuming the rags and the bowl of the mendicant bhikku or the cloak and the wallet of the cynic the obstacles placed in the way of sturdy vagrancy by an unphilosophical police have perhaps proved too formidable for philosophical consistency we also know modern speculative optimism with its perfectibility of the species reign of peace and lion and lamb transformation scenes but one does not hear so much of it as one did forty years ago indeed i imagine it is to be met with more commonly at the tables of the healthy and wealthy than in the congregations of the wise the majority of us i apprehend profess neither pessimism nor optimism we hold that the world is neither so good nor so bad as it conceivably might be and as most of us have reason now and again to discover that it can be those who have failed to experience the joys that make life worth living are probably in as small a minority as those who have never known the griefs that rob existence of its savour and turn its richest fruits into mere dust and ashes  79 further i think i do not err in assuming that however diverse their views on philosophical and religious matters most men are agreed that the proportion of good and evil in life may be very sensibly affected by human action i never heard anybody doubt that the evil may be thus increased or diminished and it would seem to follow that good must be similarly susceptible of addition or subtraction finally to my knowledge nobody professes to doubt that so far forth as we possess a power of bettering things it is our paramount duty to use it and to train all our intellect and energy to this supreme service of our kind  hence the pressing interest of the question to what extent modern progress in natural knowledge and more especially the general outcome of that progress in the doctrine of evolution is competent to help us in the great work of helping one another  the propounders of what are called the ethics of evolution when the evolution of ethics would usually better express the object of their speculations adduce a number of more or less interesting facts and more or less sound arguments in favour of the origin of the moral sentiments in the same way as other natural phenomena by a process of evolution i have little doubt for my own part that they are on the right track but as the immoral sentiments have no less been evolved there is so far as much natural sanction for the 80 one as the other the thief and the murderer follow nature just as much as the philanthropist cosmic evolution may teach us how the good and the evil tendencies of man may have come about but in itself it is incompetent to furnish any better reason why what we call good is preferable to what we call evil than we had before some day i doubt not we shall arrive at an understanding of the evolution of the aesthetic faculty but all the understanding in the world will neither increase nor diminish the force of the intuition that this is beautiful and that is ugly  there is another fallacy which appears to me to pervade the socalled ethics of evolution it is the notion that because on the whole animals and plants have advanced in perfection of organization by means of the struggle for existence and the consequent survival of the fittest therefore men in society men as ethical beings must look to the same process to help them towards perfection i suspect that this fallacy has arisen out of the unfortunate ambiguity of the phrase survival of the fittest fittest has a connotation of best and about best there hangs a moral flavour in cosmic nature however what is fittest depends upon the conditions long since note 19 i ventured to point out that if our hemisphere were to cool again the survival of the fittest might bring about in the vegetable kingdom a population of more and more stunted and humbler 81 and humbler organisms until the fittest that survived might be nothing but lichens diatoms and such microscopic organisms as those which give red snow its colour while if it became hotter the pleasant valleys of the thames and isis might be uninhabitable by any animated beings save those that flourish in a tropical jungle they as the fittest the best adapted to the changed conditions would survive  men in society are undoubtedly subject to the cosmic process as among other animals multiplication goes on without cessation and involves severe competition for the means of support the struggle for existence tends to eliminate those less fitted to adapt themselves to the circumstances of their existence the strongest the most selfassertive tend to tread down the weaker but the influence of the cosmic process on the evolution of society is the greater the more rudimentary its civilization  social progress means a checking of the cosmic process at every step and the substitution for it of another which may be called the ethical process the end of which is not the survival of those who may happen to be the fittest in respect of the whole of the conditions which obtain but of those who are ethically the bestnote 20  as i have already urged the practice of that which is ethically bestwhat we call goodness or virtueinvolves a course of conduct which in all 82 respects is opposed to that which leads to success in the cosmic struggle for existence in place of ruthless selfassertion it demands selfrestraint in place of thrusting aside or treading down all competitors it requires that the individual shall not merely respect but shall help his fellows its influence is directed not so much to the survival of the fittest as to the fitting of as many as possible to survive it repudiates the gladiatorial theory of existence it demands that each man who enters into the enjoyment of the advantages of a polity shall be mindful of his debt to those who have laboriously constructed it and shall take heed that no act of his weakens the fabric in which he has been permitted to live laws and moral precepts are directed to the end of curbing the cosmic process and reminding the individual of his duty to the community to the protection and influence of which he owes if not existence itself at least the life of something better than a brutal savage  it is from neglect of these plain considerations that the fanatical individualism note 21 of our time attempts to apply the analogy of cosmic nature to society once more we have a misapplication of the stoical injunction to follow nature the duties of the individual to the state are forgotten and his tendencies to selfassertion are dignified by the name of rights it is seriously debated whether the members of a community are justified in using 83 their combined strength to constrain one of their number to contribute his share to the maintenance of it or even to prevent him from doing his best to destroy it the struggle for existence which has done such admirable work in cosmic nature must it appears be equally beneficent in the ethical sphere yet if that which i have insisted upon is true if the cosmic process has no sort of relation to moral ends if the imitation of it by man is inconsistent with the first principles of ethics what becomes of this surprising theory  let us understand once for all that the ethical progress of society depends not on imitating the cosmic process still less in running away from it but in combating it it may seem an audacious proposal thus to pit the microcosm against the macrocosm and to set man to subdue nature to his higher ends but i venture to think that the great intellectual difference between the ancient times with which we have been occupied and our day lies in the solid foundation we have acquired for the hope that such an enterprise may meet with a certain measure of success  the history of civilization details the steps by which men have succeeded in building up an artificial world within the cosmos fragile reed as he may be man as pascal says is a thinking reed note 22 there lies within him a fund of energy operating intelligently and so far akin to that which pervades the universe that it is competent 84 to influence and modify the cosmic process in virtue of his intelligence the dwarf bends the titan to his will in every family in every polity that has been established the cosmic process in man has been restrained and otherwise modified by law and custom in surrounding nature it has been similarly influenced by the art of the shepherd the agriculturist the artisan as civilization has advanced so has the extent of this interference increased until the organized and highly developed sciences and arts of the present day have endowed man with a command over the course of nonhuman nature greater than that once attributed to the magicians the most impressive i might say startling of these changes have been brought about in the course of the last two centuries while a right comprehension of the process of life and of the means of influencing its manifestations is only just dawning upon us  we do not yet see our way beyond generalities and we are befogged by the obtrusion of false analogies and crude anticipations but astronomy physics chemistry have all had to pass through similar phases before they reached the stage at which their influence became an important factor in human affairs physiology psychology ethics political science must submit to the same ordeal yet it seems to me irrational to doubt that at no distant period they will work as great a revolution in the sphere of practice  85 the theory of evolution encourages no millennial anticipations if for millions of years our globe has taken the upward road yet some time the summit will be reached and the downward route will be commenced the most daring imagination will hardly venture upon the suggestion that the power and the intelligence of man can ever arrest the procession of the great year  moreover the cosmic nature born with us and to a large extent necessary for our maintenance is the outcome of millions of years of severe training and it would be folly to imagine that a few centuries will suffice to subdue its masterfulness to purely ethical ends ethical nature may count upon having to reckon with a tenacious and powerful enemy as long as the world lasts but on the other hand i see no limit to the extent to which intelligence and will guided by sound principles of investigation and organized in common effort may modify the conditions of existence for a period longer than that now covered by history and much may be done to change the nature of man himself note 23 the intelligence which has converted the brother of the wolf into the faithful guardian of the flock ought to be able to do something towards curbing the instincts of savagery in civilized men  but if we may permit ourselves at larger hope of abatement of the essential evil of the world than was possible to those who in the infancy of 86 exact knowledge faced the problem of existence more than a score of centuries ago i deem it an essential condition of the realization of that hope that we should cast aside the notion that the escape from pain and sorrow is the proper object of life  we have long since emerged from the heroic childhood of our race when good and evil could be met with the same frolic welcome the attempts to escape from evil whether indian or greek have ended in flight from the battlefield it remains to us to throw aside the youthful overconfidence and the no less youthful discouragement of nonage we are grown men and must play the man       strong in will      to strive to seek to find and not to yield  cherishing the good that falls in our way and bearing the evil in and around us with stout hearts set on diminishing it so far we all may strive in one faith towards one hope        it may be that the gulfs will wash us down      it may be we shall touch the happy isles        but something ere the end      some work of noble note may yet be done note 24  187                                 notes  note 1 p 49  i have been careful to speak of the appearance of cyclical evolution presented by living things for on critical examination it will be found that the course of vegetable and of animal life is not exactly represented by the figure of a cycle which returns into itself what actually happens in all but the lowest organisms is that one part of the growing germ a gives rise to tissues and organs while another part b remains in its primitive condition or is but slightly modified the moiety a becomes the body of the adult and sooner or later perishes while portions of the moiety b are detached and as offspring continue the life of the species  thus if we trace back an organism along the direct line of descent from its remotest ancestor b as a whole has never suffered death portions of it only have been cast off and died in each individual offspring  everybody is familiar with the way in which the suckers of a strawberry plant behave a thin cylinder of living tissue keeps on growing at its free end until it attains a considerable length at 88 successive intervals it develops buds which grow into strawberry plants and these become independent by the death of the parts of the sucker which connect them the rest of the sucker however may go on living and growing indefinitely and circumstances remaining favourable there is no obvious reason why it should ever die the living substance b in a manner answers to the sucker if we could restore the continuity which was once possessed by the portions of b contained in all the individuals of a direct line of descent they would form a sucker or stolon on which these individuals would be strung and which would never have wholly died  a species remains unchanged so long as the potentiality of development resident in b remains unaltered so long eg as the buds of the strawberry sucker tend to become typical strawberry plants in the case of the progressive evolution of a species the developmental potentiality of b becomes of a higher and higher order in retrogressive evolution the contrary would be the case the phenomena of atavism seem to show that retrogressive evolution that is the return of a species to one or other of its earlier forms is a possibility to be reckoned with the simplification of structure which is so common in the parasitic members of a group however does not properly come under this head the wormlike limbless lernoea has no resemblance to any of the stages of development of the manylimbed active animals of the group to which it belongs 89 note 2 p 49  heracleitus saysgreek phrase potamo gar ouk esti dis embenai to suto but to be strictly accurate the river remains though the

life more deeply than multa bona nostra nobis nocent if there is a soul of good in things evil it is at least equally true that there is a soul of evil in things good for things like men have les defauts de leurs qualites it is one of the last lessons one learns from experience but not the least important that a 90 heavy tax is levied upon all forms of success and that failure is one of the commonest disguises assumed by blessings  note 4 p 60  there is within the body of every man a soul which at the death of the body flies away from it like a bird out of a cage and enters upon a new life  either in one of the heavens or one of the hells or on this earth  the only exception is the rare case of a man having in this life acquired a true knowledge of god according to the prebuddhistic theory the soul of such a man goes along the path of the gods to god and being united with him enters upon an immortal life in which his individuality is not extinguished in the latter theory his soul is directly absorbed into the great soul is lost in it and has no longer any independent existence the souls of all other men enter after the death of the body upon a new existence in one or other of the many different modes of being if in heaven or hell the soul itself becomes a god or demon without entering a body all superhuman beings save the great gods being looked upon as not eternal but merely temporary creatures if the soul returns to earth it may or may not enter a new body and this either of a human being an animal a plant or even a material object for all these are possessed of souls and there is no essential difference between these souls and the souls of menall being alike mere sparks of the great spirit who is 91 the only real existence rhys davids hibbert lectures 1881 p 83  for what i have said about indian philosophy i am particularly indebted to the luminous exposition of primitive buddhism and its relations to earlier hindu thought which is given by prof rhys davids in his remarkable hibbert lectures for 1881 and buddhism 1890 the only apology i can offer for the freedom with which i have borrowed from him in these notes is my desire to leave no doubt as to my indebtedness i have also found dr oldenbergs buddha ed 2 1890 very helpful the origin of the theory of transmigration stated in the above extract is an unsolved problem that it differs widely from the egyptian metempsychosis is clear in fact since men usually people the other world with phantoms of this the egyptian doctrine would seem to presuppose the indian as a more archaic belief  prof rhys davids has fully insisted upon the ethical importance of the transmigration theory one of the latest speculations now being put forward among ourselves would seek to explain each mans character and even his outward condition in life by the character he inherited from his ancestors a character gradually formed during a practically endless series of past existences modified only by the conditions into which he was born those very conditions being also in like manner the last result of a practically endless series of past causes gotamas speculation might be stated in the same words but it attempted also to explain in a way different from 92 that which would be adopted by the exponents of the modern theory that strange problem which it is also the motive of the wonderful drama of the book of job to explainthe fact that the actual distribution here of good fortune or misery is entirely independent of the moral qualities which men call good or bad we cannot wonder that a teacher whose whole system was so essentially an ethical reformation should have felt it incumbent upon him to seek an explanation of this apparent injustice and all the more so since the belief he had inherited the theory of the transmigration of souls had provided a solution perfectly sufficient to any one who could accept that belief hibbert lectures p 93 i should venture to suggest the substitution of largely for entirely in the foregoing passage whether a ship makes a good or a bad voyage is largely independent of the conduct of the captain but it is largely affected by that conduct though powerless before a hurricane he may weather a bad gale  note 5 p 61  the outward condition of the soul is in each new birth determined by its actions in a previous birth but by each action in succession and not by the balance struck after the evil has been reckoned off against the good a good man who has once uttered a slander may spend a hundred thousand years as a god in consequence of his goodness and when the power of his good actions is exhausted may be born 93 as a dumb man on account of his transgression and a robber who has once done an act of mercy may come to life in a kings body as the result of his virtue and then suffer torments for ages in hell or as a ghost without a body or be reborn many times as a slave or an outcast in consequence of his evil life  there is no escape according to this theory from the result of any act though it is only the consequences of its own acts that each soul has to endure the force has been set in motion by itself and can never stop and its effect can never be foretold if evil it can never be modified or prevented for it depends on a cause already completed that is now for ever beyond the souls control there is even no continuing consciousness no memory of the past that could guide the soul to any knowledge of its fate  the only advantage open to it is to add in this life to the sum of its good actions that it may bear fruit with the rest and even this can only happen in some future life under essentially them same conditions as the present one subject like the present one to old age decay and death and affording opportunity like the present one for the commission of errors ignorances or sins which in their turn must inevitably produce their due effect of sickness disability or woe thus is the soul tossed about from life to life from billow to billow in the great ocean of transmigration  and there is no escape save for the very few who during their birth as men attain to a right knowledge of the great spirit and thus enter into immortality or as the later 94 philosophers taught are absorbed into the divine essence rhys davids hibbert lectures pp 85 86  the state after death thus imagined by the hindu philosophers has a certain analogy to the purgatory of the roman church except that escape from it is dependent not on a divine decree modified it may be by sacerdotal or saintly intercession but by the acts of the individual himself and that while ultimate emergence into heavenly bliss of the good or wellprayed for catholic is professedly assured the chances in favour of the attainment of absorption or of nirvana by any individual hindu are extremely small  note 6 p 62  that part of the then prevalent transmigration theory which could not be proved false seemed to meet a deeply felt necessity seemed to supply a moral cause which would explain the unequal distribution here of happiness or woe so utterly inconsistent with the present characters of men gautama still therefore talked of mens previous existence but by no means in the way that he is generally represented to have done what he taught was the transmigration of character he held that after the death of any being whether human or not there survived nothing at all but that beings karma the result that is of its mental and bodily actions every individual whether human or divine was the last inheritor and the last result of the karma of a long series of past individualsa series 95 so long that its beginning is beyond the reach of calculation and its end will be coincident with the destruction of the world rhys davids hibbert lectures p 92  in the theory of evolution the tendency of a germ to develop according to a certain specific type eg of the kidney bean seed to grow into a plant having all the characters of phaseolus vulgaris is its karma it is the last inheritor and the last result of all the conditions that have affected a line of ancestry which goes back for many millions of years to the time when life first appeared on the earth the moiety b of the substance of the bean plant see note 1 is the last link in a once continuous chain extending from the primitive living substance and the characters of the successive species to which it has given rise are the manifestations of its gradually modified karma as prof rhys davids aptly says the snowdrop is a snowdrop and not an oak and just that kind of snowdrop because it is the outcome of the karma of an endless series of past existences hibbert lectures p 114  note 7 p 64  it is interesting to notice that the very point which is the weakness of the theorythe supposed concentration of the effect of the karma in one new beingpresented itself to the early buddhists themselves as a difficulty  they avoided it partly by explaining that it was a particular thirst in the creature dying a craving tanha which plays other 96 wise a great part in the buddhist theory which actually caused the birth of the new individual who was to inherit the karma of the former one but how this too place how the craving desire produced this effect was acknowledged to be a mystery patent only to a buddha rhys davids hibbert lectures p 95  among the many parallelisms of stoicism and buddhism it is curious to find one for this tanha thirst or craving desire for life seneca writes epist lxxvi 18 si enim ullum aliud est bonum quam honestum sequetur nos aviditas vitae aviditas rerum vitam instruentium quod est intolerabile infinitum vagum  note 8 p 66  the distinguishing characteristic of buddhism was that it started a new line that it looked upon the deepest questions men have to solve from an entirely different standpoint it swept away from the field of its vision the whole of the great soul theory which had hitherto so completely filled and dominated the minds of the superstitious and the thoughtful alike for the first time in the history of the world it proclaimed a salvation which each man could gain for himself and by himself in this world during this life without any the least reference to god or to gods either great or small like the upanishads it placed the first importance on knowledge but it was no longer a knowledge of god it was a clear perception of the real nature as 97 they supposed it to be of men and things and it added to the necessity of knowledge the necessity of purity of courtesy of uprightness of peace and of a universal love far reaching grown great and beyond measure rhys davids hibbert lectures p 29  the contemporary greek philosophy takes an analogous direction according to heracleitus the universe was made neither by gods nor men but from all eternity has been and to all eternity will be immortal fire glowing and fading in due measure mullach heracliti fragmenta 27 and the part assigned by his successors the stoics to the knowledge and the volition of the wise man made their divinity for logical thinkers a subject for compliments rather than a power to be reckoned with in hindu speculation the arahat still more the buddha becomes the superior of brahma the stoical wise man is at least the equal of zeus  berkeley affirms over and over again that no idea can be formed of a soul or spiritif any man shall doubt of the truth of what is here delivered let him but reflect and try if he can form any idea of power or active being and whether he hath ideas of two principal powers marked by the names of will and understanding distinct from each other as well as from a third idea of substance or being in general with a relative notion of its supporting or being the subject of the aforesaid power which is signified by the name soul or spirit this is what some hold but so far as i can see the words will soul spirit do not stand for different ideas or in truth for any idea at all but for something which is very different from ideas and which being an agent cannot be like unto or represented by any idea whatever though it must be owned at the same time that we have some notion of soul spirit and the operations of the mind such as willing loving hating inasmuch as we know or understand the meaning of these words the principles of human knowledge lxxvi see also sections lxxxix cxxxv cxlv  it is open to discussion i think whether it is possible to have some notion of that of which we can form no idea  berkeley attaches several predicates to the perceiving active being mind spirit soul or myself parts i ii it is said for example to be indivisible incorporeal unextended and incorruptible the predicate indivisible though negative in form has highly positive consequences for if perceiving active being is strictly indivisible mans soul must be one with the divine spirit which is good hindu or stoical doctrine but hardly orthodox christian philosophy if on the other hand the substance of active perceiving being is actually divided into the one divine and innumerable human entities how can the predicate indivisible be rigorously applicable to it  taking the words cited as they stand the amount to the denial of the possibility of any knowledge of substance matter having been resolved into mere affections of spirit spirit melts away into an admittedly inconceivable and unknowable 99 hypostasis of thought and powerconsequently the existence of anything in the universe beyond a flow of phenomena is a purely hypothetical assumption indeed a pyrrhonist might raise the objection that if esse is percipi spirit itself can have no existence except as a perception hypostatized into a self or as a perception of some other spirit in the former case objective reality vanishes in the latter there would seem to be the need of an infinite series of spirits each perceiving the others  it is curious to observe how very closely the phraseology of berkeley sometimes approaches that of the stoics thus cxlviii it seems to be a general pretence of the unthinking herd that they cannot see god   but alas we need only open our eyes to see the sovereign lord of all things with a more full and clear view than we do any of our fellowcreatures     we do at all times and in all places perceive manifest tokens of the divinity everything we see hear feel or any wise perceive by sense being a sign or effect of the power of god    cxlix it is therefore plain that nothing can be more evident to any one that is capable of the least reflection than the existence of god or a spirit who is intimately present to our minds producing in them all that variety of ideas or sensations which continually affect us on whom we have an absolute and entire dependence in short in whom we live and move and have our being cl but you will say hath nature no share in the production of natural things and must they all be ascribed to the immediate and sole operation of god  if by nature is 100 meant some being distinct from god as well as from the laws of nature and things perceived by sense i must confess that word is to me an empty sound without any intelligible meaning annexed to it nature in this acceptation is a vain chimaera introduced by those heathens who had not just notions of the omnipresence and infinite perfection of god  compare seneca de beneficiis iv 7  natura inquit haec mihi praestat non intelligis te quum hoc dicis mutare nomen deo quid enim est aliud natura quam deus et divina ratio toti mundo et partibus ejus inserta quoties voles tibi licet aliter hunc auctorem rerum nostrarum compellare et jovem illum optimum et maximum rite dices et tonantem et statorem qui non ut historici tradiderunt ex eo quod post votum susceptum acies romanorum fugientum stetit sed quod stant beneficio ejus omnina stator stabilitorque est hunc eundem et fatum si dixeris non mentieris nam quum fatum nihil aliud est quam series implexa causarum ille est prima omnium causa ea qua caeterae pendent it would appear therefore that the good bishop is somewhat hard upon the heathen of whose words his own might be a paraphrase  there is yet another direction in which berkeleys philosophy i will not say agrees with gautamas but at any rate helps to make a fundamental dogma of buddhism intelligible  i find i can excite ideas in my mind at pleasure and vary and shift the scene as often as i think fit it is no more than willing and straightway this or that idea arises in my fancy and by the same power 101 it is obliterated and makes way for another this making and unmaking of ideas doth very properly denominate the mind active this much is certain and grounded on experience   principles xxviii  a good many of us i fancy have reason to think that experience tells them very much the contrary and are painfully familiar with the obsession of the mind by ideas which cannot be obliterated by any effort of the will and steadily refuse to make way for others but what i desire to point out is that if gautama was equally confident that he could make and unmake ideasthen since he had resolved self into a group of ideal phantomsthe possibility of abolishing self by volition naturally followed  note 9 p 68  according to buddhism the relation of one life to the next is merely that borne by the flame of one lamp to the flame of another lamp which is set alight by it to the arahat or adept no outward form no compound thing no creature no creator no existence of any kind must appear to be other than a temporary collocation of its component parts fated inevitably to be dissolvedrhys davids hibbert lectures p 211  the self is nothing but a group of phenomena held together by the desire of life when that desire shall have ceased the karma of that particular chain of lives will cease to influence any longer any distinct individual and there will be no more birth 102 for birth decay and death grief lamentation and despair will have come so far as regards that chain of lives for ever to an end  the state of mind of the arahat in which the desire of life has ceased is nirvana dr oldenberg has very acutely and patiently considered the various interpretations which have been attached to nirvana in the work to which i have referred pp 285 et seq the result of his and other discussions of the question may i think be briefly stated thus  1 logical deduction from the predicates attached to the term nirvana strips it of all reality conceivability or perceivability whether by gods or men for all practical purposes therefore it comes to exactly the same thing as annihilation  2 but it is not annihilation in the ordinary sense inasmuch as it could take place in the living arahat or buddha  3 and since for the faithful buddhist that which was abolished in the arahat was the possibility of further pain sorrow or sin and that which was attained was perfect peace his mind directed itself exclusively to this joyful consummation and personified the negation of all conceivable existence and of all pain into a positive bliss this was all the more easy as gautama refused to give any dogmatic definition of nirvana there is something analogous in the way in which people commonly talk of the happy release of a man who has been long suffering from mortal disease according to their own views it must always be extremely doubtful whether the man will be any happier after the release 103 than before but they do not choose to look at the matter in this light  the popular notion that with practical if not metaphysical annihilation in view buddhism must needs be a sad and gloomy faith seems to be inconsistent with fact on the contrary the prospect of nirvana fills the true believer not merely with cheerfulness but with an ecstatic desire to reach it  note 10 p 68  the influence of the picture of the personal qualities of gautama afforded by the legendary anecdotes which rapidly grew into a biography of the buddha and by the birth stories which coalesced with the current folklore and were intelligible to all the world doubtless played a great part further although gautama appears not to have meddled with the caste system he refused to recognize any distinction save that of perfection in the way of salvation among his followers and by such teaching no less than by the inculcation of love and benevolence to all sentient beings he practically levelled every social political and racial barrier a third important condition was the organization of the buddhists into monastic communities for the stricter professors while the laity were permitted a wide indulgence in practice and were allowed to hope for accommodation in some of the temporary abodes of bliss with a few hundred thousand years of immediate paradise in sight the average man could be content to shut his eyes to what might follow  104  note 11 p 69  in ancient times it was the fashion even among the greeks themselves to derive all greek wisdom from eastern sources not long ago it was as generally denied that greek philosophy had any connection with oriental speculation it seems probable however that the truth lies between these extremes  the ionian intellectual movement does not stand alone it is only one of several sporadic indications of the working of some powerful mental ferment over the whole of the area comprised between the aegean and northern hindostan during the eighth seventh and sixth centuries before our era in these three hundred years prophetism attained its apogee among the semites of palestine zoroasterism grew and became the creed of a conquering race the iranic aryans buddhism rose and spread with marvellous rapidity among the aryans of hindostan while scientific naturalism took its rise among the aryans of ionia it would be difficult to find another three centuries which have given birth to four events of equal importance all the principal existing religions of mankind have grown out of the first three while the fourth is the little spring now swollen into the great stream of positive science so far as physical possibilities go the prophet jeremiah and the oldest ionian philosopher might have met and conversed if they had done so they would probably have disagreed a good deal and it is interesting to reflect that their discussions might have 105 embraced questions which at the present day are still hotly controverted  the old ionian philosophy then seems to be only one of many results of a stirring of the moral and intellectual life of the aryan and the semitic populations of western asia the conditions of this general awakening were doubtless manifold but there is one which modern research has brought into great prominence this is the existence of extremely ancient and highly advanced societies in the valleys of the euphrates and of the nile  it is now known that more than a thousandperhaps more than two thousandyears before the sixth century bc civilization had attained a relatively high pitch among the babylonians and the egyptians not only had painting sculpture architecture and the industrial arts reached a remarkable development but in chaldaea at any rate a vast amount of knowledge had been accumulated and methodized in the departments of grammar mathematics astronomy and natural history where such traces of the scientific spirit are visible naturalistic speculation is rarely far off though so far as i know no remains of an accacian or egyptian philosophy properly so called have yet been recovered  geographically chaldaea occupied a central position among the oldest seats of civilization commerce largely aided by the intervention of those colossal pedlars the phoenicians had brought chaldaea into connection with all of them for a thousand years before the epoch at present under consideration and in the ninth eighth and seventh 106 centuries the assyrian the depositary of chaldaean civilization as the macedonian and the roman at a later date were the depositories of greek culture had added irresistible force to the other agencies for the wide distribution of chaldaean literature art and science  i confess that i find it difficult to imagine that the greek immigrantwho stood in somewhat the same relation to the babylonians and the egyptians as the later germanic barbarians to the romans of the empireshould not have been immensely influenced by the new life with which they became acquainted  but there is abundant direct evidence of the magnitude of this influence in certain spheres i suppose it is not doubted that the greek went to school with the oriental for his primary instruction in reading writing and arithmetic and that semitic theology supplied him with some of his mythological lore nor does there now seem to be any question about the large indebtedness of greek art to that of chaldaea and that of egypt  but the manner of that indebtedness is very instructive the obligation is clear but its limits are no less definite nothing better exemplifies the indomitable originality of the greeks than the relations of their art to that of the orientals far from being subdued into mere imitators by the technical excellence of their teachers they lost no time in bettering the instruction they received using their models as mere stepping stones on the way to those unsurpassed and unsurpassable achievements which are all their own the shibboleth of art is 107 the human figure the ancient chaldaeans and egyptians like the modern japanese did wonders in the representation of birds and quadrupeds they even attained to something more than respectability in human portraiture but their utmost efforts never brought them within range of the best greek embodiments of the grace of womanhood or of the severer beauty of manhood  it is worth while to consider the probable effect upon the acute and critical greek mind of the conflict of ideas social political and theological which arose out of the conditions of life in the asiatic colonies the ionian polities had passed through the whole gamut of social and political changes from patriarchal and occasionally oppressive kingship to rowdy and still more burdensome mobshipno doubt with infinitely eloquent and copious argumentation on both sides at every stage of their progress towards that arbitrament of force which settles most political questions the marvellous speculative faculty latent in the ionian had come in contact with mesopotamian egyptian phoenician theologies and cosmogonies with the illuminati of orphism and the fanatics and dreamers of the mysteries possibly with buddhism and zoroasterism possibly even with judaism and it has been observed that the mutual contradictions of antagonistic supernaturalisms are apt to play a large part among the generative agencies of naturalism  thus various external influences may have contributed to the rise of philosophy among the ionian greeks of the sixth century but the assimilative 108 capacity of the greek mindits power of hellenizing whatever it touchedhas here worked so effectually that so far as i can learn no indubitable traces of such extraneous contributions are now allowed to exist by the most authoritative historians of philosophy  nevertheless i think it must be admitted that the coincidences between the heracleitostoical doctrines and those of the older hindu philosophy are extremely remarkable in both the cosmos pursues an eternal succession of cyclical changes the great year answering to the kalpa covers an entire cycle from the origin of the universe as a fluid to its dissolution in firehumor initium ignis exitus mundi as seneca has it in both systems there is immanent in the cosmos a source of energy brahma or the logos which works according to fixed laws the individual soul is an efflux of this worldspirit and returns to it perfection is attainable only by individual effort through ascetic discipline and is rather a state of painlessness than of happiness if indeed it can be said to be a state of anything save the negation of perturbing emotion the hatchment motto in coelo quies would serve both hindu and stoic and absolute quiet is not easily distinguishable from annihilation  zoroasterism which geographically occupies a position intermediate between hellenism and hinduism agrees with the latter in recognizing the essential evil of the cosmos but differs from both in its intensely anthropomorphic personification of the two antagonistic principles to the one of which it ascribes all the good and to the other all the evil  109 in fact it assumes the existence of two worlds one good and one bad the latter created by the evil power for the purpose of damaging the former  the existing cosmos is a mere mixture of the two and the last judgment is a rootandbranch extirpation of the work of ahriman  note 12 p 69  there is no snare in which the feet of a modern student of ancient lore are more easily entangled than that which is spread by the similarity of the language of antiquity to modern modes of expression i do not presume to interpret the obscurest of greek philosophers all i wish is to point out that his words in the sense accepted by competent interpreters fit modern ideas singularly well  so far as the general theory of evolution goes there is no difficulty the aphorism about the river the figure of the child playing on the shore the kingship and fatherhood of strife seem decisive the greek phrase osod ano kato mie expresses with singular aptness the cyclical aspect of the one process of organic evolution in individual plants and animals yet it may be a question whether the heracleitean strife included any distinct conception of the struggle for existence again it is tempting to compare the part played by the heracleitean fire with that ascribed by the moderns to heat or rather to that cause of motion of which heat is one expression and a little ingenuity might find a foreshadowing of the doctrine of the conservation of energy in the saying 110 that all the things are changed into fire and fire into all things as gold into goods and goods into gold  note 13 p 71  popes lines in the essay on manep i 2678       all are but parts of one stupendous whole      whose body nature is and god the soul  simply paraphrase senecas quem in hoc mundo locum deus obtinet hunc in homine animus quod est illic materia id nobis corpus estep lxv 24 which again is a latin version of the old stoical doctrine greek phrase eis apan tou kosou meros diekei o nous kataper aph emon e psuche  so far as the testimony for the universality of what ordinary people call evil goes there is nothing better than the writings of the stoics themselves they might serve as a storehouse for the epigrams of the ultrapessimists heracleitus circa 500 bc says just as hard things about ordinary humanity as his disciples centuries later and there really seems no need to seek for the causes of this dark view of life in the circumstances of the time of alexanders successors or of the early emperors of rome to the man with an ethical ideal the world including himself will always seem full of evil  note 14 p 73  i use the wellknown phrase but decline responsibility for the libel upon epicurus whose doctrines 111 were far less compatible with existence in a style than those of the cynics if it were steadily borne in mind that the conception of the flesh as the source of evil and the great saying initium est salutis notitia peccati are the property of epicurus fewer illusions about epicureanism would pass muster for accepted truth  note 15 p 75  the stoics said that man was a greek phrase zoon logikon politikon philallelon or a rational a political and an altruistic or philanthropic animal in their view his higher nature tended to develop in these three directions as a plant tends to grow up into its typical form since without the introduction of any consideration of pleasure or pain whatever thwarted the realization of its type by the plant might be said to be bad and whatever helped it good so virtue in the stoical sense as the conduct which tended to the attainment of the rational political and philanthropic ideal was good in itself and irrespectively of its emotional concomitants  man is an animal sociale communi bono genitum the safety of society depends upon practical recognition of the fact salva autem esse societas nisi custodia et amore partium non possit says seneca de ira ii 31  note 16 p 75  the importance of the physical doctrine of the stoics lies in its clear recognition of the universality 112 of the law of causation with its corollary the order of nature the exact form of that order is an altogether secondary consideration  many ingenious persons now appear to consider that the incompatibility of pantheism of materialism and of any doubt about the immortality oxf the soul with religion and morality is to be held as an axiomatic truth i confess that i have a certain difficulty in accepting this dogma for the stoics were notoriously materialists and pantheists of the most extreme character and while no strict stoic believed in the eternal duration of the individual soul some even denied its persistence after death yet it is equally certain that of all gentile philosophies stoicism exhibits the highest ethical development is animated by the most religious spirit and has exerted the profoundest influence upon the moral and religious development not merely of the best men among the romans but among the moderns down to our own day  seneca was claimed as a christian and placed among the saints by the fathers of the early christian church and the genuineness of a correspondence between him and the apostle paul has been hotly maintained in our own time by orthodox writers that the letters as we possess them are worthless forgeries is obvious and writers as wide apart as baur and lightfoot agree that the whole story is devoid of foundation  the dissertation of the late bishop of durham epistle to the philippians is particularly worthy of study apart from this question on account of 113 evidence which it supplies of the numerous similarities of thought between seneca and the writer of the pauline epistles when it is remembered that the writer of the acts puts a quotation from aratus or cleanthes into the mouth of the apostle and that tarsus was a great seat of philosophical and especially stoical learning chrysippus himself was a native of the adjacent town of soli there is no difficulty in understanding the origin of these resemblances see on this subject sir alexander grants dissertation in his edition of the ethics of aristotle where there is an interesting reference to the stoical character of bishop butlers ethics the concluding pages of dr weygoldts instructive little work die philosophie der stoa and aubertins seneque et saint paul  it is surprising that a writer of dr lightfoots stamp should speak of stoicism as a philosophy of despair surely rather it was a philosophy of men who having cast off all illusions and the childishness of despair among them were minded to endure in patience whatever conditions the cosmic process might create so long as those conditions were compatible with the progress towards virtue which alone for them conferred a worthy object on existence there is no note of despair in the stoical declaration that the perfected wise man is the equal of zeus in everything but the duration of his existence and in my judgment there is as little pride about it often as it serves for the text of discourses on stoical arrogance grant the stoical postulate that there is no good except virtue grant that 114 the perfected wise man is altogether virtuous in consequence of being guided in all things by the reason which is an effluence of zeus and there seems no escape from the stoical conclusion  note 17 p 76  our apathy carries such a different set of connotations from its greek original that i have ventured on using the latter as a technical term  note 18 p 77  many of the stoical philosophers recommended their disciples to take an active share in public affairs and in the roman world for several centuries the best public men were strongly inclined to stoicism nevertheless the logical tendency of stoicism seems to me to be fulfilled only in such men as diogenes and epictetus  note 19 p 80  criticisms on the origin of species 1864 collected essays vol ii p  911894  note 20 p 81  of course strictly speaking social life and the ethical process in virtue of which it advances towards perfection are part and parcel of the general process of evolution just as the gregarious habit of in 115 numerable plants and animals which has been of immense advantage to them is so a hive of bees is an organic polity a society in which the part played by each member is determined by organic necessities queens workers and drones are so to speak castes divided from one another by marked physical barriers among birds and mammals societies are formed of which the bond in many cases seems to be purely psychological that is to say it appears to depend upon the liking of the individuals for one anothers company the tendency of individuals to over selfassertion is kept down by fighting  even in these rudimentary forms of society love and fear come into play and enforce a greater or less renunciation of selfwill to this extent the general cosmic process begins to be checked by a rudimentary ethical process which is strictly speaking part of the former just as the governor in a steamengine is part of the mechanism of

conclude that the new doctrine was better than the old one after all at least for those who had nothing to unlearn  such being our habitual state of mind it may well be believed that the perusal of the new book on the origin of species by means of natural selection left an uncomfortable impression in spite of its plausible and winning ways we were not wholly unprepared for it as many of our contemporaries seem to have been the scientific reading in which we indulge as a relaxation from severer studies had raised dim forebodings  investigations about the succession of species in time and their actual geographical distribution over the earths surface were leading up from all sides and in various ways to the question of their origin now and then we encountered a sentence like prof owens axiom of the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things which haunted us like an apparition for dim as our conception must needs be as to what such oracular and grandiloquent phrases might really mean we felt confident that they presaged no good to old beliefs foreseeing yet deprecating the coming time of trouble we still hoped that with some repairs and makeshifts the old views might last out our days apres nous le deluge  still not to lag behind the rest of the world we read the book in which the new theory is promulgated we took it up like our neighbors and as was natural in a somewhat captious frame of mind  well we found no cause of quarrel with the first chapter here the author takes us directly to the barnyard and the kitchengarden like an honorable rural member of our general court who sat silent until near the close of a long session a bill requiring all swine at large to wear pokes was introduced when he claimed the privilege of addressing the house on the proper ground that he had been brought up among the pigs and knew all about themso we were brought up among cows and cabbages and the lowing of cattle the cackle of hens and the cooing of pigeons were sounds native and pleasant to our ears so variation under domestication dealt with familiar subjects in a natural way and gently introduced variation under nature which seemed likely enough then follows struggle for existencea principle which we experimentally know to be true and cogentbringing the comfortable assurance that man even upon leviathan hobbess theory of society is no worse than the rest of creation since all nature is at war one species with another and the nearer kindred the more internecinebringing in thousandfold confirmation and extension of the malthusian doctrine that population tends far to outrun means of subsistence throughout the animal and vegetable world and has to be kept down by sharp preventive checks so that not more than one of a hundred or a thousand of the individuals whose existence is so wonderfully and so sedulously provided for ever comes to anything under ordinary circumstances so the lucky and the strong must prevail and the weaker and illfavored must perish and then follows as naturally as one sheep follows another the chapter on natural selection darwins cheval de bataille which is very much the napoleonic doctrine that providence favors the strongest battalionsthat since many more individuals are born than can possibly survive those individuals and those variations which possess any advantage however slight over the rest are in the longrun sure to survive to propagate and to occupy the limited field to the exclusion or destruction of the weaker brethren all this we pondered and could not much object to in fact we began to contract a liking for a system which at the outset illustrates the advantages of good breeding and which makes the most of every creatures best  could we let bygones be bygones and beginning now go on improving and diversifying for the future by natural selection could we even take up the theory at the introduction  of the actually existing species we should be well content and so perhaps would most naturalists be it is by no means difficult to believe that varieties are incipient or possible species when we see what trouble naturalists especially botanists have to distinguish between themone regarding as a true species what another regards as a variety when the progress of knowledge continually increases rather than diminishes the number of doubtful instances and when there is less agreement than ever among naturalists as to what is the basis in nature upon which our idea of species reposes or how the word is to be defined  indeed when we consider the endless disputes of naturalists and ethnologists over the human races as to whether they belong to one species or to more and if to more whether to three or five or fifty we can hardly help fancying that both may be rightor rather that the unihumanitarians would have been right many thousand years ago and the multihumanitarians will be several thousand years later while at present the safe thing to say is that probably there is some truth on both sides  natural selection darwin remarks leads to divergence of character for the more living beings can be supported on the same area the more they diverge in structure habits and constitution a principle which bytheway is paralleled and illustrated by the diversification of human labor and also leads to much extinction of intermediate or unimproved forms now though this divergence may steadily tend to increase yet this is evidently a slow process in nature and liable to much counteraction wherever man does not interpose and so not likely to work much harm for the future and if natural selection with artificial to help it will produce better animals and better men than the present and fit them better to the conditions of existence why let it work say we to the top of its bent there is still room enough for improvement only let us hope that it always works for good if not the divergent lines on darwins lithographic diagram of transmutation made easy ominously show what small deviations from the straight path may come to in the end  the prospect of the future accordingly is on the whole pleasant and encouraging it is only the backward glance the gaze up the long vista of the past that reveals anything alarming here the lines converge as they recede into the geological ages and point to conclusions which upon the theory are inevitable but hardly welcome the very first step backward makes the negro and the hottentot our bloodrelationsnot that reason or scripture objects to that though pride may the next suggests a closer association of our ancestors of the olden time with our poor relations of the quadrumanous family than we like to acknowledge fortunately howevereven if we must account for him scientifically man with his two feet stands upon a foundation of his own intermediate links between the bimana and the quadrumana are lacking altogether so that put the genealogy of the brutes upon what footing you will the fourhanded races will not serve for our forerunnersat least not until some monkey live or fossil is producible with greattoes instead of thumbs upon his nether extremities or until some lucky geologist turns up the bones of his ancestor and prototype in france or england who was so busy napping the chuckiestanes and chipping out flint knives and arrowheads in the time of the drift very many ages agobefore the british channel existed says lyell iii1and until these men of the olden time are shown to have worn their greattoes in the divergent and thumblike fashion that would be evidence indeed but until some testimony of the sort is produced we must needs believe in the separate and special creation of man however it may have been with the lower animals and with plants  no doubt the full development and symmetry of darwins hypothesis strongly suggest the evolution of the human no less than the lower animal races out of some simple primordial animalthat all are equally lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the silurian system was deposited but as the author speaks disrespectfully of spontaneous generation and accepts a supernatural beginning of life on earth in some form or forms of being which included potentially all that have since existed and are yet to be he is thereby not warranted to extend his inferences beyond the evidence or the fair probability there seems as great likelihood that one special origination should be followed by another upon fitting occasion such as the introduction of man as that one form should be transmuted into another upon fitting occasion as for instance in the succession of species which differ from each other only in some details to compare small things with great in a homely illustration man alters from time to time his instruments or machines as new circumstances or conditions may require and his wit suggest minor alterations and improvements he adds to the machine he possesses he adapts a new rig or a new rudder to an old boat this answers to variation like begets like being the great rule in nature if boats could engender the variations would doubtless be propagated like those of domestic cattle in course of time the old ones would be worn out or wrecked the best sorts would be chosen for each particular use and further improved upon and so the primordial boat be developed into the scow the skiff the sloop and other species of watercraftthe very diversification as well as the successive improvements entailing the disappearance of intermediate forms less adapted to any one particular purpose wherefore these go slowly out of use and become extinct species this is natural selection now let a great and important advance be made like that of steam navigation here though the engine might be added to the old vessel yet the wiser and therefore the actual way is to make a new vessel on a modified plan this may answer to specific creation anyhow the one does not necessarily exclude the other  variation and natural selection may play their part and so may specific creation also why not  this leads us to ask for the reasons which call for this new theory of transmutation the beginning of things must needs lie in obscurity beyond the bounds of proof though within those of conjecture or of analogical inference why not hold fast to the customary view that all species were directly instead of indirectly created after their respective kinds as we now behold themand that in a manner which passing our comprehension we intuitively refer to the supernatural why this continual striving after the unattained and dim why these anxious endeavors especially of late years by naturalists and philosophers of various schools and different tendencies to penetrate what one of them calls that mystery of mysteries the origin of species  to this in general sufficient answer may be found in the activity of the human intellect the delirious yet divine desire to know stimulated as it has been by its own success in unveiling the laws and processes of inorganic nature in the fact that the principal triumphs of our age in physical science have consisted in tracing connections where none were known before in reducing heterogeneous phenomena to a common cause or origin in a manner quite analogous to that of the reduction of supposed independently originated species to a common ultimate originthus and in various other ways largely and legitimately extending the domain of secondary causes  surely the scientific mind of an age which contemplates the solar system as evolved from a common revolving fluid masswhich through experimental research has come to regard light heat electricity magnetism chemical affinity and mechanical power as varieties or derivative and convertible forms of one force instead of independent specieswhich has brought the socalled elementary kinds of matter such as the metals into kindred groups and pertinently raised the question whether the members of each group may not be mere varieties of one speciesand which speculates steadily in the direction of the ultimate unity of matter of a sort of prototype or simple element which may be to the ordinary species of matter what the protozoa or what the component cells of an organism are to the higher sorts of animals and plantsthe mind of such an age cannot be expected to let the old belief about species pass unquestioned it will raise the question how the diverse sorts of plants and animals came to be as they are and where they are and will allow that the whole inquiry transcends its powers only when all endeavors have failed granting the origin to be super natural or miraculous even will not arrest the inquiry all real origination the philosophers will say is supernatural their very question is whether we have yet gone back to the origin and can affirm that the present forms of plants and animals are the primordial the miraculously created ones  and even if they admit that they will still inquire into the order of the phenomena into the form of the miracle you might as well expect the child to grow up content with what it is told about the advent of its infant brother indeed to learn that the new comer is the gift of god far from lulling inquiry only stimulates speculation as to how the precious gift was bestowed that questioning child is father to the manis philosopher in shortclothes  since then questions about the origin of species will be raised and have been raisedand since the theorizings however different in particulars all proceed upon the notion that one species of plant or animal is somehow derived from another that the different sorts which now flourish are lineal or unlineal descendants of other and earlier sortsit now concerns us to ask what are the grounds in nature the admitted facts which suggest hypotheses of derivation in some shape or other reasons there must be and plausible ones for the persistent recurrence of theories upon this genetic basis a study of darwins book and a general glance at the present state of the natural sciences enable us to gather the following as among the most suggestive and influential we can only enumerate them here without much indication of their particular bearing there is  1 the general fact of variability and the general tendency of the variety to propagate its likethe patent facts that all species vary more or less that domesticated plants and animals being in conditions favorable to the production and preservation of varieties are apt to vary widely and that by interbreeding any variety may be fixed into a race that is into a variety which comes true from seed many such races it is allowed differ from each other in structure and appearance as widely as do many admitted species and it is practically very difficult even impossible to draw a clear line between races and species witness the human races for instance  wild species also vary perhaps about as widely as those of domestication though in different ways some of them apparently vary little others moderately others immoderately to the great bewilderment of systematic botanists and zoologists and increasing disagreement as to whether various forms shall be held to be original species or strong varieties moreover the degree to which the descendants of the same stock varying in different directions may at length diverge is unknown all we know is that varieties are themselves variable and that very diverse forms have been educed from one stock  2 species of the same genus are not distinguished from each other by equal amounts of difference there is diversity in this respect analogous to that of the varieties of a polymorphous species some of them slight others extreme and in large genera the unequal resemblance shows itself in the clustering of the species around several types or central species like satellites around their respective planets obviously suggestive this of the hypothesis that they were satellites not thrown off by revolution like the moons of jupiter saturn and our own solitary moon but gradually and peacefully detached by divergent variation that such closelyrelated species may be only varieties of higher grade earlier origin or more favored evolution is not a very violent supposition anyhow it was a supposition sure to be made  3 the actual geographical distribution of species upon the earths surface tends to suggest the same notion for as a general thing all or most of the species of a peculiar genus or other type are grouped in the same country or occupy continuous proximate or accessible areas so well does this rule hold so general is the implication that kindred species are or were associated geographically that most trustworthy naturalists quite free from hypotheses of transmutation are constantly inferring former geographical continuity between parts of the world now widely disjoined in order to account thereby for certain generic similarities among their inhabitants just as philologists infer former connection of races and a parent language to account for generic similarities among existing languages yet no scientific explanation has been offered to account for the geographical association of kindred species except the hypothesis of a common origin  4 here the fact of the antiquity of creation and in particular of the present kinds of the earths inhabitants or of a large part of them comes in to rebut the objection that there has not been time enough for any marked diversification of living things through divergent variationnot time enough for varieties to have diverged into what we call species  so long as the existing species of plants and animals were thought to have originated a few thousand years ago and without predecessors there was no room for a theory of derivation of one sort from another nor time enough even to account for the establishment of the races which are generally believed to have diverged from a common stock not so much that five or six thousand years was a short allowance for this but because some of our familiar domesticated varieties of grain of fowls and of other animals were pictured and mummified by the old egyptians more than half that number of years ago if not earlier indeed perhaps the strongest argument for the original plurality of human species was drawn from the identification of some of the present races of men upon these early historical monuments and records  but this very extension of the current chronology if we may rely upon the archaeologists removes the difficulty by opening up a longer vista so does the discovery in europe of remains and implements of prehistoric races of men to whom the use of metals was unknownmen of the stone age as the scandinavian archaeologists designate them and now axes and knives of flint evidently wrought by human skill are found in beds of the drift at amiens also in other places both in france and england associated with the bones of extinct species of animals these implements indeed were noticed twenty years ago at a place in suffolk they have been exhumed from time to time for more than a century but the full confirmation the recognition of the age of the deposit in which the implements occur their abundance and the appreciation of their bearings upon most interesting questions belong to the present time to complete the connection of these primitive people with the fossil ages the french geologists we are told have now found these axes in picardy associated with remains of elephas primigenius rhinoceros tichorhinus equus fossilis and an extinct species of bosiii2 in plain language these workers in flint lived in the time of the mammoth of a rhinoceros now extinct and along with horses and cattle unlike any now existingspecifically different as naturalists say from those with which man is now associated  their connection with existing human races may perhaps be traced through the intervening people of the stone age who were succeeded by the people of the bronze age and these by workers in ironiii3 now various evidence carries back the existence of many of the present lower species of animals and probably of a larger number of plants to the same drift period all agree that this was very many thousand years ago agassiz tells us that the same species of polyps which are now building coral walls around the present peninsula of florida actually made that peninsula and have been building there for many thousand centuries  5  the overlapping of existing and extinct species and the seemingly gradual transition of the life of the drift period into that of the present may be turned to the same account mammoths mastodons and irish elks now extinct must have lived down to human if not almost to historic times  perhaps the last dodo did not long outlive his huge new zealand kindred the aurochs once the companion of mammoths still survives but owes his present and precarious existence to mans care now nothing that we know of forbids the hypothesis that some new species have been independently and supernaturally created within the period which other species have survived  some may even believe that man was created in the days of the mammoth became extinct and was recreated at a later date but why not say the same of the aurochs contemporary both of the old man and of the new still it is more natural if not inevitable to infer that if the aurochs of that olden time were the ancestors of the aurochs of the lithuanian forests so likewise were the men of that age the ancestors of the present human races  then whoever concludes that these primitive makers of rude flint axes and knives were the ancestors of the better workmen of the succeeding  stone age and these again of the succeeding artificers in brass and iron will also be likely to suppose that the equus and bos of that time different though they be were the remote progenitors of our own horses and cattle in all candor we must at least concede that such considerations suggest a genetic descent from the drift period down to the present and allow time enoughif time is of any account for variation and natural selection to work out some appreciable results in the way of divergence into races or even into socalled species whatever might have been thought when geological time was supposed to be separated from the present era by a clear line it is now certain that a gradual replacement of old forms by new ones is strongly suggestive of some mode of origination which may still be operative when species like individuals were found to die out one by one and apparently to come in one by one a theory for what owen sonorously calls the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things could not be far off  that all such theories should take the form of a derivation of the new from the old seems to be inevitable perhaps from our inability to conceive of any other line of secondary causes in this connection owen himself is apparently in travail with some transmutation theory of his own conceiving which may yet see the light although darwins came first to the birth  different as the two theories will probably be they cannot fail to exhibit that fundamental resemblance in this respect which betokens a community of origin a common foundation on the general facts and the obvious suggestions of modern science indeedto turn the point of a pungent simile directed against darwinthe difference between the darwinian and the owenian hypotheses may after all be only that between homoeopathic and heroic doses of the same drug  if theories of derivation could only stop here content with explaining the diversification and succession of species between the teritiary period and the present time through natural agencies or secondary causes still in operation we fancy they would not be generally or violently objected to by the savants of the present day but it is hard if not impossible to find a stoppingplace some of the facts or accepted conclusions already referred to and several others of a more general character which must be taken into the account impel the theory onward with accumulated force vires not to say virus acquirit eundo the theory hitches on wonderfully well to lyells uniformitarian theory in geologythat the thing that has been is the thing that is and shall bethat the natural operations now going on will account for all geological changes in a quiet and easy way only give them time enough so connecting the present and the proximate with the farthest past by almost imperceptible gradationsa view which finds large and increasing if not general acceptance in physical geology and of which darwins theory is the natural complement  so the darwinian theory once getting a foothold marches boldly on follows the supposed near ancestors of our present species farther and yet farther back into the dim past and ends with an analogical inference which makes the whole world kin as we said at the beginning this upshot discomposes us several features of the theory have an uncanny look they may prove to be innocent but their first aspect is suspicious and high authorities pronounce the whole thing to be positively mischievous in this dilemma we are going to take advice following the bent of our prejudices and hoping to fortify these by new and strong arguments we are going now to read the principal reviews which undertake to demolish the theorywith what result our readers shall be duly informed   ii   i can entertain no doubt after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which i am capable that the view which most naturalists entertain and which i formerly entertained namely that each species has been independently created is erroneous i am fully convinced that species are not immutable but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species furthermore i am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification   this is the kernel of the new theory the darwinian creed as recited at the close of the introduction to the remarkable book under consideration  the questions what will he do with it and how far will he carry it the author answers at the close of the volume   i cannot doubt that the theory of descent with modification embraces all the members of the same class furthermore i believe that all animals have descended from at most only four or five progenitors and plants from an equal or lesser number   seeing that analogy as strongly suggests a further step in the same direction while he protests that analogy may be a deceitful guide yet he follows its inexorable leading to the inference that  probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this ear have descended from some one primordial form into which life was first breathediii4   in the first extract we have the thin end of the wedge driven a little way in the last the wedge driven home  we have already sketched some of the reasons suggestive of such a theory of derivation of species reasons which gave it plausibility and even no small probability as applied to our actual world and to changes occurring since the latest tertiary period we are well pleased at this moment to find that the conclusions we were arriving at in this respect are sustained by the very high authority and impartial judgment of pictet the swiss paleontologist in his review of darwins bookiii5  the fairest and most admirable opposing one that has appearedhe freely accepts that ensemble of natural operations which darwin impersonates under the now familiar name of natural selection allows that the exposition throughout the first chapters seems a la fois prudent et fort and is disposed to accept the whole argument in its foundations that is so far as it relates to what is now going on or has taken place in the present geological periodwhich period he carries back through the diluvial epoch to the borders of the tertiaryiii6  pictet accordingly admits that the theory will very well account for the origination by divergence of nearlyrelated species whether within the present period or in remoter geological times a very natural view for him to take since he appears to have reached and published several years ago the pregnant conclusion that there most probably was some material connection between the closelyrelated species of two successive faunas and that the numerous close species whose limits are so difficult to determine were not all created distinct and independent  but while thus accepting or ready to accept the basis of darwins theory and all its legitimate direct inferences he rejects the ultimate conclusions brings some weighty arguments to bear against them and is evidently convinced that he can draw a clear line between the sound inferences which he favors and the unsound or unwarranted theoretical deductions which he rejects we hope he can  this raises the question why does darwin press his theory to these extreme conclusions why do all hypotheses of derivation converge so inevitably to one ultimate point having already considered some of the reasons which suggest or support the theory at its outsetwhich may carry it as far as such sound and experienced naturalists as pictet allow that it may be trueperhaps as far as darwin himself unfolds it in the introductory proposition cited at the beginning of this articlewe may now inquire after the motives which impel the theorist so much farther here proofs in the proper sense of the word are not to be had we are beyond the region of demonstration and have only probabilities to consider what are these probabilities what work will this hypothesis do to establish a claim to be adopted in its completeness why should a theory which may plausibly enough account for the diversification of the species of each special type or genus be expanded into a general system for the origination or successive diversification of all species and all special types or forms from four or five remote primordial forms or perhaps from one we accept the theory of gravitation because it explains all the facts we know and bears all the tests that we can put it to we incline to accept the nebular hypothesis for similar reasons not because it is provedthus far it is incapable of proofbut because it is a natural theoretical deduction from accepted physical laws is thoroughly congruous with the facts and because its assumption serves to connect and harmonize these into one probable and consistent whole can the derivative hypothesis be maintained and carried out into a system on similar grounds if so however unproved it would appear to be a tenable hypothesis which is all that its author ought now to claim such hypotheses as from the conditions of the case can neither be proved nor disproved by direct evidence or experiment are to be tested only indirectly and therefore imperfectly by trying their power to harmonize the known facts and to account for what is otherwise unaccountable so the question comes to this what will an hypothesis of the derivation of species explain which the opposing view leaves unexplained  questions these which ought to be entertained before we take up the arguments which have been advanced against this theory we can barely glance at some of the considerations which darwin adduces or will be sure to adduce in the future and fuller exposition which is promised to display them in such wise as to indoctrinate the unscientific reader would require a volume merely to refer to them in the most general terms would suffice for those familiar with scientific matters but would scarcely enlighten those who are not wherefore let these trust the impartial pictet who freely admits that in the absence of sufficient direct proofs to justify the possibility of his hypothesis mr darwin relies upon indirect proofs the bearing of which is real and incontestable who concedes that his theory accords very well with the great facts of comparative anatomy and zoologycomes in admirably to explain unity of composition of organisms also to explain rudimentary and representative organs and the natural series of genera and speciesequally corresponds with many paleontological dataagrees well with the specific resemblances which exist between two successive faunas with the parallelism which is sometimes observed between the series of paleontological succession and of embryonal development etc and finally although he does not accept the theory in these results he allows that it appears to offer the best means of explaining the manner in which organized beings were produced in epochs anterior to our own  what more than this could be said for such an hypothesis here probably is its charm and its strong hold upon the speculative mind unproven though it be and cumbered prima facie with cumulative improbabilities as it proceeds yet it singularly accords with great classes of facts otherwise insulated and enigmatic and explains many things which are thus far utterly inexplicable upon any other scientific assumption  we have said that darwins hypothesis is the natural complement to lyells uniformitarian theory in physical geology it is for the organic world what that is for the inorganic and the accepters of the latter stand in a position from which to regard the former in the most favorable light  wherefore the rumor that the cautious lyell himself has adopted the darwinian hypothesis need not surprise us the two views are made for each other and like the two counterpart pictures for the stereoscope when brought together combine into one apparently solid whole  if we allow with pictet that darwins theory will very well serve for all that concerns the present epoch of the worlds historyan epoch in which this renowned paleontologist includes the diluvial or quaternary periodthen darwins first and foremost need in his onward course is a practicable road from this into and through the tertiary period the intervening region between the comparatively near and the far remote past  here lyells doctrine paves the way by showing that in the physical geology there is no general or absolute break between the two probably no greater between the latest tertiary and the quaternary period than between the latter and the present time so far the lyellian view is we suppose generally concurred in it is largely admitted that numerous tertiary species have continued down into the quaternary and many of them to the present time a goodly percentage of the earlier and nearly half of the later tertiary mollusca according to des hayes lye and if we mistake not bronn still live this identification however is now questioned by a naturalist of the very highest authority but in its bearings on the new theory the point here turns not upon absolute identity so much as upon close resemblance for those who with agassiz doubt the specific identity in any of these cases and those who say with pictet that the later tertiary deposits contain in general the debris of species very nearly related to those which still exist belonging to the same genera but specifically different may also agree with pictet that the nearlyrelated species of successive faunas must or may have had a material connection but the only material connection that we have an idea of in such a case is a genealogical one and the supposition of a genealogical connection is surely not unnatural in such casesis demonstrably the natural one as respects all those tertiary species which experienced naturalists have pronounced to be identical with existing ones but which others now deem distinct for to identify the two is the same thing as to conclude the one to be the ancestor of the other no doubt there are differences between the tertiary and the present individuals differences equally noticed by both classes of naturalists but differently estimated by the one these are deemed quite compatible by the other incompatible with community of origin but who can tell us what amount of difference is compatible with community of origin  this is the very question at issue and one to be settled by observation alone who would have thought that the peach and the nectarine came from one stock but  this being proved is it now very improbable that both were derived from the almond or from some common amygdaline progenitor who would have thought that the cabbage cauliflower broccoli kale and kohlrabi are derivatives of one species and rape or colza turnip and probably rutabaga of  another species and who that is convinced of this can long undoubtingly hold the original distinctness of turnips from cabbages as an article of faith on scientific grounds may not a primordial cabbage or rape be assumed as the ancestor of all the cabbage races on much the same ground that we assume a common ancestry for the diversified human races if all our breeds of cattle came from one stock why not this stock from the auroch which has had all the time between the diluvial and the historic periods in which to set off a variation perhaps no greater than the difference between some sorts of domestic cattle  that considerable differences are often discernible between tertiary individuals and their supposed descendants of the present day affords no argument against darwins theory as has been rashly thought but is decidedly in its favor if the identification were so perfect that no more differences were observable between the tertiary and the recent shells than between various individuals of either then darwins opponents who argue the immutability of species from the ibises and cats preserved by the ancient egyptians being just like those of the present day could triumphantly add a few hundred thousand years more to the length of the experiment and to the force of their argument  as the facts stand it appears that while some tertiary forms are essentially undistinguishable from existing ones others are the same with a difference which is judged not to be specific or aboriginal and yet others show somewhat greater differences such as are scientifically expressed by calling them marked varieties or else doubtful species while others differing a little more are confidently termed distinct but nearlyrelated species now is not all this a question of degree of mere gradation of difference and is it at all likely that these several gradations came to be established in two totally different wayssome of them though naturalists cant agree which through natural variation or other secondary cause and some by original creation without secondary cause we have seen that the judicious pictet answers such questions as darwin would have him do in affirming that in all probability the nearlyrelated species of two successive faunas were materially connected and that contemporaneous species similarly resembling each other were not all created so but have become so this is equivalent to saying that species using the term as all naturalists do and must continue to employ the word have only a relative not an absolute fixity that differences fully equivalent to what are held to be specific may arise in the course of time so that one species may at length be naturally replaced by another species a good deal like it or may be diversified into two three or more species or forms as different as species this concedes all that darwin has a right to ask all that he can directly infer from evidence we must add that it affords a locus standi more or less tenable for inferring more  here another geological consideration comes in to help on this inference  the species of the later tertiary period for the most part not only resembled those of our daysmany of them so closely as to suggest an absolute continuitybut also occupied in general the same regions that their relatives occupy now the same may be said though less specially of the earlier tertiary and of the later secondary but there is less and less localization of forms as we recede yet some localization even in palaeozoic times while in the secondary period one is struck with the similarity of forms and the identity of many of the species which flourished apparently at the same time in all or in the most widelyseparated parts of the world in the tertiary epoch on the contrary along with the increasing specialization of climates and their approximation to the present state we find abundant evidence of increasing localization of orders genera and species and this localization strikingly accords with the present geographical distribution of the same groups of species where the imputed forefathers lived their relatives and supposed descendants now flourish all the actual classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms were represented in the tertiary faunas and floras and in nearly the same proportions and the same diversities as at present the faunas of what is now europe asia america and australia differed from each other much as they now differ in factaccording to adolphe brongniart whose statements we here condenseiii7the inhabitants of these different regions appear for the most part to have acquired before the close of the tertiary period the characters which essentially distinguish their existing faunas the eastern continent had then as now its great pachyderms elephants rhinoceros hippopotamus south america its armadillos sloths and anteaters australia a crowd of marsupials and the very strange birds of new zealand had predecessors of similar strangeness  everywhere the same geographical distribution as now with a difference in the particular area as respects the northern portion of the continents answering to a warmer climate then than ours such as allowed species of hippopotamus rhinoceros and elephant to range even to the regions now inhabited by the reindeer and the muskox and with the serious disturbing intervention of the glacial period within a comparatively recent time let it be noted also that those tertiary species which have continued with little change down to our days are the marine animals of the lower grades especially mollusca their low organization moderate sensibility and the simple conditions of an existence in a medium like the ocean not subject to great variation and incapable of sudden change may well account for their continuance while on the other hand the more intense however gradual climatic vicissitudes on land which have driven all tropical and subtropical forms out of the higher latitudes and assigned to them their actual limits would be almost sure to extinguish such huge and unwieldy animals as mastodons mammoths and the like whose power of enduring altered circumstances must have been small  this general replacement of the tertiary species of a country by others so much like them is a noteworthy fact the hypothesis of the independent creation of all species irrespective of their antecedents leaves this fact just as mysterious as is creation itself that of derivation undertakes to account for it whether it satisfactorily does so or not it must be allowed that the facts well accord with that hypothesis the same may be said of another conclusion namely that the geological succession of animals and plants appears to correspond in a general way with their relative standing or rank in a natural system of classification it seems clear that though no one of the grand types of the animal kingdom can be traced back farther than the rest yet the lower classes long preceded the higher that there has been on the whole a steady progression within each class and order and that the highest plants and animals have appeared only in relatively modern times it is only however in a broad sense that this generalization is now thought to hold good it encounters many apparent exceptions and sundry real ones so far as the rule holds all is as it should be upon an hypothesis of derivation  the rule has its exceptions but curiously enough the most striking class of exceptions if such they be seems to us even more favorable to the doctrine of derivation than is the general rule of a pure and simple ascending gradation we refer to what agassiz calls prophetic and synthetic types for which the former name may suffice as the difference between the two is evanescent   it has been noticed writes our great zoologist that certain types which are frequently prominent among the representatives of past ages combine in their structure peculiarities which at later periods are only observed separately in different distinct types sauroid fishes before reptiles pterodactyles before birds ichthyosauri before dolphins etc  there are entire families of nearly every class of animals which in the state of their perfect development exemplify such prophetic relations  the sauroid fishes of the past geological ages are an example of this kind these fishes which preceded the appearance of reptiles present a combination of ichthyic and reptilian characters not to be found in the true members of this class which form its bulk at present the pterodactyles which preceded the class of birds and the ichthyosauri which preceded the cetacea are other examples of such prophetic typesagassiz contributions essay on classification p 117   now these reptilelike fishes of which garpikes are the living representatives though of earlier appearance are admittedly of higher rank than common fishes they dominated until reptiles appeared when they mostly gave place to or as the derivationists will insist were resolved by divergent variation and natural selection into common fishes destitute of reptilian characters and saurian reptilesthe intermediate grades which according to a familiar piscine saying are neither fish flesh nor good redherring being eliminated and extinguished by natural consequence of the struggle for existence which darwin so aptly portrays and so perhaps of the other prophetic types here type and antitype correspond if these are true prophecies we need not wonder that some who read them in agassizs book will read their fulfillment in darwins  note also in this connection that along with a wonderful persistence of type with change of species genera orders etc from formation to formation no species and no higher group which has once unequivocally died out ever afterward reappears why is this but that the link of generation has been sundered why on the hypothesis of independent originations were not failing species recreated either identically or with a difference in regions eminently adapted to their wellbeing to take a striking case that no part of the world now offers more suitable conditions for wild horses and cattle than the pampas and other plains of south america is shown by the facility with which they have there run wild and enormously multiplied since introduced from the old world not long ago there was no wild american stock yet in the times of the mastodon and megatherium at the dawn of the present period wildhorsescertainly very much like the existing horseroamed over those plains in abundance on the principle of original and direct created adaptation of species to climate and other conditions why were they not reproduced when after the colder intervening era those regions became again eminently adapted to such animals why but because by their complete extinction in south america the line of descent was there utterly broken upon the ordinary hypothesis there is no scientific explanation possible of this series of facts and of many others like them  upon the new hypothesis the succession of the same types of structure within the same areas during the later geological periods ceases to be mysterious and is simply explained by inheritance their cessation is failure of issue  along with these considerations the fact alluded to on page 98 should be remembered that as a general thing related species of the present age are geographically associated the larger part of the plants and still more of the animals of each separate country are peculiar to it and as most species now flourish over the graves of their bygone relatives of former ages so they now dwell among or accessibly near their kindred species  here also comes in that general parallelism between the order of succession of animals and plants in geological times and the gradation among their living representatives from low to highly organized from simple and general to complex and specialized forms also the parallelism between the order of succession of animals in geological times and the changes their living representatives undergo during their embryological growth as if the world were one prolonged gestation modern science has much insisted on this parallelism and to a certain extent is allowed to have made it out all these things which conspire to prove that the ancient and the recent forms of life are somehow intimately connected together in one grand system equally conspire to suggest that the connection is one similar or analogous to generation surely no naturalist can be blamed for entering somewhat confidently upon a field of speculative inquiry which here opens so invitingly nor need former premature endeavors and failures utterly dishearten him  all these things it may naturally be said go to explain the order not the mode of the incoming of species but they all do tend to bring out the generalization expressed by mr wallace in the formula that every species has come into existence coincident both in time and space with preexisting closelyallied species not however that this is proved even of existing species as a matter of general fact it is obviously impossible to prove anything of the kind but we must concede that the known facts strongly suggest such an inference andsince species are only congeries of individuals since every individual came into existence in consequence of preexisting individuals of the same sort so leading up to the individuals with which the species began and since the only material sequence we know of among plants and animals is that from parent to progenythe presumption becomes exceedingly strong that the connection of the incoming with the preexisting species is a genealogical one  here however all depends upon the probability that mr wallaces inference is really true certainly it is not yet generally accepted but a strong current is setting toward its acceptance  so long as universal cataclysms were in vogue and all life upon the earth was thought to have been suddenly destroyed and renewed many times in succession such a view could not be thought of so the equivalent view maintained by agassiz and formerly we believe by dorbigny that irrespectively of general and sudden catastrophes or any known adequate physical cause there has been a total depopulation at the close of each geological period or formation say forty or fifty times or more followed by as many independent great acts of creation at which alone have species been originated and at each of which a vegetable and an animal kingdom were produced entire and complete fullfledged as flourishing as widespread and populous as varied and mutually adapted from the beginning as ever afterwardsuch a view of course supersedes all material connection between successive species and removes even the association and geographical range of species entirely out of the domain of physical causes and of natural science this is the extreme opposite of wallaces and darwin s view and is quite as hypothetical the nearly universal opinion if we rightly gather it manifestly is that the replacement of the species of successive formations was not complete and simultaneous but partial and successive and that along the course of each epoch some species probably were introduced and some doubtless became extinct if all since the tertiary belongs to our present epoch this is certainly true of it if to two or more epochs then the hypothesis of a total change is not true of them  geology makes huge demands upon time and we regret to find that it has exhausted oursthat what we meant for the briefest and most general sketch of some geological considerations in favor of darwins hypothesis has so extended as to leave no room for considering the great facts of comparative anatomy and zoology with which darwins theory very well accords nor for indicating how it admirably serves for explaining the unity of composition of all organisms the existence of representative and rudimentary organs and the natural series which genera and species compose suffice it to say that these are the real strongholds of the new system on its theoretical side that it goes far toward explaining both the physiological and the structural gradations and relations between the two kingdoms and the arrangement of all their forms in groups subordinate to groups all within a few great types that it reads the riddle of abortive organs and of morphological conformity of which no other theory has ever offered a scientific explanation and supplies a ground for harmonizing the two fundamental ideas which naturalists and philosophers conceive to have ruled the organic world though they could not reconcile them namely adaptation to purpose and conditions of existence and unity of type to reconcile these two undeniable principles is the capital problem in the philosophy of natural history and the hypothesis which consistently does so thereby secures a great advantage  we all know that the arm and hand of a monkey the foreleg and foot of a dog and of a horse the wing of a bat and the fin of a porpoise are fundamentally identical that the long neck of the giraffe has the same and no more bones than the short one of the elephant that the eggs of surinam frogs hatch into tadpoles with as good tails for swimming as any of their kindred although as tadpoles they never enter the water that the guineapig is furnished with incisor teeth which it never uses as it sheds them before birth that embryos of mammals and birds have branchial slits and arteries running in loops in imitation or reminiscence of the arrangement which is permanent in fishes and that thousands of animals and plants have rudimentary organs which at least in numerous cases are wholly useless to their possessors etc etc upon a derivative theory this morphological conformity is explained by community of descent and it has not been explained in any other way  naturalists are constantly speaking of related species of the affinity of a genus or other group and of family resemblancevaguely conscious that these terms of kinship are something more than mere metaphors but unaware of the grounds of their aptness mr darwin assures them that they have been talking derivative doctrine all their livesas m jourdain talked prosewithout knowing it  if it is difficult and in many cases practically impossible to fix the limits of species it is still more so to fix those of genera and those of tribes and families are still less susceptible of exact natural circumscription intermediate forms occur connecting one group with another in a manner sadly perplexing to systematists except to those who have ceased to expect absolute limitations in nature all this blending could hardly fail to suggest a former material connection among allied forms such as that which the hypothesis of derivation demands  here it would not be amiss to consider the general principle of gradation throughout organic naturea principle which answers in a general way to the law of continuity in the inorganic world or rather is so analogous to it that both may fairly be expressed by the leibnitzian axiom natura non agit saltatim as an axiom or philosophical principle used to test modal laws or hypotheses this in strictness belongs only to physics in the investigation of nature at large at least in the organic world nobody would undertake to apply this principle as a test of the validity of any theory or supposed law but naturalists of enlarged views will not fail to infer the principle from the phenomena they investigateto perceive that the rule holds under due qualifications and altered forms throughout the realm of nature although we do not suppose that nature in the organic world makes no distinct steps but only short and serial stepsnot infinitely fine gradations but no long leaps or few of them  to glance at a few illustrations out of many that present themselves it would be thought that the distinction between the two organic kingdoms was broad and absolute  plants and animals belong to two very different categories fulfill opposite offices and as to the mass of them are so unlike that the difficulty of the ordinary observer would be to find points of comparison without entering into details which would fill an article we may safely say that the difficulty with the naturalist is all the other waythat all these broad differences vanish one by one as we approach the lower confines of the two kingdoms and that no absolute distinction whatever is now known between them it is quite possible that the same organism may be both vegetable and animal or may be first the one and then the other if some organisms may be said to be at first vegetables and then animals others like the spores and other reproductive bodies of many of the lower algae may equally claim to have first a characteristically animal and then an unequivocally vegetable existence nor is the gradation restricted to these simple organisms it appears in general functions as in that of reproduction which is reducible to the same formula in both kingdoms while it exhibits close approximations in the lower forms also in a common or similar ground of sensibility in the lowest forms of both a common faculty of effecting movements tending to a determinate end traces of which pervade the vegetable kingdomwhile on the other hand this indefinable principle this vegetable  animula vagula blandula hospes comesque corporis  graduates into the higher sensitiveness of the lower class of animals nor need we hesitate to recognize the fine gradations from simple sensitiveness and volition to the higher instinctive and to the other psychical manifestations of the higher brute animals the gradation is undoubted however we may explain it  again propagation is of one mode in the higher animals of two in all plants but vegetative propagation by budding or offshoots extends through the lower grades of animals in both kingdoms there may be separation of the offshoots or indifference in this respect or continued and organic union with the parent stock and this either with essential independence of the offshoots or with a subordination of these to a common whole or finally with such subordination and amalgamation along with specialization of function that the same parts which in other cases can be regarded only as progeny in these become only members of an individual  this leads to the question of individuality a subject quite too large and too recondite for present discussion the conclusion of the whole matter however is that individualitythat very ground of being as distinguished from thingis not attained in nature at one leap if anywhere truly exemplified in plants it is only in the lowest and simplest where the being is a structural unit a single cell memberless and organless though organicthe same thing as those cells of which all the more complex plants are built up and with which every plant and structurally every animal began its development in the ascending gradation of the vegetable kingdom individuality is so to say striven after but never attained in the lower animals it is striven after with greater though incomplete success it is realized only in animals of so high a rank that vegetative multiplication or offshoots are out of the question where all parts are strictly members and nothing else and all subordinated to a common nervous centreis fully realized only in a conscious person  so also the broad distinction between reproduction by seeds or ova and propagation by buds though perfect in some of the lowest forms of life becomes evanescent in others and even the most absolute law we know in the physiology of genuine reproductionthat of sexual cooperationhas its exceptions in both kingdoms in parthenogenesis to which in the vegetable kingdom a most curious and intimate series of gradations leads in plants likewise a long and finely graduated series of transitions leads from bisexual to unisexual blossoms and so in various other respects everywhere we may perceive that nature secures her ends and makes her distinctions on the whole manifest and real but everywhere without abrupt breaks we need not wonder therefore that gradations between species and varieties should occur the more so since genera tribes and other groups into which the naturalist collocates species are far from being always absolutely limited in nature though they are necessarily represented to be so in systems from the necessity of the case the classifications of the naturalist abruptly define where nature more or less blends our systems are nothing if not definite they express differences and some of the coarser gradations but this evinces not their perfection but their imperfection even the best of them are to the system of nature what consecutive patches of the seven colors are to the rainbow  now the principle of gradation throughout organic nature may of course be interpreted upon other assumptions than those of darwins hypothesiscertainly upon quite other than those of a materialistic philosophy with which we ourselves have no sympathy still we conceive it not only possible but probable that this gradation as it has its natural ground may yet have its scientific explanation in any case there is no need to deny that the general facts correspond well with an hypothesis like darwins which is built upon fine gradations  we have contemplated quite long enough the general presumptions in favor of an hypothesis of the derivation of species we cannot forget however while for the moment we overlook the formidable difficulties which all hypotheses of this class have to encounter and the serious implications which they seem to involve we feel moreover that darwins particular hypothesis is exposed to some special objections it requires no small strength of nerve steadily to conceive not only of the diversification but of the formation of the organs of an animal through cumulative variation and natural selection think of such an organ as the eye that most perfect of optical instruments as so produced in the lower animals and perfected in the higher a friend of ours who accepts the new doctrine confesses that for a long while a cold chill came over him whenever he thought of the eye he has at length got over that stage of the complaint and is now in the fever of belief perchance to be succeeded by the sweating stage during which sundry peccant humors may be eliminated from the system for ourselves we dread the chill and have some misgivings about the consequences of the reaction  we find ourselves in the singular position acknowledged by pictetthat is confronted with a theory which although it can really explain much seems inadequate to the heavy task it so boldly assumes but which nevertheless appears better fitted than any other that has been broached to explain if it be possible to explain somewhat of the manner in which organized beings may have arisen and succeeded each other in this dilemma we might take advantage of mr darwins candid admission that he by no means expects to convince old and experienced people whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts all regarded during a long course of years from the old point of view this is nearly our case so owning no call to a larger faith than is expected of us but not prepared to pronounce the whole hypothesis untenable under such construction as we should put upon it we naturally sought to attain a settled conviction through a perusal of several proffered refutations of the theory at least this course seemed to offer the readiest way of bringing to a head the various objections to which the theory is exposed on several accounts some of these opposed reviews especially invite examination we propose accordingly to conclude our task with an article upon darwin and his reviewers   iii   the origin of species like all origination like the institution of any other natural state or order is beyond our immediate ken we see or may learn how things go on we can only frame hypotheses as to how they began  two hypotheses divide the scientific world very unequally upon the origin of the existing diversity of the plants and animals which surround us one assumes that the actual kinds are primordial the other that they are derivative one that all kinds originated supernaturally and directly as such and have continued unchanged in the order of nature the other that the present kinds appeared in some sort of genealogical connection with other and earlier kinds that they became what they now are in the course of time and in the order of nature  or bringing in the word species which is well defined as the perennial succession of individuals commonly of very like individualsas a close corporation of individuals perpetuated by generation instead of electionand reducing the question to mathematical simplicity of statement  species are lines of individuals coming down from the past and running on to the future lines receding therefore from our view in either direction  within our limited observation they appear to be parallel lines as a general thing neither approaching to nor diverging from each other  the first hypothesis assumes that they were parallel from the unknown beginning and will be to the unknown end the second hypothesis assumes that the apparent parallelism is not real and complete at least aboriginally but approximate or temporary that we should find the lines convergent in the past if we could trace them far enough that some of them if produced back would fall into certain fragments of lines which have left traces in the past lying not exactly in the same direction and these farther back into others to which they are equally unparallel it will also claim that the present lines whether on the whole really or only approximately parallel sometimes fork or send off branches on one side or the other producing new lines varieties which run for a while and for aught we know indefinitely when not interfered with near and approximately parallel to the parent line this claim it can establish and it may also show that these close subsidiary lines may branch or vary again and that those branches or varieties which are best adapted to the existing conditions may be continued while others stop or die out and so we may have the basis of a real theory of the diversification of species and here indeed there is a real though a narrow established ground to build upon but as systems of organic nature both doctrines are equally hypotheses are suppositions of what there is no proof of from experience assumed in order to account for the observed phenomena and supported by such indirect evidence as can be had  even when the upholders of the former and more popular system mix up revelation with scientific discussionwhich we decline to dothey by no means thereby render their view other than hypothetical agreeing that plants and animals were produced by omnipotent fiat does not exclude the idea of natural order and what we call secondary causes the record of the fiatlet the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed etc and it was so let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was soseems even to imply them agreeing that they were formed of the dust of the ground and of thin air only leads to the conclusion that the pristine individuals were corporeally constituted like existing individuals produced through natural agencies to agree that they were created after their kinds determines nothing as to what were the original kinds nor in what mode during what time and in what connections it pleased the almighty to introduce the first individuals of each sort upon the earth scientifically considered the two opposing doctrines are equally hypothetical  the two views very unequally divide the scientific world so that believers in the divine right of majorities need not hesitate which side to take at least for the present up to a time quite within the memory of a generation still on the stage two hypotheses about the nature of light very unequally divided the scientific world but the small minority has already prevailed  the emission theory has gone out the undulatory or wave theory after some fluctuation has reached high tide and is now the pervading the fullyestablished system there was an intervening time during which most physicists held their opinions in suspense  the adoption of the undulatory theory of light called for the extension of the same theory to heat and this promptly suggested the hypothesis of a correlation material connection and transmutability of heat light electricity magnetism etc which hypothesis the physicists held in absolute suspense until very lately but are now generally adopting if not already established as a system it promises soon to become so at least it is generally received as a tenable and probably true hypothesis  parallel to this however less cogent the reasons darwin and others having shown it likely that some varieties of plants or animals have diverged in time into cognate species or into forms as different as species are led to infer that all species of a genus may have thus diverged from a common stock and thence to suppose a higher community of origin in ages still farther back and so on following the safe example of the physicists and acknowledging the fact of the diversification of a once homogeneous species into varieties we may receive the theory of the evolution of these into species even while for the present we hold the hypothesis of a further evolution in cool suspense or in grave suspicion in respect to very many questions a wise mans mind rests long in a state neither of belief nor unbelief but your intellectually shortsighted people are apt to be preternaturally clearsighted and to find their way very plain to positive conclusions upon one side or the other of every mooted question  in fact most people and some philosophers refuse to hold questions in abeyance however incompetent they may be to decide them and curiously enough the more difficult recondite and perplexing the questions or hypotheses aresuch for instance as those about organic naturethe more impatient they are of suspense sometimes and evidently in the present case this impatience grows out of a fear that a new hypothesis may endanger cherished and most important beliefs impatience under such circumstances is not unnatural though perhaps needless and if so unwise  to us the present revival of the derivative hypothesis in a more winning shape than it ever before had was not unexpected we wonder that any thoughtful observer of the course of investigation and of speculation in science should not have foreseen it and have learned at length to take its inevitable coming patiently the more so as in darwins treatise it comes in a purely scientific form addressed only to scientific men the notoriety and wide popular perusal of this treatise appear to have astonished the author even more than the book itself has astonished the reading world coming as the new presentation does from a naturalist of acknowledged character and ability and marked by a conscientiousness and candor which have not always been reciprocated we have thought it simply right to set forth the doctrine as fairly and as favorably as we could there are plenty to decry it and the whole theory is widely exposed to attack for the arguments on the other side we may look to the numerous adverse publications which darwin s volume has already called out and especially to those reviews which propose directly to refute it taking various lines and reflecting very diverse modes of thought these hostile critics may be expected to concentrate and enforce the principal objections which can be brought to bear against the derivative hypothesis in general and darwins new exposition of it in particular  upon the opposing side of the question we have read with attention1 an article in the north american review for april last 2 one in the christian examiner boston for may 3 m pictets article in the bibliotheque universelle which we have already made considerable use of which seems throughout most able and correct and which in tone and fairness is admirably in contrast with4 the article in the edinburgh review for may attributedalthough against a large amount of internal presumptive evidenceto the most distinguished british comparative anatomist 5 an article in the north british review for may 6 prof agassiz has afforded an early opportunity to peruse the criticisms he makes in the forthcoming third volume of his great work by a publication of them in advance in the american journal of science for july  in our survey of the lively discussion which has been raised it matters little how our own particular opinions may incline but we may confess to an impression thus far that the doctrine of the permanent and complete immutability of species has not been established and may fairly be doubted  we believe that species vary and that natural selection  works but we suspect that its operation like every analogous natural operation may be limited by something else just as every species by its natural rate of reproduction would soon completely fill any country it could live in but does not being checked by some other species or some other conditionso it may be surmised that variation and natural selection have their struggle and consequent check or are limited by something inherent in the constitution of organic beings  we are disposed to rank the derivative hypothesis in its fullness with the nebular hypothesis and to regard both as allowable as not unlikely to prove tenable in spite of some strong objections but as not therefore demonstrably true those if any there be who regard the derivative hypothesis as satisfactorily proved must have loose notions as to what proof is those who imagine it can be easily refuted and cast aside must we think have imperfect or very prejudiced conceptions of the facts concerned and of the questions at issue  we are not disposed nor prepared to take sides for or against the new hypothesis and so perhaps occupy a good position from which to watch the discussion and criticise those objections which are seemingly inconclusive  on surveying the arguments urged by those who have undertaken to demolish the theory we have been most impressed with a sense of their great inequality some strike us as excellent and perhaps unanswerable some as incongruous with other views of the same writers others when carried out as incompatible with general experience or general beliefs and therefore as proving too much still others as proving nothing at all so that on the whole the effect is rather confusing and disappointing we certainly expected a stronger adverse case than any which the thoroughgoing opposers of darwin appear to have made out wherefore if it be found that the new hypothesis has grown upon our favor as we proceeded this must be attributed not so much to the force of the arguments of the book itself as to the want of force of several of those by which it has been assailed darwins arguments we might resist or adjourn but some of the refutations of it give us more concern than the book itself did  these remarks apply mainly to the philosophical and theological objections which have been elaborately urged almost exclusively by the american reviewers the north british reviewer indeed roundly denounces the book as atheistical but evidently deems the case too clear for argument the edinburgh reviewer on the contrary scouts all such objectionsas well he may since he records his belief in a continuous creative operation a constantly operating secondary creational law through which species are successively produced and he emits faint but not indistinct glimmerings of a transmutation theory of his owniii8 so that he is equally exposed to all the philosophical objections advanced by agassiz and to most of those urged by the other american critics against darwin himself  proposing now to criticise the critics so far as to see what their most general and comprehensive objections amount to we must needs begin with the american reviewers and with their arguments adduced to prove that a derivative hypothesis ought not to be true or is not possible philosophical or theistic  it must not be forgotten that on former occasions very confident judgments have been pronounced by very competent persons which have not been finally ratified of the two great minds of the seventeenth century newton and leibnitz both profoundly religious as well as philosophical one produced the theory of gravitation the other objected to that theory that it was subversive of natural religion the nebular hypothesisa natural consequence of the theory of gravitation and of the subsequent progress of physical and astronomical discoveryhas been denounced as atheistical even down to our own day but it is now largely adopted by the most theistical natural philosophers as a tenable and perhaps sufficient hypothesis and where not accepted is no longer objected to so far as we know on philosophical or religious grounds  the gist of the philosophical objections urged by the two boston reviewers against an hypothesis of the derivation of speciesor at least against darwins particular hypothesis is that it is incompatible with the idea of any manifestation of design in the universe that it denies final causes  a serious objection this and one that demands very serious attention  the proposition that things and events in nature were not designed to be so if logically carried out is doubtless tantamount to atheism yet most people believe that some were designed and others were not although they fall into a hopeless maze whenever they undertake to define their position  so we should not like to stigmatize as atheistically disposed a person who regards certain things and events as being what they are through designed laws whatever that expression means but as not themselves specially ordained or who in another connection believes in general but not in particular providence we could sadly puzzle him with questions but in return he might equally puzzle us then to deny that anything was specially designed to be what it is is one proposition while to deny that the designer supernaturally or immediately made it so is another though the reviewers appear not to recognize the distinction  also scornfully to repudiate or to sneer at the idea of any manifestation of design in the material universeiii9 is one thing while to consider and perhaps to exaggerate the difficulties which attend the practical application of the doctrine of final causes to certain instances is quite another thing yet the boston reviewers we regret to say have not been duly regardful of the difference whatever be thought of darwins doctrine we are surprised that he should be charged with scorning or sneering at the opinions of others upon such a subject perhaps darwins view is incompatible with final causeswe will consider that question presently but as to the examiners charge that he sneers at the idea of any manifestation of design in the material universe though we are confident that no misrepresentation was intended we are equally confident that it is not at all warranted by the two passages cited in support of it  here are the passages   if green woodpeckers alone had existed or we did not know that there were many black and pied kinds i dare say that we should have thought that the green color was a beautiful adaptation to hide this treefrequenting bird from its enemies  if our reason leads us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of inimitable contrivances in nature this same reason tells us though we may easily err on both sides that some contrivances are less perfect can we consider the sting of the wasp or of the bee as perfect which when used against many attacking animals cannot be withdrawn owing to the backward serratures and so inevitably causes the death of the insect by tearing out its viscera   if the sneer here escapes ordinary vision in the detached extracts one of them wanting the end of the sentence it is if possible more imperceptible when read with the context moreover this perusal inclines us to think that the examiner has misapprehended the particular argument or object as well as the spirit of the author in these passages the whole reads more naturally as a caution against the inconsiderate use of final causes in science and an illustration of some of the manifold errors and absurdities which their hasty assumption is apt to involveconsiderations probably equivalent to those which induced lord bacon to liken final causes to vestal virgins so if any one it is here bacon that sitteth in the seat of the scornful as to darwin in the section from which the extracts were made he is considering a subsidiary question and trying to obviate a particular difficulty but we suppose is wholly unconscious of denying any manifestation of design in the material universe he concludes the first sentence   and consequently that it was a character of importance and might have been acquired through natural selection as it is i have no doubt that the color is due to some quite distinct cause probably to sexual selection   after an illustration from the vegetable creation darwin adds   the naked skin on the head of a vulture is generally looked at as a direct adaptation for wallowing in putridity and so it may be or it may possibly be due to the direct action of putrid matter but we should be very cautious in drawing any such inference when we see that the skin on the head of the cleanfeeding male turkey is likewise naked the sutures in the skulls of young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding parturition and no doubt they facilitate or may be indispensable for this act but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and reptiles which have only to escape from a broken egg we may infer that this structure has arisen from the laws of growth and has been taken advantage of in the parturition of the higher animals   all this simply taken is beyond cavil unless the attempt to explain scientifically how any designed result is accomplished savors of impropriety  in the other place darwin is contemplating the patent fact that perfection here below is relative not absoluteand illustrating this by the circumstance that european animals and especially plants are now proving to be better adapted for new zealand than many of the indigenous onesthat the correction for the aberration of light is said on high authority not to be quite perfect even in that most perfect organ the eye and then follows the second extract of the reviewer but what is the position of the reviewer upon his own interpretation of these passages if he insists that green woodpeckers were specifically created so in order that they might be less liable to capture must he not equally hold that the black and pied ones were specifically made of these colors in order that they might be more liable to be caught and would an explanation of the mode in which those woodpeckers came to be green however complete convince him that the color was undesigned  as to the other illustration is the reviewer so complete an optimist as to insist that the arrangement and the weapon are wholly perfect quoad the insect the normal use of which often causes the animal fatally to injure or to disembowel itself either way it seems to us that the argument here as well as the insect performs harikari the examiner adds   we should in like manner object to the word favorable as implying that some species are placed by the creator under unfavorable circumstances at least under such as might be advantageously modified   but are not many individuals and some races of men placed by the creator under unfavorable circumstances at least under such as might be advantageously modified surely these reviewers must be living in an ideal world surrounded by the faultless monsters which our world neer saw in some elysium where imperfection and distress were never heard of such arguments resemble some which we often hear against the bible holding that book responsible as if it originated certain facts on the shady side of human nature or the apparently darker lines of providential dealing though the facts are facts of common observation and have to be confronted upon any theory  the north american reviewer also has a world of his ownjust such a one as an idealizing philosopher would be apt to devisethat is full of sharp and absolute distinctions such for instance as the absolute invariableness of instinct an absolute want of intelligence in any brute animal and a complete monopoly of instinct by the brute animals so that this instinct is a great matter for them only since it sharply and perfectly distinguishes this portion of organic nature from the vegetable kingdom on the one hand and from man on the other most convenient views for argumentative purposes but we suppose not borne out in fact  in their scientific objections the two reviewers take somewhat different lines but their philosophical and theological arguments strikingly coincide they agree in emphatically asserting that darwins hypothesis of the origination of species through variation and natural selection repudiates the whole doctrine of final causes and all indication of design or purpose in the organic world    is neither more nor less than a formal denial of any agency beyond that of a blind chance in the developing or perfecting of the organs or instincts of created beings    it is in vain that the apologists of this hypothesis might say that it merely attributes a different mode and time to the divine agencythat all the qualities subsequently appearing in their descendants must have been implanted and have remained latent in the original pair such a view the examiner declares is nowhere stated in this book and would be we are sure disclaimed by the author  we should like to be informed of the grounds of this sureness the marked rejection of spontaneous generationthe statement of a belief that all animals have descended from four or five progenitors and plants from an equal or lesser number or perhaps if constrained to it by analogy from some one primordial form into which life was first breathedcoupled with the expression to my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the creator that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes than that each species has been independently createdthese and similar expressions lead us to suppose that the author probably does accept the kind of view which the examiner is sure he would disclaim at least we charitably see nothing in his scientific theory to hinder his adoption of lord bacons confession of faith in this regard that notwithstanding god hath rested and ceased from creating yet nevertheless he doth accomplish and fulfill his divine will in all things great and small singular and general as fully and exactly by providence as he could by miracle and new creation though his working be not immediate and direct but by compass not violating nature which is his own law upon the creature   however that may be it is undeniable that mr darwin has purposely been silent upon the philosophical and theological applications of his theory  this reticence under the circumstances argues design and raises inquiry as to the final cause or reason why here as in higher instances confident as we are that there is a final cause we must not be overconfident that we can infer the particular or true one perhaps the author is more familiar with naturalhistorical than with philosophical inquiries and not having decided which particular theory about efficient cause is best founded he meanwhile argues the scientific questions concernedall that relates to secondary causesupon purely scientific grounds as he must do in any case perhaps confident as he evidently is that his view will finally be adopted he may enjoy a sort of satisfaction in hearing it denounced as sheer atheism by the inconsiderate and afterward when it takes its place with the nebular hypothesis and the like see this judgment reversed as we suppose it would be in such event  whatever mr darwins philosophy may be or whether he has any is a matter of no consequence at all compared with the important questions whether a theory to account for the origination and diversification of animal and vegetable forms through the operation of secondary causes does or does not exclude design and whether the establishment by adequate evidence of darwin s particular theory of diversification through variation and natural selection would essentially alter the present scientific and philosophical grounds for theistic views of nature the unqualified affirmative judgment rendered by the two boston reviewers evidently able and practised reasoners must give us pause we hesitate to advance our conclusions in opposition to theirs but after full and serious consideration we are constrained to say that in our opinion the adoption of a derivative hypothesis and of darwins particular hypothesis if we understand it would leave the doctrines of final causes utility and special design just where they were before we do not pretend that the subject is not environed with difficulties every view is so environed and every shifting of the view is likely if it removes some difficulties to bring others into prominence but we cannot perceive that darwins theory brings in any new kind of scientific difficulty that is any with which philosophical naturalists were not already familiar  since natural science deals only with secondary or natural causes the scientific terms of a theory of derivation of speciesno less than of a theory of dynamicsmust needs be the same to the theist as to the atheist  the difference appears only when the inquiry is carried up to the question of primary causea question which belongs to philosophy wherefore darwin s reticence about efficient cause does not disturb us he considers only the scientific questions as already stated we think that a theistic view of nature is implied in his book and we must charitably refrain from suggesting the contrary until the contrary is logically deduced from his premises if however he anywhere maintains that the natural causes through which species are diversified operate without an ordaining  and directing intelligence and that the orderly arrangements and admirable adaptations we see all around us are fortuitous or blind undesigned resultsthat the eye though it came to see was not designed for seeing nor the hand for handlingthen we suppose he is justly chargeable with denying and very needlessly denying all design in organic nature otherwise we suppose not  why if darwins wellknown passage about the eyeiii10 equivocal though some of the language bedoes not imply ordaining and directing intelligence then he refutes his own theory as effectually as any of his opponents are likely to do he asks   may we not believe that under variation proceeding long enough generation multiplying the better variations times enough and natural selection securing the improvements a living optical instrument might be thus formed as superior to one of glass as the works of the creator are to those of man  this must mean one of two things either that the living instrument was made and perfected under which is the same thing as by an intelligent first cause or that it was not if it was then theism is asserted and as to the mode of operation how do we know and why must we believe that fitting precedent forms being in existence a living instrument so different from a lifeless manufacture would be originated and perfected in any other way or that this is not the fitting way if it means that it was not if he so misuses words that by the creator he intends an unintelligent power undirected force or necessity then he has put his case so as to invite disbelief in it for then blind forces have produced not only manifest adaptions of means to specific endswhich is absurd enoughbut better adjusted and more perfect instruments or machines than intellect that is human intellect can contrive and human skill executewhich no sane person will believe  on the other hand if darwin even admitswe will not say adoptsthe theistic view he may save himself much needless trouble in the endeavor to account for the absence of every sort of intermediate form those in the line between one species and another supposed to be derived from it he may be bound to provide but as to an infinite number of other varieties not intermediate gross rude and purposeless the unmeaning creations of an unconscious cause born only to perish which a relentless reviewer has imposed upon his theoryrightly enough upon the atheistic alternativethe theistic view rids him at once of this scum of creation for as species do not now vary at all times and places and in all directions nor produce crude vague imperfect and useless forms there is no reason for supposing that they ever did goodfornothing monstrosities failures of purpose rather than purposeless indeed sometimes occur but these are just as anomalous and unlikely upon darwins theory as upon any other for his particular theory is based and even overstrictly insists upon the most universal of physiological laws namely that successive generations shall differ only slightly if at all from their parents and this effectively excludes crude and impotent forms wherefore if we believe that the species were designed and that natural propagation was designed how can we say that the actual varieties of the species were not equally designed have we not similar grounds for inferring design in the supposed varieties of species that we have in the case of the supposed species of a genus when a  naturalist comes to regard as three closely related species what he before took to be so many varieties of one species how has he thereby strengthened our conviction that the three forms are designed to have the differences which they actually exhibit wherefore so long as gradatory orderly and adapted forms in nature argue design and at least while the physical cause of variation is utterly unknown and mysterious we should advise mr darwin to assume in the philosophy of his hypothesis that variation has been led along certain beneficial lines streams flowing over a sloping plain by gravitation here the counterpart of natural selection may have worn their actual channels as they flowed yet their particular courses may have been assigned and where we see them forming definite and useful lines of irrigation after a manner unaccountable on the laws of gravitation and dynamics we should believe that the distribution was designed  to insist therefore that the new hypothesis of the derivative origin of the actual species is incompatible with final causes and design is to take a position which we must consider philosophically untenable we must also regard it as highly unwise and dangerous in the present state and present prospects of physical and physiological science we should expect the philosophical atheist or skeptic to take this ground also until better informed the unlearned and unphilosophical believer but we should think that the thoughtful theistic philosopher would take the other side not to do so seems to concede that only supernatural events can be shown to be designed which no theist can admitseems also to misconceive the scope and meaning of all ordinary arguments for design in nature this misconception is shared both by the reviewers and the reviewed at least mr darwin uses expressions which imply that the natural forms which surround us because they have a history or natural sequence could have been only generally but not particularly designeda view at once superficial and contradictory whereas his true line should be that his hypothesis concerns the order and not the cause the how and not the why of the phenomena and so leaves the question of design just where it was before  to illustrate this from the theists point of view transfer the question for a moment from the origination of species to the origination of individuals which occurs as we say naturally because natural that is stated fixed or settled is it any the less designed on that account we acknowledge that god is our makernot merely the originator of the race but our maker as individualsand none the less so because it pleased him to make us in the way of ordinary generation if any of us were born unlike our parents and grandparents in a slight degree or in whatever degree would the case be altered in this regard  the whole argument in natural theology proceeds upon the ground that the inference for a final cause of the structure of the hand and of the valves in the veins is just as valid now in individuals produced through natural generation as it would have been in the case of the first man supernaturally created why not then just as good even on the supposition of the descent of men from chimpanzees and gorillas since those animals possess these same contrivances or to take a more supposable case if the argument from structure to design is convincing when drawn from a particular animal say a newfoundland dog and is not weakened by the knowledge that this dog came from similar parents would it be at all weakened if in tracing his genealogy it were ascertained that he was a remote descendant of the mastiff or some other breed or that both these and other breeds came as is suspected from some wolf if not how is the argument for design in the structure of our particular dog affected by the supposition that his wolfish progenitor came from a posttertiary wolf perhaps less unlike an existing one than the dog in question is to some other of the numerous existing races of dogs and that this posttertiary came from an equally or more different tertiary wolf and if the argument from structure to design is not invalidated by our present knowledge that our  individual dog was developed from a single organic cell how is it invalidated by the supposition of an analogous natural descent through a long line of connected forms from such a cell or from some simple animal existing ages before there were any dogs  again suppose we have two wellknown and apparently most decidedly different animals or plants a and d both presenting in their structure and in their adaptations to the conditions of existence as valid and clear evidence of design as any animal or plant ever presented suppose we have now discovered two intermediate species b and c which make up a series with equable differences from a to d is the proof of design or final cause in a and d whatever it amounted to at all weakened by the discovery of the intermediate forms rather does not the proof extend to the intermediate species and go to show that all four were equally designed suppose now the number of intermediate forms to be much increased and therefore the gradations to be closer yetas close as those between the various sorts of dogs or races of men or of horned cattle would the evidence of design as shown in the structure of any of the members of the series be any weaker than it was in the case of a and d whoever contends that it would be should likewise maintain that the origination of individuals by generation is incompatible with design or an impossibility in nature we might all have confidently thought the latter antecedently to experience of the fact of reproduction let our experience teach us wisdom  these illustrations make it clear that the evidence of design from structure and adaptation is furnished complete by the individual animal or plant itself and that our knowledge or our ignorance of the history of its formation or mode of production adds nothing to it and takes nothing away  we infer design from certain arrangements and results and we have no other way of ascertaining it testimony unless infallible cannot prove it and is out of the question here testimony is not the appropriate proof of design adaptation to purpose is some arrangements in nature appear to be contrivances but may leave us in doubt many others of which the eye and the hand are notable examples compel belief with a force not appreciably short of demonstration clearly to settle that such as these must have been designed goes far toward proving that other organs and other seemingly less explicit adaptations in nature must also have been designed and clinches our belief from manifold considerations that all nature is a preconcerted arrangement a manifested design a strange contradiction would it be to insist that the shape and markings of certain rude pieces of flint lately found in driftdeposits prove design but that nicer and thousandfold more complex adaptations to use in animals and vegetables do not a fortiori argue design  we could not affirm that the arguments for design in nature are conclusive to all minds but we may insist upon grounds already intimated that whatever they were good for before darwins book appeared they are good for now to our minds the argument from design always appeared conclusive of the being and continued operation of an intelligent first cause the ordainer of nature and we do not see that the grounds of such belief would be disturbed or shifted by the adoption of darwins hypothesis we are not blind to the philosophical difficulties which the thoroughgoing implication of design in nature has to encounter nor is it our vocation to obviate them it suffices us to know that they are not new nor peculiar difficultiesthat as darwin s theory and our reasonings upon it did not raise these perturbing spirits they are not bound to lay them meanwhile that the doctrine of design encounters the very same difficulties in the material that it does in the moral world is just what ought to be expected  so the issue between the skeptic and the theist is only the old one long ago argued outnamely whether organic nature is a result of design or of chance variation and natural selection open no third alternative they concern only the question how the results whether fortuitous or designed may have been brought about organic nature abounds with unmistakable and irresistible indications of design and being a connected and consistent system this evidence carries the implication of design throughout the whole on the other hand chance carries no probabilities with it can never be developed into a consistent system but when applied to the explanation of orderly or beneficial results heaps up improbabilities at every step beyond all computation to us a fortuitous cosmos is simply inconceivable  the alternative is a designed cosmos  it is very easy to assume that because events in nature are in one sense accidental and the operative forces which bring them to pass are themselves blind and unintelligent physically considered all forces are therefore they are undirected or that he who describes these events as the results of such forces thereby assumes that they are undirected this is the assumption of the boston reviewers and of mr agassiz who insists that the only alternative to the doctrine that all organized beings were supernaturally created just as they are is that they have arisen spontaneously through the omnipotence of matteriii11  as to all this nothing is easier than to bring out in the conclusion what you introduce in the premises if you import atheism into your conception of variation and natural selection you can readily exhibit it in the result  if you do not put it in perhaps there need be none to come out while the mechanician is considering a steamboat or locomotiveengine as a material organism and contemplating the fuel water and steam the source of the mechanical forces and how they operate he may not have occasion to mention the engineer but the orderly and special results accomplished the why the movements are in this or that particular direction etc is inexplicable without him if mr darwin believes that the events which he supposes to have occurred and the results we behold were undirected and undesigned or if the physicist believes that the natural forces to which he refers phenomena are uncaused and undirected no argument is needed to show that such belief is atheism but the admission of the phenomena  and of these natural processes and forces does not necessitate any such belief nor even render it one whit less improbable than before  surely too the accidental element may play its part in nature without negativing design in the theists view he believes that the earths surface has been very gradually prepared for man and the existing animal races that vegetable matter has through a long series of generations imparted fertility to the soil in order that it may support its present occupants that even beds of coal have been stored up for mans benefit yet what is more accidental and more simply the consequence of physical agencies than the accumulation of vegetable matter in a peat bog and its transformation into coal no scientific person at this day doubts that our solar system is a progressive development whether in his conception he begins with molten masses or aeriform or nebulous masses or with a fluid revolving mass of vast extent from which the specific existing worlds have been developed one by one what theist doubts that the actual results of the development in the inorganic worlds are not merely compatible with design but are in the truest sense designed re suits not mr agassiz certainly who adopts a remarkable illustration of design directly founded on the nebular hypothesis drawing from the position and times of the revolution of the world so originated direct evidence that the physical world has been ordained in conformity with laws which obtain also among living beings but the reader of the interesting expositioniii12 will notice that the designed result has been brought to pass through what speaking after the manner of men might be called a chapter of accidents  a natural corollary of this demonstration would seem to be that a material connection between a series of created thingssuch as the development of one of them from another  or of all from a common stockis highly compatible with their intellectual connection namely with their being designed and directed by one mind yet upon some ground which is not explained and which we are unable to conjecture mr agassiz concludes to the contrary in the organic kingdoms and insists that because the members of such a series have an intellectual connection they cannot be the result of a material differentiation of the objects themselvesiii13 that is they cannot have had a genealogical connection but is there not as much intellectual connection between the successive generations of any species as there is between the several species of a genus or the several genera of an order as the intellectual connection here is realized through the material connection why may it not be so in the case of species and genera on all sides therefore the implication seems to be quite the other way   returning to the accidental element it is evident that the strongest point against the compatibility of darwins hypothesis with design in nature is made when natural selection is referred to as picking out those variations which are improvements from a vast number which are not improvements but perhaps the contrary and therefore useless or purposeless and born to perish but even here the difficulty is not peculiar for nature abounds with analogous instances some of our race are useless or worse as regards the improvement of mankind yet the race may be designed to improve and may be actually improving or to avoid the complication with free agencythe whole animate life of a country depends absolutely upon the vegetation the vegetation upon the rain the moisture is furnished by the ocean is raised by the suns heat from the oceans surface and is wafted inland by the winds but what multitudes of raindrops fall back into the oceanare as much without a final cause as the incipient varieties which come to nothing  does it therefore follow that the rains which are bestowed upon the soil with such rule and average regularity were not designed to support vegetable and animal life consider likewise the vast proportion of seeds and pollen of ova and younga thousand or more to onewhich come to nothing and are therefore purposeless in the same sense and only in the same sense as are darwins unimproved and unused slight variations the world is full of such cases and these must answer the argumentfor we cannot except by thus showing that it proves too much  finally it is worth noticing that though natural selection is scientifically explicable variation is not thus far the cause of variation or the reason why the offspring is sometimes unlike the parents is just as mysterious as the reason why it is generally like the parents it is now as inexplicable as any other origination and if ever explained the explanation will only carry up the sequence of secondary causes one step farther and bring us in face of a somewhat different problem but which will have the same element of mystery that the problem of variation has now  circumstances may preserve or may destroy the variations man may use or direct them but selection whether artificial or natural no more originates them than man originates the power which turns a wheel when he dams a stream and lets the water fall upon it the origination of this power is a question about efficient cause the tendency of science in respect to this obviously is not toward the omnipotence of matter as some suppose but to ward the omnipotence of spirit  so the real question we come to is as to the way in which we are to conceive intelligent and efficient cause to be exerted and upon what exerted are we bound to suppose efficient cause in all cases exerted upon nothing to evoke something into existenceand this thousands of times repeated when a slight change in the details would make all the difference between successive species why may not the new species or some of them be designed diversifications of the old  there are perhaps only three views of efficient cause which may claim to be both philosophical and theistic  1  the view of its exertion at the beginning of time endowing matter and created things with forces which do the work and produce the phenomena  2  this same view with the theory of insulated interpositions or occasional direct action engrafted upon itthe view that events and operations in general go on in virtue simply of forces communicated at the first but that now and then and only now and then the deity puts his hand directly to the work  3  the theory of the immediate orderly and constant however infinitely diversified action of the intelligent efficient cause  it must be allowed that while the third is preeminently the christian view all three are philosophically compatible with design in nature the second is probably the popular conception perhaps most thoughtful people oscillate from the middle view toward the first or the thirdadopting the first on some occasions the third on others those philosophers who like and expect to settle all mooted questions will take one or the other extreme the examiner inclines toward the north american reviewer fully adopts the third view to the logical extent of maintaining that the origin of an individual as well as the origin of a species or a genus can be explained only by the direct action of an intelligent creative cause to silence his critics this is the line for mr darwin to take for it at once and completely relieves his scientific theory from every theological objection which his reviewers have urged against it  at present we suspect that our author prefers the first conception though he might contend that his hypothesis is compatible with either of the three that it is also compatible with an atheistic or pantheistic conception of the universe is an objection which being shared by all physical and some ethical or moral science cannot specially be urged against darwins system as he rejects spontaneous generation and admits of intervention at the beginning of organic life and probably in more than one instance he is not wholly excluded from adopting the middle view although the interventions he would allow are few and far back yet one interposition admits the principle as well as more interposition presupposes particular necessity or reason for it and raises the question when and how often it may have been necessary it might be the natural supposition if we had only one set of species to account for or if the successive inhabitants of the earth had no other connections or resemblances than those which adaptation to similar conditions which final causes in the narrower sense might explain but if this explanation of organic nature requires one to believe that at innumerable periods in the earths history certain elemental atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues and this when the results are seen to be strictly connected and systematic we cannot wonder that such interventions should at length be considered not as interpositions or interferences but ratherto use the reviewers own languageas exertions so frequent and beneficent that we come to regard them as the ordinary action of him who laid the foundation of the earth and without whom not a sparrow falleth to the groundiii14 what does the difference between mr darwin and his reviewer now amount to if we say that according to one view the origination of species is natural according to the other miraculous mr darwin agrees that what is natural as much requires and presupposes an intelligent mind to render it so that is to effect it continually or at stated timesas what is supernatural does to effect it for onceiii15 he merely inquires into the form of the miracle may remind us that all recorded miracles except the primal creation of matter were transformations or actions in and upon natural things and will ask how many times and how frequently may the origination of successive species be repeated before the supernatural merges in the natural  in short darwin maintains that the origination of a species no less than that of an individual is natural the reviewer that the natural origination of an individual no less than the origination of a species requires and presupposes divine power a fortiori then the origination of a variety requires and presupposes divine power and so between the scientific hypothesis of the one and the philosophical conception of the other no contrariety remains and so concludes the north american reviewer a proper view of the nature of causation places the vital doctrine of the being and the providence of a god on ground that can never be shakeniii16 a worthy conclusion and a sufficient answer to the denunciations and arguments of the rest of the article so far as philosophy and natural theology are concerned if a writer must needs use his own favorite dogma as a weapon with which to give coup de grace to a pernicious theory he should be careful to seize his edgetool by the handle and not by the blade  we can barely glance at a subsidiary philosophical objection of the north american reviewer which the examiner also raises though less explicitly  like all geologists mr darwin draws upon time in the most unlimited manner he is not peculiar in this regard mr agassiz tells us that the conviction is now universal among wellinformed naturalists that this globe has been in existence for innumerable ages and that the length of time elapsed since it first became inhabited cannot be counted in years pictet that the imagination refuses to calculate the immense number of years and of ages during which the faunas of thirty or more epochs have succeeded one another and developed their long succession of generations  now the reviewer declares that such indefinite succession of ages is virtually infinite lacks no characteristic of eternity except its name at least that the difference between such a conception and that of the strictly infinite if any is not appreciable but infinity belongs to metaphysics therefore he concludes darwin supports his theory not by scientific but by metaphysical evidence his theory is essentially and completely metaphysical in character resting altogether upon that idea of the infinite which the human mind can neither put aside nor comprehendiii17 and so a theory which will be generally regarded as much too physical is transferred by a single syllogism to metaphysics  well physical geology must go with it for even on the soberest view it demands an indefinitely long time antecedent to the introduction of organic life upon our earth a fortiori is physical astronomy a branch of metaphysics demanding as it does still larger instalments of infinity as the reviewer calls them both as to time and number moreover far the greater part of physical inquiries now relate to molecular actions which a distinguished natural philosopher informs us we have to regard as the results of an infinite number of in finitely small material particles acting on each other at infinitely small distancesa triad of infinitiesand so physics becomes the most metaphysical of sciences  verily if this style of reasoning is to prevail  thinking is but an idle waste of thought    and naught is everything and everything is naught   the leading objection of mr agassiz is likewise of a philosophical character it is that species exist only as categories of thoughtthat having no material existence they can have had no material variation and no material community of origin here the predication is of species in the subjective sense the inference in the objective sense reduced to plain terms the argument seems to be species are ideas therefore the objects from which the idea is derived cannot vary or blend and cannot have had a genealogical connection  the common view of species is that although they are generalizations yet they have a direct objective ground in nature which genera orders etc have not according to the succinct definition of jussieuand that of linnaeus is identical in meaninga species is the perennial succession of similar individuals in continued generations the species is the chain of which the individuals are the links the sum of the genealogicallyconnected similar individuals constitutes the species which thus has an actuality and ground of distinction not shared by genera and other groups which were not supposed to be genealogically connected how a derivative hypothesis would modify this view in assigning to species only a temporary fixity is obvious yet if naturalists adopt that hypothesis they will still retain jussieus definition which leaves untouched the question as to how and when the perennial successions were established the practical question will only be how much difference between two sets of individuals entitles them to rank under distinct species and that is the practical question now on whatever theory the theoretical question isas stated at the beginning of this articlewhether these specific lines were always as distinct as now  mr agassiz has lost no opportunity of urging the idea that while species have no material existence they yet exist as categories of thought in the same way and only in the same way as genera families orders classes etc he  has taken the ground that all the natural divisions in the animal kingdom are primarily distinct founded upon different categories of characters and that all exist in the same way that is as categories of thought embodied in individual living forms i have attempted to show that branches in the animal kingdom are founded upon different plans of structure and for that very reason have embraced from the beginning representatives between which there could be no community of origin that classes are founded upon different modes of execution of these plans and therefore they also embrace representatives which could have no community of origin that orders represent the different degrees of complication in the mode of execution of each class and therefore embrace representatives which could not have a community of origin any more than the members of different classes or branches that families are founded upon different patterns of form and embrace representatives equally independent in their origin that genera are founded upon ultimate peculiarities of structure embracing representatives which from the very nature of their peculiarities could have no community of origin and that finally species are based upon relationsand proportions that exclude as much as all the preceding distinctions the idea of a common descent  as the community of characters among the beings belonging to these different categories arises from the intellectual connection which shows them to be categories of thought they cannot be the result of a gradual  material differentiation of the objects themselves the argument on which these views are founded may be summed up in the following few words  species genera families etc exist as thoughts individuals as factsiii18  an ingenious dilemma caps the argument   it seems to me that there is much confusion of ideas in the general statement of the variability of species so often repeated lately if species do not exist at all as the supporters of the transmutation theory maintain how can they vary and if individuals alone exist how can the differences which may be observed among them prove the variability of species   now we imagine that mr darwin need not be dangerously gored by either horn of this curious dilemma although we ourselves cherish oldfashioned prejudices in favor of the probable permanence and therefore of a more stable objective ground of species yet we agreeand mr darwin will agree fully with mr agassizthat species and he will add varieties exist as categories of thought that is as cognizable distinctionswhich is all that we can make of the phrase here whatever it may mean in the aristotelian metaphysics admitting that species are only categories of thought and not facts or things how does this prevent the individuals which are material things from having varied in the course of time so as to exemplify the present almost innumerable categories of thought or embodiments of divine thought in material forms orviewed on the human sidein forms marked with such orderly and graduated resemblances and differences as to suggest to our minds the idea of species genera orders etc and to our reason the inference of a divine original we have no clear idea how mr agassiz intends to answer this question in saying that branches are founded upon different plans of structure classes upon different mode of execution of these plans orders on different degrees of complication in the mode of execution families upon different patterns of form genera upon ultimate peculiarities of structure and species upon relations and proportions that is we do not perceive how these several categories of thought exclude the possibility or the probability that the individuals which manifest or suggest the thoughts had an ultimate community of origin  moreover mr darwin might insinuate that the particular philosophy of classification upon which this whole argument reposes is as purely hypothetical and as little accepted as is his own doctrine if both are pure hypotheses it is hardly fair or satisfactory to extinguish the one by the other if there is no real contradiction between them nothing is gained by the attempt  as to the dilemma propounded suppose we try it upon that category of thought which we call chair this is a genus comprising a common chair sella vulgaris arm or easy chair s cathedra the rockingchair s  oscillanswidely distributed in the united statesand some others each of which has sported as the gardeners say into many varieties but now as the genus and the species have no material existence how can they vary if only individual chairs exist how can the differences which may be observed among them prove the variability of the species to which we reply by asking which does the question refer to the category of thought or the individual embodiment if the former then we would remark that our categories of thought vary from time to time in the readiest manner and although the divine thoughts are eternal yet they are manifested to us in time and succession and by their manifestation only can we know them how imperfectly allowing that what has no material existence can have had no material connection or variation we should yet infer that what has intellectual existence and connection might have intellectual variation and turning to the individuals which represent the species we do not see how all this shows that they may not vary observation shows us that they do wherefore taught by fact that successive individuals do vary we safely infer that the idea must have varied and that this variation of the individual representatives proves the variability of the species whether objectively or subjectively regarded  each species or sort of chair as we have said has its varieties and one species shades off by gradations into another andnote it wellthese numerous and successively slight variations and gradations far from suggesting an accidental origin to chairs and to their forms are very proofs of design  again edifice is a generic category of thought egyptian grecian byzantine and gothic buildings are wellmarked species of which each individual building of the sort is a material embodiment now the question is whether these categories or ideas may not have been evolved one from another in succession or from some primal less specialized edificial category what better evidence for such hypothesis could we have than the variations and grades which connect these species with each other we might extend the parallel and get some good illustrations of natural selection from the history of architecture and the origin of the different styles under different climates and conditions two considerations may qualify or limit the comparison one that houses do not propagate so as to produce continuing lines of each sort and variety but this is of small moment on agassizs view he holding that genealogical connection is not of the essence of a species at all the other that the formation and development of the ideas upon which human works proceed are gradual or as the same great naturalist well states it while human thought is consecutive divine thought is simultaneous but we have no right to affirm this of divine action  we must close here we meant to review some of the more general scientific objections which we thought not altogether tenable but after all we are not so anxious just now to know whether the new theory is well founded on facts as whether it would be harmless if it were besides we feel quite unable to answer some of these objections and it is pleasanter to take up those which one thinks he can  among the unanswerable perhaps the weightiest of the objections is that of the absence in geological deposits of vestiges of the intermediate forms which the theory requires to have existed here all that mr darwin can do is to insist upon the extreme imperfection of the geological record and the uncertainty of negative evidence but withal he allows the force of the objection almost as much as his opponents urge itso much so indeed that two of his english critics turn the concession unfairly upon him and charge him with actually basing his hypothesis upon these and similar difficultiesas if he held it because of the difficulties and not in spite of them a handsome return for his candor  as to this imperfection of the geological record perhaps we should get a fair and intelligible illustration of it by imagining the existing animals and plants of new england with all their remains and products since the arrival of the mayflower to be annihilated and that in the coming time the geologists of a new colony dropped by the new zealand fleet on its way to explore the ruins of london undertake after fifty years of examination to reconstruct in a catalogue the flora and fauna of our day that is from the close of the glacial period to the present time with all the advantages of a surface exploration what a beggarly account it would be how many of the land animals and plants which are enumerated in the massachusetts official reports would it be likely to contain  another unanswerable question asked by the boston reviewers is why when structure and instinct or habit vary as they must have varied on darwins hypothesisthey vary together and harmoniously instead of vaguely we cannot tell because we cannot tell why either varies at all yet as they both do vary in successive generationsas is seen under domesticationand are correlated we can only adduce the fact darwin may be precluded from our answer but we may say that they vary together because designed to do so a reviewer says that the chance of their varying together is inconceivably small yet if they do not the variant individuals must all perish then it is well that it is not left to chance to refer to a parallel case before we were born nourishment and the equivalent to respiration took place in a certain way but the moment we were ushered into this breathing world our actions promptly conformed both as to respiration and nourishment to the before unused structure and to the new surroundings  now says the examiner suppose for instance the gills of an aquatic animal converted into lungs while instinct still compelled a continuance under water would not drowning ensue no doubt butsimply contemplating the facts instead of theorizingwe notice that young frogs do not keep their heads under water after ceasing to be tadpoles the instinct promptly changes with the structure without supernatural interpositionjust as darwin would have it if the development of a variety or incipient species though rare were as natural as a metamorphosis  or if a quadruped not yet furnished with wings were suddenly inspired with the instinct of a bird and precipitated itself from a cliff would not the descent be hazardously rapid doubtless the animal would be no better supported than the objection but darwin makes very little indeed of voluntary efforts as a cause of change and even poor lamarck need not be caricatured he never supposed that an elephant would take such a notion into his wise head or that a squirrel would begin with other than short and easy leaps yet might not the length of the leap be increased by practice  the north american reviewers position that the higher brute animals have comparatively little instinct and no intelligence is a heavy blow and great discouragement to dogs horses elephants and monkeys thus stripped of their all and left to shift for themselves as they may in this hard world their pursuit and seeming attainment of knowledge under such peculiar difficulties are interesting to contemplate however we are not so sure as is the critic that instinct regularly increases downward and decreases upward in the scale of being now that the case of the bee is reduced to moderate proportionsiii19 we know of nothing in instinct surpassing that of an animal so high as a bird the talegal the male of which plumes himself upon making a hotbed in which to batch his partners eggswhich he tends and regulates the beat of about as carefully and skillfully as the unplumed biped does an eccaleobioniii20  as to the real intelligence of the higher brutes it has been ably defended by a far more competent observer mr agassiz to whose conclusions we yield a general assent although we cannot quite place the best of dogs in that respect upon a level with a considerable proportion of poor humanity nor indulge the hope or indeed the desire of a renewed acquaintance with the whole animal kingdom in a future life  the assertion that acquired habitudes or instincts and acquired structures are not heritable any breeder or good observer can refute      that the human mind has become what it is out of a developed instinct is a statement which mr darwin nowhere makes and we presume would not accept that he would have us believe that individual animals acquire their  instincts graduallyiii21 is a statement which must have been penned in inadvertence both of the very definition of instinct and of everything we know of in mr darwins book  it has been attempted to destroy the very foundation of darwins hypothesis by denying that there are any wild varieties to speak of for natural selection to operate upon we cannot gravely sit down to prove that wild varieties abound we should think it just as necessary to prove that snow falls in winter that variation among plants cannot be largely due to hybridism and that their variation in nature is not essentially different from much that occurs in domestication and in the longrun probably hardly less in amount we could show if our space permitted  as to the sterility of hybrids that can no longer be insisted upon as absolutely true nor be practically used as a test between species and varieties unless we allow that hares and rabbits are of one species that such sterility whether total or partial subserves a purpose in keeping species apart and was so designed we do not doubt but the critics fail to perceive that this sterility proves nothing whatever against the derivative origin of the actual species for it may as well have been intended to keep separate those forms which have reached a certain amount of divergence as those which were always thus distinct  the argument for the permanence of species drawn from the identity with those now living of cats birds and other animals preserved in egyptian catacombs was good enough as used by cuvier against sthilaire that is against the supposition that time brings about a gradual alteration of whole species but it goes for little against darwin unless it be proved that species never vary or that the perpetuation of a variety necessitates the extinction of the parent breed for darwin clearly maintainswhat the facts warrantthat the mass of a species remains fixed so long as it exists at all though it may set off a variety now and then the variety may finally supersede the parent form or it may coexist with it yet it does not in the least hinder the unvaried stock from continuing true to the breed unless it crosses with it the common law of inheritance may be expected to keep both the original and the variety mainly true as long as they last and none the less so because they have given rise to occasional varieties the tailless manx cats like the curtailed fox in the fable have not induced the normal breeds to dispense with their tails nor have the dorkings apparently known to pliny affected the permanence of the common sort of fowl  as to the objection that the lower forms of life ought on darwins theory to have been long ago improved out of existence and replaced by higher forms the objectors forget what a vacuum that would leave below and what a vast field there is to which a simple organization is best adapted and where an advance would be no improvement but the contrary to accumulate the greatest amount of being upon a given space and to provide as much enjoyment of life as can be under the conditions is what nature seems to aim at and this is effected by diversification  finally we advise nobody to accept darwins or any other derivative theory as true the time has not come for that and perhaps never will we also advise against a similar credulity on the other side in a blind faith that speciesthat the manifold sorts and forms of existing animals and vegetableshave no secondary cause the contrary is already not unlikely and we suppose will hereafter become more and more probable but we are confident that if a derivative hypothesis ever is established it will be so on a solid theistic ground  meanwhile an inevitable and legitimate hypothesis is on trialan hypothesis thus far not untenablea trial just now very useful to science and we conclude not harmful to religion unless injudicious assailants temporarily make it so  one good effect is already manifest its enabling the advocates of the hypothesis of a multiplicity of human species to perceive the double insecurity of their ground when the races of men are admitted to be of one species the corollary that they are of one origin may be expected to follow those who allow them to be of one species must admit an actual diversification into stronglymarked and persistent varieties and so admit the basis of fact upon which the darwinian hypothesis is built while those on the other hand who recognize several or numerous human species will hardly be able to maintain that such species were primordial and supernatural in the ordinary sense of the word  the english mind is prone to positivism and kindred forms of materialistic philosophy and we must expect the derivative theory to be taken up in that interest we have no predilection for that school but the contrary if we had we might have looked complacently upon a line of criticism which would indirectly but effectively play into the hands of positivists and materialistic atheists generally the wiser and stronger ground to take is that the derivative hypothesis leaves the argument for design and therefore for a designer as valid as it ever was that to do any work by an instrument must require and therefore presuppose the exertion rather of more than of less power than to do it directly that whoever  would be a consistent theist should believe that design in the natural world is coextensive with providence and hold as firmly to the one as he does to the other in spite of the wholly similar and apparently insuperable difficulties which the mind encounters whenever it endeavors to develop the idea into a system either in the material and organic or in the moral world it is enough in the way of obviating objections to show that the philosophical difficulties of the one are the same and only the same as of the other                      iv         capitalthe mother of labour      an economical problem discussed from a         physiological point of view                  1890  the first act of a newborn child is to draw a deep breath in fact it will never draw a deeper inasmuch as the passages and chambers of the lungs once distended with air do not empty themselves again it is only a fraction of their contents which passes in and out with the flow and the ebb of the respiratory tide mechanically this act of drawing breath or inspiration is of the same nature as that by which the handles of a bellows are separated in order to fill the bellows with air and in like manner it involves that expenditure of energy which we call exertion or work or labour it is therefore no mere metaphor to say that man is destined to a life of toil the work of respiration which began with his first breath ends only with his last nor does one born in the purple get off with a lighter task than the child who first sees light under a hedge  148 how is it that the newborn infant is enabled to perform this first instalment of the sentence of lifelong labour which no man may escape  whatever else a child may be in respect of this particular question it is a complicated piece of mechanism built up out of materials supplied by its mother and in the course of such buildingup provided with a set of motorsthe muscles each of these muscles contains a stock of substance capable of yielding energy under certain conditions one of which is a change of state in the nerve fibres connected with it the powder in a loaded gun is such another stock of substance capable of yielding energy in consequence of a change of state in the mechanism of the lock which intervenes between the finger of the man who pulls the trigger and the cartridge if that change is brought about the potential energy of the powder passes suddenly into actual energy and does the work of propelling the bullet the powder therefore may be appropriately called workstuff not only because it is stuff which is easily made to yield work in the physical sense but because a good deal of work in the economical sense has contributed to its production labour was necessary to collect transport and purify the raw sulphur and saltpetre to cut wood and convert it into powdered charcoal to mix these ingredients in the right proportions to give the mixture the proper grain and so on the powder 149 once formed part of the stock or capital of a powdermaker and it is not only certain natural bodies which are collected and stored in the gunpowder but the labour bestowed on the operations mentioned may be figuratively said to be incorporated in it  in principle the workstuff stored in the muscles of the newborn child is comparable to that stored in the gunbarrel the infant is launched into altogether new surroundings and these operate through the mechanism of the nervous machinery with the result that the potential energy of some of the workstuff in the muscles which bring about inspiration is suddenly converted into actual energy and this operating through the mechanism of the respiratory apparatus gives rise to an act of inspiration as the bullet is propelled by the going off of the powder as it might be said that the ribs are raised and the midriff depressed by the going off of certain portions of muscular workstuff this workstuff is part of a stock or capital of that commodity stored up in the childs organism before birth at the expense of the mother and the mother has made good her expenditure by drawing upon the capital of foodstuffs which furnished her daily maintenance  under these circumstances it does not appear to me to be open to doubt that the primary act of outward labour in the series which necessarily accompany 150 the life of man is dependent upon the preexistence of a stock of material which is not only of use to him but which is disposed in such a manner as to be utilisable with facility and i further imagine that the propriety of the application of the term capital to this stock of useful substance cannot be justly called in question inasmuch as it is easy to prove that the essential constituents of the workstuff accumulated in the childs muscles have merely been transferred from the store of foodstuffs which everybody admits to be capital by means of the maternal organism to that of the child in which they are again deposited to await use every subsequent act of labour in like manner involves an equivalent consumption of the childs store of workstuffits vital capital and one of the main objects of the process of breathing is to get rid of some of the effects of that consumption it follows then that even if no other than the respiratory work were going on in the organism the capital of workstuff which the child brought with it into the world must sooner or later be used up and the movements of breathing must come to an end just as the seesaw of the piston of a steamengine stops when the coal in the fireplace has burnt away  milk however is a stock of materials which essentially consists of savings from the foodstuffs supplied to the mother and these savings are 151 in such a physical and chemical condition that the organism of the child can easily convert them into workstuff that is to say by borrowing directly from the vital capital of the mother indirectly from the store in the natural bodies accessible to her it can make good the loss of its own the operation of borrowing however involves further work that is the labour of sucking which is a mechanical operation of much the same nature as breathing the child thus pays for the capital it borrows in labour but as the value in workstuff of the milk obtained is very far greater than the value of that labour estimated by the consumption of workstuff it involves the operation yields a large profit to the infant the overplus of foodstuff suffices to increase the childs capital of workstuff and to supply not only the materials for the enlargement of the buildings and machinery which is expressed by the childs growth but also the energy required to put all these materials together and to carry them to their proper places thus throughout the years of infancy and so long thereafter as the youth or man is not thrown upon his own resources he lives by consuming the vital capital provided by others to use a terminology which is more common than appropriate whatever work he performs and he does a good deal if only in mere locomotion is unproductive  152 let us now suppose the child come to mans estate in the condition of a wandering savage dependent for his food upon what he can pick up or catch after the fashion of the australian aborigines it is plain that the place of mother as the supplier of vital capital is now taken by the fruits seeds and roots of plants and by various kinds of animals it is they alone which contain stocks of those substances which can be converted within the mans organism into workstuff and of the other matters except air and water required to supply the constant consumption of his capital and to keep his organic machinery going in no way does the savage contribute to the production of these substances whatever labour he bestows upon such vegetable and animal bodies on the contrary is devoted to their destruction and it is a mere matter of accident whether a little labour yields him a great dealas in the case for example of a stranded whale or whether much labour yields next to nothingas in times of longcontinued drought the savage like the child borrows the capital he needs and at any rate intentionally does nothing towards repayment it would plainly be an improper use of the word produce to say that his labour in hunting for the roots or the fruits or the eggs or the grubs and snakes which he finds and eats pro duces or contributes to produce them the same thing is true of more advanced tribes who 153 are still merely hunters such as the esquimaux they may expend more labour and skill but it is spent in destruction  when we pass from these to men who lead a purely pastoral life like the south american gauchos or some asiatic nomads there is an important change let us suppose the owner of a flock of sheep to live on the milk cheese and flesh which they yield it is obvious that the flock stands to him in the economic relation of the mother to the child inasmuch as it supplies him with foodstuffs competent to make good the daily and hourly losses of his capital of workstuff if we imagine our sheepowner to have access to extensive pastures and to be troubled neither by predacious animals nor by rival shepherds the performance of his pastoral functions will hardly involve the expenditure of any more labour than is needful to provide him with the exercise required to maintain health and this is true even if we take into account the trouble originally devoted to the domestication of the sheep it surely would be a most singular pretension for the shepherd to talk of the flock as the produce of his labour in any but a very limited sense in truth his labour would have been a mere accessory of production of very little consequence under the circumstances supposed a ram and some ewes left to themselves for a few years would probably generate as large a flock 154 and the superadded labour of the shepherd would have little more effect upon their production than upon that of the blackberries on the bushes about the pastures for the most part the increment would be thoroughly unearned and if it is a rule of absolute political ethics that owners have no claim upon betterment brought about independently of their own labour then the shepherd would have no claim to at least ninetenths of the increase of the flock  but if the shepherd has no real claim to the title of producer who has  are the rams and ewes the true producers certainly their title is better if borrowing from the old terminology of chemistry they only claim to be regarded as the proximate principles of production and yet if strict justice is to be dispensed even they are to be regarded rather as collectors and distributors than as producers for all that they really do is to collect slightly modify and render easily accessible the vital capital which already exists in the green herbs on which they feed but in such a form as to be practically out of the reach of man  thus from an economic point of view the sheep are more comparable to confectioners than to producers the usefulness of biscuit lies in the raw flour of which it is made but raw flour does not answer as an article of human diet and biscuit does so the usefulness of mutton lies mainly in certain chemical compounds which it 155 contains the sheep gets them out of grass we cannot live on grass but we can on mutton  now herbaceous and all other green plants stand alone among terrestrial natural bodies in so far as under the influence of light they possess the power to build up out of the carbonic acid gas in the atmosphere water and certain nitrogenous and mineral salts those substances which in the animal organism are utilised as workstuff they are the chief and for practical purposes the sole producers of that vital capital which we have seen to be the necessary antecedent of every act of labour every green plant is a laboratory in which so long as the sun shines upon it materials furnished by the mineral world gases water saline compounds are worked up into those foodstuffs without which animal life cannot be carried on and since up to the present time synthetic chemistry has not advanced so far as to achieve this feat the green plant may be said to be the only living worker whose labour directly results in the production of that vital capital which is the necessary antecedent of human labour nor is this statement a paradox involving perpetual motion because the energy by which the plant does its work is supplied by the sunthe primordial capitalist so far as we are concerned but 156 it cannot be too strongly impressed upon the mind that sunshine air water the best soil that is to be found on the surface of the earth might coexist yet without plants there is no known agency competent to generate the socalled protein compounds by which alone animal life can be permanently supported and not only are plants thus essential but in respect of particular kinds of animals they must be plants of a particular nature if there were no terrestrial green plants but say cypresses and mosses pastoral and agricultural life would be alike impossible indeed it is difficult to imagine the possibility of the existence of any large animal as the labour required to get at a sufficiency of the store of foodstuffs contained in such plants as these could hardly extract from them an equivalent for the waste involved in that expenditure of work       it remains to be seen whether the plants which have no     chlorophyll and flourish in darkness such as the fungi can     live upon purely mineral food  we are compact of dust and air from that we set out and to that complexion must we come at last the plant either directly or by some animal intermediary lends us the capital which enables us to carry on the business of life as we flit through the upper world from the one term of our journey to the other popularly no doubt it is permissible to speak of the soil as a producer just as we may talk of the daily movement of the sun  but as i have elsewhere remarked propositions which are to bear any deductive strain that may be put upon them must run the risk of 157 seeming pedantic rather than that of being inaccurate and the statement that land in the sense of cultivable soil is a producer or even one of the essentials of economic production is anything but accurate the process of waterculture in which a plant is not planted in any soil but is merely supported in water containing in solution the mineral ingredients essential to that plant is now thoroughly understood and if it were worth while a crop yielding abundant foodstuffs could be raised on an acre of fresh water no less than on an acre of dry land in the arctic regions again land has nothing to do with production in the social economy of the esquimaux who live on seals and other marine animals and might like proteus shepherd the flocks of poseidon if they had a mind for pastoral life but the seals and the bears are dependent on other inhabitants of the sea until somewhere in the series we come to the minute green plants which float in the ocean and are the real producers by which the whole of its vast animal population is supported thus when we find set forth as an absolute 158 truth the statement that the essential factors in economic production are land capital and labourwhen this is offered as an axiom whence all sorts of other important truths may be deducedit is needful to remember that the assertion is true only with a qualification undoubtedly vital capital is essential for as we have seen no human work can be done unless it exists not even that internal work of the body which is necessary to passive life but with respect to labour that is human labour i hope to have left no doubt on the readers mind that in regard to production the importance of human labour may be so small as to be almost a vanishing quantity moreover it is certain that there is no approximation to a fixed ratio between the expenditure of labour and the production of that vital capital which is the foundation of all wealth for suppose that we introduce into our suppositious pastoral paradise beasts of prey and rival shepherds the amount of labour thrown upon the sheepowner may increase almost indefinitely and its importance as a condition of production may be enormously augmented while the quantity of produce remains stationary compare for a moment the unimportance of the shepherds labour under the circumstances first defined with its indispensability in countries in which the water for the sheep has to be drawn from deep 159 wells or in which the flock has to be defended from wolves or from human depredators as to land it has been shown that except as affording mere room and standing ground the importance of land great as it may be is secondary the one thing needful for economic production is the green plant as the sole producer of vital capital from natural inorganic bodies men might exist without labour in the ordinary sense and without land without plants they must inevitably perish       in some remarkable passages of the botany of sir james rosss     antarctic voyage which took place half a century ago sir     joseph hooker demonstrated the dependence of the animal life of     the sea upon the minute indeed microscopic plants which float     in it a marvellous example of what may be done by     waterculture one might indulge in dreams of cultivating and     improving diatoms until the domesticated bore the same     relation to the wild forms as cauliflowers to the primitive     brassica oleracea without passing beyond the limits of fair     scientific speculation  that which is true of the purely pastoral condition is a fortiori true of the purely agricultural condition in which the existence of the cultivator is directly dependent on the production of vital capital by the plants which he cultivates here again the condition precedent of the work of each year is vital capital suppose that a man lives exclusively upon the plants which he cultivates it is obvious that he must have foodstuffs to live upon while he prepares the soil for sowing and throughout the period which elapses between this and harvest these foodstuffs must be yielded by the stock remaining over from former crops the result is the same as beforethe preexistence of vital capital is the necessary antecedent of labour moreover the amount of labour which contributes as an accessory condition to the production 160 of the crop varies as widely in the case of plantraising as in that of cattleraising with favourable soil climate and other conditions it may be very small with unfavourable very great for the same revenue or yield of foodstuffs       it is a pity that we have no word that signifies plantculture     exclusively but for the present purpose i may restrict     agriculture to that sense  thus i do not think it is possible to dispute the following proposition  the existence of any man or of any number of men whether organised into a polity or not depends on the production of foodstuffs that is vital capital readily accessible to man either directly or indirectly by plants but it follows that the number of men who can exist say for one year on any given area of land taken by itself depends upon the quantity of foodstuffs produced by such plants growing on the area in one year if a is that quantity and b the minimum of foodstuffs required for each man abn the maximum number of men who can exist on the area now the amount of production a is limited by the extent of area occupied by the quantity of sunshine which falls upon the area by the range and distribution of temperature by the force of the winds by the supply of water by the composition and the physical characters of the soil by animal and vegetable competitors and destroyers the labour of man neither does nor can produce vital capital all that it can do is to modify favourably or unfavourably the conditions of its production the most important of these 161 namely sunshine range of daily and nightly temperature windare practically out of mens reach on the other hand the supply of water the physical and chemical qualities of the soil and the influences of competitors and destroyers can often though by no means always be largely affected by labour and skill and there is no harm in calling the effect of such labour production if it is clearly understood that production in this sense is a very different thing from the production of foodstuffs by a plant       i do not forget electric lighting greenhouses and hothouses     and the various modes of affording shelter against violent     winds but in regard to production of foodstuffs on the large     scale they may be neglected even if synthetic chemistry should     effect the construction of proteids the laborato ry will     hardly enter into competition with the farm within any time     which the present generation need trouble itself about  we have been dealing hitherto with suppositions the materials of which are furnished by everyday experience not with mere a priori assumptions our hypothetical solitary shepherd with his flock or the solitary farmer with his grain field are mere bits of such experience cut out as it were for easy study still borrowing from daily experience let us suppose that either sheepowner or farmer for any reason that may be imagined desires the help of one or more other men and that in exchange for their labour he offers so many sheep or quarts of milk or pounds of 162 cheese or so many measures of grain for a years service i fail to discover any a priori rights of labour in virtue of which these men may insist on being employed if they are not wanted but on the other hand i think it is clear that there is only one condition upon which the persons to whom the offer of these wages is made can accept it and that is that the things offered in exchange for a years work shall contain at least as much vital capital as a man uses up in doing the years work for no rational man could knowingly and willingly accept conditions which necessarily involve starvation therefore there is an irreducible minimum of wages it is such an amount of vital capital as suffices to replace the inevitable consumption of the person hired now surely it is beyond a doubt that these wages whether at or above the irreducible minimum are paid out of the capital disposable after the wants of the owner of the flock or of the crop of grain are satisfied and from what has been said already it follows that there is a limit to the number of men whether hired or brought in any other way who can be maintained by the sheep owner or landowner out of his own resources since no amount of labour can produce an ounce of foodstuff beyond the maximum producible by a limited number of plants under the most favourable circumstances in regard to those conditions which are not affected by labour it follows 163 that if the number of men to be fed increases indefinitely a time must come when some will have to starve that is the essence of the socalled malthusian doctrine and it is a truth which to my mind is as plain as the general proposition that a quantity which constantly increases will some time or other exceed any greater quantity the amount of which is fixed  the foregoing considerations leave no doubt about the fundamental condition of the existence of any polity or organised society of men either in a purely pastoral or purely agricultural state or in any mixture of both states it must possess a store of vital capital to start with and the means of repairing the consumption of that capital which takes place as a consequence of the work of the members of the society and if the polity occupies a completely isolated area of the earths surface the numerical strength of that polity can never exceed the quotient of the maximum quantity of foodstuffs producible by the green plants on that area in each year divided by the quantity necessary for the maintenance of each person during the year but there is a third mode of existence possible to a polity it may conceivably be neither purely pastoral nor purely agricultural but purely manufacturing let us suppose three islands like gran canaria teneriffe and lanzerote in the canaries to be quite cut off from the rest of the world let gran canaria be 164 inhabited by grainraisers teneriffe by cattlebreeders while the population of lanzerote which we may suppose to be utterly barren consists of carpenters woollen manufacturers and shoemakers then the facts of daily experience teach us that the people of lanzerote could never have existed unless they came to the island provided with a stock of foodstuffs and that they could not continue to exist unless that stock as it was consumed was made up by contributions from the vital capital of either gran canaria or teneriffe or both moreover the carpenters of lanzerote could do nothing unless they were provided with wood from the other islands nor could the wool spinners and weavers or the shoemakers work without wool and skins from the same sources the wood and the wool and the skins are in fact the capital without which their work as manufacturers in their respective trades is impossibleso that the vital and other capital supplied by gran canaria and teneriffe is most indubitably the necessary antecedent of the industrial labour of lanzerote it is perfectly true that by the time the wood the wool and the skins reached lanzerote a good deal of labour in cutting shearing skinning transport and so on would have been spent upon them but this does not alter the fact that the only production which is essential to the existence of the population of teneriffe and gran canaria is that effected by the 165 green plants in both islands and that all the labour spent upon the raw produce useful in manufacture directly or indirectly yielded by themby the inhabitants of these islands and by those of lanzerote into the bargainwill not provide one solitary lanzerotian with a dinner unless the teneriffians and canariotes happen to want his goods and to be willing to give some of their vital capital in exchange for them  under the circumstances defined if teneriffe and gran canaria disappeared or if their inhabitants ceased to care for carpentry clothing or shoes the people of lanzerote must starve but if they wish to buy then the lanzerotians by cultivating the buyers indirectly favour the cultivation of the produce of those buyers  thus if the question is asked whether the labour employed in manufacture in lanzerote is productive or unproductive there can be only one reply if anybody will exchange vital capital or that which can be exchanged for vital capital for lanzerote goods it is productive if not it is unproductive  in the case of the manufacturer the dependence of labour upon capital is still more intimate than in that of the herdsman or agriculturist when the latter are once started they can go on without troubling themselves about the existence of any other people but the manufacturer depends on preexisting capital not only at the 166 beginning but at the end of his operations however great the expenditure of his labour and of his skill the result for the purpose of maintaining his existence is just the same as if he had done nothing unless there is a customer able and willing to exchange foodstuffs for that which his labour and skill have achieved  there is another point concerning which it is very necessary to have clear ideas suppose a carpenter in lanzerote to be engaged in making chests of drawers let us suppose that a the timber and b the grain and meat needful for the mans sustenance until he can finish a chest of drawers have to be paid for by that chest then the capital with which he starts is represented by a  b he could not start at all unless he had it day by day he must destroy more or less of the substance and of the general adaptability of a in order to work it up into the special forms needed to constitute the chest of drawers and day by day he must use up at least so much of b as will replace his loss of vital capital by the work of that day  suppose it takes the carpenter and his workmen ten days to saw up the timber to plane the boards and to give them the shape and size proper for the various parts of the chest of drawers and suppose that he then offers his heap of boards to the advancer of a  b as an equivalent for the wood  ten days supply of vital capital the latter will surely say no 167 i did not ask for a heap of boards i asked for a chest of drawers up to this time so far as i am concerned you have done nothing and are as much in my debt as ever and if the carpenter maintained that he had virtually created twothirds of a chest of drawers inasmuch as it would take only five days more to put together the pieces of wood and that the heap of boards ought to be accepted as the equivalent of twothirds of his debt i am afraid the creditor would regard him as little better than an impudent swindler it obviously makes no sort of difference whether the canariote or teneriffian buyer advanced the wood and the foodstuffs on which the carpenter had to maintain himself or whether the carpenter had a stock of both the consumption of which must be recouped by the exchange of a chest of drawers for a fresh supply in the latter case it is even less doubtful that if the carpenter offered his boards to the man who wanted a chest of drawers the latter would laugh in his face and if he took the chest of drawers for himself then so much of his vital capital would be sunk in it past recovery again the payment of goods in a lump for the chest of drawers comes to the same thing as the payment of daily wages for the fifteen days that the carpenter was occupied in making it if at the end of each day the carpenter chose to say to himself i have virtually created by my days labour a fifteenth of what i shall get for the chest 168 of drawerstherefore my wages are the produce of my days labourthere is no great harm in such metaphorical speech so long as the poor man does not delude himself into the supposition that it represents the exact truth  virtually is apt to cover more intellectual sins than charity does moral delicts after what has been said it surely must be plain enough that each days work has involved the consumption of the carpenters vital capital and the fashioning of his timber at the expense of more or less consumption of those forms of capital whether the a  b to be exchanged for the chest has been advanced as a loan or is paid daily or weekly as wages or at some later time as the price of a finished commoditythe essential element of the transaction and the only essential element is that it must at least effect the replacement of the vital capital consumed neither boards nor chest of drawers are eatable and so far from the carpenter having produced the essential part of his wages by each days labour he has merely wasted that labour unless somebody who happens to want a chest of drawers offers to exchange vital capital or something that can procure it equivalent to the amount consumed during the process of manufacture       see the discussion of this subject further on  that it should be necessary at this time of day to set forth such elementary truths as these may 169 well seem strange but no one who consults that interesting museum of political delusions progress and poverty some of the treasures of which i have already brought to light will doubt the fact if he bestows proper attention upon the first book of that widelyread work at page 15 it is thus written  the proposition i shall endeavour to prove is that wages instead of being drawn from capital are in reality drawn from the product of the labour for which they are paid  again at page 18  in every case in which labour is exchanged for commodities production really precedes enjoyment    wages are the earningsthat is to say the makingsof labournot the advances of capital  and the proposition which the author endeavours to disprove is the hitherto generally accepted doctrine       that labour is maintained and paid out of existing capital         before the product which constitutes the ultimate object is         secured p 16  the doctrine respecting the relation of capital and wages which is thus opposed in progress and poverty is that illustrated in the foregoing pages the truth of which i conceive must be plain to any one who has apprehended the very simple arguments by which i have endeavoured to 170 demonstrate it one conclusion or the other must be hopelessly wrong and even at the cost of going once more over some of the ground traversed in this essay and that on natural and political rights i propose to show that the error lies with progress and poverty in which work so far as political science is concerned the poverty is to my eye much more apparent than the progress       collected essays vol i pp 359382  to begin at the beginning the author propounds a definition of wealth  nothing which nature supplies to man without his labour is wealth p 28  wealth consists of natural substances or products which have been adapted by human labour to human use or gratification their value depending upon the amount of labour which upon the average would be required to produce things of like kind p 27 the following examples of wealth are given          buildings cattle tools machinery agricultural and            mineral products manufactured goods ships waggons            furniture and the like p 27  i take it that native metals coal and brick clay are mineral products and i quite believe that they are properly termed wealth but when a seam of coal crops out at the surface and lumps of coal are to be had for the picking up or when native copper lies about in nuggets or 171 when brick clay forms a superficial stratum it appears to me that these things are supplied to nay almost thrust upon man without his labour according to the definition therefore they are not wealth according to the enumeration however they are wealth a tolerably fair specimen of a contradiction in terms or does progress and poverty really suggest that a coal seam which crops out at the surface is not wealth but that if somebody breaks off a piece and carries it away the bestowal of this amount of labour upon that particular lump makes it wealth while the rest remains not wealth the notion that the value of a thing bears any necessary relation to the amount of labour average or otherwise bestowed upon it is a fallacy which needs no further refutation than it has already received  the average amount of labour bestowed upon warmingpans confers no value upon them in the eyes of a goldcoast negro nor would an esquimaux give a slice of blubber for the most elaborate of icemachines  so much for the doctrine of progress and poverty touching the nature of wealth let us now consider its teachings respecting capital as wealth or a part of wealth adam smiths definition that part of a mans stock which he expects to yield him a revenue is called his capital is quoted with approval p 32 elsewhere capital is said to be that part of wealth which 172 is devoted to the aid of production p 28 and yet again it is said to be          wealth in course of exchange understanding exchange to            include not merely the passing from hand to hand but            also such transmutations as occur when the reproductive            or transforming forces of nature are utilised for the            increase of wealth p 32       the italics are the authors  but if too much pondering over the possible senses and scope of these definitions should weary the reader he will be relieved by the following acknowledgment          nor is the definition of capital i have suggested of            any importance p 33  the author informs us in fact that he is not writing a textbook thereby intimating his opinion that it is less important to be clear and accurate when you are trying to bring about a political revolution than when a merely academic interest attaches to the subject treated but he is not busy about anything so serious as a textbook no he is only attempting to discover the laws which control a great social problema mode of expression which indicates perhaps the highwater mark of intellectual muddlement i have heard in my time of laws which control other laws but this is the first occasion on which laws which control a problem have come under my notice even the disquisitions of 173 those flabby writers who have burdened the press and darkened counsel by numerous volumes which are dubbed political economy p 28 could hardly furnish their critics with a finer specimen of that which a hero of the dunciad by the one flash of genius recorded of him called clotted nonsense  doubtless it is a sign of grace that the author of these definitions should attach no importance to any of them but since unfortunately his whole argument turns upon the tacit assumption that they are important i may not pass them over so lightly the third i give up why anything should be capital when it is in course of exchange and not be capital under other circumstances passes my understanding we are told that that part of a farmers crop held for sale or for seed or to feed his help in part payment of wages would be accounted capital that held for the care of his family would not be p 31 but i fail to discover any ground of reason or authority for the doctrine that it is only when a crop is about to be sold or sown or given as wages that it may be called capital on the contrary whether we consider custom or reason so much of it as is stored away in ricks and barns during harvest and remains there to be used in any of these ways months or years afterwards is customarily and rightly termed capital  surely the meaning of the clumsy phrase that capital is wealth in the 174 course of exchange must be that it is wealth capable of being exchanged against labour or anything else that in fact is the equivalent of the second definition that capital is that part of wealth which is devoted to the aid of production obviously if you possess that for which men will give labour you can aid production by means of that labour and again it agrees with the first definition borrowed from adam smith that capital is that part of a mans stock which he expects to yield him a revenue for a revenue is both etymologically and in sense a return a man gives his labour in sowing grain or in tending cattle because he expects a returna revenuein the shape of the increase of the grain or of the herd and also in the latter case in the shape of their labour and manure which aid the production of such increase the grain and cattle of which he is possessed immediately after harvest is his capital and his revenue for the twelvemonth until the next harvest is the surplus of grain and cattle over and above the amount with which he started this is disposable for any purpose for which he may desire to use it leaving him just as well off as he was at the beginning of the year whether the man keeps the surplus grain for sowing more land and the surplus cattle for occupying more pasture whether he exchanges them for other commodities such as the use of the land as rent or labour as 175 wages or whether he feeds himself and his family in no way alters their nature as revenue or affects the fact that this revenue is merely disposable capital  that even apart from etymology cattle are typical examples of capital cannot be denied progress and poverty p 25 and if we seek for that particular quality of cattle which makes them capital neither has the author of progress and poverty supplied nor is any one else very likely to supply a better account of the matter than adam smith has done cattle are capital because they are stock which yields revenue that is to say they afford to their owner a supply of that which he desires to possess  and in this particular case the revenue is not only desirable but of supreme importance inasmuch as it is capable of maintaining human life the herd yields a revenue of foodstuffs as milk and meat a revenue of skins a revenue of manure a revenue of labour a revenue of exchangeable commodities in the shape of these things as well as in that of live cattle  in each and all of these capacities cattle are capital and conversely things which possess any or all of these capacities are capital  therefore what we find at page 25 of progress and poverty must be regarded as a welcome lapse into clearness of apprehension  a fertile field a rich vein of ore a falling stream which supplies power may give the possessor advantages 176 equivalent to the possession of capital but to class such things as capital would be to put an end to the distinction between land and capital  just so but the fatal truth is that these things are capital and that there really is no fundamental distinction between land and capital is it denied that a fertile field a rich vein of ore or a falling stream may form part of a mans stock and that if they do they are capable of yielding revenue will not somebody pay a share of the produce in kind or in money for the privilege of cultivating the first royalties for that of working the second and a like equivalent for that of erecting a mill on the third in what sense then are these things less capital than the buildings and tools which on page 27 of progress and poverty are admitted to be capital is it not plain that if these things confer advantages equivalent to the possession of capital and if the advantage of capital is nothing but the yielding of revenue then the denial that they are capital is merely a roundabout way of selfcontradiction  all this confused talk about capital however is lucidity itself compared with the exposition of the remarkable thesis wages not drawn from capital but produced by labour which occupies the third chapter of progress and poverty  if for instance i devote my labour to gathering birds eggs or picking wild berries the eggs or berries i thus 177 get are my wages surely no one will contend that in such a case wages are drawn from capital there is no capital in the case p 34  nevertheless those who have followed what has been said in the first part of this essay surely neither will nor can have any hesitation about substantially adopting the challenged contention though they may possibly have qualms as to the propriety of the use of the term wages they will have no difficulty in apprehending the fact that birds eggs and berries are stores of foodstuffs or vital capital that the man who devotes his labour to getting them does so at the expense of his personal vital capital and that if the eggs and the berries are wages for his work they are so because they enable him to restore to his organism the vital capital which he has consumed in doing the work of collection so that there is really a great deal of capital in the case       not merely on the grounds stated below but on the strength     of mr georges own definition does the gatherer of eggs or     berries produce them by his labour if so what do the hens     and the bushes do  our author proceeds  an absolutely naked man thrown on an island where no human being has before trod may gather birds eggs or pick berries p 34  no doubt but those who have followed my argument thus far will be aware that a mans vital capital does not reside in his clothes and therefore 178 they will probably fail as completely as i do to discover the relevancy of the statement  again          or if i take a piece of leather and work it up into a            pair of shoes the shoes are my wagesthe reward of my            exertion surely they are not drawn from capitaleither            my capital or anybody elses capitalbut are brought            into existence by the labour of which they became the            wages and in obtaining this pair of shoes as the wages            of my labour capital is not even momentarily lessened            one iota for if we call in the idea of capital my            capital at the beginning consists of the piece of            leather the thread c p 34  it takes away ones breath to have such a concatenation of fallacies administered in the space of half a paragraph it does not seem to have occurred to our economical reformer to imagine whence his capital at the beginning the leather thread c came i venture to suppose that leather to have been originally cattleskin and since calves and oxen are not flayed alive the existence of the leather implies the lessening of that form of capital by a very considerable iota it is therefore as sure as anything can be that in the long run the shoes are drawn from that which is capital par excellence to wit cattle it is further beyond doubt that the operation of tanning must involve loss of capital in the shape of bark to say nothing of other losses and that the use of the awls and knives of the shoemaker involves loss of capital in the shape of the store of 179 iron further the shoemaker has been enabled to do his work not only by the vital capital expended during the time occupied in making the pair of shoes but by that expended from the time of his birth up to the time that he earned wages that would keep him alive  progress and poverty continues          as my labour goes on value is steadily added until            when my labour results in the finished shoes i have my            capital plus the difference in value between the            material and the shoes in obtaining this additional            valuemy wageshow is capital at any time drawn            upon p 34  in return we may inquire how can any one propound such a question capital is drawn upon all the time not only when the shoes are commenced but while they are being made and until they are either used by the shoemaker himself or are purchased by somebody else that is exchanged for a portion of another mans capital in fact supposing that the shoemaker does not want shoes himself it is the existence of vital capital in the possession of another person and the willingness of that person to part with more or less of it in exchange for the shoesit is these two conditions alone which prevent the shoemaker from having consumed his capital unproductively just as much as if he had spent his time in chopping up the leather into minute fragments  thus the examination of the very case selected 180 by the advocate of the doctrine that labour bestowed upon manufacture without any intervention of capital can produce wages proves to be a delusion of the first magnitude even though it be supported by the dictum of adam smith which is quoted in its favour p 34          the produce of labour constitutes the natural recompense            or wages of labour in that original state of things which            precedes both the appropriation of land and the            accumulation of stock the whole produce of labour belongs            to the labourer he has neither landlord nor master to            share with him wealth of nations ch viii  but the whole of this passage exhibits the influence of the french physiocrats by whom adam smith was inspired at their worst that is to say when they most completely forsook the ground of experience for a priori speculation the confident reference to that original state of things is quite in the manner of the essai sur linegalie now the state of men before the appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock must surely have been that of purely savage hunters as by the supposition nobody would have possessed land certainly no man could have had a landlord and if there was no accumulation of stock in a transferable form as surely there could be no master in the sense of hirer but hirer and hire that is wages are correlative terms like mother and child as child implies mother so does hire or wages imply a 181 hirer or wagegiver therefore when a man in the original state of things gathered fruit or killed game for his own sustenance the fruit or the game could be called his wages only in a figurative sense as one sees if the term hire which has a more limited connotation is substituted for wage if not it must be assumed that the savage hired himself to get his own dinner whereby we are led to the tolerably absurd conclusion that as in the state of nature he was his own employer the master and the labourer in that model age appropriated the produce in equal shares and if this should be not enough it has already been seen that in the hunting state man is not even an accessory of production of vital capital he merely consumes what nature produces  according to the author of progress and poverty political economists have been deluded by a fallacy which has entangled some of the most acute minds in a web of their own spinning  it is in the use of the term capital in two senses in the primary proposition that capital is necessary to the exertion of productive labour the term capital is understood as including all food clothing shelter c whereas in the deductions finally drawn from it the term is used in its common and legitimate meaning of wealth devoted not to the immediate gratification of desire but to the procurement of more wealthof wealth in the hands of employers as distinguished from labourers p 40  182 i am by no means concerned to defend the political economists who are thus charged with blundering but i shall be surprised to learn that any have carried the art of selfentanglement to the degree of perfection exhibited by this passage who has ever imagined that wealth which in the hands of an employer is capital ceases to be capital if it is in the hands of a labourer suppose a workman to be paid thirty shillings on saturday evening for six days labour that thirty shillings comes out of the employers capital and receives the name of wages simply because it is exchanged for labour in the workmans pocket as he goes home it is a part of his capital in exactly the same sense as half an hour before it was part of the employers capital he is a capitalist just as much as if he were a rothschild suppose him to be a single man whose cooking and household matters are attended to by the people of the house in which he has a room then the rent which he pays them out of this capital is in part wages for their labour and he is so far an employer if he saves one shilling out of his thirty he has to that extent added to his capital when the next saturday comes round and if he puts his saved shillings week by week into the savings bank the difference between him and the most bloated of bankers is simply one of degree  at page 42 we are confidently told that 183 labourers by receiving wages cannot lessen even temporarily the capital of the employer while at page 44 it is admitted that in certain cases the capitalist pays out capital in wages one would think that the paying out of capital is hardly possible without at least a temporary diminution of the capital from which payment is made but progress and poverty changes all that by a little verbal legerdemain          for where wages are paid before the object of the labour            is obtained or is finishedas in agriculture where            ploughing and sowing must precede by several months the            harvesting of the crop as in the erection of buildings            the construction of ships railroads canals cit is            clear that the owners of the capital paid in wages cannot            expect an immediate return but as the phrase is must            outlay it or lie out of it for a time which sometimes            amounts to many years and hence if first principles are            not kept in mind it is easy to jump to the conclusion            that wages are advanced by capital p 44  those who have paid attention to the argument of former parts of this paper may not be able to understand how if sound first principles are kept in mind any other conclusion can be reached whether by jumping or by any other mode of logical progression but the first principle which our author keeps in mind possesses just that amount of ambiguity which enables him to play hocuspocus with it it is this that the creation of value does not depend upon the finishing of the product p 44  184 there is no doubt that under certain limitations this proposition is correct it is not true that labour always adds to capital by its exertion before it takes from capital its wages p 44 but it is true that it may and often does produce that effect  to take one of the examples given the construction of a ship the shaping of the timbers undoubtedly gives them a value for a shipbuilder which they did not possess before when they are put together to constitute the framework of the ship there is a still further addition of value for a shipbuilder and when the outside planking is added there is another addition for a shipbuilder suppose everything else about the hull is finished except the one little item of caulking the seams there is no doubt that it has still more value for a shipbuilder but for whom else has it any value except perhaps for a firewood merchant what price will any one who wants a shipthat is to say something that will carry a cargo from one port to anothergive for the unfinished vessel which would take water in at every seam and go down in half an hour if she were launched suppose the shipbuilders capital to fail before the vessel is caulked and that he cannot find another shipbuilder who cares to buy and finish it what sort of proportion does the value created by the labour for which he has paid out of his capital stand to that of his advances  185 surely no one will give him onetenth of the capital disbursed in wages perhaps not so much even as the prime cost of the raw materials  therefore though the assertion that the creation of value does not depend on the finishing of the product may be strictly true under certain circumstances it need not be and is not always true and if it is meant to imply or suggest that the creation of value in a manufactured article does not depend upon the finishing of that article a more serious error could hardly be propounded  is there not a prodigious difference in the value of an uncaulked and in that of a finished ship between the value of a house in which only the tiles of the roof are wanting and a finished house between that of a clock which only lacks the escapement and a finished clock  as ships house and clock the unfinished articles have no value whateverthat is to say no person who wanted to purchase one of these things for immediate use would give a farthing for either the only value they can have apart from that of the materials they contain is that which they possess for some one who can finish them or for some one who can make use of parts of them for the construction of other things a man might buy an unfinished house for the sake of the bricks or he might buy an incomplete clock to use the works for some other piece of machinery  thus though every stage of the labour 186 bestowed on raw material for the purpose of giving rise to a certain product confers some additional value on that material in the estimation of those who are engaged in manufacturing that product the ratio of that accumulated value at any stage of the process to the value of the finished product is extremely inconstant and often small while to other persons the value of the unfinished product may be nothing or even a minus quantity a housetimber merchant for example might consider that wood which had been worked into the ribs of a ship was spoiledthat is had less value than it had as a log  according to progress and poverty there was really no advance of capital while the great st gothard tunnel was cut suppose that as the swiss and the italian halves of the tunnel approached to within half a kilometre that halfkilometre had turned out to be composed of practically impenetrable rockwould anybody have given a centime for the unfinished tunnel and if not how comes it that the creation of value does not depend on the finishing of the product  i think it may be not too much to say that of all the political delusions which are current in this queer world the very stupidest are those which assume that labour and capital are necessarily antagonistic that all capital is produced by labour and therefore by natural right is the property of 187 the labourer that the possessor of capital is a robber who preys on the workman and appropriates to himself that which he has had no share in producing  on the contrary capital and labour are necessarily close allies capital is never a product of human labour alone it exists apart from human labour it is the necessary antecedent of labour and it furnishes the materials on which labour is employed the only indispensable form of capitalvital capitalcannot be produced by human labour all that man can do is to favour its formation by the real producers there is no intrinsic relation between the amount of labour bestowed on an article and its value in exchange the claim of labour to the total result of operations which are rendered possible only by capital is simply an a priori iniquity  188                                v                social diseases and worse remedies          letters to the times on mr booths scheme            with a preface and introductory essay                            1891                            preface  the letters which are here collected together were published in the times in the course of the months of december 1890 and january 1891  the circumstances which led me to write the first letter are sufficiently set forth in its opening sentences and the materials on which i based my criticisms of mr booths scheme in this and in the second letter were wholly derived from mr booths book i had some reason to know however that when anybody allows his sense of duty so far to prevail over his sense of the blessedness of peace as to write a letter to the times on any subject of public interest his reflections before he has done with the business will be very like 189 those of johnny gilpin who little thought when he set out of running such a rig such undoubtedly are mine when i contemplate these twelve documents and call to mind the distinct addition to the revenue of the post office which must have accrued from the mass of letters and pamphlets which have been delivered at my door to say nothing of the unexpected light upon my character motives and doctrines which has been thrown by some of the times correspondents and by no end of comments elsewhere  if selfknowledge is the highest aim of man i ought by this time to have little to learn and yet if i am awake some of my teachersunable perhaps to control the divine fire of the poetic imagination which is so closely akin to if not a part of the mythopoeic facultyhave surely dreamed dreams so far as my humbler and essentially prosaic faculties of observation and comparison go plain facts are against them but as i may be mistaken i have thought it well to prefix to the letters by way of prolegomena an essay which appeared in the nineteenth century for january 1888 in which the principles that to my mind lie at the bottom of the social question are stated so far as individualism and regimental socialism are concerned this paper simply emphasizes and expands the opinions expressed in an address to the members of the midland institute delivered seventeen years earlier 190 and still more fully developed in several essays published in the nineteenth century in 1889 which i hope before long to republish       see collected essays vol i p 290 to end and this volume     p 147  the fundamental proposition which runs through the writings which thus extend over a of twenty years is that the common a priori doctrines and methods of reasoning about political and social questions are essentially vicious and that argumentation on this basis leads with equal logical force to two contradictory and extremely mischievous systems the one that of anarchaic individualism the other that of despotic or regimental socialism whether i am right or wrong i am at least consistent in opposing both to the best of my ability mr booths system appears to me and as i have shown is regarded by socialists themselves to be mere autocratic socialism masked by its theological exterior that the fantastic religious skin will wear away and the socialistic reality it covers will show its real nature is the expressed hope of one candid socialist and may be fairly conceived to be the unexpressed belief of the despotic leader of the new trades union who has shown his zeal if not his discretion in championing mr booths projects see letter viii  yet another word to commentators upon my letters there are some who rather chuckle and 191 some who sneer at what they seem to consider the dexterity of an old controversial hand exhibited by the contrast which i have drawn between the methods of conversion depicted in the new testament and those pursued by fanatics of the salvationist type whether they be such as are now exploited by mr booth or such as those who from the time of the anabaptists to go no further back have worked upon similar lines  whether such observations were intended to be flattering or sarcastic i must respectfully decline to accept the compliment or to apply the sarcasm to myself i object to obliquity of procedure and ambiguity of speech in all shapes and i confess that i find it difficult to understand the state of mind which leads any one to suppose that deep respect for singleminded devotion to high aims is incompatible with the unhesitating conviction that those aims include the propagation of doctrines which are devoid of foundationperhaps even mischievous  the most degrading feature of the narrower forms of christianity of which that professed by mr booth is a notable example is their insistence that the noblest virtues if displayed by those who reject their pitiable formulae are as their pet phrase goes splendid sins but there is perhaps one step lower and that is that men who profess freedom of thought should fail to see and 192 appreciate that large soul of goodness which often animates even the fanatical adherents of such tenets i am sorry for any man who can read the epistles to the galatians and the corinthians without yielding a large meed of admiration to the fervent humanity of paul of tarsus who can study the lives of francis of assisi or of catherine of siena without wishing that for the furtherance of his own ideals he might be even as they or who can contemplate unmoved the steadfast veracity and true heroism which loom through the fogs of mystical utterance in george fox in all these great men and women there lay the root of the matter a burning desire to amend the condition of their fellowmen and to put aside all other things for that end if in spite of all the dogmatic helps or hindrances in which they were entangled these people are not to be held in high honour who are  i have never expressed a doubtfor i have nonethat when mr booth left the methodist connection and started that organisation of the salvation army upon which comparatively recently such ambitious schemes of social reform have been grafted he may have deserved some share of such honour i do not say that so far as his personal desires and intentions go he may not still deserve it but the correlate of despotic authority is unlimited responsibility if mr booth is to take 193 credit for any good that the army system has effected he must be prepared to bear blame for its inherent evils as it seems to me that has happened to him which sooner or later happens to all despots he has become the slave of his own creationthe prosperity and glory of the soulsaving machine have become the end instead of a means of soulsaving and to maintain these at the proper pitch the general is led to do things which the mr booth of twenty years ago would probably have scorned  and those who desire as i most emphatically desire to be just to mr booth however badly they may think of the working of the organization he has founded will bear in mind that some astute backers of his probably care little enough for salvationist religion and perhaps are not very keen about many of mr booths projects i have referred to the rubbing of the hands of the socialists over mr booths success but unless i err greatly there are politicians of a certain school to whom it affords still greater satisfaction consider what electioneering agents the captains of the salvation army scattered through all our towns and directed from a political bureau in london would make think how political adversaries could be harassed by our local attorneytribune of the people i mean and how a troublesome man on the other side could be hunted 194 down upon any convenient charge whether true or false brought by our vigilancefamiliar       see letter viii      see letter ii  i entirely acquit mr booth of any complicity in farreaching schemes of this kind but i did not write idly when in my first letter i gave no vague warning of what might grow out of the organised force drilled in the habit of unhesitating obedience which he has created  195                            introductory essay               the struggle for existence in human society                                1888  the vast and varied procession of events which we call nature affords a sublime spectacle and an inexhaustible wealth of attractive problems to the speculative observer if we confine our attention to that aspect which engages the attention of the intellect nature appears a beautiful and harmonious whole the incarnation of a faultless logical process from certain premises in the past to an inevitable conclusion in the future but if it be regarded from a less elevated though more human point of view if our moral sympathies are allowed to influence our judgment and we permit ourselves to criticise our great mother as we criticise one another then our verdict at least so far as sentient nature is concerned can hardly be so favourable  in sober truth to those who have made a study of the phenomena of life as they exhibited by the higher forms of the animal world 196 the optimistic dogma that this is the best of all possible worlds will seem little better than a libel upon possibility it is really only another instance to be added to the many extant of the audacity of a priori speculators who having created god in their own image find no difficulty in assuming that the almighty must have been actuated by the same motives as themselves they are quite sure that had any other course been practicable he would no more have made infinite suffering a necessary ingredient of his handiwork than a respectable philosopher would have done the like  but even the modified optimism of the timehonoured thesis of physicotheology that the sentient world is on the whole regulated by principles of benevolence does but ill stand the test of impartial confrontation with the facts of the case no doubt it is quite true that sentient nature affords hosts of examples of subtle contrivances directed towards the production of pleasure or the avoidance of pain and it may be proper to say that these are evidences of benevolence but if so why is it not equally proper to say of the equally numerous arrangements the no less necessary result of which is the production of pain that they are evidences of malevolence  if a vast amount of that which in a piece of human workmanship we should call skill is 197 visible in those parts of the organization of a deer to which it owes its ability to escape from beasts of prey there is at least equal skill displayed in that bodily mechanism of the wolf which enables him to track and sooner or later to bring down the deer viewed under the dry light of science deer and wolf are alike admirable and if both were nonsentient automata there would be nothing to qualify our admiration of the action of the one on the other but the fact that the deer suffers while the wolf inflicts suffering engages our moral sympathies we should call men like the deer innocent and good men such as the wolf malignant and bad we should call those who defended the deer and aided him to escape brave and compassionate and those who helped the wolf in his bloody work base and cruel surely if we transfer these judgments to nature outside the world of man at all we must do so impartially in that case the goodness of the right hand which helps the deer and the wickedness of the left hand which eggs on the wolf will neutralize one another and the course of nature will appear to be neither moral nor immoral but nonmoral  this conclusion is thrust upon us by analogous facts in every part of the sentient world yet inasmuch as it not only jars upon prevalent prejudices but arouses the natural dislike to that which is painful much ingenuity has been exercised in devising an escape from it  from the theological side we are told that 198 this is a state of probation and that the seeming injustices and immoralities of nature will be compensated by and by but how this compensation is to be effected in the case of the great majority of sentient things is not clear i apprehend that no one is seriously prepared to maintain that the ghosts of all the myriads of generations of herbivorous animals which lived during the millions of years of the earths duration before the appearance of man and which have all that time been tormented and devoured by carnivores are to be compensated by a perennial existence in clover while the ghosts of carnivores are to go to some kennel where there is neither a pan of water nor a bone with any meat on it besides from the point of view of morality the last stage of things would be worse than the first for the carnivores however brutal and sanguinary have only done that which if there is any evidence of contrivance in the world they were expressly constructed to do  moreover carnivores and herbivores alike have been subject to all the miseries incidental to old age disease and overmultiplication and both might well put in a claim for compensation on this score  on the evolutionist side on the other hand we are told to take comfort from the reflection that the terrible struggle for existence tends to final good and that the suffering of the ancestor is paid for by the increased perfection of the progeny there would be something in this argument if in 199 chinese fashion the present generation could pay its debts to its ancestors otherwise it is not clear what compensation the eohippus gets for his sorrows in the fact that some millions of years afterwards one of his descendants wins the derby and again it is an error to imagine that evolution signifies a constant tendency to increased perfection that process undoubtedly involves a constant remodelling of the organism in adaptation to new conditions but it depends on the nature of those conditions whether the direction of the modifications effected shall be upward or downward retrogressive is as practicable as progressive metamorphosis if what the physical philosophers tell us that our globe has been in a state of fusion and like the sun is gradually cooling down is true then the time must come when evolution will mean adaptation to an universal winter and all forms of life will die out except such low and simple organisms as the diatom of the arctic and antarctic ice and the protococcus of the red snow if our globe is proceeding from a condition in which it was too hot to support any but the lowest living thing to a condition in which it will be too cold to permit of the existence of any others the course of life upon its surface must describe a trajectory like that of a ball fired from a mortar and the sinking half of that course is as much a part of the general process of evolution as the rising  from the point of view of the moralist the 200 animal world is on about the same level as a gladiators show the creatures are fairly well treated and set to fightwhereby the strongest the swiftest and the cunningest live to fight another day the spectator has no need to turn his thumbs down as no quarter is given he must admit that the skill and training displayed are wonderful but he must shut his eyes if he would not see that more or less enduring suffering is the meed of both vanquished and victor and since the great game is going on in every corner of the world thousands of times a minute since were our ears sharp enough we need not descend to the gates of hell to hear         sospiri pianti ed alti guai     voci alte e floche e suon di man con elle  it seems to follow that if the world is governed by benevolence it must be a different sort of benevolence from that of john howard  but the old babylonians wisely symbolized nature by their great goddess istar who combined the attributes of aphrodite with those of ares her terrible aspect is not to be ignored or covered up with shams but it is not the only one if the optimism of leibnitz is a foolish though pleasant dream the pessimism of schopenhauer is a nightmare the more foolish because of its hideousness error which is not pleasant is surely the worst form of wrong  201 this may not be the best of all possible worlds but to say that it is the worst is mere petulant nonsense a wornout voluptuary may find nothing good under the sun or a vain and inexperienced youth who cannot get the moon he cries for may vent his irritation in pessimistic moanings but there can be no doubt in the mind of any reasonable person that mankind could would and in fact do get on fairly well with vastly less happiness and far more misery than find their way into the lives of nine people out of ten if each and all of us had been visited by an attack of neuralgia or of extreme mental depression for one hour in every twentyfoura supposition which many tolerably vigorous people know to their cost is not extravagantthe burden of life would have been immensely increased without much practical hindrance to its general course men with any manhood in them find life quite worth living under worse conditions than these  there is another sufficiently obvious fact which renders the hypothesis that the course of sentient nature is dictated by malevolence quite untenable a vast multitude of pleasures and these among the purest and the best are superfluities bits of good which are to all appearances unnecessary as inducements to live and are so to speak thrown into the bargain of life to those who experience them few delights can be more entrancing than such as are afforded by natural 202 beauty or by the arts and especially by music but they are products of rather than factors in evolution and it is probable that they are known in any considerable degree to but a very small proportion of mankind  the conclusion of the whole matter seems to be that if ormuzd has not had his way in this world neither has ahriman pessimism is as little consonant with the facts of sentient existence as optimism if we desire to represent the course of nature in terms of human thought and assume that it was intended to be that which it is we must say that its governing principle is intellectual and not moral that it is a materialized logical process accompanied by pleasures and pains the incidence of which in the majority of cases has not the slightest reference to moral desert that the rain falls alike upon the just and the unjust and that those upon whom the tower of siloam fell were no worse than their neighbours seem to be oriental modes of expressing the same conclusion  in the strict sense of the word nature it denotes the sum of the phenomenal world of that which has been and is and will be and society like art is therefore a part of nature  but it is convenient to distinguish those parts of nature in which man plays the part of immediate cause as some thing apart and therefore society like art 203 is usefully to be considered as distinct from nature it is the more desirable and even necessary to make this distinction since society differs from nature in having a definite moral object whence it comes about that the course shaped by the ethical manthe member of society or citizennecessarily runs counter to that which the nonethical manthe primitive savage or man as a mere member of the animal kingdomtends to adopt the latter fights out the struggle for existence to the bitter end like any other animal the former devotes his best energies to the object of setting limits to the struggle  in the cycle of phenomena presented by the life of man the animal no more moral end is discernible than in that presented by the lives of the wolf and of the deer however imperfect the relics of prehistoric men may be the evidence which they afford clearly tends to the conclusion that for thousands and thousands of years before the origin of the oldest known civilizations men were savages of a very low type they strove with their enemies and their competitors they preyed upon things weaker or less cunning than themselves they were born multiplied without stint and died for thousands of generations alongside the mammoth the urus the lion and the hyaena whose lives were spent in the same way 204 and they were no more to be praised or blamed on moral grounds than their less erect and more hairy compatriots       the reader will observe that this is the argument of the     romanes lecture in brief1894  as among these so among primitive men the weakest and stupidest went to the wall while the toughest and shrewdest those who were best fitted to cope with their circumstances but not the best in any other sense survived life was a continual free fight and beyond the limited and temporary relations of the family the hobbesian war of each against all was the normal state of existence the human species like others plashed and floundered amid the general stream of evolution keeping its head above water as it best might and thinking neither of whence nor whither  the history of civilizationthat is of societyon the other hand is the record of the attempts which the human race has made to escape from this position the first men who substituted the state of mutual peace for that of mutual war whatever the motive which impelled them to take that step created society but in establishing peace they obviously put a limit upon the struggle for existence between the members of that society at any rate it was not to be pursued a outrance and of all the successive shapes which society has taken that most nearly approaches perfection in which the war of individual against individual is most strictly limited  205 the primitive savage tutored by istar appropriated whatever took his fancy and killed whomsoever opposed him if he could on the contrary the ideal of the ethical man is to limit his freedom of action to a sphere in which he does not interfere with the freedom of others he seeks the common weal as much as his own and indeed as an essential part of his own welfare peace is both end and means with him and he founds his life on a more or less complete selfrestraint which is the negation of the unlimited struggle for existence he tries to escape from his place in the animal kingdom founded on the free development of the principle of nonmoral evolution and to establish a kingdom of man governed upon tile principle of moral evolution for society not only has a moral end but in its perfection social life is embodied morality  but the effort of ethical man to work towards a moral end by no means abolished perhaps has hardly modified the deepseated organic impulses which impel the natural man to follow his nonmoral course one of the most essential conditions if not the chief cause of the struggle for existence is the tendency to multiply without limit which man shares with all living things it is notable that increase and multiply is a commandment traditionally much older than the ten and that it is perhaps the only one which has been spontaneously and ex animo obeyed by 206 the great majority of the human race but in civilized society the inevitable result of such obedience is the reestablishment in all its intensity of that struggle for existencethe war of each against allthe mitigation or abolition of which was the chief end of social organization  it is conceivable that at some in the history of the fabled atlantis the production of food should have been exactly sufficient to meet the wants of the population that the makers of the commodities of the artificer should have amounted to just the number supportable by the surplus food of the agriculturists and as there is no harm in adding another monstrous supposition to the foregoing let it be imagined that every man woman and child was perfectly virtuous and aimed at the good of all as the highest personal good in that happy land the natural man would have been finally put down by the ethical man there would have been no competition but the industry of each would have been serviceable to all nobody being vain and nobody avaricious there would have been no rivalries the struggle for existence would have been abolished and the millennium would have finally set in but it is obvious that this state of things could have been permanent only with a stationary population add ten fresh mouths and as by the supposition there was only exactly enough before somebody must go on short rations the 207 atlantis society might have been a heaven upon earth the whole nation might have consisted of just men needing no repentance and yet somebody must starve reckless istar nonmoral nature would have riven the ethical fabric i was once talking with a very eminent physician about the vis medicatrix naturae stuff said he nine times out of ten nature does not want to cure the man she wants to put him in his coffin and istarnature appears to have equally little sympathy with the ends of society stuff she wants nothing but a fair field and free play for her darling the strongest       the late sir w gull  our atlantis may be an impossible figment but the antagonistic tendencies which the fable adumbrates have existed in every society which was ever established and to all appearance must strive for the victory in all that will be historians point to the greed and ambition of rulers to the reckless turbulence of the ruled to the debasing effects of wealth and luxury and to the devastating wars which have formed a great part of the occupation of mankind as the causes of the decay of states and the foundering of old civilizations and thereby point their story with a moral  no doubt immoral motives of all sorts have figured largely among the minor causes of these events but beneath all this 208 superficial turmoil lay the deepseated impulse given by unlimited multiplication in the swarms of colonies thrown out by phoenicia and by old greece in the ver sacrum of the latin races in the floods of gauls and of teutons which burst over the frontiers of the old civilization of europe in the swaying to and fro of the vast mongolian hordes in late times the population problem comes to the front in a very visible shape nor is it less plainly manifest in the everlasting agrarian questions of ancient rome than in the arreoi societies of the polynesian islands  in the ancient world and in a large part of that in which we live the practice of infanticide was or is a regular and legal custom famine pestilence and war were and are normal factors in the struggle for existence and they have served in a gross and brutal fashion to mitigate the intensity of the effects of its chief cause  but in the more advanced civilizations the progress of private and public morality has steadily tended to remove all these checks we declare infanticide murder and punish it as such we decree not quite so successfully that no one shall die of hunger we regard death from preventible causes of other kinds as a sort of constructive murder and eliminate pestilence to the best of our ability we declaim against the curse 209 of war and the wickedness of the military spirit and we are never weary of dilating on the blessedness of peace and the innocent beneficence of industry in their moments of expansion even statesmen and men of business go thus far the finer spirits look to an ideal civitas dei a state when every man having reached the point of absolute selfnegation and having nothing but moral perfection to strive after peace will truly reign not merely among nations but among men and the struggle for existence will be at an end  whether human nature is competent under any circumstances to reach or even seriously advance towards this ideal condition is a question which need not be discussed it will be admitted that mankind has not yet reached this stage by a very long way and my business is with the present and that which i wish to point out is that so long as the natural man increases and multiplies without restraint so long will peace and industry not only permit but they will necessitate a struggle for existence as sharp as any that ever went on under the regime of war if istar is to reign on the one hand she will demand her human sacrifices on the other  let us look at home for seventy years peace and industry have had their way among us with less interruption and under more favourable conditions than in any other country on the face of the earth the wealth of croesus was nothing to 210 that which we have accumulated and our prosperity has filled the world with envy but nemesis did not forget croesus has she forgotten us  i think not there are now 36000000 of people in our islands and every year considerably more than 300000 are added to our numbers that is to say about every hundred seconds or so a new claimant to a share in the common stock or maintenance presents him or herself among us at the present time the produce of the soil does not suffice to feed half its population  the other moiety has to be supplied with food which must be bought from the people of foodproducing countries that is to say we have to offer them the things which they want in exchange for the things we want and the things they want and which we can produce better than they can are mainly manufacturesindustrial products       these numbers are only approximately accurate in 1881 our     population amounted to 35241482 exceeding the number in 1871     by 3396103 the average annual increase in the decennial     18711881 is therefore 339610 the number of minutes in a     calendar year is 525600  the insolent reproach of the first napoleon had a very solid foundation we not only are but under penalty of starvation we are bound to be a nation of shopkeepers but other nations also lie under the same necessity of keeping shop and some of them deal in the same goods as ourselves our customers naturally seek to get the most and 211 the best in exchange for their produce if our goods are inferior to those of our competitors there is no ground compatible with the sanity of the buyers which can be alleged why they should not prefer the latter and if that result should ever take place on a large and general scale five or six millions of us would soon have nothing to eat we know what the cotton famine was and we can therefore form some notion of what a dearth of customers would be  judged by an ethical standard nothing can be less satisfactory than the position in which we find ourselves in a real though incomplete degree we have attained the condition of peace which is the main object of social organization and for arguments sake it may be assumed that we desire nothing but that which is in itself innocent and praiseworthynamely the enjoyment of the fruits of honest industry and lo in spite of ourselves we are in reality engaged in an internecine struggle for existence with our presumably no less peaceful and wellmeaning neighbours we seek peace and we do not ensue it the moral nature in us asks for no more than is compatible with the general good the nonmoral nature proclaims and acts upon that fine old scottish family motto thou shalt starve ere i want let us be under no illusions then so long as unlimited multiplication goes on no social organization which has ever been devised or is likely to 212 be devised no fiddlefaddling with the distribution of wealth will deliver society from the tendency to be destroyed by the reproduction within itself in its intensest form of that struggle for existence the limitation of which is the object of society and however shocking to the moral sense this eternal competition of man against man and of nation against nation may be however revolting may be the accumulation of misery at the negative pole of society in contrast with that of monstrous wealth at the positive pole this state of things must abide and grow continually worse so long as istar holds her way unchecked it is the true riddle of the sphinx and every nation which does not solve it will sooner or later be devoured by the monster itself has generated  the practical and pressing question for us just now seems to me to be how to gain time time brings counsel as the teutonic proverb has it and wiser folk among our posterity may see their way out of that which at present looks like an impasse  it would be folly to entertain any illfeeling towards those neighbours and rivals who like ourselves are slaves of istar but if somebody is to be starved the modern world has no oracle of delphi to which the nations can appeal for an 213 indication of the victim it is open to us to try our fortune and if we avoid impending fate there will be a certain ground for believing that we are the right people to escape securus judicat orbis       it is hard to say whether the increase of the unemployed     poor or that of the unemployed rich is the greater social     evil  1894  to this end it is well to look into the necessary condition of our salvation by works they are two one plain to all the world and hardly needing insistence the other seemingly not so plain since too often it has been theoretically and practically left out of sight the obvious condition is that our produce shall be better than that of others there is only one reason why our goods should be preferred to those of our rivalsour customers must find them better at the price that means that we must use more knowledge skill and industry in producing them without a proportionate increase in the cost of production and as the price of labour constitutes a large element in that cost the rate of wages must be restricted within certain limits it is perfectly true that cheap production and cheap labour are by no means synonymous but it is also true that wages cannot increase beyond a certain proportion without destroying cheapness  cheapness then with as part and parcel of cheapness a moderate price of labour is essential to our success as competitors in the markets of the world  the second condition is really quite as plainly indispensable as the first if one thinks seriously 214 about the matter it is social stability  society is stable when the wants of its members obtain as much satisfaction as life being what it is common sense and experience show may be reasonably expected mankind in general care very little for forms of government or ideal considerations of any sort and nothing really stirs the great multitude to break with custom and incur the manifest perils of revolt except the belief that misery in this world or damnation in the next or both are threatened by the continuance of the state of things in which they have been brought up but when they do attain that conviction society becomes as unstable as a package of dynamite and a very small matter will produce the explosion which sends it back to the chaos of savagery  it needs no argument to prove that when the price of labour sinks below a certain point the worker infallibly falls into that condition which the french emphatically call la miserea word for which i do not think there is any exact english equivalent it is a condition in which the food warmth and clothing which are necessary for the mere maintenance of the functions of the body in their normal state cannot be obtained in which men women and children are forced to crowd into dens wherein decency is abolished and the most ordinary conditions of healthful existence are impossible of attainment in which the 215 pleasures within reach are reduced to bestiality and drunkenness in which the pains accumulate at compound interest in the shape of starvation disease stunted development and moral degradation in which the prospect of even steady and honest industry is a life of unsuccessful battling with hunger rounded by a paupers grave  that a certain proportion of the members of every great aggregation of mankind should constantly tend to establish and populate such a slough of despond as this is inevitable so long as some people are by nature idle and vicious while others are disabled by sickness or accident or thrown upon the world by the death of their breadwinners so long as that proportion is restricted within tolerable limits it can be dealt with and so far as it arises only from such causes its existence may and must be patiently borne  but when the organization of society instead of mitigating this tendency tends to continue and intensify it when a given social order plainly makes for evil and not for good men naturally enough begin to think it high time to try a fresh experiment the animal man finding that the ethical man has landed him in such a slough resumes his ancient sovereignty and preaches anarchy which is substantially a proposal to reduce the social cosmos to chaos and begin the brute struggle for existence once again  any one who is acquainted with the state of 216 the population of all great industrial centres whether in this or other countries is aware that amidst a large and increasing body of that population la misere reigns supreme i have no pretensions to the character of a philanthropist and i have a special horror of all sorts of sentimental rhetoric i am merely trying to deal with facts to some extent within my own knowledge and further evidenced by abundant testimony as a naturalist and i take it to be a mere plain truth that throughout industrial europe there is not a single large manufacturing city which is free from a vast mass of people whose condition is exactly that described and from a still greater mass who living just on the edge of the social swamp are liable to be precipitated into it by any lack of demand for their produce and with every addition to the population the multitude already sunk in the pit and the number of the host sliding towards it continually increase  argumentation can hardly be needful to make it clear that no society in which the elements of decomposition are thus swiftly and surely accumulating can hope to win in the race of industries  intelligence knowledge and skill are undoubtedly conditions of success but of what avail are they likely to be unless they are backed up by honesty energy goodwill and all the physical and moral faculties that go to the making of manhood and unless they are stimulated by hope of such 217 reward as men may fairly look to and what dweller in the slough of want dwarfed in body and soul demoralized hopeless can reasonably be expected to possess these qualities  any full and permanent development of the productive powers of an industrial population then must be compatible with and indeed based upon a social organization which will secure a fair amount of physical and moral welfare to that population which will make for good and not for evil natural science and religious enthusiasm rarely go hand in hand but on this matter their concord is complete and the least sympathetic of naturalists can but admire the insight and the devotion of such social reformers as the late lord shaftesbury whose recently published life and letters gives a vivid picture of the condition of the working classes fifty years ago and of the pit which our industry ignoring these plain truths was then digging under its own feet  there is perhaps no more hopeful sign of progress among us in the last halfcentury than the steadily increasing devotion which has been and is directed to measures for promoting physical and moral welfare among the poorer classes sanitary reformers like most other reformers whom i have had the advantage of knowing seem to need a good dose of fanaticism as a sort of moral coca to keep them up to the mark and doubtless they have made many mistakes but that the 218 endeavour to improve the condition under our industrial population live to amend the drainage of densely peopled streets to provide baths washhouses and gymnasia to facilitate habits of thrift to furnish some provision for instruction and amusement in public libraries and the like is not only desirable from a philanthropic point of view but an essential condition of safe industrial development appears to me to be indisputable it is by such means alone so far as i can see that we can hope to check the constant gravitation of industrial society towards la misere until the general progress of intelligence and morality leads men to grapple with the sources of that tendency if it is said that the carrying out of such arrangements as those indicated must enhance the cost of production and thus handicap the producer in the race of competition i venture in the first place to doubt the fact but if it be so it results that industrial society has to face a dilemma either alternative of which threatens destruction  on the one hand a population the labour of which is sufficiently remunerated may be physically and morally healthy and socially stable but may fail in industrial competition by reason of the dearness of its produce  on the other hand a population the labour of which is insufficiently remunerated must become physically and morally unhealthy and socially unstable and though it 219 may succeed for a while in industrial competition by reason of the cheapness of its produce it must in the end fall through hideous misery and degradation to utter ruin  well if these are the only possible alternatives let us for ourselves and our children choose the former and if need be starve like men but i do not believe that the stable society made up of healthy vigorous instructed and selfruling people would ever incur serious risk of that fate they are not likely to be troubled with many competitors of the same character just yet and they may be safely trusted to find ways of holding their own  assuming that the physical and moral wellbeing and the stable social order which are the indispensable conditions of permanent industrial development are secured there remains for consideration the means of attaining that knowledge and skill without which even then the battle of competition cannot be successfully fought let us consider how we stand a vast system of elementary education has now been in operation among us for sixteen years and has reached all but a very small fraction of the population i do not think that there is any room for doubt that on the whole it has worked well and that its indirect no less than its direct benefits have been immense but as might be expected it exhibits the defects of all our educational systemsfashioned 220 as they were to meet the wants of a bygone condition of society there is a widespread and i think welljustified complaint that it has too much to do with books and too little to do with things i am as little disposed as any one can well be to narrow early education and to make the primary school a mere annexe of the shop and it is not so much in the interests of industry as in that of breadth of culture that i echo the common complaint against the bookish and theoretical character of our primary instruction  if there were no such things as industrial pursuits a system of education which does nothing for the faculties of observation which trains neither the eye nor the hand and is compatible with utter ignorance of the commonest natural truths might still be reasonably regarded as strangely imperfect and when we consider that the instruction and training which are lacking are exactly those which are of most importance for the great mass of our population the fault becomes almost a crime the more that there is no practical difficulty in making good these defects there really is no reason why drawing should not be universally taught and it is an admirable training for both eye and hand artists are born not made but everybody may be taught to draw elevations plans and sections and pots and pans are as good indeed better models for 221 this purpose than the apollo belvedere the plant is not expensive and there is this excellent quality about drawing of the kind indicated that it can be tested almost as easily and severely as arithmetic such drawings are either right or wrong and if they are wrong the pupil can be made to see that they are wrong from the industrial point of view drawing has the further merit that there is hardly any trade in which the power of drawing is not of daily and hourly utility  in the next place no good reason except the want of capable teachers can be assigned why elementary notions of science should not be an element in general instruction in this case again no expensive or elaborate apparatus is necessary the commonest thinga candle a boys squirt a piece of chalkin the hands of a teacher who knows his business may be made the startingpoint whence children may be led into the regions of science as far as their capacity permits with efficient exercise of their observational and reasoning faculties on the road if object lessons often prove trivial failures it is not the fault of object lessons but that of the teacher who has not found out how much the power of teaching a little depends on knowing a great deal and that thoroughly and that he has not made that discovery is not the fault of the teachers but of the detestable system of training them which is widely prevalent       training in the use of simple tools is no doubt desirable     on all grounds from the point of view of culture the     man whose fingers are all thumbs is but a stunted     creature but the practical difficulties in the way of     introducing handiwork of this kind into elementary schools     appear to me to be considerable  222 as i have said i do not regard the proposal to add these to the present subjects of universal instruction as made merely in the interests of industry elementary science and drawing are just as needful at eton where i am happy to say both are now parts of the regular course as in the lowest primary school but their importance in the education of the artisan is enhanced not merely by the fact that the knowledge and skill thus gainedlittle as they may amount towill still be of practical utility to him but further because they constitute an introduction to that special training which is commonly called technical education  i conceive that our wants in this last direction may be grouped under three heads 1 instruction in the principles of those branches of science and of art which are peculiarly applicable to industrial pursuits which may be called preliminary scientific education 2 instruction in the special branches of such applied science and art as technical education proper 3 instruction of teachers in both these branches 4 capacitycatching machinery  a great deal has already been done in each of these directions but much remains to be done if elementary education is amended in the way 223 that has been suggested i think that the school boards will have quite as much on their hands as they are capable of doing well the influences under which the members of these bodies are elected do not tend to secure fitness for dealing with scientific or technical education and it is the less necessary to burden them with an uncongenial task as there are other organizations not only much better fitted to do the work but already actually doing it  in the matter of preliminary scientific education the chief of these is the science and art department which has done more during the last quarter of a century for the teaching of elementary science among the masses of the people than any organization which exists either in this or in any other country it has become veritably a peoples university so far as physical science is concerned at the foundation of our old universities they were freely open to the poorest but the poorest must come to them in the last quarter of a century the science and art department by means of its classes spread all over the country and open to all has conveyed instruction to the poorest the university extension movement shows that our older learned corporations have discovered the propriety of following suit  technical education in the strict sense has become a necessity for two reasons the old apprenticeship system has broken down partly by 224 reason of the changed conditions of industrial life and partly because trades have ceased to be crafts the traditional secrets whereof the master handed down to his apprentices invention is constantly changing the face of our industries so that use and wont rule of thumb and the like are gradually losing their importance while that knowledge of principles which alone can deal successfully with changed conditions is becoming more and more valuable socially the master of four or five apprentices is disappearing in favour of the employer of forty or four hundred or four thousand hands and the odds and ends of technical knowledge formerly picked up in a shop are not and cannot be supplied in the factory the instruction formerly given by the master must therefore be more than replaced by the systematic teaching of the technical school  institutions of this kind on varying scales of magnitude and completeness from the splendid edifice set up by the city and guilds institute to the smallest local technical school to say nothing of classes such as those in technology instituted by the society of arts subsequently taken over by the city guilds have been established in various parts of the country and the movement in favour of their increase and multiplication is rapidly growing in breadth and intensity but there is much difference of opinion as to the best 225 way in which the technical instruction so generally desired should be given two courses appear to be practicable the one is the establishment of special technical schools with a systematic and lengthened course of instruction demanding the employment of the whole time of the pupils the other is the setting afoot of technical classes especially evening classes comprising a short series of lessons on some special topic which may be attended by persons already earning wages in some branch of trade or commerce  there is no doubt that technical schools on the plan indicated under the first head are extremely costly and so far as the teaching of artisans is concerned it is very commonly objected to them that as the learners do not work under trade conditions they are apt to fall into amateurish habits which prove of more hindrance than service in the actual business of life  when such schools are attached to factories under the direction of an employer who desires to train up a supply of intelligent workmen of course this objection does not apply nor can the usefulness of such schools for the training of future employers and for the higher grade of the employed be doubtful but they are clearly out of the reach of the great mass of the people who have to earn their bread as soon as possible we must therefore look to the classes and especially to evening classes as the great instrument for the technical 226 education of the artisan the utility of such classes has now been placed beyond all doubt the only question which remains is to find the ways and means of extending them  we are here as in all other questions of social organization met by two diametrically opposed views on the one hand the methods pursued in foreign countries are held up as our example the state is exhorted to take the matter in hand and establish a great system of technical education on the other hand many economists of the individualist school exhaust the resources of language in condemning and repudiating not merely the interference of the general government in such matters but the application of a farthing of the funds raised by local taxation to these purposes i entertain a strong conviction that in this country at any rate the state had much better leave purely technical and trade instruction alone but although my personal leanings are decidedly towards the individualists i have arrived at that conclusion on merely practical grounds in fact my individualism is rather of a sentimental sort and i sometimes think i should be stronger in the faith if it were less vehemently advocated i am unable to see that civil society is anything but a corporation established 227 for a moral object onlynamely the good of its membersand therefore that it may take such measures as seem fitting for the attainment of that which the general voice decides to be the general good that the suffrage of the majority is by no means a scientific test of social good and evil is unfortunately too true but in practice it is the only test we can apply and the refusal to abide by it means anarchy the purest despotism that ever existed is as much based upon that will of the majority which is usually submission to the will of a small minority as the freest republic law is the expression of the opinion of the majority and it is law and not mere opinion because the many are strong enough to enforce it       in what follows i am only repeating and emphasizing     opinions which i expressed seventeen years ago in an     address to the members of the midland institute     republished in critiques and addresses in 1873 and in vol     i of these essays  i have seen no reason to modify them     notwithstanding high authority on the other side  i am as strongly convinced as the most pronounced individualist can be that it is desirable that every man should be free to act in every way which does not limit the corresponding freedom of his fellowman but i fail to connect that great induction of political science with the practical corollary which is frequently drawn from it that the statethat is the people in their corporate capacityhas no business to meddle with anything but the administration of justice and external defence it appears to me that the 228 amount of freedom which incorporate society may fitly leave to its members is not a fixed quantity to be determined a priori by deduction from the fiction called natural rights but that it must be determined by and vary with circumstances i conceive it to be demonstrable that the higher and the more complex the organization of the social body the more closely is the life of each member bound up with that of the whole and the larger becomes the category of acts which cease to be merely selfregarding and which interfere with the freedom of others more or less seriously  if a squatter living ten miles away from any neighbour chooses to burn his house down to get rid of vermin there may be no necessity in the absence of insurance offices that the law should interfere with his freedom of action his act can hurt nobody but himself but if the dweller in a street chooses to do the same thing the state very properly makes such a proceeding a crime and punishes it as such he does meddle with his neighbours freedom and that seriously so it might perhaps be a tenable doctrine that it would be needless and even tyrannous to make education compulsory in a sparse agricultural population living in abundance on the produce of its own soil but in a densely populated manufacturing country struggling for existence with competitors every ignorant person tends to 229 become a burden upon and so far an infringer of the liberty of his fellows and an obstacle to their success under such circumstances an education rate is in fact a war tax levied for purposes of defence  that state action always has been more or less misdirected and always will be so is i believe perfectly true but i am not aware that it is more true of the action of men in their corporate capacity than it is of the doings of individuals the wisest and most dispassionate man in existence merely wishing to go from one stile in a field to the opposite will not walk quite straighthe is always going a little wrong and always correcting himself and i can only congratulate the individualist who is able to say that his general course of life has been of a less undulatory character to abolish state action because its direction is never more than approximately correct appears to me to be much the same thing as abolishing the man at the wheel altogether because do what he will the ship yaws more or less why should i be robbed of my property to pay for teaching another mans children is an individualist question which is not unfrequently put as if it settled the whole business perhaps it does but i find difficulties in seeing why it should the parish in which i live makes me pay my share for the paving and lighting of a great many streets that i never pass through 230 and i might plead that i am robbed to smooth the way and lighten the darkness of other people but i am afraid the parochial authorities would not let me off on this plea and i must confess i do not see why they should  i cannot speak of my own knowledge but i have every reason to believe that i came into this world a small reddish person certainly without a gold spoon in my mouth and in fact with no discernible abstract or concrete rights or property of any description if a foot was not set upon me at once as a squalling nuisance it was either the natural affection of those about me which i certainly had done nothing to deserve or the fear of the law which ages before my birth was painfully built up by the society into which i intruded that prevented that catastrophe if i was nourished cared for taught saved from the vagabondage of a wastrel i certainly am not aware that i did anything to deserve those advantages and if i possess anything now it strikes me that though i may have fairly earned my days wages for my days work and may justly call them my propertyyet without that organization of society created out of the toil and blood of long generations before my time i should probably have had nothing but a flint axe and an indifferent hut to call my own and even those would be mine only so long as no stronger savage came my way  so that if society having quite gratuitously 231 done all these things for me asks me in turn to do something towards its preservationeven if that something is to contribute to the teaching of other mens childreni really in spite of all my individualist leanings feel rather ashamed to say no and if i were not ashamed i cannot say that i think that society would be dealing unjustly with me in converting the moral obligation into a legal one there is a manifest unfairness in letting all the burden be borne by the willing horse  it does not appear to me then that there is any valid objection to taxation for purposes of education but in the case of technical schools and classes i think it is practically expedient that such a taxation should be local our industrial population accumulates in particular towns and districts these districts are those which immediately profit by technical education and it is only in them that we can find the men practically engaged in industries among whom some may reasonably be expected to be competent judges of that which is wanted and of the best means of meeting the want  in my belief all methods of technical training are at present tentative and to be successful each must be adapted to the special peculiarities of its locality this is a case in which we want twenty years not of strong government but of cheerful and hopeful blundering and we may be 232 thankful if we get things straight in that time  the principle of the bill introduced but dropped by the government last session appears to me to be wise and some of the objections to it i think are due to a misunderstanding the bill proposed in substance to allow localities to tax themselves for purposes of technical educationon the condition that any scheme for such purpose should be submitted to the science and art department and declared by that department to be in accordance with the intention of the legislature  a cry was raised that the bill proposed to throw technical education into the hands of the science and art department but in reality no power of initiation nor even of meddling with details was given to that departmentthe sole function of which was to decide whether any plan proposed did or did not come within the limits of technical education the necessity for such control somewhere is obvious no legislature certainly not ours is likely to grant the power of selftaxation without setting limits to that power in some way and it would neither have been practicable to devise a legal definition of technical education nor commendable to leave the question to the auditorgeneral to be fought out in the lawcourts the only alternative was to leave the decision to an appropriate state authority if it is 233 asked what is the need of such control if the people of the localities are the best judges the obvious reply is that there are localities and localities and that while manchester or liverpool or birmingham or glasgow might perhaps be safely left to do as they thought fit smaller towns in which there is less certainty of full discussion by competent people of different ways of thinking might easily fall a prey to crocheteers  supposing our intermediate science teaching and our technical schools and classes are established there is yet a third need to be supplied and that is the want of good teachers and it is necessary not only to get them but to keep them when you have got them  it is impossible to insist too strongly upon the fact that the efficient teachers of science and of technology are not to be made by the processes in vogue at ordinary training colleges the memory loaded with mere bookwork is not the thing wantedis in fact rather worse than uselessin the teacher of scientific subjects it is absolutely essential that his mind should be full of knowledge and not of mere learning and that what he knows should have been learned in the laboratory rather than in the library there are happily already both in london and in the provinces various places in which such training is to be had and the main thing at present is to make it in the first place accessible and in the next 234 indispensable to those who undertake the business of teaching but when the welltrained men are supplied it must be recollected that the profession of teacher is not a very lucrative or otherwise tempting one and that it may be advisable to offer special inducements to good men to remain in it these however are questions of detail into which it is unnecessary to enter further  last but not least comes the question of providing the machinery for enabling those who are by nature specially qualified to undertake the higher branches of industrial work to reach the position in which they may render that service to the community if all our educational expenditure did nothing but pick one man of scientific or inventive genius each year from amidst the hewers of wood and drawers of water and give him the chance of making the best of his inborn faculties it would be a very good investment  if there is one such child among the hundreds of thousands of our annual increase it would be worth any money to drag him either from the slough of misery or from the hotbed of wealth and teach him to devote himself to the service of his people here again we have made a beginning with our scholarships and the like and need only follow in the tracks already worn  the programme of industrial development briefly set forth in the preceding pages is not what kant calls a hirngespinnst a cobweb 235 spun in the brain of a utopian philosopher more or less of it has taken bodily shape in many parts of the country and there are towns of no great size or wealth in the manufacturing districts keighley for example in which almost the whole of it has for some time been carried out so far as the means at the disposal of the energetic and publicspirited men who have taken the matter in hand permitted the thing can be done i have endeavoured to show good grounds for the belief that it must be done and that speedily if we wish to hold our own in the war of industry i doubt not that it will be done whenever its absolute necessity becomes as apparent to all those who are absorbed in the actual business of industrial life as it is to some of the lookers on  perhaps it is necessary for me to add that technical education is not here proposed as a panacea for social diseases but simply as a medicament which will help the patient to pass through an imminent crisis  an ophthalmic surgeon may recommend an operation for cataract in a man who is going blind without being supposed to undertake that it will cure him of gout and i may pursue the metaphor so far as to remark that the surgeon is justified in pointing out that a diet of porkchops and burgundy will probably kill his patient though he may be quite able to suggest a mode of living 236 which will free him from his constitutional disorder  mr booth asks me why do you not propose some plan of your own really that is no answer to my argument that his treatment will make the patient very much worse note added in social diseases and worse remedies january 1891  237             letters to the times                  on the           darkest england scheme                     i  the times december 1st 1890  sir a short time ago a generous and philanthropic friend wrote to me placing at my disposal a large sum of money for the furtherance of the vast scheme which the general of the salvation army has propounded if i thought it worthy of support the responsibility of advising my benevolent correspondent has weighed heavily upon me but i felt that it would be cowardly as well as ungracious to refuse to accept it i have therefore studied mr booths book with some care for the purpose of separating the essential from the accessory features of his project and i have based my judgmenti am sorry to say an unfavourable oneupon the data thus obtained before communicating my conclusions to my friend however i am desirous to know what there may be to be said in arrest of that judgment 238 and the matter is of such vast public importance that i trust you will aid me by publishing this letter notwithstanding its length  there are one or two points upon which i imagine all thinking men have arrived at the same convictions as those from which mr booth starts it is certain that there is an immense amount of remediable misery among us that in addition to the poverty disease and degradation which are the consequences of causes beyond human control there is a vast probably a very much larger quantity of misery which is the result of individual ignorance or misconduct and of faulty social arrangements further i think it is not to be doubted that unless this remediable misery is effectually dealt with the hordes of vice and pauperism will destroy modern civilization as effectually as uncivilized tribes of another kind destroyed the great social organization which preceded ours moreover i think all will agree that no reforms and improvements will go to the root of the evil unless they attack it in its ultimate sourcenamely the motives of the individual man honest industrious and selfrestraining men will make a very bad social organization prosper while vicious idle and reckless citizens will bring to ruin the best that ever was or ever will be invented  the leading propositions which are peculiar to mr booth i take to be these  239 1 that the only adequate means to such reformation of the individual man is the adoption of that form of somewhat corybantic christianity of which the soldiers of the salvation army are the militant missionaries this implies the belief that the excitement of the religious emotions largely by processes described by their employers as rousing and convivial is a desirable and trustworthy method of permanently amending the conduct of mankind  i demur to these propositions i am of opinion that the testimony of history no less than the cool observation of that which lies within the personal experience of many of us is wholly adverse to it     2 that the appropriate instrument for the propagation and maintenance of this peculiar sacramental enthusiasm is the salvation armya body of devotees drilled and disciplined as a military organization and provided with a numerous hierarchy of officers every one of whom is pledged to blind and unhesitating obedience to the general who frankly tells us that the first condition of the service is implicit unquestioning obedience a telegram from me will send any of them to the uttermost parts of the earth every one has taken service on the express condition that he or she will obey without questioning or gainsaying the orders from headquarters darkest england p 243  240 this proposition seems to me to be indisputable history confirms it  francis of assisi and ignatius loyola made their great experiments on the same principle nothing is more certain than that a body of religious enthusiasts perhaps we may even say fanatics pledged to blind obedience to their chief is one of the most efficient instruments for effecting any purpose that the wit of man has yet succeeded in devising and i can but admire the insight into human nature which has led mr booth to leave his unquestioning and unhesitating instruments unbound by vows a volunteer slave is worth ten sworn bondsmen     3 that the success of the salvation army with its present force of 9416 officers wholly engaged in the work its capital of three quarters of a million its income of the same amount its 1375 corps at home and 1499 in the colonies and foreign countries appendix pp 3 and 4 is a proof that divine assistance has been vouchsafed to its efforts  here i am not able to agree with the sanguine commanderinchief of the new model whose labours in creating it have probably interfered with his acquisition of information respecting the fate of previous enterprises of like kind  it does not appear to me that his success is in any degree more remarkable than that of francis of assisi or that of ignatius loyola than that 241 of george fox or even than that of the mormons in our own time when i observe the discrepancies of the doctrinal foundations from which each of these great movements set out i find it difficult to suppose that supernatural aid has been given to all of them still more that mr booths smaller measure of success is evidence that it has been granted to him  but what became of the franciscan experiment if there was one rule rather than another on which the founder laid stress it was that his army of friars should be absolute mendicants keeping themselves sternly apart from all worldly entanglements yet even before the death of francis in 1226 a strong party headed by elias of cortona the deputy of his own appointment began to hanker after these very things and within thirty years of that time the franciscans had become one of the most powerful wealthy and worldly corporations in christendom with their fingers in every sink of political and social corruption if so be profit for the order could be fished out of it their principal interest being to fight their rivals the dominicans and to persecute such of their own brethren as were honest enough to try to carry out their founders plainest injunctions we also know what has become of loyolas experiment for two centuries the jesuits have been the hope of the enemies of the papacy whenever it becomes too prosperous they are sure to bring about a catastrophe by their corrupt use of the political and social influence which their organization and their wealth secure       see note pp 245247  242 with these examples of that which may happen to institutions founded by noble men with high aims in the hands of successors of a different stamp armed with despotic authority before me common prudence surely requires that before advising the handing over of a large sum of money to the general of a new order of mendicants i should ask what guarantee there is that thirty years hence the general who then autocratically controls the action say of 100000 officers pledged to blind obedience distributed through the whole length and breadth of the poorer classes and each with his finger on the trigger of a mine charged with discontent and religious fanaticism with the absolute control say of eight or ten millions sterling of capital and as many of income with barracks in every town with estates scattered over the country and with settlements in the colonieswill exercise his enormous powers not merely honestly but wisely what shadow of security is there that the person who wields this uncontrolled authority over many thousands of men shall use it solely for those philanthropic and religious objects which i do not doubt are alone in the mind of mr booth who is to say that the salvation army in the year 243 1920 shall not be a replica of what the franciscan order had become in the year 1260  the personal character and the intentions of the founders of such organizations as we are considering count for very little in the formation of a forecast of their future and if they did it is no disrespect to mr  booth to say that he is not the peer of francis of assisi but if franciss judgment of men was so imperfect as to permit him to appoint an ambitious intriguer of the stamp of brother elias his deputy we have no right to be sanguine about the perspicacity of mr booth in a like matter  adding to all these considerations the fact that mr llewelyn davies the warmth of whose philanthropy is beyond question and in whose competency and fairness i for one place implicit reliance flatly denies the boasted success of the salvation army in its professed mission i have arrived at the conclusion that as at present advised i cannot be the instrument of carrying out my friends proposal  mr booth has pithily characterized certain benevolent schemes as doing sixpennyworth of good and a shillings worth of harm i grieve to say that in my opinion the definition exactly fits his own project few social evils are of greater magnitude than uninstructed and unchastened religious fanaticism no personal habit more surely degrades the conscience and the intellect than 244 blind and unhesitating obedience to unlimited authority undoubtedly harlotry and intemperance are sore evils and starvation is hard to bear or even to know of but the prostitution of the mind the soddening of the conscience the dwarfing of manhood are worse calamities it is a greater evil to have the intellect of a nation put down by organized fanaticism to see its political and industrial affairs at the mercy of a despot whose chief thought is to make that fanaticism prevail to watch the degradation of men who should feel themselves individually responsible for their own and their countrys fates to mere brute instruments ready to the hand of a master for any use to which he may put them  but that is the end to which in my opinion all such organizations as that to which kindly people who do not look to the consequences of their acts are now giving their thousands inevitably tend unless clear proof that i am wrong is furnished another thousand shall not be added by my instrumentality                i am sir your obedient servant                                   t h huxley  245                       note  an authoritative contemporary historian matthew paris writes thus of the minorite or franciscan friars in england in 1235 just nine years after the death of francis of assisi  at this time some of the minorite brethren as well as some of the order of preachers unmindful of their profession and the restrictions of their order impudently entered the territories of some noble monasteries under pretense of fulfilling their duties of preaching as if intending to depart after preaching the next day under pretence of sickness or on some other pretext however they remained and constructing an altar of wood they placed on it a consecrated stone altar which they had brought with them and clandestinely and in a low voice performed mass and even received the confessions of many of the parishioners to the prejudice of the priests  and if by chance they were not satisfied with this they broke forth in insults and threats reviling every other order except their own and asserting that all the rest were doomed to damnation and that they would not spare the soles of their feet till they had exhausted the wealth of their opposers however great it might be the religious men therefore gave way to them in many points yielding to avoid scandal and offending those in power for they were the councillors and messengers of the nobles and even secretaries of the pope and therefore obtained much 246 secular favour some however finding themselves opposed by the court of rome were restrained by obvious reasons and went away in confusion for the supreme pontiff with a scowling look said to them what means this my brethren  to what lengths are you going have you not professed voluntary poverty and that you would traverse towns and castles and distant places as the case required barefooted and unostentatiously in order to preach the word of god in all humility and do you now presume to usurp these estates to yourselves against the will of the lords of these fees your religion appears to be in a great measure dying away and your doctrines to be confuted  under date of 1243 matthew writes  for three or four hundred years or more the monastic order did not hasten to destruction so quickly as their order minorites and preachers of whom now the brothers twentyfour years having scarcely elapsed had first built in england dwellings which rivalled regal palaces in height these are they who daily expose to view their inestimable treasures in enlarging their sumptuous edifices and erecting lofty walls thereby impudently transgressing the limits of their original poverty and violating the basis of their religion according to the prophecy of german hildegarde when noblemen and rich men are at the point of death whom they know to be possessed of great riches they in their love of gain diligently urge them to the injury and loss of the ordinary pastors and extort confessions and hidden wills lauding themselves and their own order only 247 and placing themselves before all others so no faithful man now believes he can be saved except he is directed by the counsels of the preachers and minoritesmatthew pariss english history translated by the rev j a  giles 1889 vol i                        ii  the times december 9th 1890  sirthe purpose of my previous letter about mr booths scheme was to arouse the contributors to the military chest of the salvation army to a clear sense of what they are doing i thought it desirable that they should be distinctly aware that they are setting up and endowing a sect in many ways analogous to the ranters and revivalists of undesirable notoriety in former times but with this immensely important difference that it possesses a strong farreaching centralized organization the disposal of the physical moral and financial strength of which rests with an irresponsible chief who according to his own account is assured of the blind obedience of nearly 10000 subordinates i wish them to ask themselves ought prudent men and good citizens to aid in the establishment of an organization which under sundry by no means improbable contingencies may easily become a worse and more 248 dangerous nuisance than the mendicant friars of the middle ages if this is an academic question i really do not know what questions deserve to be called practical as you divined i purposely omitted any consideration of the details of the salvationist scheme and of the principles which animate those who work it because i desired that the public appreciation of the evils necessarily inherent in all such plans of despotic social and religious regimentation should not be obscured by the raising of points of less comparative however great absolute importance  but it is now time to undertake a more particular criticism of darkest england at the outset of my examination of that work i was startled to find that mr booth had put forward his scheme with an almost incredibly imperfect knowledge of what had been done and is doing in the same direction a simple reader might well imagine that the author of darkest england posed as the columbus or at any rate the cortez of that region  go to mudies he tells us and you will be surprised to see how few books there are upon the social problem that may or may not be correct but if mr booth had gone to a certain readingroom not far from mudies i undertake to say that the wellinformed and obliging staff of the national library in bloomsbury would have provided him with more books on this topic in almost all european languages than he would 249 read in three months  has socialism no literature and what is socialism but an incarnation of the social question moreover i am persuaded that even mudies resources could have furnished mr booth with the life of lord shaftesbury and carlyles works mr booth seems to have undertaken to instruct the world without having heard of past and present or of latterday pamphlets though somewhat late in the day a judicious friend calls his attention to them to those of my contemporaries on whom as on myself carlyles writings on this topic made an ineffaceable impression forty years ago who know that for all that time hundreds of able and devoted men both clerical and lay have worked heart and soul for the permanent amendment of the condition of the poor mr booths go to mudies affords an apt measure of the depth of his preliminary studies however i am bound to admit that these earlier labourers in the field laboured in such a different fashion that the originality of the plan started by mr booth remains largely unaffected for them no drums have beat no trombones brayed no sanctified buffoonery after the model of the oration of the friar in wallensteins camp dear to the readers of schiller has tickled the ears of the groundlings on their behalf sadly behind the great age of rowdy selfadvertisement in which their lot has fallen they seem not to have advanced one whit 250 beyond john the baptist and the apostles 1800 years ago in their notions of the way in which the metanoia the change of mind of the illdoer is to be brought about yet the new model was there ready for the imitation of those ancient savers of souls the ranting and roaring mystagogues of some of the most venerable of greek and syrian cults also had their processions and banners their fifes and cymbals and holy chants their hierarchy of officers to whom the art of making collections was not wholly unknown and who as freely as their modern imitators promised an elysian future to contributory converts the success of these antique salvation armies was enormous simon magus was quite as notorious a personage and probably had as strong a following as mr booth yet the apostles with their oldfashioned ways would not accept such a success as a satisfactory sign of the divine sanction nor depart from their own methods of leading the way to the higher life  i deem it unessential to verify mr booths statistics the exact strength of the population of the realm of misery be it one two or three millions has nothing to do with the efficacy of any means proposed for the highly desirable end of reducing it to a minimum the sole question for consideration at present is whether the scheme keeping specially in view the spirit in which it is to be worked is likely to do more good than harm  251 mr booth tells us with commendable frankness that it is primarily and mainly for the sake of saving the soul that i seek the salvation of the body p 45 which language being interpreted means that the propagation of the special salvationist creed comes first and the promotion of the physical intellectual and purely moral welfare of mankind second in his estimation men are to be made sober and industrious mainly that as washed shorn and docile sheep they may be driven into the narrow theological fold which mr booth patronizes if they refuse to enter for all their moral cleanliness they will have to take their place among the goats as sinners only less dirty than the rest  i have been in the habit of thinking and i believe the opinion is largely shared by reasonable men that selfrespect and thrift are the rungs of the ladder by which men may most surely climb out of the slough of despond of want and i have regarded them as perhaps the most eminent of the practical virtues that is not mr booths opinion for him they are mere varnished sinsnothing better than pride rebaptised p 46 shutting his eyes to the necessary consequences of the struggle for life the existence of which he accepts as fully as any darwinian mr booth tells men whose evil case is one of those consequences that envy is a cornerstone of our 252 competitive system with thrift and selfrespect denounced as sin with the suffering of starving men referred to the sins of the capitalist the gospel according to mr booth may save souls but it will hardly save society       see p 100  in estimating the social and political influence which the salvation army is likely to exert it is important to reflect that the officers pledged to blind obedience to their general are not to confine themselves to the functions of mere deacons and catechists though under a general like cyril alexandria knew to her cost what even they could effect they are to be tribunes of the people who are to act as their gratuitous legal advisers and when law is not sufficiently effective the whole force of the army is to obtain what the said tribunes may conceive to be justice by the practice of ruthless intimidation society says mr booth needs mothering and he sets forth with much complacency a variety of cases by which we may estimate the sort of mothering to be expected at his parental hands those who study the materials thus set before them will i think be driven to the conclusion that the mother has already proved herself a most unscrupulous meddler even if she has not fallen within reach of the arm of the law  consider this case a asserting herself to have been seduced twice applied to our people we hunted up the man followed him to the country 253 threatened him with public exposure and forced from him the payment to his victim of pounds 60 down an allowance of pounds 1 a week and an insurance policy on his life for pounds 450 in her favour p 222   jedburgh justice this we constitute ourselves prosecutor judge jury sheriffs officer all in one we practice intimidation as deftly as if we were a branch of another league and under threat of exposure we extort a tolerably heavy hushmoney in payment of our silence   well really my poor moral sense is unable to distinguish these remarkable proceedings of the new popular tribunate from what in french is called chantage and in plain english blackmailing and when we consider that anybody for any reason of jealousy or personal spite or party hatred might be thus hunted followed threatened and financially squeezed or ruined without a particle of legal investigation at the will of a man whom the familiar charged with the inquisitorial business dare not hesitate to obey surely it is not unreasonable to ask how far does the salvation army in its tribune of the people aspect differ from a sicilian mafia i am no apologist of men guilty of the acts charged against the person who yet i think might be as fairly called a victim in this case as his partner in wrongdoing it is possible that in so peculiar a case solomon himself might have been puzzled 254 to apportion the relative moral delinquency of the parties however that may be the man was morally and legally bound to support his child and any one would have been justified in helping the woman to her legal rights and the man to the legal consequences in which exposure is included of his fault  the action of the general of the salvation army in extorting the heavy fine he chose to impose as the price of his silence however excellent his motives appears to me to be as immoral as i hope it is illegal  so much for the salvation army as a teacher of questionable ethics and of eccentric economics as the legal adviser who recommends and practices the extraction of money by intimidation as the fairy godmother who proposes to mother society in a fashion which is not to my taste however much it may commend itself to some of mr booths supporters                    i am sir your obedient servant                                       t h huxley  255                       iii         the times december 11th 1890  sirwhen i first addressed you on the subject of the projected operations of the salvation army all that i knew about that body was derived from the study of mr booths book from common repute and from occasional attention to the sayings and doings of his noisy squadrons with which my walks about london in past years have made me familiar i was quite unaware of the existence of evidence respecting the present administration of the salvation forces which would have enabled me to act upon the sagacious maxim of the american humourist dont prophesy unless you know the letter you were good enough to publish has brought upon me a swarm of letters and pamphlets  some favour me with abuse some thoughtful correspondents warmly agree with me and then proceed to point out how much worthier certain schemes of their own are of my friends support some send valuable encouragement for which i offer my hearty thanks and ask them to excuse any more special acknowledgment but that which i find most to the purpose just now is the revelation made by some of the documents which have reached me of a fact of which i was wholly ignorantnamely that 256 persons who have faithfully and zealously served in the salvation army who express unchanged attachment to its original principles and practice and who have been in close official relations with the general have publicly declared that the process of degradation of the organization into a mere engine of fanatical intolerance and personal ambition which i declared was inevitable has already set in and is making rapid progress  it is out of the question sir that i should occupy the columns of the times with a detailed exposition and criticism of these pieces justificatives of my forecast i say criticism because the assertions of persons who have quitted any society must in fairness be taken with the caution that is required in the case of all ex parte statements of hostile witnesses but it is at any rate a notable fact that there are parts of my first letter indicating the inherent and necessary evil consequences of any such organization which might serve for abstracts of portions of this evidence long since printed and published under the public responsibility of the witnesses  let us ask the attention of your readers in the first place to an excaptains experience of the salvation army by j j r redstone the genuineness of which is guaranteed by the preface dated april 5th 1888 which the rev dr cunningham geikie has supplied mr redstones story is well worth reading on its own account  257 told in simple direct language such as john bunyan might have used it permits no doubt of the singleminded sincerity of the man who gave up everything to become an officer of the salvation army but exhibiting a sad want of that capacity for unhesitating and blind obedience on which mr  booth lays so much stress was thrown aside pennilessno i am wrong with 2s 4d for his last weeks salaryto shift with his equally devoted wife as he best might i wish i could induce intending contributors to mr  booths army chest to read mr redstones story i would particularly ask them to contrast the pure simplicity of his plain tale with the artificial pietism and slobbering unction of the letters which mr ballington booth addresses to his dear boy a married man apparently older than himself so long as the said dear boy is facing brickbats and starvation as per order  i confess that my opinion of the chiefs of the salvation army has been so distinctly modified by the perusal of this pamphlet that i am glad to be relieved from the necessity of expressing it it will be much better that i should cite a few sentences from the preface written by dr cunningham geikie who expresses warm admiration for the early and uncorrupted work of the salvation army and cannot possibly be accused of prejudice against it on religious grounds     1 the salvation army is emphatically a 258 family concern mr booth senior is general one son is chief of the staff and the remaining sons and daughters engross the other chief positions it is booth all over indeed like the sun in your eyes you can see nothing else wherever you turn and as dr geikie shrewdly remarks to be the head of a widely spread sect carries with it many advantagesnot all exclusively spiritual     2 whoever becomes a salvation officer is henceforth a slave helplessly exposed to the caprice of his superiors  mr redstone bore an excellent character both before he entered the army and when he left it to join it though a married man he gave up a situation which he had held for five years and he served mr booth two years working hard in most difficult posts his one fault major lawley tells us was that he was too straightthat is too honest truthful and manlyor in other words too real a christian yet without trial without formulated charges on the strength of secret complaints which were never apparently tested he was dismissed with less courtesy than most people would show a beggarwith 2s 4d for his last weeks salary if there be any mistake in this matter i shall be glad to learn it     3 dr geikie confirms on the ground of information given confidentially by other officers 259 mr redstones assertion that they are watched and reported by spies from headquarters     4 mr booth refuses to guarantee his officers any fixed amount of salary while he and his family of high officials live in comfort if not in luxury the pledged slaves whose devotion is the foundation of any true success the army has met with often have hardly food enough to sustain life one good fellow frankly told me that when he had nothing he just went and begged  at this point it is proper that i should interpose an apology for having hastily spoken of such men as francis of assisi even for purposes of warning in connection with mr booth whatever may be thought of the wisdom of the plans of the founders of the great monastic orders of the middle ages they took their full share of suffering and privation and never shirked in their own persons the sacrifices they imposed on their followers  i have already expressed the opinion that whatever the ostensible purpose of the scheme under discussion one of its consequences will be the setting up and endowment of a new rantersocialist sect i may now add that another effect will beindeed has beento set up and endow the booth dynasty with unlimited control of the physical moral and financial resources of the sect mr booth is already a printer and publisher who it is plainly declared utilizes the officers of the 260 army as agents for advertising and selling his publications and some of them are so strongly impressed with the belief that active pushing of mr booths business is the best road to their masters favour that when the public obstinately refuse to purchase his papers they buy them themselves and send the proceeds to headquarters mr booth is also a retail trader on a large scale and the dean of wells has most seasonably drawn attention to the very notable banking project which he is trying to float any one who follows dean plumptres clear exposition of the principles of this financial operation can have little doubt that whether they are or are not adequate to the attainment of the first and second of mr booths ostensible objects they may be trusted to effect a wide extension of any kingdom in which worldly possessions are of no value we are in fact in sight of a financial catastrophe like that of law a century ago only it is the poor who will suffer  i have already occupied too much of your space and yet i have drawn upon only one of the sources of information about the inner working of the salvation army at my disposition far graver charges than any here dealt with are publicly brought in the others                     i am sir your obedient servant                                        t h huxley  261 ps i have just read mr buchanans letter in the times of today  mr buchanan is i believe an imaginative writer i am not acquainted with his works but nothing in the way of fiction he has yet achieved can well surpass his account of my opinions and of the purport of my writings                         iv  the times december 20th 1890  sirin discussing mr booths projects i have hitherto left in the background a distinction which must be kept well in sight by those who wish to form a fair judgment of the influence for good or evil of the salvation army salvationism the work of saving souls by revivalist methods is one thing boothism the utilization of the workers for the furtherance of mr  booths peculiar projects is another mr booth has captured and harnessed with sharp bits and effectual blinkers a multitude of ultraevangelical missionaries of the revivalist school who were wandering at large it is this skilfully if somewhat mercilessly driven team which has dragged the generals coachload of projects into their present position  262 looking then at the host of salvationists proper from the captains downwards to whom in my judgment the family hierarchy stands in the relation of the old man of the sea to sinbad as an independent entity i desire to say that the evidence before me whether hostile or friendly to the general and his schemes is distinctly favourable to them  it exhibits them as in the main poor uninstructed not unfrequently fanatical enthusiasts the purity of whose lives the sincerity of whose belief and the cheerfulness of whose endurance of privation and rough usage in what they consider a just cause command sincere respect for my part though i conceive the corybantic method of soulsaving to be full of dangers and though the theological speculations of these good people are to me wholly unacceptable yet i believe that the evils which must follow in the track of such errors as of all other errors will be largely outweighed by the moral and social improvement of the people whom they convert i would no more raise my voice against them so long as they abstain from annoying their neighbours than i would quarrel with a man vigorously sweeping out a stye on account of the shape of his broom or because he made a great noise over his work i have always had a strong faith in the principle of the injunction thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn if a kingdom is worth a mass as a great 263 ruler said surely the reign of clean living industry and thrift is worth any quantity of tambourines and eccentric doctrinal hypotheses all that i have hitherto said and propose further to say is directed against mr booths extremely clever audacious and hitherto successful attempt to utilize the credit won by all this honest devotion and selfsacrifice for the purposes of his socialistic autocracy  i now propose to bring forward a little more evidence as to how things really stand where mr booths system has had a fair trial i obtain it mainly from a curious pamphlet the title of which runs the new papacy  behind the scenes in the salvation army by an exstaff officer make not my fathers house a house of merchandise john ii 16 1889 published at toronto by a britnell on the cover it is stated that this is the book which was burned by the authorities of the salvation army i remind the reader once more that the statements which i shall cite must be regarded as ex parte all i can vouch for is that on grounds of internal evidence and from other concurrent testimony respecting the ways of the booth hierarchy i feel justified in using them  this is the picture the writer draws of the army in the early days of its invasion of the dominion of canada  264 then it will be remembered it professed to be the humble handmaid of the existing churches its professed object was the evangelization of the masses it repudiated the idea of building up a separate religious body and it denounced the practice of gathering together wealth and the accumulation of property men and women other than its own converts gathered around it and threw themselves heart and soul into the work for the simple reason that it offered as they supposed a more extended and widely open field for evangelical effort ministers everywhere were invited and welcomed to its platforms majors and colonels were few and far between and the supremacy and power of the general were things unknown     care was taken to avoid anything like proselytism its converts were never coerced into joining its ranks  in a word the organization occupied the position of an auxiliary mission and recruiting agency for the various religious bodies the meetings were crowded people professed conversion by the score the public liberally supplied the means to carry on the work in their respective communities therefore every corps was wholly selfsupporting its officers were properly if not luxuriously cared for the local expenditure was amply provided and under the supervision of the secretary a local member and the officer in charge the funds were disbursed in the towns where they were collected and the 265 spirit of satisfaction and confidence was mutual all around pp 4 5  such was the army as the green tree now for the dry  those who have been daily conversant with the armys machinery are well aware how entirely and radically the whole system has changed and how from a band of devoted and disinterested workers united in the bonds of zeal and charity for the good of their fellows it has developed into a colossal and aggressive agency for the building up of a system and a sect bound by rules and regulations altogether subversive of religious liberty and antagonistic to every other branch of christian endeavour and bound hand and foot to the will of one supreme head and ruler as the work has spread through the country and as the area of its endeavours has enlarged each leading position has been filled one after the other by individuals strangers to the country totally ignorant of the sentiments and idiosyncrasies of the canadian people trained in one school under the teachings and dominance of a member of the booth family and out of whom every idea has been crushed except that of unquestioning obedience to the general and the absolute necessity of going forward to his bidding without hesitation or question p 6  266 what is the result of all this in the first place whilst material prosperity has undoubtedly been attained spirituality has been quenched and as an evangelical agency the army has become almost a dead letter  in seventyfive per cent of its stations its officers suffer need and privation chiefly on account of the heavy taxation that is placed upon them to maintain an imposing headquarters and a large ornamental staff the whole financial arrangements are carried on by a system of inflation and a handtomouth extravagance and blindness as to future contingencies nearly all of its original workers and members have disappeared p 7 in reference to the religious bodies at large the army has become entirely antagonistic soldiers are forbidden by its rules to attend other places of worship without the permission of their officers  officers or soldiers who may conscientiously leave the service or the ranks are looked upon and often denounced publicly as backsliders  means of the most despicable description have been resorted to in order to starve them back to the service p 8 in its inner workings the army system is identical with jesuitism  that the end justifies the means if not openly taught is as tacitly agreed as in that celebrated order p 9  surely a bitter overcharged anonymous libel is the reflection which will occur to many who read 267 these passages especially the last well i turn to other evidence which at any rate is not anonymous it is contained in a pamphlet entitled general booth the family and the salvation army showing its rise progress and moral and spiritual decline by s h  hodges llb late major in the army and formerly private secretary to general booth manchester 1890 i recommend potential contributors to mr  booths wealth to study this little work also i have learned a great deal from it among other interesting novelties it tells me that mr booth has discovered the necessity of a third step or blessing in the work of salvation he said to me one day hodges you have only two barrels to your gun i have three p 31 and if mr hodgess description of this third barrel is correctgiving up your conscience and for god and the army stooping to do things which even honourable worldly men would not consent to do p 32it is surely calculated to bring down a good many things the first principles of morality among them  mr hodges gives some remarkable examples of the army practice with the generals new rifle but i must refer the curious to his instructive pamphlet the position i am about to take up is a serious one and i prefer to fortify it by the help of evidence which though some of it may be anonymous cannot be sneered away and i shall 268 be believed when i say that nothing but a sense of the great social danger of the spread of boothism could induce me to revive a scandal even though it is barely entitled to the benefit of the statute of limitations  on the 7th of july 1883 you sir did the public a great service by writing a leading article on the notorious eagle case from which i take the following extract  mr justice kay refused the application but he was induced to refuse it by means which as mr justice stephen justly remarked were highly discreditable to mr booth mr booth filed an affidavit which appears totally to have misled mr justice kay as it would have misled any one who regarded it as a frank and honest statement by a professed teacher of religion  when i addressed my first letter to you i had never so much as heard of the eagle scandal but i am thankful that my perception of the inevitable tendency of all religious autocracies towards evil was clear enough to bring about a provisional condemnation of mr booths schemes in my mind  supposing that i had decided the other way with what sort of feeling should i have faced my friend when i had to confess that the money had passed into the absolute control of a person about the character of whose administration this 269 concurrence of damnatory evidence was already extant  i have nothing to say about mr booth personally for i know nothing on that subject as on several others i profess myself an agnostic but if he is as he may be a saint actuated by the purest of motives he is not the first saint who as you have said has shown himself in the ardour of prosecuting a wellmeant object to be capable of overlooking the plain maxims of everyday morality if i were a salvationist soldier i should cry with othello cassio i love thee but never more be officer of mine                 i am sir your obedient servant                                    t h huxley                           v  the times december 24th 1890  sirif i have any strong points finance is certainly not one of them but the financial or rather fiscal operations of the general of the salvation army as they are set forth and exemplified in the new papacy possess that grand simplicity which is the mark of genius 270 and even i can comprehend themor to be more modest i can portray them in such a manner that every lineament however harsh and every shade however dark can be verified by published evidence  suppose there is a thriving expanding colonial town and that scattered among its artisans and labourers there is a sprinkling of methodists or other such ultraevangelical good people doing their best in a quiet way to save souls clearly this is an outpost which it is desirable to capture we therefore take measures to get up a salvation boom of the ordinary pattern enthusiasm is roused a score or two of soldiers are enlisted into the ranks of the salvation army we select the man who promises to serve our purposes best make a captain of him and put him in command of the corps he is very pleased and grateful and indeed he ought to be all he has done is that he has given up his trade that he has promised to work at least nine hours a day in our service none of your eighthour nonsense for us as collector bookseller general agent and anything else we may order him to be we on the other hand guarantee him nothing whatever to do so might weaken his faith and substitute worldly for spiritual ties between us knowing that if he exerts himself in a right spirit his labours will surely be blessed we content ourselves with telling him that if after all 271 expenses are paid and our demands are satisfied each week 25s remains he may take it and if nothing remains he may take that and stay his stomach with what the faithful may give him  with a certain grim playfulness we add that the value of these contributions will be reckoned as so much salary so long as our captain is successful therefore a beneficent spring of cash trickles unseen into our treasury when it begins to dry up we say god bless you dear boy turn him adrift with or without 2s 4d in his pocket and put some other willing horse in the shafts  the general i believe proposes among other things to do away with sweating may he not as well set a good example by beginning at home my little sketch however looks so like a monstrous caricature that after all i must produce the original from the pages of my canadian authority he says that a captain has to pay 10 per cent of all collections and donations to the divisional fund for the support of his divisional officer who has also the privilege of arranging for such special meetings as he shall think fit the proceeds of which he takes away for the general needs of the division headquarters too has the right to hold such special meetings at the corps and send around such special attractions as its wisdom sees fit and to take away the proceeds for the purposes it decides upon  272 he has to pay the rent of his building either to headquarters or a private individual he has to send the whole collection of the afternoon meeting of the first sunday in the month to the extension fund at headquarters he has to pay for the heating lighting and cleaning of his hall together with such necessary repairs as may be needed he has to provide the food lodging and clothing of his cadet if he has one headquarters taxes him with so many copies of the army papers each week for which he has to pay sold or unsold and when he has done this he may take 6 or 5 being a woman or such proportion of it as may be left with which to clothe and feed himself and to pay the rent and provide for the heating and lighting of his quarters if he has a lieutenant he has to pay him 6 per week or such proportion of it as he himself gets and share the house expenses with him now it will be easily understood that at least 60 per cent of the stations in canada the officer gets no money at all and he has to beg specially amongst his people for his houserent and food there are few places in the dominion in which the soldiers do not find their officers in all the food they need but it must be remembered that the value of the food so received has to be accounted for at headquarters and entered upon the books of the corps as cash received the amount being deducted from any moneys that the officer is able to take from the 273 weeks collections so that no matter how much may be specially given the officer cannot receive more than the value of 6 per week the officer cannot collect any arrears of salary as each week has to pay its own expenses and if there is any surplus cash after all demands are met it must be sent to the war chest at headquartersthe new papacy pp 35 36  evidently sir headquarters has taken to heart the injunction about casting your bread upon the waters it casts the crumb of a day or twos work of an emissary and gets back any quantity of loaves of cash so long as captains present themselves to be used up and replaced by new victims  what can be said of these devoted poor fellows except o sancta simplicitas  but it would be a great mistake to suppose that the moneygathering efficacy of mr booths fiscal agencies is exhausted by the foregoing enumeration of their regular operations consider the following edifying history of the rescue home in toronto  it is a fine building in the heart of the city the lot cost 7000 and a building was put up at a cost of 7000 more and there is a mortgage on it amounting to half the cost of the whole the land today would probably fetch double its original price and every year enhances its valuein the first five months of its 274 existence this institution received from the public an income of 1812 70c out of this 600 was paid to headquarters for rent 590 52c was spent upon the building in various ways and the balance of 622 18c paid the salaries of the staff and supported the inmates pp 24 25  said i not truly that mr booths fisc bears the stamp of genius who else could have got the public to buy him a corner lot put a building upon it pay all its working expenses and then not content with paying him a heavy rent for the use of the handsome present they had made him they say not a word against his mortgaging it to half its value and so far as any one knows there is nothing to stop headquarters from selling the whole estate tomorrow and using the money as the general may direct  once more listen to the author of the new papacy who affirms that out of the funds given by the dominion for the evangelization of the people by means of the salvation army one sixth had been spent in the extension of the kingdom of god and the other five sixths had been invested in valuable property all handed over to mr booth and his heirs and assigns as we have already stated p 26  and this brings me to the last point upon which i wish to touch the answer to all inquiries as to what has become of the enormous 275 personal and real estate which has been given over to mr booth is that it is held in trust the supporters of mr booth may feel justified in taking that statement on trust i do not anyhow the more completely satisfactory this trust is the less can any man who asks the public to put blind faith in his integrity and his wisdom object to acquaint them exactly with its provisions is the trust drawn up in favour of the salvation army but what is the legal status of the salvation army have the soldiers any claim  certainly not have the officers any legal interest in the trust surely not the general has taken good care to insist on their renouncing all claims as a condition of their appointment thus to all appearance the army as a legal person is identical with mr booth and in that case any trust ostensibly for the benefit of the army iswhat shall we say that is at once accurate and polite  i conclude with these plain questionswill mr booth take counsels opinion as to whether there is anything in such legal arrangements as he has at present made which prevents him from disposing of the wealth he has accumulated at his own will and pleasure will anybody be in a position to set either the civil or the criminal law in motion against him or his successors if he or they choose to spend every farthing in ways very different from those contemplated by the donors  276 i may add that a careful study of the terms of a declaration of trust by william booth in favour of the christian mission made in 1878 has not enabled persons of much greater competence than myself to answer these questions satisfactorily                   i am sir your obedient servant                                      t h huxley       see preface to this volume pp ixxiii  on december 24th a letter appeared in the times signed j s trotter in which the following passages appear  it seems a pity to put a damper on the spirits of those who agree with professor huxley in his denunciation of general booth and all his works may i give a few particulars as to the book which was published in canada i had the pleasure of an interview with the author of a book written in canada the book was printed at toronto and two copies only struck off by the printers one of these copies was stolen from the printer and the quotation sent to you by professor huxley was inserted in the book and is consequently a forgery the book was published without the consent and against the will of the author  277 so the quotation is not only a bitter overcharged anonymous libel as professor huxley intimates but a forgery as well as to mr hodges it seems to me to be simply trifling with your readers to bring him in as an authority he was turned out of the army out of kindness taken on again and again dismissed if this had happened to one of your staff would his opinion of the times as a newspaper be taken for gospel  but in the times of december 29th mr j s trotter writes  i find i was mistaken in saying in my letter of wednesday to the times that mr hodges was dismissed from the service of general booth and regret any inconvenience the statement may have caused to mr hodges  and on december 30th the times published a letter from mr hodges in which he says that mr trotters statements as they regard himself are the very reverse of truthi was never turned out of the salvation army nor so far as i was made acquainted with general booths motives was i taken on again out of kindness in order to rejoin the salvation army i resigned the position of manager in a mill where i was in 278 receipt of a salary of pounds 250 per annum with houserent and one third of the profits instead of this mr booth allowed me pounds 2 per week and houserent                     vi  the times december 26th 1890  siri am much obliged to mr j s trotter for the letter which you published this morning it furnishes evidence which i much desired to possess on the following points     1 the author of the new papacy is a responsible trustworthy person otherwise mr trotter would not speak of having had the pleasure of an interview with him     2 after this responsible person had taken the trouble to write a pamphlet of sixtyfour closely printed pages some influence was brought to bear upon him the effect of which was that he refused his consent to its publication mr trotters excellent information will surely enable him to tell us what influence that was     3 how does mr trotter know that any passage i have quoted is an interpolation does he possess that other copy of the two which alone as he affirms were printed  279 4 if so he will be able to say which of the passages i have cited is genuine and which is not and whether the tenor of the whole uninterpolated copy differs in any important respect from that of the copy i have quoted  it will be interesting to hear what mr j s trotter has to say upon these points but the really important thing which he has done is that he has testified of his own knowledge that the anonymous author of the new papacy is no mere irresponsible libeller but a person of whom even an ardent salvationist has to speak with respect              i am sir your obedient servant                                 t h huxley  i may add that the unfortunate mr trotter did me the further service of eliciting the letter from mr hodges referred to on p 277which sufficiently establishes that gentlemans credit and leads me to attach full weight to his evidence about the third barrel       january 1891  280                     vii  the times december 27th 1890  sirin making use of the only evidence of the actual working of mr booths autocratic government accessible to me i was fully aware of the slippery nature of the ground upon which i was treading for as i pointed out in my first letter no personal habit more surely degrades the conscience and the intellect than blind and unhesitating obedience to unlimited authority now we have it on mr booths own showing that every officer of his has undertaken to obey without questioning or gainsaying the orders from headquarters and the possible relations of such orders to honour and veracity are demonstrated not only by the judicial deliverance on mr booths affidavit in the eagle case which i have already cited not only by mr bramwell booths admission before mr justice lopes that he had stated what was not quite correct because he had promised mr stead not to divulge the facts of the case the times november 4th 1885 but by the following passage in mr hodgess account of the reasons of his withdrawal from the salvation army  the general and chief did not and could 281 not deny doing these things the only question was this was it right to practise this deception these points of difference were fully discussed between myself and the chief of the staff on my withdrawal especially the leamington incident which was the one that finally drove me to decision i had come to the conclusion from the first that they had acted as they supposed with a single eye to the good of gods cause and had persuaded myself that the things were as against the devil right to be done that as in battle one party captured and turned the enemys own guns upon them so as they were fighting against the devil it would be fair to use against him his weapons and i wrote to this effect to the general p 63  now i do not wish to say anything needlessly harsh but i ask any prudent man these questions could i under these circumstances trust any uncorroborated statement emanating from headquarters or made by the generals order had i any reason to doubt the truth of mr hodgess naive confession of the corrupting influence of mr booths system and did it not behove me to pick my way carefully through the mass of statements before me many of them due to people whose moral sense might by possibility have been as much blunted by the army discipline in the 282 use of the weapons of the devil as mr hodges affirms that his was  therefore in my third letter i commenced my illustrations of the practical working of boothism with the evidence of mr redstone fortified and supplemented by that of a nonsalvationist dr cunningham geikie that testimony has not been challenged and until it is i shall assume that it cannot be in my fourth letter i cited a definite statement by mr hodges in evidence of the jesuitical principles of headquarters what sort of answer is it to tell us that mr hodges was dismissed the army a child might expect that some such red herring would be drawn across the trail and in anticipation of the stale trick i added the strong prima facie evidence of the trustworthiness of my witness in this particular which is afforded by the eagle case it was not until i wrote my fourth letter to you siruntil the exploitation of the captains and the jesuitry of headquarters could be proved up to the hiltthat i ventured to have recourse to the new papacy so far as the pamphlet itself goes this is an anonymous work and for sufficient reasons i did not choose to go beyond what was to be found between its covers to any one accustomed to deal with the facts of evolution the boothism of the new papacy was merely the natural and necessary development of the boothism of mr redstones case and of the 283 eagle case therefore i felt fully justified in using it at the same time carefully warning my readers that it must be taken with due caution  mr trotters useful letter admits that such a book was written by a person with whom he had the pleasure of an interview and that a version of it interpolated according to his assertion was published against the will of the author hence i am justified in believing that there is a foundation of truth in certain statements some of which have long been in my possession but which for lack of mr trotters valuable corroboration i have refrained from using the time is come when i can set forth some of the heads of this information with the request that mr trotter who knows all about the business will be so good as to point out any error that there may be in them i am bound to suppose that his sole object like mine is the elucidation of the truth and to assume his willingness to help me therein to the best of his ability     1 the author of the new papacy is a mr sumner a person of perfect respectability and greatly esteemed in toronto who held a high position in the army when he left a large public meeting presided over by a popular methodist minister passed a vote of sympathy with him  284 is this true or false     2 on saturday last about noon mr sumner the author of the book and mr fred perry the salvation army printer accompanied by a lawyer went down to messrs imrie and grahams establishment and asked for all the manuscript stereotype plates c of the book mr sumner explained that the book had been sold to the army and on a cheque for the amount due being given the printing material was delivered up  did these paragraphs appear in the toronto telegram of april 24th 1889 or did they not are the statements they contain true or false  3 public interest in the fate or probable outcome of that mysterious book called the new papacy or behind the scenes in the salvation army continues unabated though the line of proceedings by the publisher and his solicitor mr smoke of watson thorne smoke and masten has not been altered since yesterday the book no doubt will be issued in some form so far as known only one complete copy remains and the whereabouts of this is a secret which will be profoundly kept it is safe to say that if the commissioner kept on guessing until the next anniversary he would not strike the secluded 285 location of the one volume among five thousand which escaped when he and his assistant mr fred perry believed they had cast every vestige of the forbidden work into the fiery furnace on tuesday last when the discovery was made that a copy of the new papacy was in existence publisher britnell of yonge street was at once the suspected holder and in a short time his bookstore was the resort of army agents sent to reconnoitre toronto news april 28th 1889  is this a forgery or is it not is it in substance true or false  when mr trotter has answered these inquiries categorically we may proceed to discuss the question of interpolations in mr sumners book            i am sir your obedient servant                               t h huxley  on the 26th of december a letter signed j t cunningham late fellow of university college oxford called forth the following commentary  286                    viii  the times december 29th 1890  sirif mr cunningham doubts the efficacy of the struggle for existence as a factor in social conditions he should find fault with mr booth and not with me  i am labouring under no delusion as to the possibility of inaugurating the millennium by my social specific in the struggle of life the weakest will go to the wall and there are so many weak the fittest in tooth and claw will survive all that we can do is to soften the lot of the unfit and make their suffering less horrible than it is at present in darkest england p 44  that is what mr cunningham would have found if he had read mr booths book with attention and if he will bestow equal pains on my second letter he will discover that he has interpolated the word wilfully in his statement of my argument which runs thus shutting his eyes to the necessary consequences of the struggle for life the existence of which he admits as fully as any darwinian mr booth tells men whose evil case is one of those consequences that envy is a cornerstone of our competitive system mr  287 cunninghams physiological studies will have informed him that the process of shutting the eyes in the literal sense of the words is not always wilful and i propose to illustrate by the crucial instance his own letter furnishes that the shutting of the eyes of the mind to the obvious consequences of accepted propositions may also be involuntary at least i hope so     1 sooner or later says mr cunningham the population problem will block the way once more what does this mean except that multiplication excessive in relation to the contemporaneous means of support will create a severe competition for those means and this seems to me to be a pretty accurate reflection of the conceptions of malthus and the other poor benighted folks of a past generation at whom mr cunningham sneers     2 by way of leaving no doubt upon this subject mr cunningham further tells us the struggle for existence is always going on of course let us thank darwin for making us realize it it is pleasant to meet with a little gratitude to darwin among the epigoni who are squabbling over the heritage he conquered for them but mr cunninghams personal expression of that feeling is hasty for it is obvious that he has not realized the significance of darwins teachingindeed i fail to discover in mr  cunninghams letter any sign that he has even realized what 288 he would be at if the struggle for existence is always going on and if as i suppose will be granted industrial competition is one phase of that struggle i fail to see how my conclusion that it is sheer wickedness to tell ignorant men that envy is a cornerstone of competition can be disputed  mr cunningham has followed the lead of that polished and instructed person mr ben tillett in rebuking me for as the associates say attacking mr  booths personal character of course when i was writing i did not doubt that this very handy though not too clean weapon would be used by one or other of mr booths supporters and my action was finally decided by the following considerations i happen to be a member of one of the largest life insurance societies there is a vacancy in the directory at present for which half a dozen gentlemen are candidates now i said to myself supposing that one of these gentlemen whose pardon i humbly beg for starting the hypothesis say mr a in his administrative capacity and as a man of business has been the subject of such observations as a judge on the bench bestowed upon mr booth is he a person for whom i can properly vote and if i find when i go to the meeting of the policyholders that most of them know nothing of this and other evidences of what by the mildest judgment must be termed mr as unfitness for administrative 289 responsibilities am i to let them remain in their ignorance i leave the answer and its application to men of sense and integrity  the mention of mr cunninghams ally reminds me that i have omitted to thank mr tillett for his very useful and instructive letter and i hasten to repair a neglect which i assure mr tillett was more apparent than real mr  tilletts letter is dated december 20th on the 21st the following pregnant however unconscious commentary upon it appeared in reynoldss newspaper  i have always maintained that the salvation army is one of the mightiest socialistic agencies in the country and now professor huxley comes in to confirm that view how could it be otherwise the fantastic religious side of salvationism will disappear in the course of time and what will be left  a large number of men and women who have been organized disciplined and taught to look for something better than their present condition and who have become public speakers and not afraid of ridicule there you have the raw materials for a socialist army  mr ben tillett evidently knows latin enough to construe proximus ardet  i trust that the public will not allow themselves to be led away by the false issues which are 290 dangled before them a man really may love his fellowmen cherish any form of christianity he pleases and hold not only that darwinism is tottering to its fall but if he pleases the equally sane belief that it never existed and yet may feel it his duty to oppose to the best of his capacity despotic socialism in all its forms and more particularly in its boothian disguise               i am sir your obedient servant                                  th huxley  persons who have not had the advantage of a classical education might fairly complain of my use of the word epigoni to say truth i had been reading droysens geschichte des hellenismus and the familiar historical title slipped out unawares in replying to me however the late fellow of university college oxford declares he had to look the word out in a lexicon i commend the fact to the notice of the combatants over the desirability of retaining the present compulsory modicum of greek in our universities  291                     ix  the times december 30th 1890  siri am much obliged to messrs ranger burton and matthews for their prompt answer to my questions i presume it applies to all money collected by the agency of the salvation army though not specifically given for the purposes of the christian mission named in the deed of 1878 to all sums raised by mortgage upon houses and land so given and further to funds subscribed for mr booths various projects which have no apparent reference to the objects of the christian mission as defined in the deed  otherwise to use a phrase which has become classical it does not assist us much but i must leave these points to persons learned in the law  and indeed with many thanks to you sir for the amount of valuable space which you have allowed me to occupy i now propose to leave the whole subject my sole purpose in embarking upon an enterprise which was extremely distasteful to me was to prevent the skilful general or rather generals who devised the plan of campaign from sweeping all before them with a rush i found the pass already held by such stout defenders as mr  loch and the dean 292 of wells and with your powerful help we have given time for the reinforcements sure to be sent by the abundant though somewhat slowly acting common sense of our countrymen to come up  i can no longer be useful and i return to more congenial occupations          i am sir your obedient servant                             t h huxley  the following letter appeared in the times of january 2nd 1891  dear mr tilletti have not had patience to read professor huxleys letters the existence of hunger nakedness misery death from insufficient food even of starvation is certain and no agency as yet reaches it how can any man hinder or discourage the giving of food or help  why is the house called a workhouse because it is for those who cannot work no because it was the house to give work or bread the very name is an argument i am very sure what our lord and his apostles would do if they were in london let us be thankful even to have a will to do the same  yours faithfully henry e card manning  293                       x  the times january 3rd 1891  sirin my old favourite the arabian nights the motive of the whole series of delightful narratives is that the sultan who refuses to attend to reason can be got to listen to a story may i try whether cardinal manning is to be reached in the same way when i was attending the meeting of the british association in belfast nearly forty years ago i had promised to breakfast with the eminent scholar dr hincks having been up very late the previous night i was behind time so hailing an outside car i said to the driver as i jumped on now drive fast i am in a hurry whereupon he whipped up his horse and set off at a handgallop nearly jerked off my seat i shouted my good friend do you know where i want to go no yer honner said the driver but any way i am driving fast i have never forgotten this objectlesson in the dangers of illregulated enthusiasm we are all invited to jump on to the salvation army car which mr booth is undoubtedly driving very fast some of us have a firm conviction not only that he is taking a very different direction from that in which we wish to go but that before long car and driver will come to grief are we to accept 294 the invitation even at the bidding of the eminent person who appears to think himself entitled to pledge the credit of our lord and his apostles in favour of boothism     i am sir your obedient servant                        t h huxley                    xi  the times january 13th 1891  sira letter from mr boothclibborn dated january 3rd appeared in the times of yesterday this elaborate document occupies three columns of small printspace enough assuredly for an effectual reply to the seven letters of mine to which the writer refers if any such were forthcoming  mr boothclibborn signs himself commissioner of the salvation army for france and switzerland but he says that he accepts my challenge without the knowledge of his chiefs considering the selfdamaging character of his letter it was perhaps hardly necessary to make that statement  mr commissioner boothclibborn speaks of my challenge i presume that he refers to my request for information about the authorship and fate of the new papacy in the letter 295 published in the times on december 27th 1890 the commissioner deals with this matter in paragraph no 4 of his letter and i observe with no little satisfaction that he does not venture to controvert any one of the statements of my witnesses he tacitly admits that the author of the new papacy was a person greatly esteemed in toronto and that he held a high position in the army further that the canadian commissioner thought it worth while to pay the printers bill in order that the copies already printed off might be destroyed and the pamphlet effectually suppressed thus the essential facts of the case are admitted and established beyond question  how does mr boothclibborn try to explain them away  mr sumner who wrote the little book in a hot fit soon regretted it as any man would do whose conscience showed him in a calmer moment when his respectability returned with his repentance that he had grossly misrepresented and just before it appeared offered to order its suppression if the army would pay the costs already incurred and which he was unable to bear  the new papacy fills sixty closely printed duodecimo pages it is carefully written and for the most part in studiously moderate language moreover it contains many precise details and 296 figures the ascertainment of which must have taken much time and trouble yet forsooth it was written in a hot fit  i sincerely hope for the sake of his own credit that mr commissioner boothclibborn does not know as much about this melancholy business as i do  my hands are unfortunately tied and i am not at liberty to use all the information in my possession i must content myself with quoting the following passage from the preface to the new papacy  it has not been without considerable thought and a good deal of urging that the following pages have been given to the public but though we would have shrunk from a labour so distasteful and have gladly avoided a notoriety anything but pleasant to the feelings or conducive to our material welfare we have felt that in the interests of the benevolent public in the interests of religion in the interests of a band of devoted men and women whose personal ends are being defeated and the fruit of whose labour is being destroyed and above all in the interests of that future which lies before the salvation army itself if purged and purified in its executive and returned to its original position in the ranks of canadian christian effort it is no more than our duty to throw such light as we are able upon its true inwardness and with that object and for the 297 furtherance of those ends we offer our pages to the public view  the preface is dated april 1889 according to the statement in the toronto telegram which mr commissioner boothclibborn does not dare to dispute his canadian fellowcommissioner bought and destroyed the whole edition of the new papacy about the end of the third week in april it is clear that the writer of the paragraph quoted from the preface was well out of a hot fit if he had ever been in one while he had not entered on the stage of repentance within three weeks of that time mr commissioner boothclibborns scandalous insinuations that mr sumner was bribed by a few sovereigns and that he was bought off in the face of his own admission that mr sumner offered to order its suppression if the army would pay the costs already incurred and which he was unable to bear is a crucial example of that jesuitry with which the officials of the army have been so frequently charged  mr commissioner boothclibborn says that when london headquarters heard of the affair it disapproved of the action of the commissioner that circumstance indicates that headquarters is not wholly devoid of intelligence but it has nothing to do with the value of mr sumners evidence which is all i am concerned about very likely london headquarters will disapprove of its french 298 commissioners present action but what then the upshot of all this is that mr boothclibborn has made as great a blunder as simple mr trotter did the pair of balaams greatly desired to curse but have been compelled to bless they have between them completely justified my reliance on mr sumner as a perfectly trustworthy witness and neither of them has dared to challenge the accuracy of one solitary statement made by that worthy gentleman whose full story i hope some day or other to see set before the public then the true causes of his action will be made known  paragraph 2 of the commissioners letter says many things but not much about mr hodges the columns of the times recently showed that mr hodges was able to compel an apology from mr trotter i leave it to him to deal with the commissioner  as to the eagle case treated of in paragraph no 3 a gentleman well versed in the law who was in court during the hearing of the appeal has assured me that the argument was purely technical that the facts were very slightly gone into and that so far as he knows no dissenting comment was made on the strictures of the judge before whom the case first came  moreover in the judgment of the master of the rolls fully recorded in the times of february 14th 1884 the following passages occur  299 the case had been heard by a learned judge who had exercised his discretion upon it and the court would not interfere with his discretion unless they could see that he was wrong the learned judge had taken a strong view of the conduct of the defendant but nevertheless had said that he would have given relief if he could have seen how far protection and compensation could be given and if this court differed from him in that view and could give relief without forfeiture they would be acting on his own principle in doing so certain suggestions had been made with that view and the court had to consider the case under all the circumstances he himself the master of the rolls considered that it was probable the defendant with his principles had intended to destroy the property as a publichouse and that it was not right thus to take property under a covenant to keep it up as a publichouse intending to destroy it as such  he did not however think this was enough to deprive him of all relief the defendant could only expect severe terms  yet sir mr commissioner boothclibborn this high official of the salvation army has the audacity to tell the public that if i had made inquiries i should have found that in the court of appeal the judge reversed the decision of his predecessor as regards seven eighths of the property and the general was declared to have acted 300 all along with straight forwardness and good faith  but the nature of mr commissioner boothclibborns conceptions of straightforwardness and good faith is so marvellously illustrated by the portions of his letter with which i have dealt that i doubt not his statements are quite up to the level of the army regulations and instructions in regard to those cardinal virtues as i pointed out must be the case the slave is subdued to that he works in  for myself i must confess that the process of wading through mr commissioners verbose and clumsy pleadings has given me a hot fit which i undertake to say will be followed by not so much as a passing shiver of repentance and it is under the influence of the genial warmth diffused through the frame on one of those rare occasions when one may be angry and sin not that i infringe my resolution to trouble you with no more letters on reflection i am convinced that it is undesirable that the public should be misled for even a few days by misrepresentations so serious  i am copiously abused for speaking of the jesuitical methods of the superior officials of the salvation army but the following facts have not been and i believe cannot be denied     1 mr booths conduct in the eagle case has been censured by two of the judges  301 2 mr bramwell booth admitted before mr justice lopes that he had made an untrue statement because of a promise he had made to mr stead       this statement has been disputed but not yet publicly see p 305  and i have just proved that mr commissioner boothclibborn asserts the exact contrary of that which your report of the judgment of the master of the rolls tells us that distinguished judge said  under these circumstances i think that my politeness in applying no harder adjective than jesuitical to these proceedings is not properly appreciated        i am sir your obedient servant                           t h huxley                    xii  the times january 22nd 1891  siri think that your readers will be interested in the accompanying opinion written in consultation with an eminent chancery queens counsel with which i have been favoured it will be observed that this important legal deliverance 302 justifies much stronger language than any which i have applied to the only security  for the proper administration of the funds in mr booths hands which appears to be in existence  i am sir your obedient servant                            t h huxley         1 dr johnsons buildings temple ec                   january 14 1891  mr booths declaration of trust deed 1878  i am of opinion subject to the question whether there may be any provision in the charitable trusts acts which can be made available for enforcing some scheme for the appropriation of the property and with regard to the real and leasehold properties whether the conveyances and leases are not altogether void as frauds on the mortmain acts that nothing can be done to control or to interfere with booth in the disposition or application of the properties or moneys purported to be affected by the deed  as to the properties vested in booth himself it appears to me that such are placed absolutely under his power and control both as to the disposal and application thereof and that there are no trusts for any specific purposes declared which 303 could be enforced and that there are no defined persons nor classes of persons who can claim to be entitled to the benefits of them or at whose instance they could be enforced by any legal process  as to the properties if any vested in trustees appointed by booth it appears to me that the only person who has a locus standi to enforce these trusts is booth himself and that he would have absolute power over the trusts and the property and might deal with the property as he pleased and that as in the former case nothing could be done in the way of enforcing any trusts against him  as to the moneys contributed or raised by mortgage for the general purposes of the mission it appears to me that booth may expend them as he pleases without being subject to any legal control and that he cannot even be compelled to publish any balancesheets  whether there are any provisions in the charitable trusts acts which could be made available for enforcing some scheme for the application of the property or funds is a question to which i should require to give a closer consideration should it become necessary to go into it but at present after perusing these acts and especially 16 and 17 vict c 137 and 18 and 19 vict c 124 i cannot see how they could be made applicable to the trusts as declared in this deed  304 as to the mortmain acts the matter is clearly charitable and unless in the conveyances and leases to booth or to the trustees if any named by him all the provisions of the acts have been complied with and the deeds have been enrolled under the acts they would be void it is probable however that every conveyance and lease has been taken without disclosing any charitable trust for the purpose of preventing it from being void on the face of it it is to be noted that the deed is a mere deed poll by booth himself without any other party to it who as a contracting party would have a right to enforce it  whether there are any objects of the trust i cannot say if there is as the recital indicates a society of enrolled members called the christian mission those members would be objects of the trust but then it appears to me booth has entire control and determination of the application and as to the trusts enuring for the benefit of the salvation army i am not aware what is the constitution of the salvation army but there is no reference whatever to any such body in the deed i have understood the army as being merely the missionaries and not the society of worshippers  if there is no christian mission society of enrolled members then there are no objects of the trust the trusts are purely religious and trading is entirely beyond its purposes booth can 305 give away the property simply because there is no one who has any right to prevent his doing so  ernest hatton  it is probably my want of legal knowledge which prevents me from appreciating the value of the professed corrections of mr hattons opinion contained in the letters of messrs ranger burton and matthews times january 28th and 29th 1891  the note on page 301 refers to a correspondence incomplete at the time fixed for the publication of my pamphlet the nature of which is sufficiently indicated by the subjoined extracts from mr steads letter in the times of january 20th and from my reply in the times of january 24th referring to the paragraphs numbered 1 2 at the end of my letter xi mr stead says  on reading this i at once wrote to professor huxley stating that as he had mentioned my name i was justified in intervening to explain that so far as the second count in his indictment wentfor the eagle dispute is no concern of minehe had been misled by an error in the reports of the case which appeared in the daily papers 306 of november 4 1885 i have his reply today saying that i had better write to you direct may i ask you then seeing that my name has been brought into the affair to state that as i was in the dock when mr bramwell booth was in the witnessbox i am in a position to give the most unqualified denial to the statement as to the alleged admission on his part of falsehood nothing was heard in court of any such admission neither the prosecuting counsel nor the judge who tried the case ever referred to it although it would obviously have had a direct bearing on the credit of the witness and the jury by acquitting mr  bramwell booth showed that they believed him to be a witness of truth but fortunately the facts can be verified beyond all gainsaying by a reference to the official shorthandwriters report of the evidence during the hearing of the case for the prosecution inspector borner was interrupted by the judge who said  i want to ask you a question during the whole of that conversation did booth in any way suggest that that child had been sold borner replied  not at that interview my lord  it was to this that mr bramwell booth referred when after examination crossexamination 307 and reexamination during which no suggestion had been made that he had ever made the untrue statement now alleged against him he asked and received leave from the judge to make the following explanation which i quote from the official report  will you allow me to explain a matter mentioned yesterday in reference to a question asked by your lordship some days ago with respect to one matter connected with my conduct your lordship asked i think it was inspector borner whether i had said to him at either of our interviews that the child was sold by her parents and he replied no that is quite correct i did not say so to him and what i wish to say now is that i had been specially requested by mr stead and had given him a promise that i would not under any circumstances divulge the fact of that sale to any person which would ma ke it at all probable that any trouble would be brought upon the persons who had taken part in this investigation central criminal court reports vol  cii part 612 pp 10356  in the daily papers of the following day this statement was misreported as follows  i wish to explain in regard to your lordships condemnation of my having said no to 308 inspector borner when he asked me whether the child had been sold by her parentsthe reason why i stated what was not correct was that i had promised mr stead not to divulge the fact of the sale to any person which would make it probable that any trouble should be brought on persons taking part in this proceeding  hence the mistake into which professor huxley has unwittingly fallen  i may add that so far from the statement never having been challenged for five years it was denounced as a remarkably striking lie in the war cry of november 14th and again the same official organ of the salvation army of november 18th specifically adduced this misreport as an instance of the most disgraceful way in which the reports of the trial were garbled by some of the papers what then becomes of one of the two main pillars of professor huxleys argument  in my reply i point out that on the 10th of january mr stead addressed to me a letter which commences thus i see in the times of this morning that you are about to republish your letters on booths book  i replied to this letter on the 12th of january  309 dear mr steadi charge mr bramwell booth with nothing i simply quote the times report the accuracy of which so far as i know has never been challenged by mr booth i say i quote the times and not mr hodges because i took some pains about the verification of mr hodgess citation       this is a slip of the pen mr hodges had nothing to do     with the citation of which i made use  i should have thought it rather appertained to mr bramwell booth to contradict a statement which refers not to what you heard but to what he said however i am the last person to wish to give circulation to a story which may not be quite correct and i will take care if you have no objection your letter is marked private to make public as much of your letter as relates to the point to which you have called my attention             i am yours very faithfully                           t h huxley  to this mr stead answered under date of january 13th 1891  dear professor huxleyi thank you for your letter of the 12th inst i am quite sure you would not wish to do any injustice in this matter but instead of publishing any extract from my letter might i ask you to read the passage as it 310 appears in the verbatim report of the trial which was printed day by day and used by counsel on both sides and by the judge during the case i had hoped to have got you a copy today but find that i was too late i shall have it first thing tomorrow morning you will find that it is quite clear and conclusively disposes of the alleged admission of untruthfulness again thanking you for your courtesy             i am yours faithfully                       w t stead  thus it appears that the letter which mr stead wrote to me on the 13th of january does not contain one word of that which he ways it contains in the statement which appears in the times today moreover the letter of mine to which mr stead refers in his first communication to me is not the letter which appeared on the 13th as he states but that which you published on december 27th 1890 therefore it is not true that mr stead wrote at once on the contrary he allowed nearly a fortnight to elapse before he addressed me on the 10th of january 1891 furthermore mr stead suppresses the fact that since the 13th of january he has had in his possession my offer to publish his version of the story and he leads the reader to suppose that my only answer was that he had better write to 311 you direct all the while mr stead knows perfectly well that i was withheld from making public use of his letter of the 10th by nothing but my scruples about using a document which was marked private and that he did not give me leave to quote his letter of the 10th of january until after he had written that which appeared yesterday  and i add  as to the subjectmatter of mr steads letter the point which he wishes to prove appears to be thisthat mr bramwell booth did not make a false statement but that he withheld from the officers of justice pursuing a most serious criminal inquiry a fact of grave importance which lay within his own knowledge and this because he had promised mr stead to keep the fact secret in short mr bramwell booth did not say what was wrong but he did what was wrong  i will take care to give every weight to the correction most people i think will consider that one of the main pillars of my argument as mr  stead is pleased to call them has become very much strengthened  312          legal opinions respecting          general booths acts  in referring to the course of action adopted by general booth and mr  bramwell booth in respect of their legal obligations to other persons or to the criminal and civil law i have been as careful as i was bound to be to put any difficulties suggested by mere lay commonsense in an interrogative or merely doubtful form and to confine myself for any positive expressions to citations from published declarations of the judges before whom the acts of general booth came from reports of the law courts and from the deliberate opinions of legal experts i have now some further remarks to make on these topics     i the observations at p 305 express with due reserve the impression which the counsels opinions quoted by general booths solicitors made on my mind they were written and sent to the printer before i saw the letter from a barrister not practising on the common law side and those from messrs clarke and calkin and mr george kebbell which appeared in the times of february 3rd and 4th  these letters fully bear out the conclusion which i had formed but which it would have 313 been presumptuous on my part to express that the opinions cited by general booths solicitors were like the famous broken teacups wisely ranged for show and that as messrs clarke and calkin say they do not at all meet the main points on which mr hatton advised i do not think that any one who reads attentively the able letter of a barrister not practicing on the common law side will arrive at any other conclusion or who will not share the very natural desire of mr kebbell to be provided with clear and intelligible answers to the following inquiries     1 does the trust deed by its operation empower any one legally to call upon mr booth to account for the application of the funds     2 in the event of the funds not being properly accounted for is any one and if so who in a position to institute civil or criminal proceedings against any one and whom in respect of such refusal or neglect to account     3 in the event of the proceedings civil or criminal failing to obtain restitution of misapplied funds is or are any other person or persons liable to make good the loss  on december 24th 1890 a letter of mine appeared in the times no v  above in which i put questions of the same import and asked mr booth if he would not be so good as to take counsels opinion on the trusts of which so 314 much has been heard and so little seen not as they stood in 1878 or in 1888 but as they stand now six weeks have elapsed and i wait for a reply  it is true that dr greenwood has been authorized by mr booth to publish what he calls a rough outline of the intended trust deed general booth and his critics p 120 but unfortunately we are especially told that it does not profess to be an absolutely accurate analysis under these circumstances i am afraid that neither lawyers nor laymen of moderate intelligence will pay much attention to the assertion that it gives a fair idea of the general effect of the draft even although the words in quotation marks are taken from it verbatim  these words which i give in italics 1 define the purposes of the scheme to be for the social and moral regeneration and improvement of persons needy destitute degraded or criminal in some manner indicated implied or suggested in the book called in darkest england whence i apprehend that if the whole funds collected are applied to mothering society by the help of speculative attorney tribunes of the people the purposes of the trust will be unassailably fulfilled 2 the name is to be darkest england scheme 3 the general of the salvation army is to be director of the scheme truly valuable information all this but taking it for what it is worth the 315 public must not be misled into supposing that it has the least bearing upon the questions to which neither i nor anybody else has yet been able to obtain an intelligible answer and that is where are the vast funds which have been obtained in one way or another during the last dozen years in the name of the salvation army where is the presumably amended trust deed of 1888 i ask once more will mr booth submit to competent and impartial legal scrutiny the arrangements by which he and his successors are prevented from dealing with the funds of the socalled army chest exactly as he or they may please  ii with respect to the eagle case i am advised that dr greenwood whose good faith i do not question has been misled into misrepresenting it in the appendix to his pamphlet and certainly the evidence of authoritative records which i have had the opportunity of perusing appears to my nonlegal mind to be utterly at variance with the statement to which dr  greenwood stands committed i may observe further that the excuse alleged on behalf of mr booth that he signed the affidavit set before him by his solicitors without duly considering its contents is one which i should not like to have put forward were the case my own it may be and often is necessary for a person to sign an affidavit without 316 being able fully to appreciate the technical language in which it is couched but his solicitor will always instruct him as to the effect of these terms and in this particular case where the whole matter turns on mr booths personal intentions it was his plainest duty to inquire very seriously whether the legal phraseology employed would convey neither more nor less than such intentions to those who would act on the affidavit before he put his name to it  iii with respect to mr bramwell booths case i refer the reader to p 311  iv as to mr boothclibborns misrepresentations see above pp 298 299  this much for the legal questions which have been raised by various persons since the first edition of the pamphlet was published  dr greenwoods general booth and his critics  so far as i am concerned there is little or nothing in this brochure beyond a reproduction of the vituperative stuff which has been going the round of those newspapers which favour general booth for some weeks those who do not want to see the real worth of it all will not read 317 the preceding pages and those who do will need no help from me  i fear however that in justice to other people i must put one of dr greenwoods paragraphs in the pillory he says that i have built up on the flimsy foundation of stories told by three or four deserters from the army p 114 a sweeping indictment against general booth this is the sort of thing to which i am well accustomed at the hands of anonymous newspaper writers but in view of the following easily verifiable statements i do not think that an educated and i have no doubt highly respectable gentleman like dr greenwood can in cold blood contemplate that assertion with satisfaction  the persons here alluded to as three or four deserters from the army are     1 mr redstone for whose character dr cunningham geikie is guarantee and whom it has been left to dr greenwood to attempt to besmirch     2 mr sumner who is a gentleman quite as worthy of respect as dr greenwood and whose published evidence not one of the champions of the salvation army has yet ventured to impugn     3 mr hodges similarly libelled by that unhappy meddler mr trotter who was compelled to the prompt confession of his error see p 277     4 notwithstanding this evidence of mr trotters claims to attention dr greenwood quotes a 318 statement of his as evidence that a statement quoted by me from mr sumners work is a forgery but dr greenwood unfortunately forgets to mention that on the 27th of december 1890 letter no vii above mr trotter was publicly required to produce proof of his assertion and that he has not thought fit to produce that proof  if i were disposed to use to dr greenwood language of the sort he so freely employs to me i think that he could not complain of a handsome scolding  for what is the real state of the case simply thisthat having come to the conclusion from the perusal of in darkest england that general booths colossal scheme as apart from the local action of salvationists was bad in principle and must produce certain evil consequences and having warned the public to that effect i quite unexpectedly found my hands full of evidence that the exact evils predicted had in fact already shown themselves on a great scale and carefully warning the public to criticize this evidence i produced a small part of it when dr greenwood talks about my want of regard to the opinion of the nine thousand odd who still remain among the faithful p 114 he commits an imprudence he would obviously be surprised to learn the extent of the support encouragement and information which i have received from active and sincere members of the salvation army 319 but of which i can make no use because of the terroristic discipline and systematic espionage which my correspondents tell me is enforced by its chief some of these days when nobody can be damaged by their use a curious light may be thrown upon the inner workings of the organization which we are bidden to regard as a happy family by these documents  320 blank page 321              the salvation army           articles of war  to be signed by all who wish to be entered on the roll as soldiers  having received with all my heart the salvation offered to me by the tender mercy of jehovah i do here and now publicly acknowledge god to be my father and king jesus christ to be my saviour and the holy spirit to be my guide comforter and strength and that i will by his help love serve worship and obey this glorious god through all time and through all eternity  believing solemnly that the salvation army has been raised up by god and is sustained and directed by him i do here declare my full determination by gods help to be a true soldier of the army till i die     i am thoroughly convinced of the truth of the armys teaching     i believe that repentance towards god faith in our lord jesus christ and conversion by the holy spirit are necessary to salvation and that all men may be saved     i believe that we are saved by grace through faith in our lord jesus christ and he that believeth hath the witness of it in himself i have got it thank god     i believe that the scriptures were given by inspiration of god and that they teach that not only does continuance in the favour of god depend upon continued faith in and obedience to christ 322 but that it is possible for those who have been truly converted to fall away and be eternally lost     i believe that it is the privilege of all gods people to be wholly sanctified and that their whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ that is to say i believe that after conversion there remain in the heart of the believer inclinations to evil or roots of bitterness which unless overpowered by divine grace produce actual sin but these evil tendencies can be entirely taken away by the spirit of god and the whole heart thus cleansed from anything contrary to the will of god or entirely sanctified will then produce the fruit of the spirit only and i believe that persons thus entirely sanctified may by the power of god be kept unblamable and unreprovable before him     i believe in the immortality of the soul in the resurrection of the body in the general judgment at the end of the world in the eternal happiness of the righteous and in the everlasting punishment of the wicked  therefore i do here and now and for ever renounce the world with all its sinful pleasures companionship treasures and objects and declare my full determination boldly to show myself a soldier of jesus christ in all places and companies no matter what i may have to suffer do or lose by so doing     i do here and now declare that i will abstain from the use of all intoxicating liquors and also from the habitual use of opium laudanum morphia and all other baneful drugs except when in illness such drugs shall be ordered for me by a doctor     i do here and now declare that i will abstain from 323 the use of all low or profane language from the taking of the name of god in vain and from all impurity or from taking part in any unclean conversation or the reading of any obscene book or paper at any time in any company or in any place     i do here declare that i will not allow myself in any falsehood deceit misrepresentation or dishonesty neither will i practise any fraudulent conduct either in my business my home or in any other relation in which i may stand to my fellow men but that i will deal truthfully fairly honourably and kindly with all those who may employ me or whom i may myself employ     i do here declare that i will never treat any woman child or other person whose life comfort or happiness may be placed within my power in an oppressive cruel or cowardly manner but that i will protect such from evil and danger so far as i can and promote to the utmost of my ability their present welfare and eternal salvation     i do here declare that i will spend all the time strength money and influence i can in supporting and carrying on this war and that i will endeavour to lead my family friends neighbours and all others whom i can influence to do the same believing that the sure and only way to remedy all the evils in the world is by bringing men to submit themselves to the government of the lord jesus christ     i do here declare that i will always obey the lawful orders of my officers and that i will carry out to the utmost of my power all the orders and regulations of the army and further that i will be an example of faithfulness to its principles advance to the utmost of my ability its operations and never allow where i can prevent it any injury to its interests or hindrance to its success  324 and i do here and now call upon all present to witness that i enter into this undertaking and sign these articles of war of my own free will feeling that the love of christ who died to save me requires from me this devotion of my life to his service for the salvation of the whole world and therefore wish now to be enrolled as

officer the divisional officer must be prepared to give him three stations as a married man  e no officer accepted will be allowed to marry until he or she has been at least three years in the field except in cases of longstanding engagements before application for the work  f no male officer will under any circumstances be allowed to marry before he is twentytwo years of age unless required by

regulations for field officers                                            presents and testimonials  1 officers are expected to refuse utterly and to prevent if possible even the proposal of any present or testimonial to them  2 of course an officer who is receiving no salary or only part salary may accept food or other gifts such as are needed to meet his wants but it is dishonourable for any one who is receiving their salary to accept gifts of food also           the doctrines of the salvation army  the principal doctrines taught in the army are as follows   1 we believe that the scriptures of the old and new testament were given by inspiration of god and that they only constitute the divine rule of christian faith and practice  2 we believe there is only one god who is infinitely perfect the creator preserver and governor of all things  3 we believe that there are three persons in the godheadthe father the son and the holy ghost undivided in essence coequal in power and glory and the only proper object of religious worship  4 we believe that in the person of jesus christ the divine and human natures are united so that he is truly and properly god and truly and properly man  5 we believe that our first parents were created in a state of innocency but by their disobedience they lost their purity and happiness and that in consequence of their fall all men have become sinners totally depraved and as such are justly exposed to the wrath of god  6 we believe that the lord jesus christ has by his suffering and death made an atonement for the whole world so that whosoever will may be saved  7 we believe that repentance towards god faith in our lord jesus christ and regeneration by the holy spirit are necessary to salvation  8 we believe that we are justified by grace through faith in our lord jesus christ and that he that believeth hath the witness in himself  9 we believe the scriptures teach that not only does continuance in the favour of god depend upon continued faith in and obedience to christ but that it is possible for those who have been truly converted to fall away and be eternally lost  10 we believe that it is the privilege of all believers to be wholly sanctified and that the whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ that is to say we believe that after conversion there remain in the heart of the believer inclinations to evil or roots of bitterness which unless overpowered by divine grace produce actual sin but that these evil tendencies can be entirely taken away by the spirit of god and the whole heart thus cleansed from everything contrary to the will of god or entirely sanctified will then produce the fruit of the spirit only and we believe that persons thus entirely sanctified may by the power of god be kept unblamable and unreprovable before him  11 we believe in the immortality of the soul in the resurrection of the body in the general judgment at the end of the world in the eternal happiness of the righteous and in the everlasting punishment of the wicked                                           declaration  i hereby declare that i will never on
