had been a strenuous day for the baseball team of winona university and victor ollnee its redoubtable catcher slept late breakfast at the beta kappa fraternity house on sunday started without him and gilbert frenson who never played ball or tennis and arnold macey who was too effeminate to swing a bat divided the sunday morning star between them  see here gil called macey holding up an illustrated page do you suppose this woman is any relation to vic  frenson took the paper and glanced at it casually it contained a fullpage lurid article printed in two colors with the picture of a tall serpentine heavyeyed yet beautiful woman whose long arms ending in claws reached for the heart of a sleeping man what is it all about asked frenson as his eyes roamed over the text  it seems to be an attack on a medium named ollnee who pretends to be able to bring the dead to life according to this article shes the limit as a fraud you dont supposeollnee is an unusual name  oh not so very i suppose its another way of spelling olney i dont see any reason to connect old vic with any such woman as that  no only hes always been kind of secretive about his folks youll admit that why we dont even know where he came from nobody does unless you do  frensen dipped into the article wow this is a hot one lucile has a case for libel all rightunless the reporter happens to be telling the truth  hello vic he shouted as a tall broadshouldered but rather lean young fellow entered the room vic you are discovered  whats the excitement asked the newcomer  heres an article in the sunday paper you should see its all about a woman namesake of yours a medium named lucile ollnee the name is spelled exactly like yours say old man i didnt know you were the son of an infamous faker why didnt you let us know his tone was comic  young ollnee took the paper quietly but as he read a look of bewilderment came upon his face  how about it vic repeated macey you seem to be hard hit is she an aunt or a sister  rising abruptly victor left the room taking the paper with him  macey uttered a word of astonishment but frensen after a pause said soberly theres something doing here sissy he didnt act a bit funny but its up to us to keep quiet till we know just where we stand if that woman is related to vic hes going to be fighting mad i guess id better go up and see how hes taking it he certainly did seem jolted he turned to utter a warning dont say anything to the other fellows till i come back  macey promised and frenson went up the stairs and into the little study which he and victor shared in common the windows were open and the birdsongs and the fragrance of a glorious may morning flooded the room with joy but in the midst of its radiance young ollnee sat bent above the fateful printed page  as frenson entered he raised his head have you read this thing frens he asked tremulously  part of it  frens lucy ollnee is my mother this article is full of lies but its based on facts id like to kill the man that wrote it he added savagely  let me look at it again said frenson  victor handed the paper to him and sat in silence while frenson went over the article with studious care it was an exceedingly able and bitter presentation of the opposition side it left no excuse no palliation for a career such as that of lucile ollnee  she is fraudulent from beginning to end the writer passionately declared from her heart outward she is as vile as remorseless as mysterious as a vampire no one knows from what foul nest she sprang she battens upon the sick the worldweary the sorrowing her hokuspokus is so simple that it would deceive no one but those who are blinded by their own tears she has just one human trait she is said to be educating a son at an eastern university on the profits of her vile trade it is said that she is keeping him in ignorance of her way of life  frenson looked up at his friend vic what do you know of this business  almost nothing i dont know very much of even my mothers relations the first that i can remember is our home in la crescent my fathers name was paul ollnee but i cant remember him he died before i was three years old we left la crescent when i was about eight and went to the city i cant remember very much previous to that time but after we moved to the city i know my mother set up her ghostroom again  ghostroom  yes thats what i called it i cant remember when there was not a ghostroom in our house as far back as when i was five years old we had it and i was just getting old enough to wonder about it when we moved to the city  what kind of a den was this ghostroom  it looked like any other bright and pretty room but i never got more than a glimpse of it for i was afraid of it there was nice paper on the wall i remember and a desk with books and there were some tall tin horns standing in the corner oh yes and always an old walnut table theres something queer about that i dont understand why my mother should have taken that table down to the city with her but she did it was just an old batteredup walnut stand and yet she seemed to think the world of it she put it in the center of her room in the city just as she used to have it in our old home oh how i hated that room there was something uncanny about it there was always a string of strange men and women going into it with my mother and i was always sent away to play when they came oh gilhis voice brokeshe is a medium but shes not the awful creature they make her out  of course not we all know how these things go  you see i went away to boardingschool when i was ten this paper says i was sent away to keep me clear of the business that went on at home im not sure but that is true for ive seen very little of my mothers home life since  didnt you visit her during vacations  no she always came to see me and we took trips here and there wed go east or to colorado somewhere oh weve had such splendid times together gil she brought me presents and sent me money he looked out of the window for a few moments before he could go on and nowthe other fellows will see that article of course  yes the whole town will be reading it in an hour however they may not connect you with it  oh yes they will and theyll believe every word of it and theyll understand that i am lucy ollnees son this finishes me gil everybody will think i knew how my mother earned her money and theyll despise me for taking it he rose in an agony of shame i might as well be at the bottom of the lake  dont take it so hard old man youre a big favorite here said frenson with intent to offer consolation the work youve done on the team will go a long ways toward carrying you through this thing brace up all is not lost  the stricken youth was not listening just think gil shes been doing all this for me i knew she claimed to have messages but i didnt know that i was living on money earned in that way you see we own some houses in la crescent and i just took it for granted that our living came from them he was white with pain now this ends my career here ive got to get out and do it quick ill be the laughing stock of the whole town by noon  frenson deeply sympathetic did his best to minimize the effect of the disclosure but with victors corroboration of the reporters charges he was forced to admit that mrs ollnee was either an imposter or a woman of unsound mind little by little he drew from the stricken youth other interesting details  i remember having a fight with a city boy by the name of barker said victor because he yelled at me sonova medium till i stopped his mouth with my fist it seems to me as if it were the very next day that my mother took me to mirror lake and put me in a boardingschool that fight must have influenced her perhaps up to that moment our neighbors had let us alone i can understand now why she always visited me and why she never offered to take me to the city  he did not say that this very aloofness had made of her to him a serene and lofty figure but so it was she had come to him out of the unknown distance a mysterious queen of the fairies with something very sad and very sweet in her face and something very appealing in her voice there was nothing commonplace nothing associated with toil or worry in his memory of her her broad full brow her deepblue eyes and her frail little body put her apart from other women as he dwelt now on her dignity her loving care his heart grew strong with resolution gilbert he called suddenly im going down there and defend her from those beasts  frenson was not surprised i reckon thats your little stunt he retorted studentfashion but he was very much in earnest nevertheless im wondering what old boyden will say  victor believed in professor boyden and honored him but at the moment the thought of facing him was painful boyden was one of those who tested the human soul with the electric bell the clock and the spymograph delusions were among his hobbies hysteria was a great word with him man lived among appearances personality was not a unit but an aggregate liable to disassociation and the hysterical girl was capable of deceiving the very elect to him mediumship was merely the sign of immorality or epilepsy  a part of this disrupting philosophy had entered victors head and as he slowly and minutely reread that cruel newspaper analysis of his sweet and gentle mother he was startled but a little comforted by the thought that she might be the victim of her subconscious self she cant mean to cheat of that i am certain but she needs me just the same im going to earn her living and mine in some honest way  two or three of his most intimate friends came up after breakfast and started in to chaff but being far past the stage of evasion victor frankly confessed his relationship to the medium and hotly defended her ending by mournfully declaring his intention of leaving school at once and forever  thereupon his visitors also became very serious perceiving the tumult of doubt and despair into which he had been thrown and one by one they fell into awkward silence and slipped away leaving him alone with frenson who had been giving the most careful thought to the whole situation  of course the fellow who wrote this article had his own private grouch any one can see that and your friends are not going to condemn your mother on what he says but all the same youre wound up pretty tight vic theres no two ways about that according to your own statement she does claim to hear voices and she does claim to give messages from the dead now im not saying all this is impossible but you know as well as i do that boyden and his kind say nitsky to the whole business  i dont care what shes done retorted victor she has stood by me like a brick all these years and now its up to me to do something for her when shes in trouble  frenson admitted that this was a human and righteous resolution on the part of his chum and offered to help in any possible way  victor too full of grief and despair to think clearly went about his packing with swollen throat there was keen pain in the thought of abandoning this bright room of discarding all his trophies books and pictures but this he did putting nothing into his trunk but his clothing and a few photographs of his dearest girl friends whats the use he said to frenson its me to the spade or the icetongs now i wont need these things any more its battle in the arena of trade for vic from this time on  frenson looked around at the little library well ill hold them together for a while maybe youll be able to come back and graduate after all  never dont you see i cant take another cent of my mothers money now that i know how its earned  frenson listened unexcitedly well now suppose these voices should turn out to be real suppose these messages have been from the dead  it wouldnt make any difference  oh yes it would at least it would to me scientific men have been against a whole lot of things in the past that turned out to be true natural selection for instance and xrays and the wireless telephone  i see your drift gil you want to be a comfort to me but ive been digging down into my memory and i know now that my mother has been trained into these habits these delusions for over twenty years it wont be an easy thing to get her out of them she is as much deceived as the rest i am sure of that  well why dont you experiment with her make a test suggested frenson  would you experiment with your own mother asked victor  id make a case out of my grandmother if as much hinged on her as swings on this question of your mothers honesty you cant blink these charges vic theyll have to be met if she remains in the city  victor sat in silence for a few moments then broke out again gil i begin to understand a hundred things that have always seemed queer to me she has kept me away from her because she knew i would not sanction her way of earning money why i havent slept in her house but once since i was ten years old and that was just before i entered here i hated where she lived it was a ratty little hole down on the south side and the people with her were sloppy sals i refused to stay a second night i can see it all now she was living there in that way to save money for me to keep me here she wanted me to have just as good a chance as any of the rest of you this room the clothes i have on my trinkets everything came from her and now theres no telling what may happen to her that article threatens all kinds of persecution i ought to be there this minute i must take the very next train  i guess youre right there old man its likely to be a pretty exciting day for her this article is apt to bring all kinds of trouble to her as well as to you  the news that victor ollnee was the son of a notorious medium ran rapidly among his classmates and while they honored him and prized his skill on the team they felt a certain resentment toward him some of them thought he had not been quite honest with them and a violent controversy was thundering in the diningroom as frenson reentered it at one oclock he took victors part of course he cant help what his mothers done he argued he didnt choose his mother why slam into vic  we arent slamming into him were sorry for him responded one of the fellows  but we dont see how we can afford to have him in the frat said another hes a ripping good fellow and a wonder at the bat but what can we do he should have told us about himself the paper here says that his mother makes a living by cheating people by tapping spirit wires and blowing horns and hearing voices in the dark and all that shady business is sure to reflect on us hes a marked man which ever way you look at it youll see everybody rubbernecking over our fence today theyve begun it already  thats so agreed a third man why didnt he tell us the truth before we voted him in here  frenson explained hes been telling me all about it he says he didnt know his mother was earning her money that way  thats the part that looks queer to us accused the opposition how could he help knowing it looks to us as if hed been covering it up all along this writer says the woman is a regular battleax  the current was setting strongly against victor and frenson seeing this rose to go well theres no need of taking action poor vic is heartbroken over the whole business and is leaving on the threeoclock train  this silenced even his critics they began to remember what a jolly good fellow he was and how important his work in the diamond had been it was all very sad business and they relented we dont want to be hard on him they said  frenson went up to victor see here captain you must be hungry ill push a tray for you if you dont feel like going down among those indians ill have to be honest with you theyre all up in the air down there and howling something fierce i reckon id better hustle a turkeyleg for you  i wish you would gil i cant bear to see any one but you if i can i want to sneak out and get to the train without catching anybodys eye all i need now is to kill that reporter he has smashed my world sure thing and i may find my poor little mother crushed under it too he tore the paper into little bits snarling through his set teeth the fellows may believe what they please ive done with them all theyre all against me but you i can see that  frenson got out his pipe and filled it while his partner raged up and down the room at last he said now vickie when you get calmed down you just remember that youve a lot of mighty good friends up here therell be dozens of them that this thing wont change a little bit theyll talk but theyll be sympathetic  victors wrath burned itself out at last and he consented to frensons bringing the tray of food but he declined to go downstairs till the time came to start for the train  as they were crossing the hall they met little macey who with a startled look in his eyes intercepted victors passage im awfully sorry vic he began i wish i could do something for you  there was something so sincere and moving in his tone that victors stern mood melted his voice grew husky as he tried to jocularly reply never mind sissy im down but im not out goodby till next time  thats the spirit cheered frenson from the doorway  out on the walk a couple of the older fraternity men stood talking in low voices of victor of course and as they fell apart one of them had the grace to say dont stay away too long vic well need you saturday  victor waved a hand i hope youll be here when i return he retorted but as he entered the hack which frenson had provided as though he were taking an invalid or a lady to the train his composure utterly gave way i could have stood it if the boys hadnt welched he sobbed but they did you cant fool me they threw me down hard  some of them did admitted frenson but they were the hollow ones the solid chaps are all right yet  i cant blame them very much if they believe all that stuff about my mother and think that i knew it why of course theyre right in feeling as they do  at the train the loyal frenson said well now vic if you need help any time you let me know and ill come galloping  thats real bold in you gil and if i get where i cant see my way out ill shout  and so they partedvictor with a feeling that their companionship was ended forever gilbert with a sense of having failed of his intent to comfort and sustain     ii  victor interrogates his mother   once on the train with the towers of the university building out of sight victors mind went forward toward the great city whereto he was now hurrying in the spirit of one about to enter a tigerhaunted jungle hitherto he had been unafraid of its tumult for there his mother lived her home vague of outline as it was offered refuge from the thunder and the shouting but now its shelter was worse than useless for its lintel was marked with a sign of shame and terror and this the law and the lawless knew equally well  how will she seem to me now he asked himself what will she say to me when we meet  on one point he was sternly resolved she must leave the city at once we will go west somewhere i will earn our living now and at the moment earning a living seemed easy  the close of a beautiful spring day was spreading over the town as he made his way up the stairway into the unwonted silence of the thoroughfare the wind was from the east clean and cool and sweet as he looked down at the river from the bridge and marked its water flowing swiftly from the lake toward the splendid sunset sky he exulted over the power of man of science to reverse the natural current of a stream so must i change the whole course of my mothers life he thought with returning resolution it must be done it can be done its all in the will  the hitormiss squalor of california avenue filled him with renewed and augmented disgust as he descended from the car at the corner and began his search for his mothers apartment which was the top story of a shabby wooden building standing between two shops the stairway reeked with associations of poverty a shifty poverty and victors gorge rose at it the second flight though cleaner was musty with decaying wood and the doorwayon which a dim card was tackedsadly needed paint he began to realize sharply the sacrifices which had enabled him to live in the carefree comfort of his chapterhouse and his heart softened  after knocking twice without obtaining a response he tried the knob it yielded and he went in all was silent and dim for an instant he hesitated perhaps im in the wrong pew after all he thought but as he looked about him he recognized the ghostroom furniture of his boyhood on the wall was a familiar picturethe crayon portrait of a blackwhiskered man the same old battered walnut table which he remembered so well occupied one corner and behind it three long tin cones stood upright on their larger ends he shivered with disgust at them and turned to the lounge over which scattered as if by a gale of wind lay the leaves of the hated sunday edition of the star all else was neat and tidy though threadbare with use it was indeed very far from being the gilded den of vice which the reporter had depicted  oppressed by the silence victor called out mother are you here  he thought he heard a voice a husky whisper say go to her and a little surprised by this he stepped to the door of the bedroom and peered in there sitting in an armchair half hid in the gloaming sat his mother with closed eyes and a graywhite face  mother are you sick he cried out starting toward her  again the whisper in the air close to his ear commanded him stay where you are do not touch her  mother dont you know me it is victor  the whisper answered your mother is resting we are treating her be patient she will awaken soon  for a moment victors heart failed him so impressive was this whisper issuing apparently from the empty air then a flood of rage swept over him this voice was one of the tricks charged against her by the paper mother stop that i wont have it do you hear me stop it i say  the sleeper stirred and her eyes opened but no sign of recognition was in them slowly her stiffened hands withdrew from the arms of her chair and clasped themselves in her lap her cheeks puffed and pallid were rigid and her eyes turned upward and inward gleamed coldly the lids were halfclosed she had a horribly unfamiliar tortured look and he started toward her calling upon her in a voice of anxiety mother what is the matter dont you hear me  at last she opened her eyes and a thrill of relief ran through him as he caught a gleam of recognition there she lifted her hands feebly whispering my boy my precious boy  kneeling by her side he waited for her consciousness to come back her hands so cold and nerveless grew warmer her lips smiled wearily yet with divine maternal tenderness and at last she spoke my big splendid boy i knew you would not desert me i knew it i knew it i prayed for you  i came by the very first train he answered and i am here to defend you  a loud knocking at the door startled her and she clasped his hand tightly as she whispered that is another of my enemies all day they have been coming send them away  he put her hands down and rose tensely ill smash their faces he hotly declared  dont be rash victor please  he strode to the door and opened it a dark handsome young woman and a grinning youth stood without they were both a little dashed by victors appearance as he queried with scowling brow what do you want  the man replied we came to have a sitting  victor exploded get out he shouted if you come back here again ill throw you down the stairs thereupon he slammed the door in their faces and returned to his mother  weve got to get away from here he said as he came to her we cant stay here another day  that must be as my guide your grandfather says she replied  theres no use talking like that to me mother youve got to stop this business i wont have any more of it its shameful and i wont have it  she answered gently im under orders victor i can do nothing in opposition to the voices  he bent over her with knitted brow see here mother i want you to understand that this medium business has got to be cut out look what it has let you in for i dont believe in your voices and you must  she stopped him my son if you do not believe in the voices you cannot believe in me they are real if they were not i should go mad they are in my ears all day long my comfort is that they are not imaginary others hear them and that proves to me that they are not an illusion if you listen they will speak to you  i dont want them to speak to me i want you to pack up  hark she commanded they are speaking now  as he listened the same measured whisper which he had heard upon entering the house made itself distinctly heard apparently in the air a little higher than his mothers head boy trust in us  victor glanced at his mothers lips he could not help it base as it seemed he suspected her of ventriloquism who are you he asked  your grandsire nelson blodgett  this reply apparently without his mothers agency was uttered in so plain a tone that victors hair rose he opened and peered into a little closet which stood behind his mothers chair it was empty and as he came slowly back and stood looking down into her face a low breathy chuckle sounded in his ear  a smart lad needs discipline  a flush of rage passed over him leaving him cold he studied his mother in silence convinced that she was cunningly playing upon his fears as he pondered she said quietly im glad you came victor you fill my heart with joy but you must not stay i do not need you you must go back to your studies  that i cannot do  oh victor you must i want you to graduate father insists on it  i tell you it is impossible do you suppose im going back there where all the fellows are laughing at me why theyre talking of throwing me out of the club more than that i cant take another cent of your money if i had known how you were earning your living i would never have entered the university at all  oh my boy do you doubt me do you believe what they say against me  this brought him face to face with the whole problem of course i dont believe that you cheatpurposelybut i do think you are abnormal you cant expect me to believe that a voice can come out of the air like that its impossible its against all reason and yet  at this moment another knock a gentler signal sounded at the door and the youth relieved by the interruption flared out at the unknown intruder go away he shouted  no no these are friends his mother asserted and rose to let them in  victor caught her by the arm what are you going to do  open the door it is one of my dearest friends  you must not give a sitting i wont have it  the knock was repeated and she hurried away leaving the boy confused angry and helpless  she returned accompanied by two women the first of them was a diminutive grayhaired lady with a frank and smiling face whose dress proclaimed a prosperous and happy station in life her companion was a tall young girl whose spring suit quiet in color and exquisitely tailored became her notably the youth thought what a stylish girl and the sight of her calmed him instantly  victor said his mother and her tone was one of relief these are my dearest friends mrs joyce and leonora wood her niece  victor bowed without speaking for the heart of battle was still in him  mrs joyce cried out what a fine big fellow i didnt expect such a stalwart son  please be seated said mrs ollnee my son has just arrived he saw that dreadful article in the paper and came to defend me  that was fine of you exclaimed mrs joyce to victor that same article brought us i would have been here before only we dont take the star and i did not see the article until about an hour ago  mrs ollnee took up her explanation but louise victor says he will not go back to college  mrs joyce was quick to apprehend the situation i suppose that outrageous article made it appear necessary for you to defend both your mother and yourself she said searchingly  victor was not disposed to gloze matters in the least it made a fool of me he responded bitterly it made it impossible for me to look my friends in the face how could i convince them that i was not sharing in the profits of my mothers business i told them i didnt know where my allowance came from but of course no one believed me i know now and i despise the whole business ive come down here to take my mother out of it  the three women looked at one another sympathetically mrs joyce who knew mrs ollnees history intimately only smiled as she answered i dont see that you need to feel ashamed of your mothers profession a medium is one of the most precious instruments in this world she brings solace to many a sorrowing heart why is her work less honorable than singing for example furthermore no one is obliged to come to her we sit of our own choice and if we are not pleased we can refuse to pay and we need not return so you see it is a free contract after all  her reasoning staggered victor he was confused also by her frank and charming manner he perceived that his problem was not so simple as he had imagined hitherto his life had been singlehearted with nothing more difficult to decide than a question of moral philosophy but here now he stood confronted by an entirely baffling entanglement of human wills this woman so evidently of the higher world of wealth and culture accepted his mothers claims and this profoundly impressed him  mrs joyce continued dont take this newspaper attack too seriously mr ollnee it was meant to be nasty and it is nasty but it is not fatal it is a cloud that will soon blow over and leave you and your mother unharmed  it will never blow over for me he replied passionately and you must not include me in this thing ive lived a long way from it thus far and i dont intend to mix up with this kind of hokuspokus  victor called his mother warningly  he corrected himself of course i dont accuse you of wilfully deceiving anybody im willing to grant that you think these voices are real but my teacher doctor boyden says that mediumship is only a kind of hysteria  mrs joyce laughed yes ive read doctor boydens books what does he know about it did he ever study a wonderful psychic like your mother has he candidly examined these phenomena never in his life i know all about that kind of investigator he is basing his conclusions on somebodys elses conjectures or prejudices  victor defended his master he has tried to experiment hes offered prizes for mediums to meet him but they have refused not one would sit with him  why should they would you have your mother seek him out to convince him why doesnt he come to her there he sits in his chair pretending to say that these phenomena are impossible whereas i know from many personal tests that these voices are not merely real but that they come from my dear ones on the other side and that they sustain and comfort me  victor was silenced and his discomfiture was made the more complete by the smiling gaze of the young girl who was evidently enjoying his perplexity nevertheless though he did not continue the argument he held to his opinion that they were all victims of his mothers unconscious necromancy  mrs joyce continued you say you know nothing about it why not find out something about it here is your mother study her  why dont we have a sitting now exclaimed miss wood it would be fun to see his face when the horns began to dance about  mrs ollnee looked a little worried not now leo im too upset its been a terrible day for me i havent eaten a thing  mrs joyce rose you poor dear lets go get something come this instant youll go mr ollnee  his first impulse was to refuse but as he studied his mothers pale face and thought of the good effect of the outside air he relented yes ill go he replied ungraciously  miss wood came over to him and tried to soften his mood i know how you feel about all this and i know how brutal a scientific sharp can be my professors were all against it just the same its a wonderful old world a good deal more wonderful than some of our teachers admit  he did not reply to this but stood watching his mother as she put on her hat and wrap her whole expression had changed her face had lighted up and her delicacy of feature and small graceful hands denoted to him as never before the woman of natural refinement and intelligence it was hard to consider her at the moment the victim of a brain disorder and yet  mrs joyce led the way down the creaking stairs and victor following in sullen silence was surprised and a little daunted to find a luxurious automobile waiting for them he rebelled at the curb you go on without me he said harshly ill stay here till you come back  oh no exclaimed mrs joyce please come with us your mother will not be happy without you  miss wood remarked humorously never refuse a dinner or a ride in a motorcar thats my motto  his mother timidly lifted her face victor mrs joyce is my most loyal friend i owe her more than you know i wish you would come  he yielded with a sense of stepping down but as he found himself seated beside miss wood and whirring swiftly up the street his inflexible attitude softened for this one night i will follow after that i lead he promised himself  the girl mocked him with subtle intonation i am glad of any mystery and romance which remains in this old world and i never quarrel with fate if any one is disposed to exchange an autocar ride for so intangible a thing as a voice i trade  a little later she reverted to his problem what right have you to pass judgment on your mother without examining her i was just as skeptical as you are when i met her first but she forced me to believe i am perfectly certain that she would upset doctor boyden if he would come down quietly and sit with her shed convince even him she is a very dear little woman and we all love her  mrs joyce leaned over and spoke in his ear it is only through devoted beings like your mother that the bereaved are assured of life everlasting she doesnt tell me that my son is living beyond the veil she brings him to me i hear his voice and touch his hand  to this sort of thing he was forced to listen during their course down the shining avenue and it made the whole city as unreal as a dream when they rolled up to the wide portals of a towering hotel a new anxiety presented itself suppose mother should be recognized as we enter suppose they arrest her here  a realization of his own poverty and youth and general helplessness came over him with crushing effect as he trod the hall which seemed very vast and splendid in his eyes he was subdued too by the thought that he had not silver enough in his pocket to fee the girl who took their wraps his resolution to fight to earn not only his own living but to rescue his mother became fainter each moment can it be that yesterday i was behind the bat he asked himself surely i must be dreaming  he perceived another side to his mothers character she seemed quite at ease amid all this splendor and accepted whatever mrs joyce did for her as something quite definitely her due  there was no indication of the sabbath in the gorgeous diningroom and nothing to show that sorrow or poverty existed in the world and seeing his mothers face flushed with pleasure the perplexed youth relented a little further this one night she may have but it must be the last of such entertainment on such terms  there was in him beneath all this antagonism a kind of dignity and manly strength which pleased mrs joyce she was glad to see him lighten up and she exerted herself to that end there now she said looking about the room lets forget all of our troubles let us suppose that all our friends on the other side are at dinner also  victor sat in silence what time his mother decided whether she would have asparagus soup or consommé it was his first experience with that degree of wealth which takes no thought of price and glancing at the figures on the bill of fare his hair rose never in his life had he eaten a meal which cost as much as this one order of soup and the fact that his mother gaily ordered the best indicated to him how deeply indebted she already was to her patroness there must be some very definite need which she supplies he conceded or mrs joyce would not so gladly pay her bills  at the same time his respect and admiration for his mother returned as the dinner went on her cheeks glowed with faint color her years of trouble seemed to slip away from her she took on youthful grace and charm glancing often at her handsome son with eyes of maternal pride and content it is so good to have you here she silently expressed he had never seen this carefree side of her and the gayer she grew the more alien in a sense she became she was instinctively the lady of that he was assured and though she could not follow miss wood in all of her flights of fancy and allusion she plainly showed unusual powers of appreciation  the talk also brought out the extraordinary intimacy of the three women it appeared that mrs joyce and mrs ollnee were inseparable that she often took his mother to the opera and to the theater and as they discussed various singers and actors whose names alone he knew his sense of being suburban deepened why does this vivid and cultured woman seek my mothers society for what reason does she lavish money upon her is it because of her personal charm no he decided that cannot be the reason beneath her cordial tone he thought he detected the reserve of one who is being kind to a dependent shes being nice to mother he concluded because she thinks shes getting something special from her mother is a freak not a friend she considers her a kind of spiritual telephone  although miss wood devoted herself to the task of amusing him and his face lost some of its gravest lines yet he could not be denoted a careless youth even when the wine came on he was thinking too deeply to be outwardly ready of retort it was too sudden a change from the pastoral air and quiet streets of winona to be instantly assimilated he remained sullen  his mother eyed him apprehensively but admiringly he looks like his father she whispered to mrs joyce  he would have been inhuman had he not responded to certain charms in miss wood she had a fine profile he admitted finer than that of any girl he knew her eyes too were a little disturbing by reason of the small wrinkles of laughter at the corners but she irritated him she was perfectly sure of herself nothing that he did or failed to do affected her in any other way apparently than to deepen her amusement her manner seemed to say wait a few days and see what a fool youll find yourself out to be youre nothing but a great big country lad trying to be a philosopher trying to live up to a rigid code of morals its all a pose a ludicrous attitude of boyish defiance  she said nothing of this of course on the contrary she talked of things in which he was interested trying politely to meet him half way she was actually a year or two younger than he but she gave off the air of being five years older she had explored immense tracts of human life or at least of social life of which he had no knowledge and this came out in her casual references to new york and paris her home was in los angeles but she was now staying with her aunt  he lost his sullen reserve the soup the wine the bird and the maid softened his stern mood by the time the coffee came on he was talking almost boyishly with his hostess and his face had lost its troubled lines  his perplexities came back as mrs joyce passed two bills to the waiter in payment for their dinner and he watched from the corner of his eye to see how much change came back two dollars eighteen dollars for four dinners great scot he inwardly groaned it would take me a week to earn our share of this meal and a returning sense of his mothers subconscious iniquity reclad him with gloom  the ride back to california avenue was less festive for mrs joyce took occasion to say my advice is this return to college and obtain your degree i will take care of your dear little mother  i cant do that he said ive quit there is no use talking about that  you shouldnt take this newspaper attack too seriously remarked miss wood reporters are always exposing mediums it is quite habitual with them and besides your mother has been through it before  is that true he asked with sharpened assault  yes mrs ollnee admitted ive been attacked in this way twice  since i have been grown up  yes once since you went to winona  i didnt know that why didnt you tell me  mrs joyce interposed what was the use you could have done nothing we who understand these matters make allowances for the reporters trade he must earn a living some way  as she said this victor recalled the cynical close of the article probably the trueblue believer will condemn the detective and not the culprit the lines ran there are dupes so purblind so infatuated that nothing not even the boldest chicanery can shake their faith nevertheless a few will take this article for what it is a full and clear exposé of a shrewd and conscienceless trickster and yet as he faced these intelligent women victor could not think of them as being deceived by open chicanery much less could he admit for a moment that his mother was capable of resorting to it  it was a dramatic and moving experience for him to go from this cushioned splendid chariot back to the shabby little apartment which was the only home in the wide world for either his mother or himself he was filled with a kind of rage at her at fate and at himself and no sooner were they inside the door than he turned upon her with a note of resentful resolution in his voice  mother how could you let me in for all of this why did you send me to college knowing that sooner or later exposure must come  i trusted the voices she replied just as i must continue to trust them in the future  now mother he rejoined with a certain foreboding grimness of inflection weve got to get right down to brass tacks on that business i cant go on any longer in ignorance of who i am and what you are i want to know all about you and all about my father who was my father what was he did he believe in this thing  her eyes fell no not while he was on this lifes plane indeed it was my work thatthat separated us he hated it and was very harsh about it but the first thing he did after he passed on was to come back and tell me that i was right after all he asked me to forgive him  is that his picture up there on the wall what did he do for a living  he was a really fine mind victor one of those men who might have been eminent had they gone out into the world he was a student and a thinker but he was not ambitious he was content to be the principal of a village school and live quietly and we were very happy till the voices began  did he know you had the voices when he married you  yes i told him all about them but he only laughed at me i suppose he thought it was just a fancy on my part anyhow he did not take them seriously and during our courtship they gave me freedom my guide said i need not sit for a while and father guarded me from all the evil ones on that side who are so ready to rush in and take possession of a medium for two years i had no touch of the power and i really thought it had all gone away from me then you came and i was very ill and father my control returned to tell me that you would be a great man hereafter he said i will direct you in the education of your son why victor he named you he said you should be called victor because you would overcome all opposition  well just how did your separation come about  when my control began to demand things from me your father accused me of playing tricks and sternly forbade any more of it i tried not to go into trance i fought the power and this angered father he came upon me so strong that i could do nothing with him i heard the voices all the time and your father thought me crazy i had what seemed like epileptic fits i seemed to lose my identitybut i didnt i knew all that was going on it seemed as if i went out of my body while others entered it and used it to torment and perplex your father then he became convinced that i was abnormal in some way and experimented with meall in a very skeptical spiritand gradually he lost his regard for me i became only a case of hysteria to him i could see him change from day to day he grew colder and more critical and more aloof all the time this made me so ill that i was unable to keep my feeti grew old rapidly and another younger and prettier woman one of his teachers gained the love i had lost and at last he went away with her  there was a little silence before victor was able to ask where did he go  he went to denver and i never saw him again he died not long after  then did you take to making a living out of the ghostroom  after your father left i asked my guides why they permitted him to leave me and they said it was considered necessary to keep me in the work you were too happy they said you are too valuable an instrument to live out your life simply as wife and mother you are now to be devoted to higher aims since then whenever i have tried to get out of the work they have brought me back oh you dont know what a clutch they have on me they know my income to a dollar they let me have just enough to live on and to educate you but they wont let my rich friends provide me with an income i must do their will exactly or they punish me  as she enlarged upon this phase of her life victor was appalled by it her madnessand madness it seemed to himwas now a settled and specific part of her life how do they punish you he asked after a pause  they do not hesitate to throw me into convulsions or make me do things that rob me of my friends they bring disaster upon me whenever i try to walk my own road every investment i make on my own judgment they defeat did you ever plague an ant or a bug by putting something in its way checking its advance no matter in which direction it went  he nodded yes ive done that as a boy  well that is exactly how they treat me ive given up trying to do anything in opposition to their wishes i do the work that is laid out for me she sighed yes ive ceased to rebel i am resigned but victor you must not fail me i shall be perfectly happy if only you will be content to go with me and to grant at least that the work i am doing is worth while youre all i have now and when i see you frowning at me so like your father i am scared that black look is on your face this moment  you need not be afraid of me mother he replied wearily but you must not ask me to believe in your voices and all the rest of it its too unnatural and too foolish but youre my good little mother all the same and im not going to desert you im going to stay right here and help you fight it out  she took his words to mean something sweet and filial and went to his arms with happiness  as she lifted her head from his shoulder he looked round the room and said but mother this ghostroom has got to go  oh victor dont say that i am ready to promise not to take money for my work but i cant promise anything further and as for my ghostroom as you call it it has so many associations with paul and your grandfather that i cannot think of giving it up i dare not give it up  you must quit it he repeated if you give another séancefor moneyi will leave you and i will never come back and on his face was the stubborn look of his father     iii  victor makes a test   that night was a long and restless one for the mother but the son with the healthy boys power of forgetfulness slept dreamlessly waking only when the morning light struck beneath his eyelids for a moment the thunder of the elevated trains in the alley puzzled him and he rose dazedly on his elbow expecting to catch frenson at some practical joke but as his eyes took in the faded carpet the cheap curtains the decrepit furniture his brain cleared and his beleaguering worries came back upon him like a swarm of vultures  he recalled the terror of his mothers trance the coming of her lovely friends the ride the luxurious dinner and last of all the significant words with which they had parted  in the light of the day his situation did not seem so complicated we must leave this city and go out west somewhereget shut of the whole bunch father was rightthis trance business is intolerable  his natural vigor and decision returned to him he rose with a bound calling to his mother with a realization of the fact that she had no cook who gets breakfast you or i  she replied with a little flutter of dismay in her voice i dont believe there is a crumb of bread in the house  never mind he replied ill go to the corner and negotiate a roll  the neighborhood did not improve with daylight acquaintance and on his way back from the shop with a jug of cream and a paper bag in his hands he dwelt again upon his motorcar ride to the palace hotel and reviewed the eighteendollar meal they had eaten he possessed sufficient sense of humor to grin as he clutched his parcels if miss wood were to see me now shed experience a jolt  his smile did not last long mrs joyce knows all about us he admitted thats why she blew us to that feast she was trying to compensate mother for her empty cupboard which was very nice of her then his thought went deeper he began to understand that it was to provide him with a larger allowance that his mother had been living alone and doing her own work dear little mutter he said and his heart softened toward her shes been walking the tightrope all right  she was up and at work in the tiny kitchen as he came in i forgot to get my supplies saturdayand yesterday i was so upset  never mind he replied gaily the royal gorge we had last night makes breakfast supererogatory ive attached some rolls and a bottle of cream and if youve any coffee and sugar were fixed  i have sugar but no coffee i drink  not on your life he cut in no burnt wheat for me and he tore down the stairs like mad  at the shop he found himself possessed of just seventeen cents with which he bought a halfpound of coffee  now i can begin my conquest of the world as all the great men have donepenniless its me for a stroll downtown i reckon  the table was neatly set when he returned and his mother proud of her big and glowing boy cheerily confronted him no matter how poor we are she said we can be happy and with her faith renewed she prepared the coffee for the cream  the sun struck into the bare little diningroom with golden charm but these two souls so alike yet so unlike faced each other with returning constraint as they talked their antagonism of purpose again developed  victor outlined his plan of going west and starting anew to this suggestion his mother listened then gently replied there are many objections to that victor first of all i have no money  cant we sell something she shook her head and he after looking around ruefully admitted that there was nothing to sell but your house this gave him a thought why dont we go back to la crescent ill work on a farm in a groceryanything rather than have you keep on with this business its dangerous and it isnt nice  victor she began with more of selfassertion than she had hitherto voiced you dont understand my mediumship is not a business it is a sacred obligation god has gifted me with the power of communicating with those who have passed to a higher plane and i must respect that gift i am in the hands of those wiser than either of us to oppose them would be selfdestruction  he listened with growing coldness and hardness thats all a delusion he repeated modern science has proved that mediumship is just plain hysteria  we wont argue she replied and her tone was that of one hurt i know for i have had the personal experience i am only a leaf in the wind when this power sweeps over me so long as i live i must remain the instrument of these our supernal friendsit is my work in the world and i must execute it  what do you expect me to do he asked almost brutally  id like you to go back to your studies  that i will not do he assured her in tones that expressed a final decision  well thenwill you remain here with me  not with you carrying on the business which i hate  why should you hate it to leo and mrs joyce my mission is noble  i hate it because i think its foolish unnatural and false i dont mean that you consciously cheat mother but i am certain that in some way it all comes down to that  she opened her arms in a gesture of passionate appeal my son these voices have educated youthey have helped me to feed and clothe you now here i am prove me try me convict me if you can i yield myself to your tests i know the spirit life is a reality if i did not i should perish with despair every day almost all hours of the day these voices whisper in my ears the hands of those you call the dead caress my cheek they cheer and admonish me they are as real to me as you are if you can silence them do so i put myself into your hands do what you will in proof of my powers  the boy was rapidly changing to the man his mothers words beating upon his brain aroused something in him which he had not hitherto acknowledged he thought deeply as he peered into her eyes burning with resolution  she is honestbut she is the victim of a fixed idea he had heard much of the fixed idea i will try her i will rid her of her obsession aloud he said the important thing is our living how am i to pay my way i havent a cent i paid out my last penny for this coffee  i have a little money  i told you i wouldnt take another dollar of your money and i wont he replied sharply thats settled i must get clear and keep clear of all this bunk  but suppose you find my powers real she asked trembling with eagerness  he hesitated thenwellif i believed in your powers i would still object to your earning money withby means of youryour voices ive got to make my own way in the world and from this moment  she read an unmitigable opposition in his eyes and sadly said youll come here to sleep wont you  he conceded so much though reluctantly yes ill sleep here but as soon as i make a raise of any work i intend to pay for my board as for carfare i guess my junk will have to go into hock he rose you see i won a silver mug and a watch by being useful to the team its them to uncle jakes he ended with a return to the college youths vocabulary and going to his valise took out his reward for muscular merit and showed it to her isnt that smooth  her eyes shone with pride how much do you suppose you can borrow on it she asked  oh i dont know five dollars maybe  well ill lend you ten dollars on it  he looked at her with musing eyes say twenty and you may have both mug and watch  she went to her purse and handed to him the money  he took it without hesitation well heres where i hit the pavement for a job  she confronted him in a final appeal oh victor i cant bear to have you doubt me even for an hour stay with me today stay and let me talk with you ive had so little of you just think for more than twelve years ive kept you away from meive starved myselfmy motherselfin order that you might grow to manhood untroubled by my faith and i cant bear to have you doubt me now  he understood something of her emotion and responded to it you dear faithful little mother i realize now what i have cost you and im grateful but thats the very reason why i cant let you do any more of it i must begin to pay you back  all you need to do to pay me is to let me look at you she fondly replied im proud of you victor i was proud of you last night i saw leo admiring you and mrs joyce thinks you are splendid  he was interested by the way who is miss wood  shes a niece of mrs joyce mrs joyce is the widow of joyce the lumberman  she seems to have all kinds of money his face was thoughtful again  yes shes rich and she has been very kind to me she took me to california and to europe she is always doing things for me it was just like her to come to me yesterdayshe is not one to fail in time of trouble i dont know what i should do without her  she certainly is nice what about miss wood does she believe in youryour voices he asked this without direct glance  yes she doesnt say much but she is deeply grateful to my guides  shes no ordinary girl i can see that is she rich also  not as mrs joyce is rich but the voices have sort of adopted her they say they will make her wealthy as a queen  what do you mean by that  they are telling her from week to week just how to invest her money  do you mean to tell me that you advise her how to invest her money  no i mean the voices advise her  why should they know anything about business  she became evasive they do theyve proved it again and again mrs joyces income has doubled in five years by following fathers advice  he pondered on this deeply i dont like that i dont see why you or your voices should be valuable in that way  there are many things in this world for you to learn my son she replied with an assumption of superior wisdom  this nettled him it dont take much wisdom to know that if you go on advising people in that way youll get into trouble thats what that writer said in the paper  she closed her lips tightly as if to keep back a cutting reply and he rose briskly well see here we must put away these dishes  she acquiesced in his postponement of the discussion and helped him wash the dishes and set the room to rights at last she said where is the morning star have you seen it  theres a paper at the foot of the stairs is that yours  yes she replied  ill get it he said and was out of the door and back again before she fully realized that he was gone he opened the twist of damp paper with haste fully expecting to find some new attack on mrs ollnee the bloodsucker but there was nothing all the same youre not safe in this house he said they threatened to arrest you and i dont like to leave you here alone today  you need not worry about me she replied quietly father will take care of me if he saw any real danger coming my way he would warn me of it  he didnt warn you of the coming of the reporter did he  nohe had some reason for permitting this cloud to come upon me he knows best  i dont believe id put very much faith in guides that didnt keep me out of trouble  perhaps all this is a part of our discipline they are wiser than we i accept even this disgrace as a good in disguise perhaps it was all intended to bring you to me  the youth sank back again baffled by this allinclosing acceptance what do you intend to do today he asked as she rose and walked over to the little walnut table  i am going to ask for advice  now  yes and i wish you would sit with me for a few moments and see if we cannot secure direction for the day  he was beginning to be curiousand his desire to dig deeper into his mothers brain overcame part of his repugnance  all right he boyishly answered but his heart contracted with sudden fear of finding her false lets see what theyre up to  take a seat opposite me she said and there was something commanding in her voice  drawing a chair up to the old brown tablewhich he remembered as one of the pieces of furniture in his earliest childhood homehe took a seat  why do you keep this rickety old thing he asked shaking it viciously  it was your grandfathers readingtable and he likes me to keep it besides it is highly magnetized and very sensitive  oh rats he irreverently burst forth you cant magnetize a piece of wood wood is a nonconductor you cant subvert a physical law just by saying so  i dont mean it in that crude sense she replied quite mistress of herself she had taken up and was holding between her hands a small hinged slate  whats that for asked victor  to vitalize the surface i am able to give it vitality by my touch she laid the slate upon the table and placed her spread hand upon it put your hand upon mine victor  he did as she bade him rebelling at the childish folly of it all what do you expect to do he asked  almost immediately the slate seemed seized by a powerful hand it began to slide back and forth across the table violently twisting and clattering the youth put forth his own great strength and stopped it but a crunching sound announced that the slate was broken  his mother said sharply you mustnt do that victor she took up the slate and showed one corner crushed and crumbled you cant hold ityou mustnt tryit angers them  he marveled at the strength which had resisted him but argued that his mother from long practice had become very muscular hysterical people often displayed astounding power  after preparing a new slate she put it on the table as before saying to the air please dont be rough fathervictor cant prevent his skepticism  three loud raps answered and she smiled he says all right he understands  seems to me hes mighty touchy for one on the heavenly plane victor retorted maliciously seems to me an allseeing spirit ought to get my point of view  a vigorous tapping on the table responded to this speech  whats that asked victor  that is your father saying yes he does get your point of view  victor had a feeling that his mother was receding from him as he faced her across the table she became the professional medium in her manner and tone he too changed he hardened assuming the attitude of the scientific observerhostile and derisive his keen hazelgray eyes grew penetrating and his lips curled in scorn his tone hurt her but she persisted in her sitting and at last the slate began to tremble throughout all its parts and a grating sound like slow writing with a pencil went on beneath it victor could plainly follow the dotting of the is and the crossing of the ts till at the end a tapping indicated that it was finished  you may take the slate victor said mrs ollnee  he took it from the table and opened it on one side in bold scripta bit oldfashionedstood these words stay where you are let the boy adventure into the city await results i will be near father  victor astounded mystified confronted his mother with wide eyes now what does that mean  it means that i am to keep this house just as it is and you are to seek work in the city is that right paul  three taps made answer  the youth was stunned by the boldness and cleverness of all this he was pained too he perceived no sign of abnormal thinking in his mothers action she was not hysterical she was not entranced whatever she did she did consciouslyand the thought that she could deliberately deceive him was shocking he breathed quickly and a nervous clutch came into his hands he resented being fooled lets try that again he said and his tone was precisely that of the child who sees a grown person swallow a coin and take it out of his ear he was angry as well as sad dont put your hand on it he protested i dont like the looks of that  she submitted and then as he was putting it down on the table the sound of writing was heard within it he laid his hand on the slates and still the writing went on with amazement he realized that both her hands were in sight and in no wise concerned in the writing the right rested lightly and quietly on the frame of the slate but the left which lay on the opposite corner of the table was quivering throughout all its minute muscles  amazed beyond words excited breathing deep with a shudder of nervous excitement running over his entire body victor listened to the mystic pencil how do you work that he asked in a whisper  i dont know i have nothing to do with it she answered and taking the upper hinge of the slate between her fingers and thumb she slowly raised it  and still the writing went on  victor holding his breath in awe bent to look within but as the opening grew wider the writing stopped  he snatched the slates from the table and studied the lines which were made up of minute dots it was all perfectly legible son i doubted now i know  victor sank back into his seat and stared speechlessly at the slate and the table the problem of his mothers mediumship had taken on new elements of mystery this physical test brought it into the range of his knowledge and interest it was no longer a question of her honesty or sanity it had become a problem in dynamics  how was that bit of pencil moved the messages he ignoredthey didnt matterbut the method of their production seemed to eliminate all trickery conscious or unconscious why did his mothers left hand quiverand how could that writing shape itself  his voice was husky with emotion as he said mother i dont understand that youve got to tell me how that is done  she felt the desperate resolution in his voice and she solemnly answered my son i dont know how it is done  but you must know who moves that pencil your hand quivered all the time  yes i seem to have some physical connection with itat times other times all that takes place has no more connection with me than the sunlight on the floor the world is a very mysterious place to me victor i dont pretend to know anything i do as i am told  he fell silent again while his mind reviewed the entire process then he burst out vehemently on a new line i cant believe my eyes youve hypnotized me mother for gods sake dont juggle with medont play tricks with me i wont stand for it it hurts me he paused confused baffled ready to weep  can you my own son accuse me of trickery she asked  you think youre honest motherbut dont you see youve become an unconscious hypnotist its your subconscious self deceiving us both i dont know how you do it but i know it must be a fraud  victor she said solemnly what this power is you shall have full opportunity to determine but i say to you that for more than twenty years ive been guided by these unseen presences ive tested their wisdom and lived under their care so far as this message is concerned i accept it i was confused and frightened yesterday but this morning i am calm i shall do as they bid i shall stay here while you go down into the city and see what you can find to do and together we will test these voices  there was a ring of newfound decision in her tone that quite dashed him he sat dumbly facing her helpless in a whirl of mental storm is she more cunning than i thought is she playing a more complex game than appears these thoughts vaguely shaped themselves then his filial self answered but what has she to gain she loves me she has sacrificed herself to keep me at schoolwhy should she deceive me  here again a third conception came to embitter him he spoke you dont seem to mind my loss of a degree  yes i do victor i feel that very deeply but the higher wisdom of your grandfather resigns me i cannot tell what is behind it by his power to read the future he may be preventing some terrible accident some calamity by fire or wateri have an impression that it is something of that sort  no came a whisper from the air  she turned her face upward and listening intently asked what is the reason father  discipline the whisper replied  he says discipline victor  discipline he echoed why should i be disciplined what have i done  it is not what youve doneits what you are to do  the voice did not reply to further questions and the silence gave out a kind of cold contempt which cut the boy as he waited  lets try that slate business again he said at last but to this his mother would not consent  its of no use she said they are gone there is no power present  he again faced her with alien accusing eyes when will you try this again  tonight when you come home  home he sneered looking about do you expect me to call this place home do you expect me to hang about this scrubby hole to be disciplined by your voices  the sound of a knock at the door gave her a moments respite the postman she explained as she rose to go to the door  she was gone for several minutes and victor heard her in friendly conversation with a pleasant male voice some way this added to his anger and disgust  she came back with a letter in her hand which she began at once to open it is from louise i mean mrs joyce  she read it through with smiling face then said victor you must be nice to louise she has done everything for us  this brought him to his feet i understand all that now it is her money ive been living oni wont touch another cent that comes from her understand that i wont eat another dinner that she pays for  why victor you should not feel that way what has she done to make you bitter  nothing i refuse to live on her charity thats all and i want you to find out just how much i owe herhow much you owe herfor i intend to pay her back every dollar with interest  but she considers ive already paid her she feels that i have always given her bounteous return for all her aid  i dont figure it that way he said shes just amusing herself  she interrupted listen to what she says she read i want to tell you how much i like your son he is so vivid and so powerful im sorry he is to miss his degree cant you persuade him to go back ill be glad to advance what is necessary  there it is you see theres the rich lady helping a poor relation  wait son she pleaded and read on i feel that i owe you ten times what youve permitted me to do for you  thats all very nice of her mother but i wont have any more of it he pounded out the sentence with his fist  she looked up at him with mingled fear and pride you are exactly like your father as you say that she declared oh victor my son if you leave me in anger i shall be desolate indeed i cant live without you please believe in meand love mefor youre all i have on this earth  his anger died away he saw her again as she really was a pale devoted little saint with troubled brow and quivering lips one who had shed her very lifeblood for himto doubt her became a monstrous cruelty  he put his arms about her and hugged her close i didnt mean to hurt you motherbut your world is so strange to me ill stay ill do the best i can here only dont work this slate trick any more dont sit for any one but me will you promise that  may i not sit for louise  not without me  i dare not promise victor father may insist if he does not insist i will do as you wish i will give it up  he kissed her dear little mother you shant live alone any more and you shall soon have a home that is worthy of you  she was weeping and a big lump in his own throat made speech difficult to cover his emotion he slangily said well now its me to the marts of trade perhaps ill fool the voices yet     iv  victor throws down the altar   how do people get jobs he asked himself as he set forth want ads i suppose he went deeper what am i fitted for i can keep booksin a fashionor i can clerk my training has not fitted me for any special thing unless to sell sportinggoods this was a lead and his face brightened my work on the team ought to help me in that direction good idea ill hie me to the sportinggoods houses  the first two managers with whom he talked while much impressed by him were completely manned but the third was disposed to consider him till he told him his name no relation to mrs ollnee the medium he asked with a grin while poising his pencil to write  for an instant victor hesitated then took the leap well yes i am but then you dont want to believe that report its more than half a lie  the managers smile vanished he left the address half finished so you are the son they spoke of he said with a cold keen glance  yes i am victor boldly answered  he closed his book i dont believe we can trade he announced of course i dont consider all mediums frauds and liars but this house is very particular about its help  victor turned and walked away bitterly rebellious of soul and disheartened for a time his anger burned so hotly within him that he meditated taking the train and leaving the city and all it held behind him again and again his thought returned to the picture his gentle little mother had made as she had said goodby to him at the head of the stairs to accuse her of conscious deception was like accusing a sweet girl of infanticide how could she build up a system of fraudulent fortunetelling so intricate so subtle that it baffled the eye of the reporter who confessed that he had not been able to detect the trickery it is only by induction by inference that one gets at the modus operandi he admitted  in his perturbation he walked away to the east and soon came out upon the lakefront a bunch of men and boys of all types and sizes were playing ball on the barren ground and with the athletes undying love of the sport he rose and edged into the game he could not resist showing his prowess by means of a few curves and the crowd with instant perception began to take a vivid interest in him  a halfhour of this restored his goodnature and he returned to the cañons to the west determined to find an opening somewhere he was never dismissed rudelyhe was too big and welldressed for thatbut the fact that he had no experience shut him out in most cases and for the rest the departments were filled with salesmen twice when he seemed about to be taken on his name and his mothers reputation shut the door of opportunity in his face  at four oclock he started slowly homeward discouraged not so much by his failure as by the fact that everybody seemed to have a knowledge of the article in the star it was evident that even when a manager did not at the moment make the connection between his name and mrs ollnees it would certainly come out later and he would be called upon to defend himself and his mother from the sneers and jeers of his fellowsalesmen im a marked man thats sure he said in dismay  all day his mind had dwelt in flashes on the glorious life at winona but now his memory of it was poisoned by the thought that he had been a pensioner on the bounty of mrs joyce the easy thing would be to change my name and skip out for the plains he said again but i wont ill stay and fight it out right here some way  he was passing the public library at the moment and was moved to go in and look up the want ads in the papers ten minutes reading of these filled him with despair there were so many wanting work his feet were tired with walking and his brain weary with the movement of the street therefore he moved on to the reference room where he found an atmosphere of study that was very grateful  accustomed to work of this kind he asked the attendant to bring him catalogues and was soon surrounded with books and magazines which dealt with the modern study of psychic phenomena he fell upon one or two of these which gave exhaustive generalizations and he was astounded to find that european men of science of the loftiest type were engaged in the study of precisely the same phenomena which his mother claimed to produce  careless of all else he remained until six oclock absorbed and confused by what he read words and phrases like telekinesis teleplastic parasitic personalities externalized motricity biopsychic energy danced about in his brain like fantastic insects he fairly staggered with the weight of the conceptions laid upon him and when at last he went out into the streets he had forgotten his race for place behind the counter  it was nearly sunset and his afternoonhis dayhad gone for naught he was as far as ever from securing workand wagesto keep his little mother and himself from the corrupting care of charity he was a bit disgusted with himself too for wasting valuable time and yet he was enough of the scholar to feel a glow of delight in the company he had been keeping there was something large and free in the attitude of those italian men toward the universe and before he had walked far he promised himself to go again and continue that line of investigation as he walked up the avenue he came face to face with the dark thinfaced girl who had knocked at his mothers door the day before she seemed about to speak but he passed her with blank look  he found his mother at the window waiting for him and upon seeing him she hurried to meet him at the head of the stairs  what luck she called with a smile  he shook his head nothing doing and received her caress rather coldly for he perceived mrs joyce in the room it isnt so easy to find a job ill be lucky if i dig one up in a week i suppose  mrs joyce greeted him cordially ive just been making a proposition to your mother victori hope youll let me call you victorwhich is that we all go abroad for a few months till this storm blows over  he looked at her with gravely interrogating glance how could we do that  she explained you both go as my guests of course we can motor through france in june and get up into switzerland in july  he sank into a chair and dazedly studied her why should you offer to do all that for us  because i am very grateful to your mother for what she has done for me she not only cured my mother of cancershe has cured me of despair she has taught me to believe again in the mystery of the world  you mean she has done this asas a medium  yesthrough her guides she has given me faith in the hereafter their advice on a hundred different things has made life easy for me my wealth is largely due to the wisdom of mr astor who speaks through her he advises and so does your grandfather that i take you all abroad this summer and i think it a very nice suggestion  oh the suggestion came from the voices did it his voice was full of scornful suggestion  yes but i thought of it myself yesterday as i read that terrible article you see im told by mr bartol my lawyer that the city officials are about to start another campaign against all forms of mediumship i think it best and so does your father that we all leave the city for a time and escape this persecution  the beleaguered youth was not a polite deceiver at his best and this proposal appeared to him not merely chimerical but immoral for the reason that his mother must have really proposed it through her uncanny power of hypnosis of suggestion she had put the idea into her rich friends head i wont consider any such proposition he bluntly answered i dont recognize my mothers claim you owe her nothing i dont believe she can cure cancer and she has no right to advise anybody in business matters  you say that because you know nothing of the facts mrs joyce briskly replied i understand your situation perfectly your mother has kept me informed of her worriesshe has no secrets from meand i must say i foresaw this antagonism on your part i felt that you were growing away from her and yet the voices advised her to keep you at school and to say nothing to show you how close they watch you i can tell you that weve been informed of your whereabouts several times today you met a young man at noon a pale serious young man whose name is gilmer who said he would help you isnt that true  he was properly surprised yes i did meet such a man  then you went to the library and read for a long time  he sneered did the voices tell you that i was turned down everywhere on account of my mothers reputation as a medium  no but they said you would oppose the idea of our going abroad and that you were under discipline  youre tired victor interposed the mother dont worry over me any more now ill get you some coffee  while she was gone on this errand mrs joyce leaned toward victor and said i can understand a part of your feeling because there was a time when i lived in the world of definite commonplace thingsbut you must not oppose your mothers voices they are as real to her as anything in this universe ive proved their reality again and again as i say they have advised me in my investments and always right in a sensein a very real sensei owe a part of my wealth to your mother and the little that she has permitted me to do in return for her aid is trifling i want to do more please be just to your dear little mother who is truly a marvelous creature and loves you beyond all other earthly things she lives only for you if it were not for you she would pass on to the spirit plane tonight  victor listened to her in a sullen meditation the whole situation was becoming incredibly fantastic vaporous as the texture of a dream  mrs joyce went on come to my house tonight for dinner never mind the morrow till the morrow comes come and talk with some friends of minethey may help you  he spoke thickly im much obliged mrs joyce im grateful for what youve done for us but to take her money or yours now would bewould be dishonest i cant let you feed us any longerweve got to fight this out alone  what will you do with her voices she asked  forget em he answered curtly  theyll force you to remember them she warningly retorted i assure you they hold your fate in their hands  mrs ollnee returning cut short the discussion which was growing heated  as he drank his coffee victor recovered a part of his native courtesy im going to win out he said with kindling eyes it would have been a wonder if i had found a job the first day im going to keep going till i wear out my shoes  a knock at the door made his mother start  another reporter she whispered theyre pestering me still  victor rose with a spring ill attend to this reporter business he said hotly  no interposed mrs joyce let me go please  he submitted and she went to meet the intruder her quiet authoritative voice could be heard saying mrs ollnee is not able to see any one that cruel and false article of yesterday has completely upset herno i am only her friend and nurse i have nothing to say except that the article in the star was false and malignant  thereupon she closed and locked the door and came back quite serious theyve been coming almost every hour determined to see your mother i would have taken her away only she persisted in saying she must remain here till you returned  have you been here all day he asked moved by the thought of her loyalty  his mother answered louise came about ten this morningand except for an hour at lunch weve both been here waiting listening  this devotion on the part of a rich and busy woman was deeply revealing the youth was being educated swiftly into new conceptions of human nature his mother was neither beautiful nor wise nor witty why should she attract and hold a lady like mrs joyce he wondered if she had been quite honest with him would her interest be the same if the voices had not enriched her  she returned to her invitations now put on your dinnersuit and come with us she insisted my niece leo will be theresurely you will respond to that lure  his mother laid her small hand upon his arm let us go victor i am in terror here  why did you stay why didnt you go before he demanded  because the voices said waitand besides i wanted to be here when you came  he rose you go i will come after dinner and bring you home  mrs joyce was quick on the trail of his intent you refuse to eat my bread you are rigorous very well let it be so come lucy let us go  mrs ollnee seemed to listen a moment then rose youll surely come after dinner victor  yes ill come about nine he replied in a tone that was hard and cold and she went away deeply hurt  left alone he walked about the ghostroom with bitterness deepening into fury what were these invisible intangible barriers which confined him he stood beside the old brown table which he had hated and feared in his boyhood what silliness it represented the pile of slates some of them still bearing messages in pencil or colored crayon offered themselves to his hand he took up one of these and read its oracular statement he will come to see the glory of the faith his neck will bow it is discipline do not worry father here was the source of his troubles  he dashed the slate to the floor and ground it under his heel catching the table by the side and upending it he wrenched its legs off as he would have wrung the neck of a vulture he breathed upon it a blast of contempt and hate and gathering it up in fragments was starting to throw it into the alley when the door burst open and his mother reappeared white breathless appalled  victor what are you doing she called with piercing intonation  he was shaken by her tone her manner but he answered im going to throw this accursed thing into the alley  she put herself before him with one hand pressed upon her bosom her breath weak and fluttering  youshallnot you are killing me dont you see that is a part of me dont you knowput it down instantly my very life and soul are in it  he dropped the broken thing in a disordered pile at her feet her anguish which seemed both physical and mental stunned him as they stood thus confronting each other mrs joyce returned she seemed to comprehend the situation instantly and putting her arm about the little psychics waist gently said youd better lie down lucy you are hurt  mrs ollnee permitted herself to be led to the little couch silently sobbing  it was growing dusky in the room and the youth though still rebellious was profoundly affected by this action his hot anger died away and a swift repentance softened him dont cry mother he said clumsily kneeling beside her i didnt think you cared so much about the old thing  mrs joyce broke forth in scorn what a crude young barbarian you are that table is something more than a piece of wood to her it is a sacred altar it is the place where the quick and the dead meet it is sentient with the touch of spirit handsand you have desecrated it you have laid violent hands upon your mothers innermost heart you will destroy her if you keep on in this way  at these words the youth for the first time caught a glimpse of the vital faith which lay behind and beneath these foolish and ridiculous practices no matter what that worn table was to him it stood for his mothers faiththat he now sawand he was sorry  i can rebuild it again he said it is not hopelessly smashed i will repair it tomorrow  the symbolism which could be read in his words seemed to comfort his mother and she grew quieter but her face remained ghastly pale and her breathing troubled  mrs joyce turned to him again you cant deceive her she knew the instant you laid your destroying hands on that slate  he did not doubt this in some hidden way his action had reached and acted upon his mother as she was speeding down the avenue her sudden return proved thisand his hair rose at the thought of her clairvoyancy and in answer to mrs joyces question why did you do it he replied sullenly but not bitterly  i did it because i detest the thing and all that goes with it i have hated that table all my life  what did you think your mother would do  i didnt stop to think i only wanted to get the brute out of sight i wanted to end the whole trade at once  youve got to be careful or youll end your mothers earthlife let me tell you boy if you want to keep her on this plane with you you must be gentle with her any shock especially when she is in trance is very dangerous to her  victor began to feel his helplessness in the midst of the intangible entangling threads of his mothers faith he now saw the folly of his action and took an unexpected way of showing his contrition  if youll forgive me mother ill go with you to mrs joyces dinner come lets get away from here for a little while i feel stifled  this pleased and comforted her amazingly she rose and placed one frail cold hand about his neck dear boy i forgive you you didnt realize what you were doing  releasing himself he gathered up the fragments of the table and tenderly examined them it can be mended he reported ill do it the first thing in the morning  a faint smile came back to his mothers face i dont mind victor i feel already that this has brought us closer together your father is herehe is smilingand i am happier than ive been for weeks  victor dressed for his party with trembling limbs it seemed as if he had passed through a tremendous battle wherein he had been defeatedand yet his heart was strangely light     v  victor receives a warning   mrs joyces house was a stone structure of rather characterless design which stood at the intersection of a wide boulevard and one of the narrower crosstown streets but it seemed very palatial to victor as he wonderingly entered its looming granite portal his mother tripped up the stairs with the air of one who feels very much at home  a man in snuffcolored livery took his hat and coat and ushered him into a large receptionroom on the left and there his hostess found him some ten minutes later come and meet my brother from california she said and led the way across the hall into the library where a tall man with gray hair and mustache was talking with a dark alert and smoothly shaven man of middle age the one mrs joyce introduced as her brother mr wood and the other as mr carew  victor was relieved to have miss wood enter and greet him cordially for the men did not seem to value him sufficiently to include him in their conversation mr wood was reserved and the tone of carews voice was cynical  leonora wood was of that severe type of beauty which requires stately gowns and victor confessed that she was quite the finest figure of a girl he had ever met but when mrs joyce said you are to take leo out to dinner he merely bowed resenting her amused smile  his seat at table brought him next a very old ladymrs wood seniorwho beamed upon him with cheerful interest there were several other women of that vague middle age which does not interest youth  miss wood talked extremely well and he became interested in spite of himself  i wonder how much longer were going to believe in luck and coincidence she said after some remark of his maybe its all thought transference or telepathy or something  dont tell me you really believe in such things professor boyden says they are all a part of the spineless mysticism which is sweeping over the country  she assumed a patronizing air its natural for undergraduates to quote their teachers i wonder how long it will be before you will consider them all old fogies  he rose to the defense of his hero boyden will never be an old fogy hes the most uptodate man in america he really is the only experimentalist along these lines hes out for the facts  your mothers voices say he is as blind as the rest wilfully blind  do you really hold stock in my mothers voices  she gazed upon him in largeeyed wonder yes dont you  no how can they be anything but a delusion  i dont know i only know they are profoundly mysterious and that they tell me things which convince me they seem to know my most secret thought i have been forced to believe in them my aunts fortune has been doubled and my own income greatly augmented by their advice  he took this up tell me more about that what did they advise you to do  they advised buying certain stocks in a machine for making paper boxes and recommended the universal traction company  at this moment mrs wood senior plucked at his sleeve louise tells me youre the son of our dear medium lucy ollnee  i am yes he replied rather ungraciously for he was eager to revert to leo  perhaps youre a medium yourself the old lady pursued  thank the lord no i havent the ghost of a voice about me  she chuckled at your age one thinks only of love and dollars when you are as old as i am the next world will interest you a great deal more than it does now besides you must believe in spirits after they have made you rich theyve made louise and leo richi suppose you know that  he soon turned back to leo i wish people would not talk my mothers voices to me i hear nothing else now  its your mothers atmosphere no one thinks of anything else when in her presence  dont you see how intolerable all that is going to be for me he asked with bitter gravity i can see that she isnt exactly human even to you shes just a sort of a freak no one loves her or seeks her for herself alone only for what she can do thats another reason why i must insist on her getting away from this i will not have her treated like a wireless telephone  her eyes expressed more sympathy than she put into her voice i see what you mean but believe me i had not thought of her in just that light and i think youre quite wrong about my aunt she is really very fond of your mother  he was eager to know more of what this clearsighted girl had seen but her neighbor mr carew claimed her and he was forced back upon grandmother wood who talked of her new faith to him for nearly half an hour  after dinner while the ladies were in the drawingroom and the men were smoking their cigars the perturbed youth expected to be freed from any further inquisition for philo wood was apparently of that type of man who has no interest in the things he cannot turn into hard cash the merits of a new strawboard boxmachine was engaging his attention at this time but after a few minutes of polite discussion of the weather and other general topics carew the lawyer turned to victor and began an interrogation which made him wince carew was very nice about it but he pursued such a welldefined line of inquiry that it amounted to a crossexamination he soon possessed himself of the fact that victor did not approve of his mothers way of life and that he was trying to secure employment in order to stop all further fortunetelling on his mothers part i dont believe in it he reiterated  the amazing thing to me interposed wood with quiet emphasis is that her predictions come true i play the ponies a bithe smiledand i have tried to draw mrs ollnee into partnership with me you have the spooks point out the winning horse to me said i to her and ill share the pot with you  and she wouldnt do it asked carew  wood seemed to be highly amused no she says her guides do not sanction gambling of any sort and yet she advises louise to buy into a new transportation scheme that looks to me like the worst kind of a gamble my advice counts for nothing against these voices  thats true admitted carew you might as well be the west wind so far as influencing her goes since mr astor butted into the game my services are good only in so far as they drive tandem with his now you say you have no belief in the thing he said turning again to victor how is that how did that come about  well in the first place ive given some study to what professor boyden calls delusional hysteria victor responded  wood smiled cynically my sister wont mind what you call it so long as it enables your mother to designate the winning stocks  the attitude of each of these men was that of watchful tolerance and victor chafed under their assumption of superior wisdom he plainly perceived that wood was using the psychic for his own ends and this angered him he shut up like a clam and left the room as soon as he could decently do so  he made his way to where leonora was sitting on a sofa in the library and took his seat beside her with intent to continue the conversation which they had begun at the dinner but he forgot his problems as he looked into her merry candid eyes  her first word was a compliment to his mother how pretty she looks tonight no one would suspect her of being the dark and subtle siren of yesterdays star her face is positively angelic at this moment how beautiful she must have been as a girl i must say you do not resemble her  thank you he said  she laughingly explained i mean you are so tall and dark you must resemble your father  i believe i do although i cannot remember him  i wonder if he had your absurd pride aunt louise tells me you absolutely refuse to accept any favor from her and that you were practically forced into coming to dinner tonight is that true  he leaned toward her with intense seriousness how would you feel if you had suddenly learned that all your clothing your food your theater ticketseverything had been paid for in money drawn from strangers by means ofwellhypnotism  if i believed that i should feel as you do but i dont it is not so simple as all that your mothers power seems very real to me and so far as i can now see she has given us all value received for every dollar by rights onehalf of all our profits belongs to her or if you prefer to her voices do you know that these voices will not permit her to retain more than a scanty living out of all the wealth she makes for others did you know that  i know she lives in a shabby apartment and she tells me that she is entirely under the control of these guides  yes they refuse to let her keep anything beyond what she actually needs for herself and your education i think all that should be counted in on her side dont you the fact that she is not enriching herself surely makes her part in the transaction a clean one  he sank away from her and brooded over this thought for a minute or two before he replied but the whole thing is so preposterous have you seen her slatewriting stunt  many times but i dont think you should call it a stunt  come now give me your honest opinion do you think my mother unconsciously cheats  she faced him with convincing candor no i dont i think she is perfectly simple and straightforward and i believe the writing is supernormal  how can you believe that youre a college girl mother tells me dont the belief in these things wipe out everything you have been taught at school it certainly rips science into strips for me or wouldif i believed it it makes a fool of a man like boyden thats a sure thing  mrs joyce looking across the room smiled in delight at the charming picture these young people made in their animated conversation doubtless they were glowing over tennysons position in modern poetry or the question of merediths ultimate standing in fiction  what the youth was really saying to the maid was this what did you get out of it all what did the voices give you  they told me to study composition for one thing they told me i would compose successful songs with the aid ofof schubert she was a little embarrassed at the end  and you took all that in  she colored im afraid i didnt really believe the schubert part however im studying composition on the chance of their being right  you say they advise you on money matters how do they do that  they advise my uncle through me to sell stock in a certain company and buy in another they told me to withdraw my money from my california bank and put it into this universal traction company  did you do that  yes  im sorry i wish you wouldnt take their advice i wish you would put your money back where it came from at once  why  because it scares me to think of your going into anything on my mothers advice  but it wasnt your mothers advice it was the advice of a great financier  you mean a dead financier  yes  he did not laugh at this on the contrary his face darkened ive heard about that did he advise your uncle to go into this same transportation company  yes all our friends are in it  you mean everybody that went to my mother for advice  yes  do many go to her for help of this kind  no not many she gives sittings only to my aunt and her friends now there were several big business men of the city who went regularly why mr pettus the president of the traction company relies upon her  the absurdity of these great capitalists going to his mothers threadbare little apartment for counsel in ways to win millions made victor smile he said with a mock sigh i wish these voices would tell me where to find a job that would pay fifteen dollars a week  they willif you give yourself up to them you must have faith  oh but the whole thing is dotty why should a poor farmer like my grandfather by just merely dying become a great financier again his brow darkened and his voice deepened with contempt its all poppycock if he knows so much about the future why didnt he warn my mother against that reporter that came in the other day to do her up why didnt he permit me to stay on at winona and get my degree  the girl was troubled by his questions and evaded them it must have been hard to leave in the midst of your final term  it was punishing it was like being yanked out of the box in the middle of an inning with the game all coming your way  she knew enough of baseball slang to catch his meaning and she smiled as she asked why dont you go back  simply because i couldnt stand the chinning id get from my classmates  cant you go on with your studies here and pass your examination  i might do that if i could get a job that would pay me my board and leave me a little time to study  she looked up at him with smiling archness why not drive an automobile you could carry your books around under the seat and study while waiting outside the shops or the theaters  good idea he exclaimed responding to her humor im pretty handy with the machine one of my friends up at winona had one i hope you own a car he said this with intent to indicate his growing desire to be near her  mrs joyce came over at this moment to inquire what they were so jolly about  leo answered i was just suggesting that mr ollnee become a chauffeur he could go on with his studies  capital exclaimed mr joyce the man i have is liable to drink and very crusty in the bargain you may have his place  im afraid i wouldnt do he responded i might get crusty too  i hope you are not liable to drink said leo  no sarsaparilla is my only tipple but this is all miss woods joke he explained  im not joking indeed im not the girl retorted i dont know of any skill that is more in demand just now than that of a chauffeur i know of one who is studying the piano i dont see any reason why mr ollnee should not take it up temporarily its perfectly honorable witness bernard shaws play  oh im not looking down on any job just now he disclaimed all i ask is a chance to earn a living while im finding out what my best points are  mr wood beckoned and leo rose to meet him we must be off he said  victor bade leo goodnight with such feeling of intimacy and friendliness as he had not hoped to attain for any one connected with mrs joyce there was something in the pressure of her hand and in the sympathetic tone of her voice at the last that he remembered with keen pleasure  mr carew was deep in conversation with mrs ollnee and victor drew near with intent to know what was being said the lawyer was very gentle very respectful but mrs ollnee was undergoing a thorough investigation at his hands he represented the calm slowspoken but very keen inquisitor and the psychic was already feeling the force of his delicate yet penetrating sarcasm  i would advise you not to trust your voices in matters that relate to life limb or fortune he said suavely and a veiled threat ran beneath his words these voices may be deceiving you  mrs ollnee protested with vehemence mr carew i am content to put my soul into their keeping  he bowed and smiled your faith is very wonderful then he added with a glance at mrs joyce who was listening for myself i would not put my secondbest coat in their keeping  mrs joyce intervened at this point and after some little discussion of a conventional topic offered to send victor and his mother home in her car victor was not pleased by her offer it was only putting him just that much deeper into her debt but he could not well refuse especially as his mother accepted it as a matter of course  on the way he took up the question of carews warning hes right mother you must stop advising people to buy or sell  why so victor  suppose you should advise buying the wrong thing  but they dont advise the wrong thing victor they are always right  always  nobody has ever reported a failure she declared  well its sure to come why should father or grandfather know any more about stocks now than he did before he died  she was a little nettled by his tone they have the constant advice of a great financier on that side  so miss wood told me who is this great financier who is so willing to help you decide what to do with other peoples money he asked cuttingly  she hesitated a little before saying commodore vanderbilt  he could not keep back a derisive shout vanderbilt well and you believe the great commodore comes to our little hole of a home to advise us oh mother thats too ridiculous  my son she began with some asperity weve been all over that ground before you dont realize how you hurt how you dishonor me when you doubt me and laugh at me  he felt the pain in her voice and began an apology i dont mean to laugh at you mother but you must remember that i have been a student for four years in the atmosphere of a great university and all this businessive got to be honest with youits all raving madness to me you certainly must stop advising in business matters mr carew tonight intended to give you warning  i know he did she quietly responded  he meant to be kind he meant to say that you were liable at any moment to be held accountable for advice that went wrong he told me that the courts were full of cases where mediums had led people into willing their property away or where they had juggled with somebody elses fortunes he told me of having convicted one woman of this and of having sent her to jail  but have i prospered from these advices she asked indignantly can any one accuse me of getting rich out of my work please consider that  that does puzzle me i cant see why they help others and leave us with a bare living and most important of all why do they permit you to be hounded this way why didnt they warn you why dont they help me  she sighed submissively of course they have their own reasons in good time all will be revealed to us they are wiser than we for all the past and all the future are unrolled before their eyes  this reply silenced him small and gentle as she was victor realized that she could resist with the strength of iron when it came to an assault upon her faith  above the knob of their own door they found a folded newspaper and this victor seized with misgiving i wonder what is coming next he said  she paled with a definite premonition of trouble open it at once she commanded  he was as eager as she for he too foresaw some new attack upon their peace lighting the gas he opened the paper with trembling hands on the first page was his own photograph and the story of his leaving college to defend his mother everything even to the parting with frenson was set down luridly side by side with the report of a celebrated murder trial  at sight of this new indignity his sense of youth and weakness came back upon him and crumpling up the paper he flung it upon the floor in impotent rage  that ends the fight here he said how can i go about this town seeking work tomorrow everybody will know my story and whats more here is your address given in full dont you see that makes it impossible for either of us to remain here another day  for the first time in her life the indomitable little psychic quailed before the persistent malice of her foes the splintered altar of her faith lying in a disordered heap upon the floor symbolized the estrangement which she felt between her invisible guides her son and herself her maternal anxiety had developed swiftly in these few hours of blissful companionship and the world of wealth and comfortfor her boys sakehad become suddenly of enormous importance to her she wished him to be a happy man and this desire weakened her abstract sense of duty to the race she spoke aloud in a tone of entreaty addressing herself to the intangible essences about her father are you here speak to me help me i need you  victor turned upon her with darkened brow oh for gods sake stop that i dont want any advice from the air  she persisted paul come to me tell me what to do please come  her voice was thrilling with its weakness and appeal but victor was furious he refused to listen his brow was set and stern  at last she cried out poignantly they are not here they have deserted us what shall i do she turned toward the table rebuild my altar you said you would restore that and perhaps they will come to us again they are angry with me now they have left me perhaps forever  if they have i shall be glad of it he returned brutally they have been a curse to you and to me also we are better off without them come let us pack up the few things we have and go away into the west where no one will know even so much as our name that is the only way left open for us  no no she cried out that is impossible i must remain here i must wait until they come back to me i cant go now and you must not desert me she ended and in her voice was something very pitiful  he moved away from her and took his seat in sullen rage for a long time he did not even look at her though he knew she was waiting and listening  at last he rose and his voice was harsh and hoarse mother my mind is made up theres no use talking against it i leave this city tomorrow morning i shall go as far as my money will carry me i shall change my name and get rid of this whole accursed business ive hated it ive hated your ghostroom and your voices all my life and this is the end of it for me if you will not go with me then i must leave you behind  she uttered a moaning cry of grief and ran like one stricken into her room flinging herself face downward upon her bed he listened for a few moments with something tugging at his heartstrings but his face was set in unrelenting lines then he rose and set to work repacking his trunk     vi  victor is checked in his flight   when victor woke from his uneasy sleep next morning his first glance was toward his mothers room wherein he had seen her vanish in an agony of grief and despair all was quiet and after dressing himselfstill firmly resolved upon flighthe went to the door and silently peered in  she was sleeping peacefully her thin hands folded on her breast and he drew a sigh of relief  i am glad shes able to sleep he said and stole back to the pantry  he studied its sparse supplies with care there was not much to do with but he boiled some eggs and made coffee very quietly with intent to let his mother sleep as long as she could he found himself less savage than the night before  i cant leave till she wakes he said to himself but im going all the same  in order to pass the time of waiting he went down to the foot of the stairs to find the morning paper he opened it with apprehension but breathed a sigh of relief upon finding no further scare heads of himself the only reference to his mother came in the midst of an editorial advocating the cleaning out of all the healers palmists fortunetellers and mediums in the city with lofty virtue the writer went on to say that the star had refused to advertise the business of these people no matter what the pecuniary reward and that it purposed a continuous campaign we intend to pursue all such women as mrs ollnee who fasten upon their credulous dupes like leeches he declared  as victor read this paragraph he caught again the violence of contrast between the woman pictured by the pen of the editor and the pale sweet mildvoiced little woman who was his mother it would have been funny had it not been so serious and so personal furthermore the paragraph strengthened him in his determination to leave the city and he still hoped to be able to persuade his mother to go with him  at eight oclock he once more tiptoed in to see if she still slept and finding her in the same position his heart softened with pity she must have been completely tired out poor little mother im afraid what i said to her worried her  after another hour of impatient waiting he again entered her room and studied her more intently there was something suggestive of death in the folded hands and he could detect no breathing her face was as pale as that of a corpse and his blood chilled a little as he approached her he called to her at last but she did not stir  stepping to her bedside he laid his palm upon her wrist it was cold as ice and he started back filled with fear mother mother are you ill he called she gave no sign of life  for a long time he stood there rigid with fear not knowing what to do he knew no one in all the city upon whom he could call save mrs joyce and leo and he did not know their street or number he felt himself utterly alone helpless ignorant as a babe and in the presence of death  gradually his brain cleared sorrow overcame his instinctive awe of a dead body he felt once more the pulseless arm and studied closely the rigid face she is gone he sobbingly cried and i was so cruel to her last night  the memory of his harsh voice his brutal words came back to plague him now that she was deaf to his remorse how little how gentle she was and how selfsacrificing she had been for him she burned out her very soul for me he acknowledged  he remained beside her thus till the sound of a crying babe on the floor below suggested to him the presence of neighbors hastening downstairs he knocked upon the first door he came to with frantic insistence  a slatternly young woman with a crown of flaming redgold hair came to the door she smiled in greeting but his first words startled her  my mother is dead come up and help me i dont know what to do  his tone carried conviction and the girl did not hesitate a moment she turned and called father come here quick mrs ollnee is dead  an old man with weak eyes and a loosehung mouth shuffled forward to him the girl explained this is mrs ollnees son he says his mother is dead im going up there you look out for the baby she turned back to victor when did she die  i found her cold and still this morning  have you called a doctor  no i dont know of any to call  jimmie she shrieked  a boys voice answered what ye want maw  jimmie you hustle into your clothes and run down the street to doctor sills office and tell him to come up here right away hurry now  closing the door behind her she started resolutely up the stairway and her action gave victor a grateful sense of relief  what do you think ailed her she asked  i dont know she seemed all right last night when i went to bed  this woman young in years was old in experience that was evident for she proceeded unhesitatingly to the silent bedside with that courage to meet death which seems native to all women she too listened and felt for signs of life and found none i reckon youre right she said quietly shes cold as a stone  at her words the strong young fellow gave way he turned his face to the wall sobbing tortured by the thought that his bitter and savage assault and expressed resolve to leave her had been the cause of his mothers death what can i do he asked when he was able to speak i must do somethingshe was so good to me  the young woman looking upon him with large tolerance and a certain measure of admiration replied theres nothing to do now but wait for the doctor youd better come down with me and have some coffee  he did not feel in the least like eating or drinking but he needed human companionship therefore he followed his neighbor down the stairs and into her cluttered little livingroom with submissive gratitude the home was slovenly but it was glorified by kindliness a tousled baby of eighteen months was keeping the old man busy and a small boy of eight or nine was struggling into his knickerbockers and victor thrust into the midst of this hearty dirty noisy household remembered with increasing respect his mothers dainty housekeeping she was a lady he said to himself in definition of the difference between her apartment and this her home was poor but it was never ratty  mrs bowers was kindness and consideration itself her father deaf and partly paralytic was treated gently although he was irritatingly slow of comprehension and insisted on knowing all about what had taken place upstairs it pained and disgusted victor inexpressibly to have his mothers condition bawled into the old mans ears but he could not reasonably interfere  he thought of mrs joyce knowing that his mother would want to have her instantly informed i ought to telephone some friends he said to mrs bowers where is the nearest phone  she told him and he went out and down the steps in haste to let mrs joyce know of his tragic bereavement and when at the drugstore near by he finally succeeded in getting communication with the house he was deeply disappointed to be told by the butler that mrs joyce was not down and could not be disturbed so early in the morning  but i must see her he insisted my mother mrs ollnee her friend isisvery sick i am victor her son and im sure mrs joyce would want to speak to me  the butlers voice changed oh very well mr ollnee he replied knowing the intimacy which existed between his mistress and the psychic just hold the line ill call her  it was a long time before the calm cultivated voice of mrs joyce came over the phone but it was worth the waiting for who is it she asked  mrs joyce this is victor ollnee my mother is very very ill im afraid shes dead  he heard her gasp of pain and surprise as she called your mother why she seemed perfectly well last night  i found her lying cold and still this morning i cant detect any pulse or any breathing cant you come over at once please do i dont know a soul in the city but you and im in great trouble  you poor boy of course ill come ill be over instantly have you called a doctor  no i dont know of any  where are you now  at the corner drugstore  is any one with your mother  no but the woman below has been up she is quite sure my mother is dead  gracious heavens i cant realize it goodby for a few minutes ill come at once  victor returned to mrs bowers apartment with a glow of grateful affection for mrs joyce it was wonderful what comfort and security came to him with her voice so sincerely filled with compassion and desire to help he wondered if leo would come with her and asked himself how the news of his bereavement would affect her her attitude toward him had been that of the elder sister who felt herself also to be the wiser but he did not resent that now  he thought of the effect of his mothers death upon the press would the star forego its malignant assault upon her character now that she was gone beyond its reach would those who threatened her with arrest be remorseful  mrs bowers persuaded him to take another cup of hot coffee and then together they returned to the little apartment above to wait for the coming of the doctor and mrs joyce the young mother became philosophical at once after a body gets to be forty i tell you he dont know whats going to happen next i reckon you better set here where you cant see the bed she added kindly it dont do any good and it only makes you grieve the harder  he obeyed her like a child and listened through his mist of tears as she rambled on ive had my share of trouble she explained first my mother went then my oldest boy then my husband took sick yes a body has to face trouble about so often anyway and besides i dont suppose your mother was afraid of death anyhow ive known all along what her business was ever since i came into the house and ive been up to see her a few times still im not much of a believer dad is though its his greatest affliction that he cant hear the voices any more i want to say i believe in your mother she was a mighty fine woman but the docterin of spiritualism i never could swaller notwithstanding i grew up longside of it  the sound of a decisive step on the stairs cut her short i bet a cookie thats the doctor  a clear crisp incisive voice responded to her greeting at the door and a moment later a beardless rather fat young fellow was confronting victor with professional smiling eyes youre not the patient he stated rather than asked victor shook his head and pointed to the bed  with quick step the physician entered the bedroom and set to work upon the motionless form with methodical haste he was still busy in this way when the whir of a motor car announced mrs joyce  victor was at the door to meet her and when she saw him she opened her arms and took him to her broad maternal bosom you poor boy she said patting his shoulder youre having more than your share of trouble  he frankly sobbed out his penitence and grief oh mrs joyce shes gone and i was so hard last night ill never forgive myself for what i said to her  she again patted him on the shoulder with intent to comfort him there there i dont believe you have anything to reproach yourself for and then remember your mothers beautiful faith she has not gone far away her heaven is not distant she is very near she has merely cast off the garment we call flesh she is here close beside you closer than ever before touching you knowing what you think and feel  in this way she comforted him and in a measure drew his mind away from the memory of his cruel and unfilial words  sill approached her with thoughtful glance are you related to this woman  no i am only a friend replied mrs joyce but this is her son  when did you discover your mothers present condition  this morning  did you fold her hands and put her in the position she occupies  no that is the strange thing when i left her last night she wasshe was lying across the bed face downward i had just told her that i was going away and that i wanted her to go with me she refused to do this and tried to get the voices to speak to her they would not come and so she being hurt i suppose by what i said ran into the room and flung herself down on the bed weeping i was angry at her and did not speak to her again i went to sleep out here on the couch and did not see her again till morning when i looked in at eight oclock she was lying just as she is now  sill eyed him keenly do you mean that you quarreled  mrs joyce interposed i can explain that she said mrs ollnee was my friend she was what is called a medium she is the mrs ollnee you may have read about in the papers  ah sills tone conveyed a mingling of surprise and increased interest so you are the son of mrs ollnee he said turning to victor  mrs joyce again answered for him yes he has been away at school he came home sunday to comfort and protect his mother but unfortunately he does not accept her faith he rebelled against her work and demanded that she give up her voices i can understand his wanting her to go away with him and i can understand also how painful it was to her but i dont believe that what he said had anything to do with her passing out she was very frail at best and has many times said that she expected to leave the body in one of her trances and never again resume her wornout garment  she was subject to trances then  yes though not strictly a trancemedium she did occasionally pass out of the body  may i take your name  certainly i am mrs john h joyce of prairie avenue  his manner changed oh yes i should have known you mrs joyce i have seen you before what you tell me does not explain the disposal of mrs ollnees body she must have gone to her death consciously as if preparing to sleep perhaps she intended only to enter a trance  mrs joyce started she may be in trance now have you thought of that doctor  victors heart bounded at the suggestion do you think it possible he asked excitedly  sill remained unmoved she does not respond to any test im sorry to say life is extinct  the entrance of doctor eberly a tall stooping man with deepset eyes and a sad worn face cut short this explanation eberly was mrs joyces family physician and taking him aside she presented the case  eberly knew doctor sill and together they returned to mrs ollnees bedside while mrs joyce kept victor as far away from their examination as possible  there have been many cases of this deep trance victor and we must not permit the coroner to come till we are absolutely convinced that your mother has gone out never to return  she must come back he cried huskily she did so much for me i want to do something for her  you did a great deal for her my dear boy it was a great joy and comfort to her to see you growing into manhood she was a little afraid of you but she worshiped you all the same your letters were an ecstasy to her  and i wrote so seldom he groaned i was so busy with my games my studies i hardly thought of her if she will only come back to me i will give up everything for her  she understood you victor she was a wonderful little woman lovely in her serene high thought she lived on a lofty plane  i begin to see that he answered contritely i understand her better now  the kindly mrs bowers had slipped away back to her household below and the men of science were still deep in a lowtoned deliberate discussion so that victor and the woman he now knew to be his best friend were left to confront each other in mutual study he was wondering at her interest in him and she was weighing his grief and remorse thinking enviously of his youth and bodily perfection i wish you were my son she uttered wistfully  doctor eberly again approached walking in that quaint sidewise fashion which had made him the subject of jocose remark among his pupils at the medical school  mrs joyce was instant in inquiry how is she doctor  life is extinct he replied with fateful precision  are you sure she demanded  reasonably so one is never sure of anything that concerns the human organism he replied wearily  she warned him you must remember she was accustomed to these trances  so i understand nevertheless this is something more than trance so far as i can determine this body is without a tenant  the tenant may come back she insisted  he looked away i know your faith but i am quite sure all is over rigor mortis has set in  she rose emphatically i have a feeling that you are both mistaken let me see her come victor why do you shrink it is but her garment lying there  she led the way to the bedside and laid her warm plump hands on the pale thin cold and rigid fingers of her friend she stooped and peered into the sightless visage lucy are you present can you see me  doctor sill then said the eyes alone puzzle me the pupils are not precisely  if there is the slightest doubt mrs joyce began  oh i didnt mean to convey that mrs joyce i was merely giving you the exact point  she shall lie precisely as she is till tomorrow announced mrs joyce firmly i have an impression that she wishes to have it so will you permit this she confronted the two physicians will you wait till tomorrow before reporting  doctor eberly considered a moment if you insist mrs joyce and if it is mr ollnees wish  yes yes victor cried ive heard of people being buried alive it is too horrible to think about leave us alone till tomorrow  the physicians conferred apart and at last eberly turned to say it seems to us a perfectly harmless concession we will not report the case till tomorrow doctor sill will call in the morning and decide what further course to take  thank you repeated mrs joyce  after the doctors had gone she turned to victor saying there is nothing for us to do now but to wait if lucy has gone out of her body forever she will manifest to us here in some familiar way if she intends to return she will revive the body and speak from it sometime between now and dawn  she seems to sleep he said and now that his awe and terror were lessened by his hope he was able to study her face more exactly how peaceful she seemsand how little she is  a great soul in a dainty envelope mrs joyce replied would you mind taking my car and going to my home to tell leonora where i am i wish also you would bring mrs post my seamstress back with you shes a good strong kindly soul and will be most helpful today  he consented readily and went away in the car with the bright spring sunlight flooding the world feeling himself snared in an invisible net all thought of leaving the city passed out of his mind he thought only of his mother and of her possible revivification i will fight the world here if only she will return he said  it seemed years since the ball game of saturday wherein he had taken such joyous and honorable part at that time his universe held no sorrow no care no uncertainty now here he sat plunged deep in mystery and confusion face to face with death penniless beleaguered and alone  what would i do without mrs joyce he asked himself she is a wonderful woman strange that in a single hour he should come to lean upon her as upon an elder sister  he suddenly remembered that she had probably come away from home without her breakfast and that she would find not so much as a crust of bread in his mothers kitchen and the thought made him flush with shame what a selfish fool i am he said and seized the speakingtube with intent to order the chauffeur to turn but reflecting that it would take only a few minutes longer to go on he dropped the mouthpiece and the machine whirled steadily forward  as he ran up the wide steps leonora opened the door for him looking very alert and capable her face full of wonder and question how is your mother she quickly tenderly asked  he choked in his reply the doctors say she isdead but your aunt insists that it is only a trance he turned away to hide his tears i am hoping shes right but im afraid that the doctors  is there anything i can do she asked her voice tremulous with sympathy  yes if you will please send mrs post the seamstress over with me we have no one in the house and mrs joyce needs help  i will go too she responded quickly please be seated while i call mrs post have you had breakfast  yes but mrs joyce has not and im afraid there isnt a thing in our house to eat  ill take something over she replied and hastened away  he did not sit he could not even compose himself to stand but walked up and down the hall like a leopard in its cage now and again a liveried servant passed glancing at him curiously but he did not mind mingled with other whirling emotions was a feeling of gratitude toward leonora whose air of conscious superiority had given place for the moment to exquisite gentleness and pity she soon had the seamstress and some lunch bestowed in the car we are ready mr ollnee she called  she said very little during their ride occasionally she made some remark of general significance or spoke to mrs post upon the duties which she might expect to meet and for this reserve victor was grateful she understood him through all his worry though he did not directly study her he was acutely conscious of her every movement her unruffled precision of action her calmness her consideration for his grief appealed to him as something very womanly and sweet  his mothers neighbors had been aroused to a staring heat of interest and from almost every window curious faces peered victor perceived and resented their scrutiny but leonora seemed not to mind she alighted calmly and carried the basket of lunch in her own hands to the stairway though she permitted victor to lead the way  mrs joyce met them with a grave smile you are prompt i am glad to see you leo and you too mrs post we have a long watch before us                                       it was a singular and absorbing vigil to which victor and the three women now set themselves while greek and italian hucksters lamentably howled through the alleys and the milkwagons and grocers carts clattered up the streets they waited upon the invisible and listened for the inaudibleso thin is the line between the prosaic and the mystic  each minute snap or crackle in the woodwork was to mrs joyce a sign that the translated spirit was struggling to manifest itself but the seamstress stolid with years of toil and trouble sat beside the bed with calm gaze fixed upon the small clearcut face half hid in the pillows as if it mattered very little to her whether she watched with the dead or sewed robes of velvet for the living its all in the days work she was accustomed to say  leo with intent to comfort victor told of several notable cases of suspension of animation with which the literature of the orient is filled and victor took this to be as she intended it to be an attempt to comfort and sustain  at times it seemed that he must be dreaming so unreal was the scene and so extraordinary was the composure of these women they had the air of those who await in infinite calm leisure the certain return of a friend now and again mrs joyce rose and looked down upon the motionless form and then perceiving no change resumed her seat from time to time intruders mounted the stairs knocked and getting no reply tramped noisily down again  victor was all for throwing things in their faces but mrs joyce interposed when he looked from the windows he saw grinning faces turned upward and waiting cameras could be seen on the walk opposite ready to snap every living thing that enteredor came fromthe house in truth victor and his friends were enduring a state of siege  at last mrs joyce said nothing is gained by your staying here victor why dont you go for a ride in the park leo take him down to the south side club  victor protested i cannot go for a pleasure trip at such a time as this it is impossible  she met him squarely victor death to me is merely a passing from one plane to another besides i dont think your mother has altogether left us but if she has you can do no good by remaining here mrs post and i are quite sufficient it is a glorious spring day i beg you to go out and take the air it will do you infinite good  if there is nothing i can do here then i ought to resume my search for work he replied sturdily now that i cannot take my mother away with me there is nothing for me to do but to find employment here and face our enemies as best i can  she opposed him there also dont do thatnot now wait i have a plan ill not go into it now but when you come back if there is no change we will all go home and i will explain  the young people had risen and were starting toward the door when an imperative long drawnout rapping startled them  thats no reporters rap there is authority in that remarked mrs joyce as she hurried to the door  a very tall man with a long gray beard stood there goodday madam he began in a husky voice i hear that my friend mrs ollnee is sick and ive come to see about it im her friend these many years and of her faith and i think i can be of some assistance  mrs joyce dimly remembered having seen him in the house before so she replied very civilly mrs ollnee lies in what seems to be deep trance although the doctors say that life is extinct  will you let me see her he inquired i know a great deal about these conditions my daughter was subject to them  you may come in she said for his manner was gentle this is her son victor  victor was vexed by the strangers intrusion but could not gainsay mrs joyce  my name is beebe doctor beebe he explained mrs ollnee has given me many a consoling message and i believe ive been of help to her youre her son eh  i am replied victor shortly  you were the vein of her heart the old man solemnly assured him her guides were forever talking of you and now may i see her  mrs joyce after a moments hesitation led him to the door of the room and stood aside for him to enter after looking down into the silent face for a long time he asked in stately fashion may i make momentary examination of the body  mrs joyce glanced at victor i see no objection to your feeling for her pulse or listening for her breath  i wish to lift her eyelids he explained  you must not touch her victor broke forth two doctors have examined her already why should you  because i too am one of the mystic order i am a healer lifes mysteries are as an open book to me  as he spoke a folded paper appeared to develop out of thin air above the bed and fell gently upon the coverlet  mrs joyce started where did that come from  the healer smiled from the fourth dimension calmly taking up the folded paper he opened it this is a message to you young man  to me victor exclaimed from whom  it is signed nelson  let me see it demanded mrs joyce  what does it say asked victor  mrs joyce handed it to him read it for yourself it is from your grandfather  he read your mother is with us but she will return to you for a little while her work is not yet ended your stubborn neck must bow there is a great mission for you but you must acquire wisdom learn that your plans are nothing your strength puny your pride pitiful we love you but we must chastise you do not attempt to leave the city      nelson  as he stood reading this letter it seemed to victor that a cold wind blew upon him from the direction of his mothers body and his blood chilled this is some of your jugglery he said turning angrily upon beebe  i assure you no replied the healer quietly it came from behind the veil it is a veritable message from the shadow world i may have had something to do with its precipitation for i too am psychic but not in any material way did i aid the guide  the whole affair seemed to victor a piece of chicanery on the part of this intruder and he bluntly said i wish youd go you can do no good here you have no business here  beebe seemed not to take offense its natural in you young fellows to believe only in the world of business and pleasure but youll be taught the pettiness and uselessness of all that your guides have a work for you to do and the sooner you surrender to their will the better you are fighting an invisible but overwhelming power  he addressed mrs joyce this message is conclusive mrs ollnee our divine instrument has not abandoned the body her spirit will return to its envelope soon he turned back to victor as for you young sir there is warfare and much sorrow before you goodday and with lofty wafture of the hand he took himself from the room  not till he had passed entirely out of hearing did victor speak then he burst forth the old fraud i wonder how many more such visitors we are to have i wish we could take her away from this place  we might take her to my house said mrs joyce but i would not dare to do so without the consent of the doctors  did you see how that man produced that message  leo replied it developed right out of the air  it was a direct materialization confessed mrs joyce my own feeling is that your grandfather sent it to assure us of your mothers return  victor silently confronted them his anxiety lost in wonder he had been told spiritualists were an uneducated lot and to have these cultured and intelligent women calmly express their acceptance of a fact so destructive of all the laws of matter as this folded note blinded him he shifted the conversation isnt it horrible that i should be here without a dollar and without a single relative i dont even know that i have a relation in the world my mother told me that she had a brother somewhere in the west but i dont think she ever gave me his address there must be aunts or uncles somewhere in the east but i have never heard from them it seems as though she had kept me purposely ignorant of her family youve been very good and kind to me mrs joyce but i cant ask anything more of you i cant ask you to stay here in this gloomy little hole please go home ill fight it out here some way alone  my dear boy said mrs joyce i insist on staying i cannot leave lucy in her present condition and i refuse to leave you alone she is coming back to you soon and then we will plan for the future as for the message you will do well to take its word to heart it is plainly a warning that you must not leave the city  but mrs joyce think what it involves to believe that that letter dropped out of the air  the world has grown very vast and very mysterious to me she solemnly responded ive had even more wonderful things than that take place in my own home  mrs joyce saw that to go would be best at least for the time and together she and leo went down the stairway and out into the street leaving the stubborn youth to confront his problem alone with the phlegmatic mrs post     vii  the return of the spirit   youth is surrounded by mysterynothing but magic touches him but it is a beautiful natural hopeful magic the mists of morning rise unaccountably the rains of autumn fall without cause the lightning the snows the grasses appear and vanish before the childs eyes like magical conjurations until at last for the most part he accepts these miracles as commonplace because they happen regularly and often in a world that is incomprehensible to the greatest philosopher the lad of twenty comes and goes unmoved by the essential irresolvability of matter  so it had been with victor under instruction he had come to speak of electricity as a fluid of steel as a metal as though calling them by these names explained them he discussed the ether calmly considering it a sort of finely attenuated jelly something which quivered to every blow and was capable of transmitting motion instantaneously sound heat and light were modes of motion he had been told and these words satisfied him food taken into the body produced power and this power was transmitted from the stomach to the brain and from the brain to the muscles and so the limbs were moved but just how the meat and potatoes got finally from the brain to the nerves and so into the swing of a baseball bat did not trouble him why should it  life and age were mere words death he had heard described by clergymen as something to be prepared for a dark and dismal event reserved for old people but which did occasionally catch a man in his arrogant youth generally in the midst of his sins life meant having a good time a succeeding in sport business or love of course certain philosophic phrases like continuous adjustment of the organism to the environment and the change of the organism from the simple to the complex had stuck in his mind but any real thought as to what these changes actually meant had been put aside quite properly for the pastimes and ambitions of the student to whom study is an incidental price for a joyous hour at play  but now here in this room beside the motionless body of his mother he began to think he had a good mind his father had left him a rich legacy in his splendid body but also something mentallatent to this hourwhich produced an irritating impatience with the vague and the mysterious he resented the intrusion of an insoluble element into his thinking he was repelled by the discovery that his mother was abnormal and from the point of view of this ghostroom his life at the university was becoming sweeter more precious more normal every hour  then too his afternoon of reading at the library had put into his mind several new and allpowerful conceptions which had germinated there like the seeds which the indian adept plants in pots of sand rising burgeoning blossoming on the instant he knew the names of some of those men whose words might be counted on the side of his mothers endowment for they were famous in physical or moral science but he had not known before that they admitted any real belief in the kind of things which his mother professed to perform  the conception that the human soul was as the ancients believed a ponderable potent entity capable of separating itself from the body came to him with overwhelming significance if mother still lives he said to the nurse where is she what form has she taken  mrs post in her own way was capable of expressing herself she is not there so much we know her body is here it is like a cloak which she has thrown down she herself is invisible but she will return and take up her body and then you will see it grow warm again and her eyes will light up like lamps and she will rise and speak to you  of course he did not believe this that her body was a castoff garment was easy to comprehend but that her spirit hovered near and would reenter its former habitation was incredible  all day he remained there pacing to and fro or sitting bent and somber over his problem at noon he got a little lunch for himself and for the nurse at two oclock mrs joyce returned to take him for a drive in her car but this he again refused thereupon she went away promising to look in again later in the evening  at dusk he stole down into the street to mail a letter to frensen wherein he had written i am a good deal of a broken reed today but i am going to fight i wish you were here to talk things over with me im surrounded by people who believe in the supernatural and i need some one like yourself to brace me up  this was true he had been thrust into the midst of those who dwelt upon the amazing and the inexplicable in human life the city which had been to him so vast so ugly and so menacing in a material way now became mysterious in an entirely different way he had now a sense of its infinite drama its network of purpose there was some comfort however in the thought that amid these swarms of people his own activities were inconspicuous tomorrow he and his mother would be forgotten in some new sensation  the air was delicately fresh and wholesome and the faces of the girls he met had singular power to comfort him the life of the city sweeping on multitudinously refreshed him like the spray of a mighty torrent foaming amid rocks and shadowed by lofty cañon walls he returned to his vigil stronger and better for this momentary communion with the crowd  mrs joyce came again at nine and insisted on remaining for the night she had quite thrown off her own gloom being perfectly certain in her own mind that lucy ollnee would return with a marvelous story of her wanderings on the other plane  she began to make plans for victor subject she said to revision by your guides  youve said that before he retorted but i have no guides i dont believe in guides and i dont intend to be ruled by a lot of spooks  be careful she warned they know your every thought and they may resent your attitude  well let them what do i care suppose for arguments sake that these voices do come from my father and my grandfather what do they know of this great city they were country folks how can they direct me in what i am to do  they know a great deal better than any of us  but how can they  because they are free from the limitations of the flesh  i dont see how that is going to help them their minds are just the same as they were arent they  indeed no we grow inconceivably in knowledge and power to discern the moment we drop the flesh  i dont see why if they are existing theyre in a world so different from this that their experience here wont help them over there and their experience over there is of no value to us here and even if it were they could not express it  during their talk the night had deepened into darkness and now as they reached a pause in their discussion a measured rapping could be heard as though some one were striking with a small wand upon the brass rod of the bed  without knowing exactly why a thrill very like fear passed over victor but mrs joyce smiled they are here dont you hear them they want to communicate with us  the youths high heart sank his boyish dread of darkness began to people this deathchamber with monstrous shadows with malignant forces he was very grateful for the presence of this cheery and undismayed believer in the spirit world without her he would have been panicstricken  she rose to enter the bedroom and he followed as far as the threshold  it was very dark in there and for a moment he could see nothing could hear nothing then a faint whisper made itself distinctly audible just above his head victor my boy it said  he did not reply for a moment and mrs joyce eagerly called did you hear that whisper victor  yes i heard it he replied  it was lucy was it you lucy asked mrs joyce  yes came the answer  are you still out of the body lucy  yes  what shall we do  wait  is there anything you want to say to victor  no not now father will speak  silence again fell and in this pause mrs joyce took the chair which stood close beside the bed and motioned victor to another near the foot he sat with thrilling nerves moved trembling in spite of himself the room was now quite dark save for a faint patch of light on the ceiling and another on the carpet his mothers body could not be distinguished from the covering of the bed  as they waited a singular cold and aromatic breeze began to blow over the bed from the dark corner and then a small brilliant bluish flame arose near the sleepers head and floating upward to the ceiling vanished silently it was like the flame of a candle twisted and leaping in a breeze  the spirit light exclaimed mrs joyce ecstatically wasnt it beautiful and see there is a hand holding it she whispered as another flame arose cant you see it  i see the light but no hand he replied  i can see more i see the dim form of an old man outlined on the wall it must be your grandsire nelson blodgett am i right she asked apparently of the dark  victor could now perceive a thin bluish wavering shape like a cloud of cigar smoke and from this a whisper seemed to come strong and clear yes i have come to speak to my grandson  dont you see him now asked mrs joyce  i see nothing he repeated and as he spoke the misty shape vanished  but you heard the whisper did you not mrs joyce persisted  he did not reply to her but rose and bent above his mother mother did you speak he asked  mrs joyce excitedly restrained him sit down you must not touch her now  why not  because it is very dangerous while the spirits are using her organism  i dont know what you mean he retorted angrily i know that that voice sounded exactly like my mothers voice and i want to know  silence foolish boy was sternly breathed into his ear  a cloud passed over the sky and as the room became perfectly black a fluttering grayblue cloud developed out of the darkest corner it had the movement of steamwreaths with each convolution faintly edged with light at one moment it resembled a handful of lines fine as cobweb looping and waving as if blown upward from below and the next moment it floated past like the folds of some exquisite drapery lifting and falling in gentle undulations at last it rose to the height of a man drifted across the bed and there hung poised over the head of the sleeper as it swung there for an instant victor could plainly detect a mans figure and face his eyelids were closed and his features vague but his chin and the spread of his shoulders were clearly defined who are you victor demanded as if the apparition were an intruder  the answer came in a flat toneless voice neither male nor female in quality i am your father  victor leaped up impulsively his hair on end with fright and the apparition vanished precisely as though an open door had been closed between it and the observer  again mrs joyce clutched him be careful sit down dont stir  somebody is playing a joke on me he insisted hotly im going to strike a light  again a voice this time almost fulltoned but with a metallic accompaniment as though it had passed through a horn poured into his ear you shall bow to our wisdom  he braced himself to receive a blow and answered through his set teeth i will not i am master of myself and i dont intend to take orders from you  you are fighting great powers you will fail the voice replied your heart is defiant expect punishment  victor threw out his left hand in rage it came into contact with something in the air something light and hollow which fell crashing to the floor and a faint gasping indrawn breath from the sleeper on the bed followed it for an instant all was silent then mrs joyce cried out  she has returned your mother has returned dont strike a light wait a moment she moved forward a little may i touch her she asked  victor thought she was speaking to him but before he could reply the invisible one whispered yes approach slowly  mrs joyce laid her hand on the sleepers brow shes warmer victor shes breathing she has certainly come back to us  approach whispered the voice in victors ear  he moved forward now in awe and wonder and stood beside the bed slowly the room lightened and out of the darkness the pallid face of his mother developed like the shadowy figures on a photographic plate she was lying just as before save for one hand which mrs joyce had taken he laid his own vital magnetic palm upon her arm and finding it still cold and pulseless called out  mother do you hear me it is victor  her fingers moved slightly in response and this minute sign of life melted his heart he fell upon his knees beside her bed weeping with gratitude and joy     viii  victor repairs his mothers altar   in consenting to the removal of his mother to mrs joyces home victor had no intention of receding from his position on the contrary he considered it merely a temporary measurefor the night or at most for a few days he entered the car thinking only of her wishes and when he watched her sink to sleep in her spacious and luxurious bed under mrs joyces generous roof he couldnt but feel relieved at the thought that she was safe and on the way back to health it was only when he left her and went to his own splendid chamber that his nervousness returned  every day every hour plunged him deeper into debt to these strangers and the fact that they were treating him like a young duke was all the more disturbing he fancied carew saying of him as he had said of another oh hes merely one of mrs joyces pensioners and the thought caused him to burn with impatience  nevertheless he slept and in the morning he forgot his perplexities in the joy of taking his breakfast with leonora he admired her now so intensely that his own weakness irresolution and inactivity seemed supine he was impatient to be doing something his hands and his brain seemed empty with no games no tasks he was disordered lost  they were alone at the table these young people and naturally fell to discussing mrs ollnees marvelous return to life this led him to speak of his own plans my course at winona fitted me for nothing he acknowledged bitterly i should have gone in for something like mechanical engineering but i didnt i had some fool notion of being a lawyer and mother i can see now was all for having me a preacher of her faith so here i am helpless as a blind kitten  it was proof of his essential charm that leonora not only endured his renewed harping on this harsh string but encouraged him to continue i know you chafe she said i had that feeling till i began my course in cooking and just to assure myself that i am not entirely useless and helpless in the world im now going in for a training as a nurse  a nurse he exclaimed oh that explains something  what does it explain  i wondered how you could be so calm and so efficient yesterday  she seemed pleased was i calm and efficient well thats one result of my study i can at least keep my head when anything goes wrong  i dont think i like your being a trained nurse he said  she smiled dont you why not  youre too fine for that he answered slowly you were made to command not to serve you should be the queen of some castle  his frankly expressed admiration did not embarrass her she accepted his words as if they came from a boy castles are said to be draughty and dreadfully hard to keep in order and besides a queens retainers are always getting sick or killed or something so i think ill keep on with my training as a nurse  but there must be a whole lot of unpleasant nasty drudgery about it  sickness isnt nice ill admit but there is no place in the world where care and sympathy mean so much  you dont intend to go out and nurse among strangers  i may  i bet you dontnot for long some fellow will come along and say no more of that and then youll stay home  what sort of fiction do you read she asked with the air of an older sister  the truthful sort your nursing is nothing but a fad  what a wise old graybeard you are  he was nettled you need not take that superior tone with me im two years older than you are  and ten years wiser i suppose you would declare if you dared  i didnt say that  no your tone was enough i admit you know a great deal more about baseball than i do  he winced that was a sidewinder all right if i knew as much about the carpenters trade or the sale of dry goods as i do about the national game id stand a chance of earning my board  why not join the league she suggested they pay good wages i believe  he took this seriously i thought of that but even if i could get into a league team which is hardly probable it wouldnt lead anywhere you see im getting up an ambition i want to be rich and powerful  football players have always been my adoration she responded heartily youd look splendid in harness why dont you go in for that  you may laugh at me now he replied bluntly but give me ten years  mercy ill be too old to admire even a football captain by that time  youll be only thirtyone  she sobered a little men have the advantage you will be young at thirtythree and ill bewell a matron no im afraid i cant wait that long i must find my admirable shortstop or halfback whichever he is to be long before that  he changed his tone and appealed to her seriously really now what can i do so long as this persecution of my mother keeps up im in for a share of it i cant run away for i promised i wouldnt so i remain like a turkey with a string to his leg walking round and round my little stake what would you do in my place come now be good and tell me  she responded to his appeal dont be impatient thats the first thing be resigned to this luxury for a few days the voices will tell you what to do they may be planning a surprise for you  all i ask of them is to quit the job and let me plan things for myself he slowly protested  the entrance of mrs wood senior ended their dialogue and he went away with a sense of having failed to win leos respect and confidence as he had hoped to do she considers me a kid he muttered discontentedly but she will change her mind one of these days  he spent the morning with his mother but toward noon he grew restless and went down into the library wherein he had observed several bound volumes of the report of the psychical society he fell to reading a long article upon multiple personality and followed this by the close study of an essay on hysteria and when mrs joyce called him to lunch he was like a man awakened from deep sleep these articles filled with new and bewildering conceptions of the human organism were after all entirely materialistic in their outcome personality was not a unit but a combination and the whole discussion served but to throw him into mental confusion and dismay  at lunch mrs joyce proposed that they all take an automobile ride round the city and end up with a dinner at the club and seeing no chance for doing anything along the line of securing employment victor consented to the expedition  the weather was glorious and the troubled youths brain cleared as if the sweet cool lake wind had swept away the miasma which his experience of the darker side of the city had placed there he surrendered himself to the pleasure the luxury of it recklessly how could he continue to brood over his future with a lovely girl by his side and a sweet and tender spring landscape unrolling before him  they fairly belted the city in their run and in the end as they went sweeping down the curving driveway of the lake mrs ollnees face was delicately pink and her eyes were bright with happiness to her son she seemed once more the lovely and delicate figure of his boyhoods admiration it seemed that her deathlike trance had been a horrible dream  the ride the clubhouse the dinner were all luxurious to the point of bewilderment to victor but he did not betray his uneasiness he was only a little more silent a little more meditative as he took his place at the finely decorated table in the pavilion which faced upon the water he determined for the day at least to accept everything that came his way this recklessness completely dominated him as he looked across the board at leonora so radiant with health and youth  no one would have detected anything morbid in mrs ollnee she was prettily dressed and not in the least abnormal and victor was proud of her even though he knew that her dresses were earned by a sort of necromancy  mrs joyce carefully avoided any discussion of his problem and the dinner ended as joyfully at it began they rode home afterward under the bright half moon silent for very pleasure in the beautiful night  the park was full of loiterers two and two and on the benches under the trees others sat two and two together it was matingtime for all the world and victors blood was astir as he turned toward the stately girl whose face had driven out all others as the moon drowns out the stars his audacity of the morning was gone however he looked at her now with a certain humble appeal his subjugation had begun  at the house they all lingered for an hour on the back porch which looked out upon a little formal garden two slender trees stood there and their silken rustling filled in the pauses of the conversation like the conferring voices of a distant multitude of infant seraphim  those must be cottonwoods victor remarked  they are replied mrs joyce i love them when i was a child i used to visit a farmhouse in whose yard were two tall trees of this sort and their murmur always filled me with mystical delight i used to lie in the grass under them hour by hour trying to imagine what they were saying to me ever since i had a place of my own ive had cottonwoodtrees in my yard i know theyre a nuisance with their fuzz but i love their rustling  as she paused the leaves uttered a pleased murmur and victor listening with a new sense of the sentiment which his hostess concealed in a plump and unimposing form thought he heard a sibilant whispered word in his car victor it said i love you  he turned quickly toward his mother but she seemed not to be listening and a moment later she spoke to mrs joyce uttering some pleasant commonplace about the night  this whisper was so clear so unmistakable that victor could not doubt its reality the question was which of the women had spoken it he had a foolish wish to believe that leo had uttered it he listened again but heard nothing  as he was helping his mother slowly up the stairs to her room he said this is all very beautiful mother but i cant enjoy it as i ought i feel like a fraud every time i see mrs joyce handing out one of those big bills i suppose she can afford it but i cant we must get back to the old place or to some new place and live on our own resources  we cant do that till morning dear let us wait until the voices speak they have been silent today perhaps they will advise us tomorrow  here was the place to tell her of the whispers he had heard but he could not bring himself to do so  she went on i wish you would repair my table your grandfathers table as you promised victor i dont know why but it helps me but you must be careful not to use any metal about it  why not  oh thats another one of the mysteries they seem to object to metal  well ill get at it tomorrow he said and kissing her goodnight went to his own room  he was awake and dressed before six the next morning and leaving a note for mrs joyce set out for california avenue on the way he dropped into a cheap café and got a breakfast which cost him twenty cents he enjoyed this keenly because as he said it was in his class and was paid for out of the money his mother had given him for his trophy  all was quiet at the flat and setting to work on the table with glue and stout cord he soon had it on its legs looking down upon it as a completed job he marveled at the reverence which his mother seemed to have for it and his mind reverted to the astounding phenomena which he himself had witnessed over its top  picking up one of the folded slates he opened it with intent to see if it held any hidden springs or false surfaces out fluttered a folded paper this he snatched up and studied with interest it was a peculiar sort of parchment veined like a bit of cornhusk and on it written in delicate and beautiful script were these words go to room 70 harwood bldg today danger threatens altair  i wonder who altair is he mused staring at the bit of paper and what is the danger that threatens  while still he stood debating whether to go downtown or to warn his mother a heavy step on the stairs announced a visitor the man for it was plainly the tread of a man and a fat man knocked on the door but did not pause for reply are you there lucy he called and came in  victor faced him with instant resentment of this familiarity who are you what do you want here he demanded  the other a tall clumsy broadfaced individual in costly clothing seemed surprised and a little alarmed i came to see mrs ollnee he explained who are you  i am her sonand i want to know how you dare to push into my mothers house like this  my name is pettus he answered pacifically no doubt youve heard your mother speak of me  oh yes responded the youth i heard mr carew speak of you youre president of that transportation company theyre all so wild about  a shade of apprehension passed over pettuss fat ugly face carew youve seen him i suppose he gave me a bad name but never mindwhere will i find your mother  victor didnt like the man and he remained silent till pettus repeated his question then he answered i cant tell you where my mother is  you mean you wont  well yes thats what i do mean  pettus turned away i can find her without your aid  what do you want with her  i want a sitting at once  you keep away from her victor blazed out i dont want her sitting for you shes mixed up too deeply in your affairs already carew said  i dont care what carew saidand i dont care whether you approve of your mothers sitting for me or not her controls will decide that question  he tramped out and down the stairway and from the window victor saw him whirl away in his automobile that mans a scoundrel and a slob he said a greasy old slob i will not have my mother sitting for such people cant i head him off somehow  with sudden resolution he ran down the stairway and over to the telephone booth on the corner he got the butler at once and was deeply relieved to find that his mother was out with mrs joyce he cant see her before i do he concluded as he hung up the receiver ill go over there and wait for her to return  as he neared the house he met leo coming out with some letters in her hand and with the swift resiliency of youth he asked if he might not walk with her  certainly she said i want to talk with you about your plans  i havent any plans he said  what have you been doing this morning  he hesitated a moment then answered ive been mending that old tablei suppose you heard about my smashing it  yes and it seemed a very childish thing to do  if you knew how i hate that business and everything connected with it  i do and it seems absurd to me your mothers life is very wonderful and very beautiful to me  he changed the subject did that man pettus call just now  yes  hes a scoundrelthat chap a fourflusher  what makes you think that  well the very looks of the man  she laughed he isnt pretty but hes a very decent citizenand has a lovely wife and two daughters  hes a slobhis face gives him awayand besides mr carew the other night  i know she interrupted mr carew is sure were all going to be ruined by your mother and the universal transportation company  i hope you havent put your money into anything pettus has control of  oh dont lets talk business on a morning like this its criminallets talk about trees and birds and flowers she might have added and love for when youth and springtime meet even on a city boulevard love is the most important subject in the encyclopedia of life so they walked and talked and jested in the way of young men and maidens and victor talked of himself finding his lifehistory vastly absorbing when discussed by a tall girl with a splendid profile and a cultivated voice he watched her buy her stamps at the drugstore finding in her every movement something adorable the poise of her bust and her fine head appealed to him with power but her humor her cool clear gaze checked the crude compliments which he was moved to utter she could not be addressed as he had been accustomed to address his girl classmates at winona  this walk completed the severance of the ties which bound him to the university his desire to return to his games weakened his ambition to shine as an athlete faded he wished to prove to this proud girl that he was neither boy nor dreamer and that he was competent to take care of himself and his mother as well  as they were reentering the house he said dont utter a word of what ive told you im going to test whether my mother has the power to read my mind or not  i understand she returned and im glad youre going to share in our séance tonight  he frowned dont say séance i hate that word  she laughed arent you fierce but ill respect your prejudices so far as an utterly unprejudiced person can  do you call yourself an unprejudiced person  i try to be  but youre not you have a prejudice against me he insisted forcing the personal note  oh youre quite mistaken she replied in fact i think youre rather nicefor a boy and she went away leaving him to fume under this indignity  mrs joyce and mrs ollnee came in soon afterward and they all took tea together quite as casually as if they were not on the edge of something very thrilling and profoundly mysterious mrs joyce politely asked victor what he had been doing but his answers were evasive he made no mention of pettus though he was burning with desire to warn her against him  soon afterward they went to his mothers room and once safely inside the door he turned upon her mother are you going to sit for pettus tonight  i expect him but im not sitting for him specially  i wont have him in the circle he is a slimy old beast i hate himand mr carew warned us against him he wasnt guessing mother he knows that this old fourflusher is up to some deviltry how did he find you  he called us up  i simply will not have him sit with you again and you must not advise any one to put a cent into his concern where are you going to have this performance  i thought of sitting here but i need the old table you mended it didnt you  yes i mended it  and you had a message from altair  how did you learn that  i felt it she answered gravely she said danger threateneddid she tell you what the danger was  no who is altair supposed to be  she is a very pure and high spirita girl of wonderful beautyso they say i have never seen her myselfshe told me today that she would watch over you  at this moment a whisper was heard in the air just above her head  lucy  yes father  take the boysitthe old place leave pettus out  yes father  i will be there pettus is under investigation  much obliged said victor and then he heard close to his ear a faint whisper victor you shall see mealtair  he was staring straight at his mothers lips at the moment and yet he was unable to detect any visible part in the production of the voice she explained the whisper altair is smiling at you she says she will be with us tonight  all this was very shocking to victor utterly disconcerted and unable to confront her at the moment he left the room the whole problem of her mental condition the central kernel of her philosophy was involved in that one whisper to solve that was to solve it all it was not so much a question of how she did it it was a question of her right to deceive him  he seized the time between tea and dinner to return to the library for an hour he dug into the spongy soil of metaphysics and it happened that he fell at last upon the crookes and zöllner experiments quoted at greater length in a volume of collected experience and found there clear and direct testimony as to the minds mastery of matter there was abundant evidence of the handling of fire by the medium home and slades ability to float in the air was attested by wellknown witnesses but beyond this and closer to his own day he came upon a detailed study of an italian psychic with her supernumerary hands a story which should have made the materialization of a letter seem very simple but it did not all the testimony of these great men abundant as it was slid from his mind as harmlessly as water from oiled silk apparently it failed to alter the texture of his thought in the slightest degree his world was the world of youth the good old wholesome stable world and he refused to be convinced  at dinner he was angered in spite of leos presence by his mothers returning confidence and ease of manner his own position had been weakened he felt by his acquiescence in the sitting his desire to satisfy himself to solve his mothers mystery had led him to abandon his stern resolutionand he regretted it he ate sparingly and took no wine being resolved to retain a perfectly clear head for the evenings experiment he was grateful to leo for keeping the talk on subjects of general interest even though he had little part in it and his liking for her deepened  as he neared the test he began to sharply realize that for the first time in all his life he was about to take part in one of his mothers hated performances and his breath was troubled by the excitement of it i will make this test conclusive he said to himself and his jaw squared there will be no nonsense tonight  the papers of the day had remained free from any further allusion to the spiritual bloodsuckers and it really seemed as if the cloud might be lifting and this consideration made his participation in the sitting all the more like a return to a lower and less defensible position he was irritated by the methodical action with which his mother proceeded to set the stage for her farce wood who seemed quite at home assisted in these preparations leaving victor leaning in sullen silence against the wall  mrs joyce took a seat directly opposite the little psychic wood sat at her left while victor with leo at his right completed the little crescent mrs ollnee with her small battered table before her faced them across its top victor made no objection to this arrangement but kept an alert eye on every movement he watched her closely she first breathed into one of the horns and put it beside her then held one of the slates between her palms for a little time i hope this will be illuminated tonight she said  this remark gave victor a twinge of disgust and bewildered pain she is too little and sweet and fine to be the high priest of such jugglery he thought but did not cease his watchful attention even for an instant  the locking of the door the turning out of the light and the taking hands in the good old traditional way all irritated and wellnigh estranged him why should his life be thrown into the midst of such cheap and illodored drama this shall never happen again he vowed beneath his breath  there was not much talk during the first halfhour for the reason that victor was too selfaccusing to talk and the others were too solemn and too eager for results to enter upon general conversation for the most part they spoke in low voices and waited and listened  the first indication of anything unusual aside from the tapping was a breeze a deathly cold wind which began to blow faintly over the table from his mother bearing a peculiar perfume an odor like that from some oriental rug which grew in power till each of the sitters remarked upon it this current of air continued so long and so uninterruptedly that victor began to wonder could it be his mothers breath if she were not fraudulently producing it then it must be that some window had been opened the network of her deceitif it was deceitthickened  mrs joyce then said in a low voice we are to have celestial visitors tonight that is the wind which accompanies the astral forms  yes said leo and that perfume always accompanies altair are we to see altair she softly asked  a sibilant whisper replied yes soon  a moment later another and distinctly different voice called softly my son  who is it asked victor  your father  what have you to say to me  the power of the mind is limitless the whispered voice replied matter the strongest steel is but a form of motion  what is all that to me asked victor  as you think so you will be be strong and constant  the vagueness of all this increased victors irritation what about pettus  the voice hesitated weakened a little i cant tellnot nowi will ask  what followed did not come clearly and consecutively to victor for mrs joyce who was expert in hearing and reporting the whispers repeated each sentence or the substance of it to him but he himself heard a considerable part of it in the very midst of a sentence the voice stopped it was as if a wire had been cut or the receiver hung up the silence was like death itself  victor called out to his mother can you hear the voices mother they seem to come from where you are  she did not reply and mrs joyce explained she is gone  again the cold breeze set in with a strong steady swell and with it was borne a low humming note which grew in volume and depth till it resembled the roaring rush of a november blast through the branches of an oak it became awesome at last with its majesty of moaning song and saddening with its somber suggestion of autumn and of death it opened the shabby little room upon an empty and limitless space upon an infinite and vacant and obscure desert wherein night and storms contended it died away at last leaving the air chill and pulseless and the chamber darker than before  before any comment could be made upon this astounding phenomenon victor perceived a faint glow of phosphorus upon the table it increased in brilliancy till it presented a clearcut square of some greenish glowing substance and then a large hand in a ruffled sleeve appeared above it as if in the act of writing  it is watts whispered leo he is writing for us  bending forward victor was able to read this message outlined in dark script on the glowing surface of what seemed to be the slate the dreams of today are the realities of tomorrow these words faded and again the shadowy hand swept over the table and this companion sentence followed the realities of today will be but the halftruths or the gross errors of the future      watts  victor was strongly tempted to clutch this hand but fear of something unpleasant prevented him from doing so he was sick with apprehension with dread of what might happen next a feeling of guilt of remorse came upon him i am to blame for this he thought and was on the point of rising and calling for the lights when something happened which changed not merely his feeling at the moment but the whole course of his life so incredible so destructive of all physical laws of all his scientific training was the phenomenon a hand large and shapely took up the glowing slate and held it like a lamp to his mothers face so that all might see her she sat with hands outspread upon the table her head thrown back her eyes closed her arms extended in rigid lines it seemed that the invisible ones desired to prove to victor that his mother could not and was not holding the slate  swift as light the glowing mirror disappeared and then as if through a window opened in the air before his eyes victor perceived a strange face confronting him the face of a girl with deep and tender eyes incredibly beautiful her eyes were in shadow but the pure oval of her cheeks the dainty grace of her chin the broad full brow and something ineffably pure in the faintly happy smile stopped his breath with awe he forgot his mother his problems his doubts in study of the unearthly beauty of this vision  mrs joyce whispered in ecstasy it is altair  the angelic lips parted and a low voice so gentle it was like the murmur of a leaf replied yes it is altair and to victor her voice was of exquisite delicacy believe be faithful  no one breathed it was as if they had been permitted to gaze upon one of heavens angelic choir how came she there who was she before these questions could be framed she disappeared silently as a bubble on the water leaving behind only that delicious subtle unaccountable odor as of tropic fruits and unknown flowers  leo breathing a sigh of sad ecstasy exclaimed is she not beautiful never has she shown herself more glorious than tonight  victor was like one drugged and dreaming there was no question of his mothers honesty in his mind he did not relate the vision to her and he winced with pain as leo spoke he wished to recall the face to hear that whisper again the effect upon him was enormous instant unfolding in all his life nothing mystic nothing to disturb or rouse his imagination had hitherto come to him and now this transcendent marvel this face born of the invisible and intangible essence of the air beat down his selfassurance and destroyed his smug conception of the universe he lost sight of his hypothesis and accepted altair for what she seemed a gloriously beautiful soul of another world a world of purity and light and love  he remained silent as mrs joyce rose and went to his mother he was still in his seat when they turned up the lights leo spoke to him but he did not answer strange transformation at the moment her voice jarred upon him she seemed commonplace prosaic in contrast with the woman who had looked upon him from the luminous shadow  gradually the walls he hated the entangling relationship he feared returned upon him and though he realized something of the revealing character of his reticence he had not the will to break it he watched his mother return to her normal self with such detachment that she at last became aware of it and lifted her feeble hands in search of him victor come to me she pleaded  he went to her then still in a daze and to her question did your father come he replied brokenly a voice came but i cant talk about that nowi must go out into the air  all perceived the tumultthe strange psychic condition into which he had been thrown and were considerate enough to refrain from pressing him with inquiry he has been touched by the power whispered mrs joyce to leo hes under conviction  the cool clear air and the material rush of the city throbbing in upon his brain restored the youth to something like his normal self but he remained silent and distraught all the way home  as they entered the hall leo glanced at his face with unsmiling penetrating intensity and in that moment perceived that victor the boy had given place to victor the man she experienced a swift change of relationship and a pang of jealousy shot through her heart she realized that the wondrous spirit face was the power that had so wrought upon and transformed him she too had thrilled to the mystical beauty of the phantom and she had read in the tremulous lips the hesitating whisper a love for the young mortal which had troubled her at the moment and which became more serious to her now  they said goodnight as strangers he absorbed absentminded she resentful and a little hurt  to his mother when they were alone in her room he said haltingly mother you must forgive me i thought you did those thingsunconsciously cheatingbut nowigive it up i believe in you absolutely  she raised her eyes to his wet with happy tears my son my splendid boy she said and in her voice was song     ix  the laws delay   belief says the wise man is not a matter of evidence it is a habit of mind and notwithstanding his confession of inward transformation victor found doubt still hidden deep in his brain when he woke the following morning his conviction had been temporary  in his musing upon altair he began to remember some very curious details he recalled that at first glance he had inwardly exclaimed how much she looks like leo the lips and chin were similar only sadder sweeterand the poise of the head was like hers also but the brow and the eyes were more like his mothers it was as though altair were at once the heavenly sister of leonora and the spirit daughter of his mother and the love which lay on the tremulous lips the deep serious eyes moved him still with almost undiminished power he was eager to see the celestial face again  he was less clear about his own physical condition at the time he remembered feeling weak and chilled as though some of his own vitality had gone out of his blood in the attempt to warm that unaccountable being into life he recalled his parting with his mother as if it were the incident in a painful dream it was all impossible incredible and yetit happened  his morning mood was eager and searching he was quite ready to see leo ready to talk with her of all that had taken place hitherto he had avoided any detailed story of his mothers evocations but now he was violently curious to know whether or no she had ever performed these particular rites before he wished to hear all that leo had to say and he was deeply disappointed when neither she nor his hostess appeared at the breakfast table  he finished his meal hurriedly as soon as it became evident that he was to be alone and instead of going downtown returned to the library to reread the famous story of sir william crookes and katie kingevery word of which had acquired new meaning to him he thrilled now to the calm bald narrative reading between the lines the inner story of the great scientists bewildered love for the stainless vision which he had evoked but could not endow with lasting life  the boy dwelt upon the scene of their parting with peculiar pain perceiving in it new pathos a throb of sorrow came into his throat was altair but a transitory flower of the darkaloof intangible and sad what meant the wistful sweetness of her smile was she unhappy in the icy realms from which she came did she long for human companionship would she come again he found himself longing for the night and another sitting with his mother he felt vaguely the disappointment which comes to those who listen to the messages of these celestial apparitions so commonplace so vaporous so inane katie king surpassing all earthly women in her physical loveliness brought no sentence of intellectual distinction from the mysterious void which was her home  in the midst of this astounding narrative he heard leos voice in the hall and with a guilty start put his book away and rose to meet her remembering that he had not treated her very well after the sitting though he could not recall the precise reason for it gradually her step the sound of her voice reasserted their charm and he returned to the breakfastroom like a boy who has been sullen and knows it but hopes to be forgiven  his shamefaced entrance disarmed her resentment and in her merry smile of greeting the dream face faded away the marvelous vision of the night lost its dominion over him and he became again the son of the morning  the girl openly mocked him you look pale and sheepish what have you been doing  ive been reading about katie king do you believe that story  we must believe it when a man like sir william crookes tells it do you believe what you saw and heard last night  no i dont how can i  you seemed to believe in the vision of altair she persisted eying him archly you were carried away by her wonderful beauty i dont blame you her loveliness is beyond anything on this earth a vision like that of sublimated womanhood purified of all its dross is very hard on us mortals altair doesnt find it necessary to eat eggs and toast as i am doing this minute im a horribly vulgar and common creature i know and i ought to apologize but i wont i like being a normal human being and if you dont like to see me eat you may go away  i like nothing better than to see you eat and ive just had a couple of eggs myself i was hoping all the time you would come down and join me but you didnt  i didnt get to sleep as usual last night she confessed with a change of tone altair came to me and kept me stirred up till nearly two oclock  what do you mean  i mean she hung about my bed tapping and sighing incessantly for what seemed like hours  could you see her  part of the time finally i turned up the light and got rid of her  he sat in silence for a few moments then burst out wildly are we all going crazy together when i hear you talk like that it makes me angry and it makes me sad i never met such people before what does it all mean seems like everybody around my mother is bitten by this ghostbug  you too she accused you caught a little of the madness last night  i did i admit it but im going to throw it off i wont have any more of it  is your curiosity satisfied  no it is not but im not going to desert the good old sunny world i know for the kind of windy graveyard we faced last night even the eyes of altair were sad did you notice it  yes i did she admitted and thats one of the things i cant understand the spirits all say they are happy but they look wistful and their voices indicate that they are filled with longing to return  im going to break out of this circle of my mothers converts he passionately declared ive got to do it or ll get all twisted out of shape like the rest of you im going to try again today to reach some man who has never heard of a psychic im going to some big mill and apply for manual labor theres something uncanny in the way im kept circling around mothers cranky patrons ill get batty in the steeple if i dont get help lets go out for a walk in the park lets forget were immortal souls for an hour or two i want to see a tree lets go to the ball gameand to the theater tonightthatll take all the money i have left and leave me just square with the world so i can jump into the lake tomorrow without anybody elses money in my pocket come what do you say  she perceived something more than humor in his noisy declamation and accepted his challenge ill go you she slangily replied just wait till i get my walkingtogs on  youve got to hurry he warned im going to get out of this house before anything crazy happens to me meet me down at the corner of the boulevard  he left the room with intent to avoid both his mother and mrs joyce at the moment he wished to remove himself from any further argument and his longing for the trees and the park was a genuine reaction from his long stress of the supernatural my search for a job can go over till tomorrow he decided  he was sufficiently recovered from his bewilderment his pain of the night before to glow with pleasure as he saw leonora swinging along toward him she carries herself well he said  she was dressed in a lightgray skirt and jacket and her white hat had a long gray quill which waved back over the rim giving her the jaunty air of a yacht under reefed sail her face was brilliant with color and her eyes were alight with humor aunt louise wanted to know where we were going and i said st joe michigan  he pretended not to see the joke st joe why st joe  as she caught his stride she demurely answered if you dont know its not for me to explain  i suppose people do go to st joe for other purposes than marriage  it is possible but they never get into the newspapers we only hear of the young things who beat their angry parents by just one boat she changed her tone where shall we go  i dont object to st joe  she pretended to be shocked how sudden you are weve only known each other two days  three however we might make it a trial marriage you could put me on probation  after your display of inconstancy last night i wouldnt trust you even for a probationary engagement  he harked back to the vision of altair she was beautiful wasnt she did she really exist or was it merely some sort of hallucination  i thought you werent going to discuss these subjects  he assented instantly quite right give me a crack on the ear every time i break out i wish i were a robin see that chap on the lawn his clothes grow of themselves and as for food all he has to do is to tap on the ground and out pops a worm  i prefer roast beef and asparagus tips and as for wearing the same feathers all the timehorrible  in such wise they talked touching lightly on a hundred trivial subjects yet carrying the remembrance of altair as an undertone to every word they walked up the boulevard to the midway then through the park to the lagoon and the sight of the water cheered victor a boat he cried us for a boatride  he was a skilled and powerful oarsman she had never seen his equal and his bared arms the roll of his splendid muscles were a delight to her eyes  he exulted as the water cried out under the keel this is what i needed ive been without a chance to kill something or beat somebody for three or four days i am cracking for lack of exercise walking isnt exercise  the heavy boat under his sweeping strokes cut through the water like a canoe and the girl on the stern seat watched him with dreaming eyes her air of patronization lost in contemplation of his skill her hands on the tillerrope her attitude of ease and irresponsibility typifying the american woman just as his intense and driving action represented the american man  he traversed the entire length of the lagoon before his need of muscular activity was met then they drifted exclaiming with pleasure over the charming vistas which every turn of their boat afforded the catbirds were singing in the willows and the banks were white and yellow with flowering shrubs and over all the clear sunlight fell in cascades of gold the wind was from the lake cool but not chill and every leaf glistened as if newly burnished the day was perfect spring and under its influence the two beings young and ardent inclined irresistibly toward each other  the girl who up to this moment had been indifferent not so say scornful of the advances of men gave herself up to the pleasure which the companionship of this young giant afforded her altair and all that she represented were very far and faint dimmed burned away into nothingness by the vivid sun of this entrancing day  for hours they explored the lagoons talking nonsense the divine nonsense of youth or sitting idly and gazing at each other with the newborn frankness of lovers at last she said im hungry arent you  as a wolf he responded  shall we go home  home i have no home no lets camp right here in the park there must be a lunch counter somewhere  theres something better than a lunch counter theres the german building  ill stand you for a beer and sandwich he shouted show it to me  returning the boat to the landing he paid his fee with a satisfied smile i never gave up fortyfive cents with better grace in my life he said to her  she led the way to the café in the german building and there they ate and drank in modest fashion while he expressed his gratitude for her guidance i owe you all ive got he declared displaying his little handful of money youve shown me another side of the citys life it isnt so bad this wild life of chicago well come again will you come again he bent a frankly pleading gaze upon her  indeed i will i love it here but aunt louise prefers to ride about in the car however you havent seen all the park yet you must see the prairies at the south end and the spanish caravels the conventall the marine side of it lets walk down the beach  he was glad to accept her guidance in this matter also and they set off down the curving walk slowly as if they found each new rood of ground more enjoyable than that already traversed he had a feeling that nothing so sweet so perfect as this days companionship could ever again come to him and he lingered over each view as if determined to extract its every possible phase of enjoyment and when two paths presented themselves he shamelessly advised taking the longer one so they came to the old convent to the caravels in the south lagoon and at last to the sand hills this was the climax of their walk these dunes were so different from anything he had ever seen so remote so suggestive and so flooded with the light of his own growing romance that they seemed of another and strangely beautiful land  taking seats upon the grass in the sunlight which was just warm enough to be delightful they absorbed the scene in silence entranced by the sails the far waterline the sun the wind and the fluting of the birds the few people who drifted by were unimportant as shadows and leo took no thought of time till a cloud crossed the sun and the wind felt suddenly chill then she rose we must go home or theyll certainly think weve gone to st joe  he returned to his jocular mood if i had ten dollars id ask you why not  i wouldnt consent if you had a million  he pretended to be astonished you would not why  because i believe in the pomp and circumstance of matrimony no runaway marriages for me when i marry it shall be in a vast cathedral with a mighty organ thundering and a long procession of awed and shivering bridesmaids  im sorry your tastes run in that way i dont at this time feel able to gratify them  nobody asked you sir she said then looking about her she sighed deeply i hate to leave this place it seems as though it could never be so beautiful again havent we had a heavenly day  i dread going back to the town for then my needs and all my life problems will swarm  i wish i could help you she said sincerely  you can he earnestly assured her if you will only come out here with me now and again i shall be able to stand a whole lot of grief  they were walking westward at the moment past the golfcourse and a sense of uneasiness filled the girls heart she looked up at him with a grave face i dont know why but i feel an impulse to hurry i feel as though we ought to get home as quickly as possible they may be worried about us  he did not share her apprehension i dont think theyll suffer  something urges me to run she repeated we must go directly home  he quickened his step with hers responding to the anxiety which had come into her tone but experiencing nothing of it in his heart what he did feel was the certainty that his day of careless ease was over the sky seemed suddenly to have lost its brightness the birds had fallen silent the crowds of people seemed less festive the world of workworn men rolled back upon them in a noisy flood as they caught a car and went speeding down the squalid avenue leos anxiety seemed to increase rather than to lessen as they neared her home theres been some accident she insisted i cant tell what it is but i think your mother has been hurt  he could not believe that anything serious had happened to his mother but when they alighted to walk across the boulevard he was quite as eager to reach the house as she  the man at the door wore an expression of wellgoverned concern which led leo to sharply ask what is it ferguson what has happened  they have taken her miss  taken who what who have taken her  the bailiff miss  the bailiff  yes miss the officers came with a warrant just as mrs ollnee was sitting down to luncheon and it was ever as much as she could do to get them to wait till she had finished mrs joyce has gone with her  leo confronted victor with large eyes that was the precise moment when i had my sensation of alarm  victor was white and rigid with indignation where did they take her  to the bond street station sir you are to come at once  how do i get there  ill show you volunteered leo is the electric out ferguson  i dont think so miss  order it around at once she turned to victor dont worry aunt louise is not easily rattled she is able to command all the help that is necessary she will have her own lawyer and will see that everything is done to shield your mother from harm  he was aching with remorseful fear oh if we had not stayed so long he groaned all the beauty and charm of the morning swept away by a wave of guilt only think i left the house without a word of greeting to her doesnt it show that there is no peace or security for either of us so long as we remain here i have tried twice to get away from this and now  the electric carriage came smoothly to the door and leo dismissing the driver motioned victor to enter ill drive she said and they swept out of the gate and down the boulevard as if by a wafture of the hand this young girl had invoked the aid of an oriental magician  the run was easy and swift till they reached the crowded crossstreet which led westward into the city deeps and as the carts thickened and coarse and vicious humanity began to swarm victor was moved to assert the mans prerogative he resented the admiring glances which the loafers addressed to his companion and a feeling of awkward helplessness came upon him i wish youd let me run this car he said morosely  slowly they felt their way to the west straight on toward a great railway depot with leo deftly winding her way amid trucks and express wagons darting past clanging streetcars and plowing through swarms of nondescript men and slattern women till at last she halted on a crossing and leaning from the window inquired of the police officer the way to the bond street station  right around the corner miss he replied with a smile pointing the way with his club  she turned up a narrow alley which ran parallel with the great domed shed of the railway and drew up before an ugly doorway in a grimy brick building of depressing architecture  victor alighted with a full realization of having left heaven for a filthy squalid hell the clang and hiss of engines in the shed the jar of heavy trucks the cries of venders the grind and howl of cars the sodden stream of humankind deafened and appalled him nevertheless he took the lead into the gloomy anteroom of the station which was half filled with officers in uniform escorting or placidly watching dullhued depressed and unkempt men and women in arrest  on inquiry of another officer they were directed to the door of a long hall which was in effect a tunnel youll find your party in the courtroom the officer said  victor led the way through this battered hallway and at the end of it came into a large bare room lighted with dusty windows on the north it was in effect a hall divided in halves by an open railing in the eastern end of the chamber the judge was seated surrounded by his clerks examining a little group of silent men in the western half of the room outside the railing sat a somber and motley assemblage of negroes italians and greeks mostly young each presenting a savage and sullen face in the midst of such a throng of miscreated beings leo seemed of angelic loveliness and purity  before the crowd became aware of her the keeneyed girl had discovered the objects of their search there they are she whispered pointing to the corner at the judges right where mrs joyce and mrs ollnee were seated in close conversation with a dark smoothlyshaven man of middle age oh im so glad she added mr bartol is with them  she led the way quite fearlessly through the aisle and directly up to the gate where she was met by the bailiff or warden of the room a sullenfaced sloppy irishman he was too keeneyed not to be immediately impressed by her beauty and something strong and clear and fine in her glance but before he had time to ask her what she wanted the gentleman whom she called bartol came forward and at his touch the officer gave way respectfully and the two young people entered the inclosure  mrs ollnee rose upon seeing victor and lifted her arms to his neck oh im so glad youve come she murmured in deep relief  a rustle of profound interest passed over the courtroom and such shuffling of feet and murmur of voices arose that the bailiff rapped querulously on the railing with the handle of his mallet and glared in a vain effort to restore silence even the judge accustomed as he was to every phase of the human comedy turned a sympathetic gaze upon the girl he was a middleaged man with a pale and sensitive careworn face and as he resumed his address to the men before him his gentle voice could be heard above the roar of the street in grave reprimand the sodden convicts who stood unshaved and spiritless before him excited his pity not his wrath  victor sat down beside his mother whispering what is it all about  mr bartol answered pettus the president of the peoples bank has absconded the bank is closed and your mother has been arrested for complicity in his frauds  victor understood almost instantly for this was exactly what carew had warned him about on the night of his first dinner in mrs joyces house what can we do he asked  leave that to me replied bartol i will see that your mother is protected  as they sat thus waiting while the judge disposed of a wifebeating case victor thought of altair and the mournful and exquisite smile with which she had greeted him what a frightful gulf gaped between these savage and bestial menthese sullen pinched grimy and malodorous streetwalkers these sottish halfhuman creatures torn and bloody with one anothers clawsand the celestial vision which his mother by some inexplicable necromancy had been able to create from the sunless world of her magic what a measureless stretch lay between this clamorous automatic pitiless court with its weary judge and the sunny bank beside the lagoon whereon the birds were singing and where he and leo had so lately lain to gaze on the far horizon land of wedded happiness and love  upon his musing the sounding voice of the clerk broke thomas aiken vs lucile ollnee  led by mr bartol mrs ollnee and mrs joyce moved through the gate and stood before the judge while from the right the complainant and his witnesses and his lawyer came to oppose them victor followed his mother and stood at the extreme left with leo by his side he had no care of what the miserable spectators in the seats would think of them he was only concerned with the judge and the opposing counsel  upon the motion of the clerk the bailiff called out hold up your hands everybody and so they all including even leo held up their right hands and took the oath that what they were about to say would be the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help them god  the judge worn by the ceaseless stream of diseased ineffectual and halting humanity passing daily before his eyes gazed in surprise and growing interest upon this group of handsome and welldressed people while the prosecuting attorney presented the claims of the complaining witness charging the defendant with conspiring to rob or defraud one mary aiken  where is mrs aiken asked the judge  she is too ill to appear your honor replied the prosecuting attorney but her granddaughter is here prepared to give in detail the story of how the defendant who professes to be a medium induced her aged and infirm grandmother to withdraw her money from certain investments in her native town and put them into the hands of anothernamely the absconding president of the peoples bank thereby impoverishing her thomas aiken the complainant charges that the said defendant lucile ollnee has by her uncanny powers obtained large sums of money and that she should be punished as a swindler  the judge studied the faces of the witnesses before him then asked what have you to say to this mrs ollnee  it is false she replied  the prosecution put in a word you will not deny that you advised these investments  i advised nothing she retorted what my controls advised i only know in a general way  what do you mean by controls inquired the judge  i am a spirit medium and sometimes a trance medium she replied facing him steadily those whom men call the dead speak through me  in what way  partly by writing partly by means of voices  do you mean to say that the dead speak in voices audible to others than yourself  yes your honor they often speak so loud that any one may hear them for the most part they whisper  the prosecution again struck in these voices are a part of the trick a part of her method of luring her victims on to do her will  the judge turned to the complainant thomas aiken a darkfaced sullen young man have you heard these voices mr aiken  no sir i never had a séance but my sister has had a number of interviews with this woman i know that in spite of the advice of her friends my grandmother has been induced to give away her money to this woman and to that scoundrel pettus we have been robbed by her it amounts to that and we intend to stop it  the judge turned back to mrs ollnee do you wish to be tried here and now on this charge  mr bartol interposed no your honor we do not this case is a very peculiar one my client is a lady as you may see and should never have been brought into this court in this fashion that she is a medium is probably true but there is no evidence of deceit on her part she assures me of her absolute faith in these voices and her manner carries conviction her friends believe in her also she claims to be nothing more than the means of communication between this world and the world of the dead  the judge smiled faintly that is claiming a good dealfrom my point of view what have you to say to that he demanded turning again to the complainants  a clear low musical voice the voice of a young woman answered the case is not uncommon your honor  victor craning his head forward found himself looking directly into the big intense black eyes of the girl he had rebuffed on the stairway the first day of his stay she was vivid intense and very indignant as she said the woman pretends to be possessed of the power of communication with the dead and by her arts she convinced my grandmother that her dead husband wished the withdrawal of her money from a bank in moline and that he recommended its investment in this traction company she played remorselessly upon the most sacred emotions of my poor old grandmother and i have evidence to prove that this advice has been a part of a general scheme whereby this traction company a fake concern has been able to delude other credulous souls  as she paused her lawyer said wearily it is a plain case of swindling your honor and we desire to press the case to its limit at once for pettus cannot be found and we fear the flight of the defendant  mr bartol spoke suavely your honor it is not a plain case of swindling mrs ollnee is the personal friend of mrs john h joyce whose name you know very well it is true that messages were given advising the investment of funds in the traction company but not only has this advice been followed by mrs joyce but by the defendant herself who has kept all her own small savings in the same bank  the judge turned to mrs ollnee is this true  it is your honor  the judge spoke to mrs joyce you believe in this womans voices  i do  yet they have advised you to put your money into the hands of a swindler  her voices seem to have done this yes sir but she herself has never advised in any way  you distinguish between the voices of your friend and her own personality do you  i do yes sir  the prosecuting attorney inserted a sneering word your honor mrs joyce is known to be credulous and under the influence of this trickster she is not a competent witness she has permitted herself to be deluded to the point where she will not believe anything ill of her medium thomas aiken is not the only one ready to press this charge against the defendant four others to my knowledge stand ready to testify to this womans uncanny power for deluding and defrauding my client finds herself stripped of her little fortune and helpless in her declining years the acting of this medium is criminal and we demand that she be punished  the judge turned his musing eyes upon mrs ollnees pale face have you anything further to say mrs ollnee  i have never been guilty of any deception your honor i claim no wisdom for myself if it is true that the traction company is a fraud then it must be that lying spirits have spoken impersonating my husband and my father  that is a subterfuge interposed the young woman miss aiken she is responsible for her voices  you accept money for your services do you not the judge asked of mrs ollnee  not now no sir  did you formerly  yes sir after my husband died i was forced to do so in order to educate my son  is this your son  yes sir  the judge addressed himself to victor what do you know of your mothers power as a medium do you share her faith  victor felt the burning eyes of the angry girl upon him as he replied i know very little about it your honor i have been away to school ever since i was ten years old  mrs joyce you are a believer in mrs ollnees powers  i am a firm believer  youve had no reason to doubt the genuineness of these messages  up to the present time i have not  you will lose heavily in this traction swindle if it is a swindle will you not  if it has failed yes sir  does that shake your faith in the medium  not in the slightest your honor it is a wellknown fact that lying spirits sometimes interpose  during this interrogation which had proceeded in conversational tone they had all remained standing before the judge whose speculative eyes wandered from face to face with growing interest at last he said to the prosecuting attorney from your own statement of it this case is not to be tried here i do not feel myself competent at this time to pass upon the questions involved  she shall not escape said miss aiken with bitter menace  mr bartol interposed we demand a trial by jury your honor  you shall have it responded the judge  the aikens withdrew sullenly and the bailiff indicated that the defendant and her party might retire to an inner office while papers were being prepared and this they did this room proved to be a bare bleak place with benches and yellow wooden chairs as ugly as a country railway station wherein a few officers were carelessly lounging about they all gazed curiously at mrs ollnee and leo and one of them muttered to the other its not often that a classy bunch like that comes into court  the indignity of it all caused leo to forget her own share in the traction companys failure it is shameful that you should be dragged here she said when the door closed behind them  leo cried mrs ollnee in agonized voice do you realize that this failure means almost as much of a loss to you as it does to louise  this affected the girl only for an instant then she loyally said yes i know but i do not blame you for it  mrs ollnee turned to her son if all they say is true victor we are the victims of some lying devils  leo soothingly laid her hand on her arm let us not think about that just now let us wait until we are safely out of this dreadful place  victor perceived that his mother was shaken to the very deeps of her faith she was trembling with excitement and weakness and his anxiety deepened into a fear that she might faint there are devils here she whispered i feel them all about mebestial horribletake me away  cant we go now he asked of the officer who seemed to have an eye on them my mother is not well  wait till the bail is fixed up the officer replied pleasantly but inexorably  they remained in silence till mrs joyce and mr bartol appeared then victor hurried his mother out into the street eager to escape the desolating air of this moral charnelhouse it was by no means a perfectly pure atmosphere without but it was fresher than within and mrs ollnee revived almost instantly oh the swarms of unclean spirits in there she said looking back with a face of horror  mrs joyce put her into the car with leo and told them to go directly home while she with victor took mr bartol to his office victor stunned by the new and crushing blow which had fallen upon him turned to the great lawyer with a boys trust and admiration what can we do he asked as soon as they had taken their seats in the car  mr bartol did not attempt to make light of the case his dark strong face was very grave as he answered for the present we can do very little beyond getting our bearings it seems to me at the moment as though the whole question hinged upon the possibility of dual personality and so far as i am concerned i have no mind upon that matter i must give it attention before i can reply our immediate concern is to keep your mother from further trouble and assault if as the prosecution stated there are others in this fight they and the press can make it very unpleasant for you all miss florence aiken has a powerful and vindictive pen she will not cease her persecutionfor she is at the bottom of the case  mrs joyce turned to him with eager face i wish you would invite mrs ollnee and her son up to your farm for a few days  i do so with pleasure i am going up tonight on the eightoclock train and i shall be very glad to have them go with me if they care to do so we can then talk the whole case over at our leisure and in quiet perhaps you can run up and stay over sunday with us  that is the very thing she responded and im very grateful to you  again victor felt himself helpless whirling along in a stream of alien purpose like a leaf in a mountain torrent and again he abandoned himself to its sweep i will do anything to get away from here he replied  mr bartol went on your mothers case will not come up for some days and the rest and quiet of the farm will do you both good to mrs joyce he added privately the whole matter interests me vastly i dont at all mind giving some time to it and besides i like the young man  mrs joyce dropped the lawyer at his office door and sped homeward swiftly with intent to overtake leo she did not attempt to conceal her anxiety the truth is victor pettus and his friends called into our circle a throng of wicked deceiving spirits they were not what they claimed to be they were cheats and they have almost ruined us your poor sweet mother is not to blame and i cant blame the aikens what i cannot understand is thiswhy did your father and his band permit these treacherous personalities to intervene why did they not defend her from these demons  victor listened to her with a complete reversal to disbelief as regards his mothers mediumship he forgot the marvels of the direct writing the mighty murmuring wind the dreamface of altair all these insubstantial and evanescent perceptions were lost submerged by the returning sea of his doubt he saw too that leos faith was shaken he felt it beneath her bravespoken words the whole question of the process as well as the content of the messages was reopened for her his situation grew ever darker his way was again blocked he could not leave his mother to her fate and yet he could not see his way to earning a cent of money while this horrible accusation was hanging over her he acknowledged too a very definite feeling of sympathy with those who had been defrauded there was moral indignation in miss aikens tremulous eagerness to punish shes not to blame he said id do exactly as she is doing if i were in her place     x  a visit to hazel grove   bartol attended by porters and greeted by conductors and brakemen led the way to the parlorcar in a stern abstraction which was his habit victor studied him closely and with growing admiration he was not tall but his head was nobly formed and his broad mask of face lionlike in its somber dreaming in repose it was sad almost bitter and in profile clearcut and resolute his dress was singularly tasteful and orderly with nothing of the careless celebrity in its color or cut and yet no one would accuse him of being the dandy he was naturally of this method and gave little direct thought to toilet or dress  mrs ollnee looked upon him as her rescuer one who had snatched her from loathsome captivity but his manner did not invite repeated and profuse thanks with a few words of polite explanation he took a seat behind his wards unfolded his newspaper and forgot them till the conductor came through the car then he remembered them and paid their fares  mrs ollnee was not merely awed by his powerful visage and searching eyes she was profoundly stirred by some psychic influence which emanated from him she whispered to victor he is very sad he is all alone he has lost his wife and both his children he has no hope and often feels like leaving this life  victor did not take this communication as a psychometric reading for he had been able to discern almost as much with his own eyes and besides all of its definite information mrs joyce might have furnished but his mother added something that startled him she said the voices say obey this man study him he will raise you high  what do you mean by that  i dont know she replied that is the way i hear it i hear other voicesthey say to me comfort him  victor was not in a mood for voices and cut her short by asking in detail about her arrest who came for you a policeman  yes but not in uniform they were very nice about it at first i was terribly frightened i was afraid i should have to go in the patrolwagon but we were allowed to ride in the car the policeman sitting with the driver  victor groaned oh mother why did you give out business advice  i gave what was given to me she responded  think of the disgrace of being in that courtroom  i didnt mind the disgrace she replied but it swarmed with horrible spirits each one of those poor criminals had a cloud of other base distorted halfformed creatures hovering about him it was like being in a cage with a host of obscene bats fluttering about she shuddered it was horrible it was a sweet relief when you and leo came for a new and happy band came with you you helped my band drive away the cloud of low beings that oppressed me and now there is something calming and serenely helpful all about me it comes from mr bartol i am no longer afraid i am perfectly serene  victor made no attempt at elucidating her exact meaning there was something depressing to him in this continued dependence upon spirit guidance a guidance that had led them into so much trouble and discredit he sat by the window watching the faintlyoutlined moonlit landscape flowing past feeling himself to be a very small insect riding on the chariot of the king of tempests with no power to check the speed or direct the course of his inflexible driver his own future was but a flutter of vague shadows his boyhood a serene sunwarm meadow now swiftly receding into the darkness of night would anything so beautiful ever come again  his mother sitting as if entranced was looking down at her folded hands her brow unlined but a plaintive droop in the lines of her sensitive mouth told that she was wearied and secretly disheartened  poor little mother he said laying a hand on her arm you are tired  the tears came to her eyes but she smiled back radiantly i dont care what comes if only you believe in me she said simply and he took her hand in both of his and pressed it like a lover  at last mr bartol folded his paper and put away his glasses well we are nearing hazel grove he announced smilingly its only a little village a meeting of crossroads but i think youll like the country its the fine old rolling prairie of which youve heard  the moon was riding high as they alighted from the coach upon the platform of a low wooden station in the midst of green fields a clump of trees and the lights in dimly discerned houses gave only a faint suggestion of a town but an open carriage was waiting for them and entering this they were driven away into the most delicious and fragrant silence  instantly the last trace of victors anger and unrest fell away from him of this simple quality had been the scenes of his life at school in such peace and serenity his earlier years had been spent indeed all his life save for the few tumultuous days in the cityand he was immediately restored and comforted by the sounds sights and odors of the superb spring night  isnt it glorious he cried i feel as if i were reaching gods country again  the swiftly stepping horses whirled them up the street through a bunch of squat buildings and out along a gently rising lane to the south ten minutes later the driver turned into a large treeshaded drive and over a curving graveled drive approached a spreading white house whose porticos shone pleasantly in the moonlight a row of lighted windows glowed with hospitable intent and tall vases of flowers showed dimly  here we are called mr bartol with genial cordiality welcome to hazeldean  to dismount before this wide porch in the midst of the small innumerable voices of the night was like living out some delicious romance to come to it from the reek and threat of the courtroom made its serene expanse a heavenly refuge and the beleaguered mother paused for a moment at the door to look back upon the lawn where opulent elms and maples dreamed in the odorless gloom i have never seen anything so peaceful she breathed only heavenly souls inhabit here  the interior was equally restful and reassuring large rooms with simple and substantial furnishings led away from a short entrance hall the ceilings were low and dark and the lamps shaded books were everywhere to be seen many of them piled carelessly convenient to lights and chairs as if it were both library and livingroom  the first word victor spoke related to the books and mr bartol replied with a smile  they are not especially well chosen i fear youll find them a mixed lot i read nothing but law in the cityhere i indulge my fancy youll wonder what my principle of selection is and if you ask me i must answeri havent any i buy whatever commends itself to me at the moment one thing leads to anotherromance to history history to poetry poetry to the drama and so on he greeted a very tidy maid who entered the room goodevening marie this is mrs ollnee and this is her son mr victor ollnee please see that they are made comfortable then again to his guests you must be tired  i am so mr bartol replied mrs ollnee and if youll pardon me ill go to my room  certainlyand you may go too if you feel like it he said to victor  i am not sleepy replied victor  very well replied his host be seated and well discuss the situation for a few minutes  he led the way to a corner where two wide windows opening on the lawn made delicious mingling of night air and study light and offering his guest a cigar took a seat saying i run out here whenever the city becomes a burden i find i need just such a corrective to the intense life of the city it is my rule to give no thought to legal troubles while i am here hence the absence of codes and all legal literature you are a college man mrs joyce tells me  i was at winona last saturday and expected to stay there till june when i was due to graduate then the devil broke loose and here i am when will my mothers case come up  not for some weeks i fear if you wish to return to your studies we can arrange that  no im done with school im only worried about my mother what do you think of her case mr bartol  im not informed sufficiently to say he replied slowly the whole subject of hypnotic control seems to be involved i must know more of your mother before i can even hazard an opinion the theories of suggestion are all rather vague to me i have only what might be called a newspaper knowledge of them but i have some information as to your mothers profession i gained from my friend mrs joyce so that i am not entirely uninformed besides it is a lawyers business to know everything and i shall at once proceed to bore into the subject  mrs ollnee returning brought him to his feet in graceful acknowledgment of her sex and placing a chair for her he said i hope you dont mind tobacco  not at all she replied quite as graciously  he placed a chair for her so that the light fell upon her face and she knew that he intended to study her as if she were a page of strange text  im glad you like it here he said in answer to her repeated admiration of his home for i suspect youll have to stay here for the present the city is passing through one of those moral paroxysms which come once in a year or two last year it was the social evil just now it concerns itself with what the reformers are pleased to call the occult fakers the feeling of a jury would be against you at present and as i have promised mrs joyce to take charge of your defense i think it well for you to go into retirement here while i take time to inform myself of the case  i do not like to trouble you  it is no trouble my dear madam here is this big home empty and completely manned a couple of guests especially a hearty young man will be a godsend to my cook she complains of not having men to feed dont let any question of expense to me trouble you  thank you most deeply  dont thank me thank louise joyce who is both client and friend and the one to whom i owe this pleasure he bowed i never before had the opportunity of entertaining a psychic and i welcome the opportunity  she did not quite know how to take him and neither did victor and perceiving that doubt bartol added i am quite sincere in all this i hear a good deal obscurely of this curious phase of human life but never before have i been confronted by one who claims the power of divination  pardon me sir i do not claim such power  do you not i thought that was precisely your claim  no sir i am a medium i report what is given to me i divine nothing of myself i am an instrument through which those whom men call the dead speak  i see he mused i will not deceive you he began again very gravely this charge against you is likely to prove serious and you must be quite frank with me i may require a test of your powers  i am at your service sir make any test of me you pleasethis moment if you like  i will not require anything of you tonight writers tell me that mediums are a dark elusive and uncanny set mrs ollnee and i must confess that you upset my preconceptions  there are all kinds of mediums as there are all kinds of lawyers mr bartol i am human like the others  if you will permit me i will take up your defense along the lines of hypnotic control on the part of this man pettus  i cannot presume to advise you sir but you must know that to me these voices come from the spirit world i am the transmitter merelyfor instance at this moment i hear a voice and i see behind you the form of a lady a lovely young woman  mother called victor warningly dont start in on that  proceed said bartol i am interested  the psychic leaning forward slightly fixed her wide deepblue eyes upon him the maid conducted me to the room which had been your wifes but i could not stay there this lady who stands beside you took me by the hand and led me away to another room she is nodding at me now  do you mean the maid led you from the room  no i mean the spirit now standing behind you led me here she says her name is margaret bartol she said comfort my dear husband restore his faith she is smiling at me she wants me to go on  bartols face remained inscrutably calm where does the form seem to be  at your right shoulder she says tell him walter and hattie are both with me she listened a moment she says tell him walters mind is perfectly clear now  victor thought he saw the lawyer start in surprise but his voice was cold as he said go on  she says tell him the way is open i am here ask him to speak to me  bartol then spoke but his tone plainly showed that he was testing his clients hallucination and not addressing himself to the imaginary ghost are you there margaret  yes came the answer clearly though faintly  the renowned lawyer gazed at the medium with eyes that burned deep and presently he asked what have you to say to me  again came the clear silvery whisper much trust the medium she will comfort you  victor thrilled to the importance of this moment and much as he feared for his mothers success he could not but admire the courage which blazed in her steady eyes she was no longer afraid of this mighty man of the law to whom heaven and hell were obsolete words she was panoplied with the magic and mystery of death and waited calmly for him to continue  at last he said go on i am listening  again through the flowerscented silent room the sibilant voice stole its way father  who is speaking  margaret  margaret what margaret  your rascal peggy  bartol certainly started at this reply which conveyed an expression of mirth but his questions continued formal  what is your will with me  mamma is hereand walter  can they speak  they will try  again silence fell upon the rooma silence so profound that every insects stir was a rude interruption at length another whisper clearer louder made itself heard alexander be happy i live  who are you  your wife  you say so can you prove your identity  the whisper grew fainter i will try it is hard goodby  bartol raised his hand to his head with a gesture of surprise i thought i felt a touch on my hair  the lady touched you as she passed away mrs ollnee explained she has gone they are all gone now  i am sorry he said in polite disappointment i wanted to pursue the interrogation is this the usual method of your communications  this is one way they write sometimes and sometimes they speak through a megaphone sometimes they materialize a face or a hand  he remained in profound thought for a few moments then starting up spoke with decision you are tired go to bed well have plenty of time to take up these matters tomorrow please feel at home here and stay as long as you wish  a little later he took victor to his room and as they stood there he remarked of course all this may be and probably is mindreading and ventriloquismsubconscious of course  but the writing said victor you must see that that is the weirdest thing she does it is baffling  my boy the whole universe is baffling to me his host replied and into his voice came that tone of tragic weariness which affected the youth like a strain of solemn music the older i grow the more senseless hopelessly senseless human life appears but i must not say such things to you goodnight  goodnight responded victor with swelling throat we owe you a great deal  dont speak of it the lawyer commanded and closed the door behind him  victor dropped into a chair what a day this had been within twentyfour hours he had seen and loved the dreamface of altair and had been blown upon by the winds from the vast chill and empty regions of space he had resented leos voice in the night but had returned to her in the light of the morning on the dreamy lagoon he had been her lover again pulling at the oar with savage joy and on the grass in the sunlight he had been the man unafraid and victorious then came the hurried return the visit to the court the rescue of his motherand here now he lay in the charity bed of his mothers lawyer truly i am being hurried he said and recalling miss aikens final menacing remark he added and if that girl and her brother can do it mother will be sent to prison much as he feared these accusing witnesses he acknowledged a kind of fierce beauty in florence aikens face  as he lay thus thinking deeply yet drowsily upon his problems he heard a faint ticking sound beneath his head it was too regular and persistent to be a chance creaking of the cloth and he rose and shook the pillow to dislodge the insect which he imagined might have flown in at the window  the ticking continued i wonder if that is a fly  the ticking seemed to reply no by means of one decided rap to test it he asked are you a spirit  the tick counted one two threeyes  some one to speak to me  tick tick tickyes  the answer was so plainly intelligent that the boy silent with amazement not unmixed with fear lay for a few minutes in puzzled inaction at length he asked who is itfather  tickno  grandfather  no  he hesitated before asking the next question is it altair  no  he thought again is it walter bartol  the answer was joyously instant yes yes yes  do you wish to speak to me  yes  about your father  yes  through my mother  now came one of those baffling changes the answer was faintly slow tick tick betraying uncertaintyand succeeding queries elicited no response  victor excited and eager would have gone to his mother for aid had he known where to find her room the mood for marvels was upon him now and altair and margaret and all the rest of the impalpable throng seemed waiting in the dusk and silence to communicate with him hopelessly wide awake he lay while the big clock on the landing rang its little chime upon the quarter hours but no further sign was given him of the presence of his intangible visitor and at last the experience of the day became as unsubstantial as his dreams  he was awakened by the cackling of fowls and the bleating of calves and lambs the sun was shining through the leafy top of a tree which lay almost against his window and happy shadows were dancing like fairies on the coverlet of his bed  it sounds like a real farm he drowsily murmured filled with the peace of those cries which typify the most ancient and unchanging parts of the cottagers life  he had known only the poetic side of farm life he had seen it heard it tasted it only as the lad out for a holiday and it all seemed serene and joyous to him to his mind the luxury of quietly dozing to the music of a barnyard was the natural habit of the farmer he did not attempt to rise till he heard the voice of his host from the lawn beneath his window  a half an hour later he found bartol in the barnyard surveying a span of colts which his farmer was leading back and forth before him they were lanky thinnecked creatures but victor knew enough of horses to perceive in them signs of a famous breed of trotters  you are a real farmer he said as he came up to his host  bartol seemed pleased i made it pay five per cent last year he responded with pride of course that means counting in my time as a farmer and not as a lawyer how did you sleep  pretty wellwhen i got at it i was a little excited and didnt go off as i usually do when i hit the pillow  no wonder i had a restless night myself he nodded to the hostler that will do and turned away i gave a great deal of thought to your mothers case the fact seems to be that the human organism is a great deal more complicated than were permitted ourselves to admit and the tendency of the ordinary man is to make the habitual commonplace no matter how profoundly mysterious it may be at the outset of course at bottom we know very little of the most familiar phenomenon why does fire burn and water run no one really knows  they were facing the drive which curved like a lilac ribbon through the green of the lawn and the estate to victors eyes had all the charm of a park combined with the suggestive music of a farmstead  its beautiful here he exclaimed  im glad you like it and i hope you and your mother will stay till we have put you both straight with the world  if i could only do something to pay my freight mr bartol i feel like a beggar and a fool to be so helpless i was not expecting to be kicked out of college and im pretty well rattled ill confess  you keep your poise notably the lawyer replied with kindly glance to be so suddenly introduced to the mystery and the chicanery of the world would bewilder an older and less emotional man  they breakfasted in a big room filled with the sunlight through the open windows the scent of snowy flowers drifted and the food and service were of a sort that victor had never seen a big grapefruit filled with sugar and berries corncakes crisp and golden bacon delicately broiled together with eggs baked in little earthen cups and last of all coffee of such fragrance that it seemed to vie with the odor of the flowers without each delicious dish was served deftly quietly by a sweetfaced maid who seemed to feel a filial interest in her master  the service was a revelation of the perfection to which country life can be brought by one who has both wealth and culture and victor wondered that any one could be sad amid such radiant surroundings  i cant see why you ever return to the city he said with conviction  bartol smiled thats the perversity of our human nature if i were forced to live here all the time the farm might pall upon me just as if all seasons were spring as it is i come back to it from the turmoil of the town with nevercloying appetite per contra these maids and my farmhands find a visit to the city their keenest delight to them the parks and the artificial ponds are more beautiful than anything in nature his tone changed in truth i live on and do my work more from force of habit than from zest so far as i can i get back to the simple animal existence where sun and air and food are the neverfailing pleasures i try to forget that i am a pursuer of criminals i return to my work in the city as i say because it helps to keep my appetite for the rural things i cant afford to let silence and green trees pall upon me if i were a little more of a believer he smiled i would say that you and your mother had been sent to me for of late i have been in a deeper slough of despair than at any time since the death of my wife i am curious to see how all this is going to affect your mother she may find it very lonely here  oh im sure she will not  well now i must be off but before i go i will show you the catalogues of my library and perhaps i can bring home some books which will bear on these occult subjects i have given orders that no information as to you shall go off the place and your mother is safe here you may read or hoe in the garden or ride a horse  i wish i might go to the city with you  my judgment is against it stay here for a few days till we see which way the wind is blowing and with a cheery wave of his hand he drove away leaving victor on the porch with the feeling of being marooned on an islanda peaceful and beautiful island but an island nevertheless     xi  loves translation   to tell the truth victor dreaded being left alone with his mother in this way he was fully aware now of the invisible barrier between them no matter what explanation was finally offered she could never be the same to him again for whether it was her subconscious self which had cunningly lured them all to the verge of disaster or some uncontrollable impulse coming from without in the light any explanation she was no longer the sweet gentle normal mother he had hitherto thought her to be  it was not a question of being in possession of strange abilities it was a question of being obsessed by some diabolical powerof being the prey of malignant demons avid to destroy  the more deeply he thought upon all that had come to him the more bewildered he became and to avoid this tumult which brought no result he went out and wandered about the farm his experience was like visiting a foreign country for the men were either swiss or german and the walls of the farmyard quite as unamerican in their massiveness and their formal arrangementa vivid contrast to the flimsy structures of the neighboring village the servants that is what they were servants treated him with the trained deference of those who for generations have touched their caps to the more fortunate beings of the earth and these signs of subordination were distinctly soothing to the youths disturbed condition of mind instantly and without effort he assumed the air of the young aristocrat they thought him  he strolled down the road to the village which was a collection of small frame cottages in neat lawns surrounding a few general stores and a greasy flyspecked postoffice here was the unimaginative the prosaic perfectly embodied old men bent and gray were gossiping from benches and boxes under the awnings clerks in their shirtsleeves were lolling over counters a few farmers teams stood at the iron hitchingposts with drowsy lowhanging heads neither doubt nor dismay nor terror had footing here the majesty of dawn the mystery of midnight did not touch these peaceful and phlegmatic souls the spirit of man was to them less than an abstraction and the tumult of the city a faroff roar as of distant cataracts  furthermore these matteroffact folk had abundant curiosity and no reverence and they all stared at victor with round absorbent gaze as if with candid intent to take full invoice of his clothing and to know him again in any disguise he heard them say one after the other as he passed along visitor of bartols i guess and he could understand that this explanation really explained for bartols castle was the restingplace of many strange birds of passage  bartol was indeed the constant marvel of hazel grove why had he bought the place why after it was bought should he spend so much money on it and finally why should he employ foreigners these were a few of the queries which were put and answered and debated in the shade of the furniture store and around the airtight store of the grocery his farm was their neverfailing wonder tale the building of a new wall was an excitement each whitewashing of a picket fence an event they knew precisely the hour of departure of each blooded ram or bull and the birth of each colt was discussed as if another son and heir had come to the owner  naturally therefore all visitors to hazeldean came in for study and commentespecially because it was well known that bartol stood high in the political councils of the party was indeed mentioned for senator and that his guests were likely to be some punkins in the world this young feller is liable to be the son of one of his millionaire clients was the comment of the patient sitters husky chap aint he  feeling something of this comment and sensing also the sleepy materialism of the inhabitants victor regained much of his own disbelief in the miraculous and yet just to that degree did the pain in his heart increase for it made of his mother something so monstrous that the conception threatened all his love and reverence for her pity sprang up in place of the filial affection he had once known he began to make new excuses for her it must be that she has become so suggestible that every sitters mind governs her in a sense that removes her responsibility and so he walked back with all his pleasure in the farm and village eaten up by his care  his mother was waiting for him on the porch and as he came up asked with shining face  isnt this heavenly victor  it is very beautiful he replied but with less enthusiasm than she expected  to think that yesterday i was threatened with the prison and nowthis we have much to thank mr bartol for  thats just it mother what claim have we on this big busy man what right have we to sit here  the brightness of her face dimmed a little but she replied bravely i have always paid my way victor and i am sure last nights message meant much to mr bartol i always help people if i bring back a belief in immortality do i not make fullest recompense to my host my gift is precious and yet i cannot sell iti can only give itand so when i am offered bed and board in return for my work i am not ashamed to take it the kings of the earth are glad to honor those who like myself have the power to penetrate the veil  never before had she ventured upon so frank a defense of her vocation and victor listened with a new conception of her powers as she continued she took on dignity and quiet force  the medium gives more for her wages than any earthly soul and when you consider that we make the grave a gateway to the light that our hands part the veil between the seen and the unseen then you will see that our gifts are not abnormal but supernormal god has given us these powers to comfort mankind to afford a new revelation to the world  why didnt you make me a medium he asked thrusting straight at her heart why did you send me away from it all  her eyes fell her voice wavered because i was weakan earthly mother my selfish love and pride overpowered me i could not see you made ashamedand besides my controls advised it for the time  he took a seat where he could look up into her face mother tell me thishavent you noticed that your controls generally advise the things you believe in  she was stung by his question yes my son generally but sometimes they drive me into ways i do not believe in often they are in opposition to my own will  he was silenced for the moment and his mind took a new turn when did altair first come  soon after i met leo she came with leo she attends leo  have you seen her  no i am always in deepest trance when she shows herself i hear her voice though  mother he said earnestly if mr bartol gets us out of this scrape will you go away with me into some new country and give up this business  you dont seem to understand victor i can no more escape from these voices than i can run away from my own shadow i dont want to run away i love the thought of them i have innumerable sweet friends on the other side to close the door in their faces would be cruel it would leave me so lonely that i should never smile again  then they mean more to you than i do he exclaimed  no no i dont mean that she passionately protested you mean more to me than all the earthly things but these heavenly hosts are very dearbesides i shall go to them soon and i want to feel sure that i can come back to you when i have put aside the body i fear now that our separation was a mistake in trying to shield you from the transient disgrace of being a mediums son i have put your soul in danger i was weaki own it i was an earthly mother i wanted my boy to be respected and rich and happy here in the earthlife i did not realize the danger i ran of being forever separated from you by the veil of death oh victor you must promise me that should i pass out suddenly you will try to keep the spiritway open between uswill you promise this  strange scene strange mother all about them the orioles were whistling the robins chirping and farther away the beasts of the barnyard were bawling their wants in cheerful chorus but here on this vineshaded porch a pale small woman sought a compact with her son which should outlast the grave and defy time and space  he gave his word how could he refuse it but his pledge was halfhearted his eyes full of wavering it irked him to think that in a month of bloom and passion a world of sunny romance a world of girls and all the sweet delights they conveyed to young men he should be forced to discuss matter which relates to the charnelhouse and the chill shadow of the tomb  he rose abruptly dont lets talk of this any more lets go for a walk lets visit the garden  she was swifter of change than he she could turn from the air of the ghostroom to the glory of the peacock as swiftly as a mirror reflects its beam of light and she caught a delightful respite from the flowers she was accustomed to the lavish greenhouses of her wealthy patrons but here was something that delighted her more than all their hotbeds here were all the oldfashioned outofdoor plants and flowers the perennials of her grandfather to whom hothouses were unknown this colonial garden was another of bartols peculiarities he had no love for orchids or any exotic or forced blooms his fancy led to the glorification of phloxes to the ripening of lilacs and to the preservation of oldtime varieties of rosesplants with human association breathing of romance and sorrowhence his plots were filled with hardy new england roots flourishing in the richer soils of the western prairies  these colors scents and forms moved victor markedly for the reason that in la crescent as a child he had been accustomed to visit a gaunt old woman the path to whose door led through cinnamon roses balsam tigerlilies sweetwilliam bachelorbuttons pinks hollyhocks and the likea wonderland to him thena strange and haunting pleasure now as he walked these graveled ways and mingled the memories of the old with the vivid impressions of the new  back to the house they came at last to luncheon and there sitting in the beautiful diningroom so cool so spacious so singularly tasteful in every detail they gazed upon each other in a delight which was tinged with pain such perfection of appointment such service all for them two beggars was more than embarrassing it provoked a sense of guilt the pretty lowvoiced softsoled maid came and went bringing exquisite food in the daintiest dishes enough food for six anticipating every want like the fairy of the storybooks mother said the youth this is a story  mrs ollnee was accustomed to the splendor of mrs joyces house but she was almost as much moved as victor she perceived the difference between the oldworld simplicity of this flawless establishment and the lavish tasteless hospitality of men like pettus  who had planned and organized this widewalled lowtoned room this marvelously effective cuisine how was it possible for such service to go on during the masters absence with apparently the same unerring precision of detail  these questions remained unanswered and they rose at last with a sense of having been for the moment at least in the seats of those who command the earth wisely  hardly were they returned to their hammocks on the porch when a swiftly driven car turned in at the gate  it is louise exclaimed mrs ollnee  and leo added victor  with streaming veils the travelers swept up to the carriage steps covered with dust yet smiling  how are you called mrs joyce and then with true motor spirit addressed the driver whats the time denis  two hours and ten minutes from north avenue  not so bad considering the roads  leo had sprung out and was throwing off her cloak and veil i hope were not too late for luncheon mr bartol has the best cook and im famished  her coming swept victor back into his other and normal self and he took charge of her with a mingling of reverence and audacity which charmed her he went out into the diningroom with her and sat beside her while she ate i hope youre going to stay he said earnestly  stay of course well stay its hot as july in the cityalways is with the wind from the southwest isnt it heavenly out here  heavenly is the word but who did it who organized it  mrs bartol she had the best taste of any oneand her way with the servants was beyond imitation they all worship her memory  i cant make myself believe i deserve all this he said your coming puts the frosting on my bun  it was as if some new and utterly different spirit or band of them had come with this glowing girl she radiated the vitality and the melody of youth without being boisterous or silly she filled the house with laughter theres something about hazeldean that always makes me happy i dont know why she said  you make all who inhabit this house happy said mrs ollnee i can hear spirit laughter echoing to yours  can you is it margaret  yes margaret and philip  victor did not smile on the contrary his face darkened and mrs joyce changed the tone of the conversation by asking did you see the paper this morning they say you have skipped to join pettus this seemed so funny that they all laughed till victor remembered that both these women had lost much money through pettus  mrs joyce sobered too the star is against you lucy and you must keep dark for a time they are denouncing you as a traitor and all the rest of it did paul or any one advise you last night  no nothing was said i suppose they are considering the matter also those deceiving spirits must be hunted out and driven away  im going to lie down for a while mrs joyce announced my old waistline is jolted a bit out o plumb leo will you stretch out too  no indeed what i need is a walk or a game of tennis im cramped from sitting so long  so it fell out that victor penniless youth hedged about with invisible walls pikes and pitfalls was soon galloping about a tennis court in the glories of a new pair of flannel trousers and a lovely bluestriped outing shirt trying hard not to win every game from a very good partner who was pouting with dismay while admiring his skill  it isnt right for any one to serve as weird a ball as you do she protested its like playing with loaded dice i begin to understand why you were not renowned as a scholar  oh i wasnt so bad i stood above medium  how could you it must have taken all your time to learn to play tennis in the diabolical way you doits conjury thats what it is  they were in the shade and the fresh sweet wind heavy with the scent of growing corn and wheat swept steadily over the court relieving it from heat and victor clean forgot his worriments this girlish figure filled his eyes with pictures of unforgetable grace and charm the swing of her skirts as she leaped for the ball the free sweep of her arm she had been well instructed and the lithe bending of her waist brought the lovers sweet unease when they came to the net now and again he studied her fine figure with frank admiration you are a corker was his boyish word of praise i dont go up against many men who play the game as well as you do your form is a whole lot better than mine i am a bit lucky i admit you see i studied baseball pitching and i know the action of a whirling sphere i curve the ballmake it break as the english say i can make it do all kinds of stunts  i see you can and ill thank you not to try any new ones she protested can you ride a horse  his face fell a bit there i am a mutt he confessed i never was on a horse except the wooden one in the gym  im glad i can beat you at something she said with exultant cruelty i know you can row  shall we try another set he asked  not today thank you my selfrespect will not stand another such drubbing im going in for a cold plunge after that you may read to me on the porch  ill be there with the largest tome in the library he replied  mrs joyce stopped him as he was going upstairs to his room victor dont worry about me while it looks as though i have lost a good deal of money through pettus i am by no means bankrupt i am just about where i was when i met your mother she has not enriched mei mean the voices have notneither have they impoverished me its just the same with leo shes almost exactly where she was when she came east it would seem as if they had been playing with us just to show us how unsubstantial earthly possessions are  there was a certain comfort in this explanation and yet the fact that her losses had not eaten in upon her original capital did not remove the essential charge of dishonesty which the man aiken had brought against the ghostly advisers florence and thomas aiken could not afford to be so lenient they were disinherited cheated of their rightful legacy by the lying spirits  he was anxious also to know just how deeply leo was involved in the peoples bank and when she came down to the porch he led her to a distant chair beside a hammock on the eastern side of the house and there with a book in his hand opened his interrogations  he began quite formally and with a welllaidout line of questions but she was not the kind of witness to permit that she broke out of his boundaries on the third query and laughingly refused to discuss her losses i am holding no one but myself responsible she said i was greedyi couldnt let well enough alone thats all  no that is not all he insisted my mother is charged with advising people to put money into the hands of a swindler  i dont believe that i think she was honest in believing that pettus would enrich us all she was deceived like the rest of us  but what becomes of the infallible voices  she laughed they are fallible thats all they made a gross blunder in pettus  mr bartol suggests that my mother may have been hypnotized by pettus and made to work his will and i think hes right he thinks the whole thing comes down to illusionto hypnotic control and telepathy  she looked thoughtful i had a stage of believing that but it doesnt explain all it only explains a small part does it explain altair to you  his glance fell nothing explains altairnor that moaning windnor the writing on the slates  and the letterhave you forgotten that  half an hour ago as we were playing tennis i had forgotten it i was cut loose from the whole blessed messnow it all comes back upon me like a cloud  oh dont look at it that way thats foolish i think its glorious fun this investigating  he acknowledged her rebuke but added it would be more fun if the person under the grill were not ones own mother  thats true she admitted and yet i think you can study her without giving offense i began in a very offensive wayi can see that nowbut she met my test and still meets every test you bring the faith she represents isnt going to have its heart plucked out in a hurry i can tell you that  the immediate thing is to defend her against this man aiken mr bartol said he would order up a lot of books and im to cram for the trial if you have any book to suggest i wish youd write its title down for me  whats the use of going to books the judges will want the facts and youll have to convince them that she is what she claims to be  how can we do that we cant exhibit her in a trance  you might perhaps her guides will give her the power she glowed with anticipatory triumph imagine her confounding the jury wouldnt that be dramatic it would be like the oldtime test of fire  he was radiant too for a moment over the thought then his face grew stern nothing like that is going to happen she would fail and that would leave us in worse case than before our only hope is to convince the jury that she is not responsible for what her voices say weve got to show shes autohypnotic  i hope the trial will come soon  so do i for here i am eating somebody elses food with no prospect of earning a cent or finding out my place in the world i dont know just what my mothers idea was in educating me in classical english instead of some technical course but im perfectly certain that im the most helpless mollusk that was ever kicked out of a school  real bitterness was in his voice and she hastened to add a word of comfort all you need is a chance to show your powers  what powers  latent powers she smiled we are all supposed to have latent powers i am seeking a career too  he forgot himself in a return of his admiration of her oh you dont have to seek a girl like you has her career all cut out for her  she caught his meaning thats what i resent why should a womans career mean only marriage  i dont knowi guess because its the most important thing for her to do  to be some mans household drudge or pet  no to be some mans inspiration  fudge a woman is never anybodys inspirationafter shes married  how cynical you are what caused it  observing my married friends  oh i am relieved i was afraid it was through some personal experience  this seemed funny to them both and they laughed together theres nothing of the maiden with reluctant feet about me she went on i simply refuse to go near the brink i find men stupid smelly and coarse  i hate girls in the abstractthey giggle and whisper behind their hands and make mouths but there is one girl who is different he tried to be very significant at the moment  she ignored his clumsy beginning of a compliment all the girls who giggle should marry the men who crack jokesthats my advice  pears like our serious conversation is straggling out into vituperation  whose fault is it  please dont force me to say it was not my fault im like lincolni joke to hide my sorrows  dont be irreverent  through all this youthful give and take the boy and girl were studying each other minutely and the phrases that read so baldly came from their lips with so much music so much of hidden meaning at least with displayed suggestion that each was tingling with the revelation of it the words of youth are slight in content it is the accompanying tone that carries to the heart  she recovered first now lets stop this schoolboy chatter  you mean schoolgirl chatter  both your mother is in a very serious predicament we must help her  he became quite serious i wish you would advise me you know so much more about the whole subject than i do im eager to get to work on the books i suppose it is too much to expect that they will come up today  they might ill go and inquire  no indeed let me go am i not an inmate here he disappeared into the house leaving her to muse on his face he began to interest her this passionate selfwilled moody youth she perceived in him the soul of the conqueror his swift change of temper his union of sportloving boy and ambitious man made him as interesting as a play hell make his way she decided using the vague terms of prophecy into which a girl falls when regarding the future of a young man its all so delightfully mysterious this path of the youth who makes his way upward to success  a shout announced his return and looking up she perceived him bearing down upon her with an armful of books  here they are he exulted red ones blue ones brown oneswhich shall we begin on  bluethats my color  agreed blue it is he dumped them all down on the wide swinging couch and fell to turning them over dark blue or light blue  dark blue  he picked up a fat volume mysterious psychic forces know this tome  oh yes indeed its wonderfully interesting  i choose it this color scheme simplifies things now heres anotherthe dual personality hows that  um wellpretty good  dual personality to the rear heres a brown bookmetaphysical phenomena  thats a good one too  im sorry they didnt bind it in blueand heres a measly yellow paperbound book in some foreign languageitalian i guess author morselli  oh thats a book i want to read let me take it  do you read italian  after a fashion  then i engage you at once to translate that book to me what is it all about  he abandoned his seat on the couch and drew a chair close to hers begin at the first page and read very slowly all the way through i wish it were a three volume edition  she looked at him with side glance youre not in the least subtle  i intended to have you understand that i enjoy the thought of your reading to me did you catch it  i caught it no one else ever suggested that i was stupid  i didnt call you stupid i think youre haughty and domineering but youre not stupid  thank you she answered demurely  eventually they drew together and she began to read the marvelous story of the crucial experiments which morselli and his fellows laid upon eusapia palladino two hours passed the robins and thrushes began their evensong the shadows lengthened on the lawn and still these young folk remained at their readingvictor sitting so close to his teachers side that his cheek almost touched her shoulder the sunset glory of the material world was forgotten in the tremendous conceptions called up by the author of this farreaching book  sweeter hours of study victor never had seeing the rise and fall of his interpreters bosom and catching the faint perfume of her hair he heard but vaguely some of the sentences and had to have them repeated what time her eyes were looking straight into his at such moment she reminded him of the dreamface that had bloomed like a rose in the black night for she was then very grave less ardent of blood than he she succeeded in giving her whole mind to the great italians thesis and the point of viewso new and so boldstirred her like a trumpet  i like this man she said he is not afraid  once or twice mrs joyce looked out at them but they made such a pretty picture she had not the heart to disturb them  at seven oclock she was forced to interrupt what are you children up to  improving our minds answered leo are we starting back what time is it  mrs joyce smiled that question is a great compliment to your company its dinnertime  are we starting now  no were going to stay all night  fine shouted victor i was wondering how i could put in the evening  its time to dress warned mrs joyce this is no happygoeasy establishment i never saw such perfection of service as alexander always has i cant get it or if i get it i cant keep it while here with the master gone half the time the wheels go like a chronometer  its all due to marie she worshiped mrs bartol and she venerates mr bartol  mrs joyce cut her short skurry to your room we must not be late  as they were going into the house together leo said i think we would better not let our elders read this book of morsellis its too disturbing for themdont you think so  it certainly is a twister however mother doesnt read any foreign language so shes safe     xii  a moonlight call and a vision   upon rising from the dinner table the young people returned to their books and at ten oclock leo lifted her eyes from her page did some one drive up  victor looked at her dazedly i didnt hear anybody proceed  mercy its ten oclock where are aunt louise and your mother i hear mr bartols voice she exclaimed rising hastily lets go get the latest news  the master of the house entered before the young people could shake off the spell of what they had been imagining  what a waste of good moonlight he exclaimed with smiling sympathy why arent you youngsters out on the lawn  its all your fault responded leo weve been absorbing one of the books you sent up  have you it must have been a wonderful romance i cant conceive of anything but a lovestory keeping youth indoors on a night like this  victor defended her weve been reading of morsellis wonderful experiments its in italian and miss wood has been translating it for me  what luck you have exclaimed mr bartol i engage her to retranslate it for me at the same rate  mrs ollnee and mrs joyce came in as he was speaking and mrs joyce after disposing herself comfortably said well what is your report  he confessed that he had been too busy with other matters to give the aiken accusation much thought however i sent an armful of books out to my assistant attorney he waved his hand toward victor  you dont mean to read books protested mrs joyce energetically when youve the very source of all knowledge right here in your own house why dont you study your client and convince yourself of her powersthen youll know what to do and say  i had thought of that he said hesitantly but  you need not fear mrs joyce assured him its true lucy cannot always furnish the phenomena on the instant in fact the more eager she is the more reluctant the forces are but you can at least try and she is not only willing but eager for the test  bartol turned to mrs ollnee are you prepared nowtonight he asked  yes this moment she answered  mrs joyce exulted the power is on her i can see that see how her hand trembles one finger is signaling dont you see it  mr bartol rose come with me into my study mrs joyce may come some other time i do not want any witnesses tonight he added with a smile  victor watched his mother go into bartols study with something of the feeling he might have had in seeing her enter the den of a lion she seemed very helpless and very inexperienced in contrast with this great inquisitor so skilled in crossexamination so inexorable in logic so menacing of eye  leo perceiving victors anxiety proposed that they return to the porch and to this he acceded though it seemed like a cowardly desertion of his mother poor little mother he said if she stands up against him shes a wonder  the girl stretched herself out on the swinging couch and the youth took his seat on a wicker chair close beside her mrs joyce kept at a decent distance so that if the young people had anything private to say she might reasonably appear not to have overheard it  talk was spasmodic for neither of them could forget for a moment the duel which was surely going on in that inner room indeed mrs joyce openly spoke of it if lucy is not too anxious too eager she will change alexanders whole conception of the universe this night  of course youre exaggerating aunt louise but i certainly expect her to shake him up  it only needs one genuine phenomenon to convince him of her sincerity what a warrior for the cause he would make she must stay right here in his house till she utterly overwhelms him he took up her case at first merely because i asked him to do so but he likes her and is ready to take it up on her own account if he finds her sincere but i want him to believe in the philosophy she represents  half an hour passed with no sign from within and mrs joyce began to yawn that ride made me sleepy  why dont you go to bed suggested leo  she professed concern and leave lucy unguarded  nonsense go to bed and sleep mr ollnee and i will stand guard till the ordeal is ended  i believe ill risk it decided mrs joyce i can hardly keep my eyes open  nor your mouth shut laughed leo hasten or youll fall asleep on the stair  left alone the young people came nigh to forgetting that the world contained aught but dim stretches of moonlit greensward dewy trees and the odor of lilac blooms in the dusk victor stood less in fear of the girl and she moved by the witchery of the night and the melody of his voice into which something new and masterful had come grew less defiant how still it all is she breathed softly it is like the elysian fields after the citys noise and grime  its more beautiful out there he motioned toward the lawn lets walk down the drive  and she complied without hesitation a laugh in her voice but not too far remember we are guardian angels  as she reached his side he took her arm and tucked it within his own you might get lost he said in jocular explanation of his action  how considerate you are she scornfully responded but her hand remained in his keeping  there were no problems now down through the soft dusk of the summer night they strolled rapturously listening to the sounds that were hardly more than silences feeling the touch of each others garments experiencing the magic thrill which leaps from maid to man and man to maid in times like these  how big you are exclaimed the girl i didnt realize how much you overtopped me i am considered tall  and so you areand divinely fair  how banal couldnt you think of a newer one  it was as much as ever i remembered that im not a giant in poetry im a dub at any fine job  of this quality was their talk to those of us who are old and dimeyed it seems of no account perhaps but to those who can remember similar walks and talks it is of higher worth than the lectures in the sorbonne learning is a very chill abstraction on such a night to such a pair would we not all go back again to this sweet land of love and longingif we could  victor did not deliberately plan to draw leonora closer to his side and the proud girl did not intend to permit him to do so but somehow it happened that his arm stole round her waist as they walked the shadowy places of the drive and their laggard feet were wholly out of rhythm to their leaping pulses  the proof of victors naturally dependable character lay in the fact that he presumed no further he was content with the occasional touch of her rounded hip to his the caressing touch of her skirt as it swung about his ankle to have attempted a kiss would have broken the spell would have alarmed and repelled her he honored her loved her but he was still in awe of her proud glance and the imperious carriage of her head he preferred to think she suffered rather than invited the clasp of his arm  she on her part was astonished and a little scared by her own complaisant weakness and as they came out into the lighter part of the walk she disengaged herself with a selfderisive remark and asked do you always take such good care of the arms of your girl friends  always he replied instantly though his heart was still in the clutch of his newborn passion  i shall be on my guard next time i see mr bartol in the doorway dont you think wed better go in what time do you suppose it is  the saddest time in the world for me if you are going to leave me  dont be maudlin she had recovered her selfcommand and was disposed to be extra severe sentimental nothings is hardly your strong point  what is my strong point  she was ready with an answer plain downright impudence  he too was recovering speech im glad i have one strong trait i was afraid there was nothing about me to make a definite impression on a proud beauty like you  please dont try to be literary stick to your oars and your baseball raquet  bat he corrected  i meant bat  i know you did but you said raquet  in this juvenile spat they approached the porch where mr bartol stood waiting for them  young people he called in a voice that somehow voiced a deep emotion do you realize that it is midnight  protesting their amazement they mounted the steps and entered the house but the moment they looked into their hosts face they became serious perceiving that something very tremendous had taken place in his laboratory  what has happened asked leo what did she do  i dont know yet he replied strangely inconclusive in tone and phrase i must think it all over if i can persuade myself that the marvels which i have witnessed are realities the universe is an entirely new and vastly different machine for me  thrilling to the excitement in his face and in his voice they passed on at the top of the stairs leo faced victor with eyes big with excitement what do you suppose came to him  i havent an idea he seemed terribly wrought up though  we must say goodnight she held out her hand and he took it  this has been the finest most instructive day of my life  she released her hand with a little decisive dismissing movement how nice of you signor morselli should know of it goodnight and the smile with which she left him was delightfully provoking and mirthful  victor would have gone straight to his mother had he known where to find her for he was eager to know what had taken place in the deeps of bartols study that she had been able to mystify the great lawyer he was convinced and yet perhaps this was only temporary he will go further what will he find  he was standing before his dresser slowly removing his collar and tie when the door opened and his mother entered she was abnormally wide awake and her eyes violet in their intensity betrayed so much excitement that he exclaimed why mother whats the matter what kind of a session did you have what has happened to you  victor father tells me that mr bartol will be convinced he is the greatest mind i have ever met if i can bring him to a belief in the spirit world it will be the most important victory of my life  what did he say to you what did he think  i dont know and strange to say i cannot read his mind he seems convinced of the phenomena and yet i cant tell for certain he was skeptical at the beginning as nearly every one is  hitherto at every such opening victor had rushed in to pluck the heart out of her mystery but now he restrained himself for fear of trapping her into some admission which would make his own testimony more difficult in court he took a seat on the bed and regarded her with meditative eyes and she went on  the voices are clamoring round me still they want to speak to you  i dont want to hear themnot tonight he replied coldly tell them to wait and talk to me when mr bartol is listening  she seemed disappointed and a little hurt by his tone altair is here she wishes most to speak  interest awoke in him what does she want of me  she listened she says trust mr bartol  he could see nothing hear nothing therefore his face lost its light  well weve got to trust him hes all the help in sight  something a breath the light caress of a hand passed over his hair and a whisper that was almost tone spoke in his ear fear nothing if you will be guided and protected  sweet as this voice was it irritated him for he could not disassociate his mother from it indeed it had something subtly familiar in its utterance and yet he could not accuse her of deceit he only roughly said dont do that i dont like that  silence followed and then his mother sadly said you have hurt her she will not speak again  let her show herself how do i know who is speaking to me let me see her face again he added this in a gentler voice being moved by a vivid memory of the exquisite picture altair had made  after another pause mrs ollnee answered she will do so she says soon she has gone but your father wants to speak to you  victor rose impatiently tell him to come again some other time im sleepy now  she turned away saddened by his manner and with a gentle goodnight went softly from the room  victor regretted his bluntness but could not free himself from a feeling that his mothers voices were deceptive or imaginary and her visit hurt and disgusted him so deeply that the charm of his evenings companionship with leo was all but lost part of her phenomena are real but these voices he broke off and went to his bed with a vague feeling of loss weighing him down  for a halfhour he lay in growing bitterness and then quite suddenly he thought he detected a thin blue vapor rising from the rag rug at the side of his bed and for an instant he was startled is it smoke or do i imagine it as it rose and sank expanded and contracted he studied it closely it was not smoke for it did not ascend it was more like filmy drapery tossed by a wind from a hidden aperture in the floor motionless amazed and awed he watched it till out of it the face of a woman looked her wistful eyes touched with an accusing sorrow it was altair and her form became more real from moment to moment until at last he could detect the swell of her bosom draped with the folds of a shimmering white robe as he waited a hand appeared at her side vaguely outlined yet alive he could see the fingers loosely clasped about a rose she was so beautiful that he lay gazing at her in speechless wonder am i dreaming he asked himself i must be dreaming and yet he could feel the air from the window  in the light of her glance he forgot all his other loves and cares his worship for her returned like swift hunger and he yearned to touch her to hear her voice she is a dream he decided and his hand lifted to test the vision fell back upon the coverlet  as if reading his thought altair put out her right arm and touched his wrist with a caress like the stroke of a beam of moonlight so light and cold it was  victor she seemed to say and his whisper was almost as light as her own  who are you  dont you know me i am altair do not forget me  i will not forget you he answered i cant forget you why do you look so sad  it is cold and empty where i dwell i come to you for happiness and warmth you had forgotten me you would not listen to my voice her reproach moved him almost to tears  i could not see you i was not sure  i do not accuse you it is natural for you to love when the day comes you will seek another one whose flesh is warm mine is cold she is of the day i am of the night but do not refuse to speak to me  her bust had grown fuller more complete as she spoke and yet from the waist downward she seemed but a trailing garment of convoluting phosphorescent gauze her left hand still hung at her side vague diaphanous but her right lay upon her breast as beautiful as real as firelit ivory and her face seemed to glow as though with some inward radiance  victor could follow the exquisite line of her brow and her eyes were glorious pools of color deep and dark with mystery and passion slowly she sank as if kneeling her stately head lowered bent above him and he felt the touch of soft lips upon his owna kiss so warm so human that it filled his heart with worship gently he lifted his hand seeking to draw her to him and for an instant he felt her pliant body in the circle of his armsthen she dissolved vanishedlike some condensation of the atmosphere and he was left alone aching with longing and despair  for a long time he waited hoping she would return he saw the moonlight fade from the carpet he heard the night wind amid the maple leaves and he knew he had not been dreaming for that strange oriental perfume lingered in the air and on the coverlet where her exquisite hand had rested a white bloom lay mystic and wonderful he lifted it and its breath sweeter than that of any other flower he had ever held filled him with instant languor and happy release of care  his next perception was that of sunlight it was morning and the kine and fowls were astir  he looked for the mysterious flower but it was gone he sprang from his bed and searched the room for it it did not exist he sadly concluded it has returned to the mysterious world from whence it came  for a long time afterward he suffered with a sense of loss while the sunlight deepened in his room and the sounds of the barnyard brought back to him the realization that he was in effect a fugitive in the house of a stranger slowly the normal action of his mind and body resumed its sway and he dressed quite sure that something abnormal had brought this vision to him he wondered if he too were getting mediumistic am i to be a son of my mother am i to hear voices and see visions he asked himself with a note of alarm he began to fear the disintegrating effects of these experiences his personality his body hitherto so solid so stable seemed about to develop disturbing capabilities  he was profoundly pleased and reassured to find on his dressingroom table a large white rose a rose precisely like that which had been laid upon his coverlet by the hand of the dreamwoman its odor was the same and its petals were as fresh as if it had just been cut it reassured him by convincing him that his vision was realthat it had a basis of physical change but it also started a perplexing chain of thought how came the rose here who brought it was his question it certainly was not there when i went to bed  with the flower in his hand he still stood looking down at the place where the hand of altair had restedstill marveling at this mingling of the real and the fantastic the dream and the rose when something shining revealed itself half concealed by the pillow and putting out his hand he took up a little brooch of turquoise set with diamonds which he recognized instantly as one that leo had worn at her throat when she said goodnight  sinking into a chair he stared now at the jewel now at the rose while a thrill of pride of mastery of joy stole through him his blood warmed his heart quickened its beat could it be that leo had been his visitor was it possible that she burning with hidden love of him had stolen to his room and there at his bedside masking herself as altair had bent to his drowsy eyes and laid upon his lips that fervid kiss the thought confused him overpowered him exalted him  his was a chivalrous nature therefore this act at the moment seemed neither unmaidenly nor wrongindeed it appeared very beautiful in his eyes it humbled him made him wonder if he were worth the risk she had run he was not abnormally selfappreciative but he had not been left unaware of his appeal to women his previous loveaffairs had been those of the undergraduate proceeding under the jocular supervision of his watchful fellows his present case was in wholly different spirit he was a man nowin fact his quarrel with leo from the first had been over her evident determination to treat him as a lad  the memory of her serene selfpossession made her selfsurrender of the night all the more amazing to him it is cold and empty where i dwell she had said this meant that she loved himlonged for himit could mean nothing else her love had begun during their ride on the lagoon in their delicious drowse on the grass it had been deepened by their afternoon of sweet companionship at tennis and over their books then came the walk in the moonlight and her acceptance of his caress in the dusky place in the pathall were preparatory to this final wondrous visit and confession  and yet her eyes had never been other than those of a friend seemingly she had laughed at herself for the momentary weakness of yielding to his arm her daylight expression had always been that of the humorous selfreliant rather intellectual girl who acknowledges no fear of man and no sudden rush of passion and yethow reconcile the facts  he smiled to think how he had been deceived by her imperious air by her expressed contempt for his interest and all the while she was really waiting for me to break through her reserve he said and this delicious explanation satisfied him for a few moments till he went deeper into his memory of what she had said and done  he was forced to reassure himself again by the jewel and the rose that she had really come to him so dreamlike did the whole ethereal episode now seem the more he dwelt upon the vision the deeper it moved him its growing significance set his blood aflame in fiction and poesy women often sacrifice their reserve moved by uncontrollable longing like the heroine of mad ophelias song because commanded by something stronger than their sweet selves it was hard to think of leo as one carried out of herself by loveand yet here lay the jewel of her bosom in his hand how to meet her puzzled and excited him  up to this minute he had admired her and had paid court to her as a young man naturally addresses a handsome girl but he was not violently in love with her indeed she had interested him rather less than a girl in winona daughter of professor boyden but now as he was about to meet her in the breakfastroom she possessed more power more significance than any woman in the world he recalled how fine and helpful she had been during the few days of their acquaintanceher serenity her good sense her pungent comment began to seem very wonderful  he looked at himself in the glass finding there a very goodlooking stalwart youth but could not discover anything to account for the sudden blaze of leonoras selfsacrificing passion he was neither a fool nor a peacock and he tried to account for her love on the ground of her regard for his mother then like a flash of light came the thought she was sleepwalking  he had read of the marvels of hypnotism and somnambulism perhaps in some strange way his mothers desire to have leo love her son had sent the girl straight to his bedside there was something uncanny in her speech and in her gesturesonly in her kiss had she been solidly warmly human  and yet all this seemed so difficult to believeand besides if the girl came in her sleep did it not prove her love quite as conclusively it might be unconscious but it was there  with heart pounding mightily and face set and stern he left his room and began descending the stairway uncertain still of the way in which he should meet her  happily he found no one in the diningroom but the maid who said to him mr bartol would like to see mr ollnee in his study as soon as mr ollnee has had his breakfast  very well he replied i will make short work of breakfast this morning  as he sat thus awaiting leo his mind filled with the wonder of her selfsurrender he considered carefully in what way he should greet her she must not know that i know he decided i will greet her as if i had not found the brooch and i will leave it where she will happen upon it accidentally     xiii  victor tests his theory   he was still at breakfast deeply engaged with his alluring vision when mrs joyce and his mother entered the room as he rose to greet them mrs joyce asked have you seen mr bartol  not yetbut he is up i am to see him soon where is leo  she is not feeling very brisk this morning and is taking her coffee in bed  he said no more but resumed his seat richer by this added proof of the deep perturbation through which the girl had passed he was disappointed and eager to see her but the conviction that she had been sleepless from love of him put him among the clouds he would have forgotten his appointment with bartol had not the maid reminded him of it even then he tried to avoid it youre sure he wanted me didnt he mean my mother  im quite sure he said mister ollnee  mother what do you suppose he wants of me  i dont know victor perhaps he wants to talk over the trial  come back and tell us as soon as you can commanded mrs joyce im crazy to know what he did last night and what he really thinks of us  victor promised to report and went away to his interview with a vague alarm disturbing the blissful selfsatisfaction of the early morning  he found bartol seated at a big table with a writingpad before him and four or five open volumes disposed about as if for reference he too looked old and worn and rather grim but he greeted his guest politely goodmorning have you seen your mother this morning  yes i have just left her at breakfast  how is she  she seems quite herselfa little pale perhaps  be seated please i want to go over our case with you first of all i want you to tell me once more and in full detail all you know of your mothers life begin at the beginning and leave nothing out dont theorize or try to explaingive me the facts as you have observed them  this was not the kind of business to which a loveexalted youth would set himself but victor squared himself before the brooding face and deepset eyes of his host and entered once more upon the story of the ghostroom which had been the one dark spot in his childhood and which became again in a moment the overshadowing torment of his young manhood  as he talked the intent look of the man before him his short sharp significant questions inspired him he poured forth in eloquent and moving phrase the story of his sudden awakening to a knowledge that his mother was a paid medium and under persecution by the press of the city he told of his sittings with her wherein he had savagely determined to unmask her for her own good he admitted his complete failure he related his experiences during the time she lay in deathly trance and his voice lost its smooth flow as he approached the most marvelous experience of all when the vast and murmuring wind blew through the small room and altair came with sad sweet face to bewitch him and to shake his conceptions of the universe to their foundation stones he confessed his bewilderment and confusion and ended by saying its all unnatural diseased i cant believe it is the real side of things  i wonder that you kept your head at all remarked bartol your youth and good hot blood protect you have you talked with your mother about our sitting  only a few words she came to my room last night and told me she had only a dim recollection of what took place she said the voices wanted to talk to mebut i didnt want them to talk to meand said soand she went away  bartol mused belief is not a matter of evidence it is a habit of mind i find myself unable to follow the evidence of my own senses my tests of your mother last night convinced me at the moment that she had the right to claim supernormal powers she seemingly turned matter into a mere abstraction and made the learning of physicists the chatter of children as he spoke his memory of what he had seen freshened and his excitement increased his voice deepened and his eyes glowed here are my notes of what took place and i have spent the night in comparing my observations with those of sir william crookes concerning the medium home in a certain very real sense the phenomena i witnessed were quite as marvelous as those crookes chronicled he rose and began to walk up and down the room and yet this morning i do not believei cannot believethat writing was precipitated in a closed book held in my hand that a pen rose of its own volition and tapped upon the table  the tendency of any mind any science is to harden to crystallize to reach a stopping point the student is prone to think that the knowledge of the physical universe which we have must be the larger part of all that is knowableand that soon we will have gathered it all into our textbooks of course this is the sheerest selfdelusion a little thought will make clear that all we know is as nothing compared to that which remains to be known up to ten oclock last night i was one of those who believe that the domain of nature is pretty thoroughly mapped out staked and plowed by the investigator but this morning i find my horizons again extended it would be foolish to say that an hours experiments and a night of reading along new lines had overturned all the landmarks of biologic science but i confess that the world for me has greatly changed i held in my hand last night a force in action for which science has no name and no placeand yet thirty years ago sir william crookes wrote of this same force in the spirit with which he discussed other elements and powers and yet his testimony is not accepted by his fellows even today  your mother met every test cheerfully and instantly and demonstrated to me as home did to crookes as slade did to zöllner that matter as we think we know it does not exist she convinced me not merely of her honesty but of her high powers as a psychic a calm persistent logical purpose ran through all her manifestations and her voiceswhatever they may mean to youadvised me to sit again with her and to have you and miss wood mrs joyce and marie always in the circle this i intend to do i feel at this moment as if no other business mattered i have been here at my desk since midnight reading comparing notes trying to convince myself that i have not gone suddenly mad  if i was not utterly deceived if your fresh keen young eyes are of any use whatsoever if the words of crookes wallace lombroso and their like are of any weight then we have in your mother a rare and subtle organism whose powers are of more importance than the rings of saturn or the canals of mars  victor was awed carried out of himself and his small concerns by the deep voice of the great lawyer as he formulated his impassioned yet restrained musings it was evident that he welcomed this opportunity of putting his thoughts into words of ordering his words into argument half in reverie and half in conscious statement to the entranced youth he poured forth his troubled soul  i was a materialist when your mother entered my house i believed that the man who died went out like a candle the grave was the end to me the socalled revelations of buddha gautama christ were the vague dreams of the heartsick the stricken mourners of the earthnot one of them brought a beam of hopebut in this modern spirit of experimentation in the work of crookes and his like i see a ray of light your mothers impersonations of my wife her messagesvoicesmay be due to mindreading to clairvoyance but the method of their delivery certainly lies beyond any known law in that glows my hope grant the possibility of direct writing of the power of the mind to think its will upon paper without the aid of hand or pen and a whole new world is opened up the horizons of life are infinitely extended  he paused abruptly i was weary of my days yesterday i moved as a creature of habit this morning it seems that i have a new interest i am convinced that in defending your mother i am defending something precious to the human race but i must be very sure of my ground i must scrutinize every phase of her power and you must help me you are young and welltrained you have a good mind and i am persuaded you will go far your mother worships you lives for you now you and i together must make such study of her mediumship as america has never seena study which shall have nothing to do with any ism fad or prejudice will you help me  victor overwhelmed by the confidence of the great lawyer by the honor which this plea laid upon his young shoulders could only stammer i will do my best  bartol thanked him i see now as i never did before that this power is a subtle personal psychical adjustment and the part you are to play is a double one first you are her son and your presence and influence are indispensable secondly you are vigorous and alert comparatively free from the wrecking effect of bereavement such as mine i confess i cannot trust myself in the face of the supposed appeal of my dead i am like the doctor who refuses to practise upon his own childmy desires blind me at the same time i see that we cannot thrust strangers upon your mother especially in her present excited state what i propose is a series of private experiments including chemical tests instantaneous photographs and the like which shall convince both judge and jury of the reality of these phenomena this case will come before my friend judge matthews and we have in him a just and penetrating mind if i can make him feel my own present conviction we may rest our case safely with any unprejudiced jury  he paused and picked up a volume from the table crookes is explicit he says he saw the lath move without visible cause he saw home thrust his hand into the hearth and stir the coals he saw the accordion play without any reason and in all this he is sustained by other men testing each phenomenon by means of electrical registering devices now we must duplicate these we must go into court armed with photographs records and witnesses we will make this a cause célèbredoing our small part to forward this superb and fearless european movement i intend to be both lawyer and physicist hereafter he ended with a smile  that the great lawyer was now completely engaged upon his mothers defense victor exultantly perceived and it gave him a feeling of pride and security but this was followed by a sense of being uprooted the sight of this man inspired yet confounded by what had come to him in a single sitting brought new and disturbing force to all that had happened to himself was it possible that thought could be precipitated like dew upon a sheet of paper  now resumed bartol i have made a further discovery there is a brotherhood of what we may call true experimentalistsbeginning with marc thury and the count de gasparin and running to flammarion and richet in paris the dialectical society sir william crookes alfred russell wallace sir oliver lodge in england thence back to the continent to zöllner aksakof ochorowicz de rochas maxwell morselli and lombroso i need a condensed record of these experiments and a synopsis of each theory once within this group you will learn by crossreference the names of all those whom each of these experimentalists regard as reliable you can work here or take the books to your roomperhaps on the whole morsellis record is first in importance bring me a clear and full abstract of that as soon as you can  i do not read italian confessed victor but leomiss wooddoes perhaps she will help me  very good now as to the mechanical side of this matter i have a nephew who is an expert photographer and a clever electrician with your permission i will send for him and see what he can do he is a man of high standing in his profession and a quiet personalityone that will not irritate or alarm your mother shall i bring him in and give her over to all  certainly im sure mother wants you to have full charge  very well we will set to work at once for our case may come up this week at its lowest terms the aiken charge involvesto usthe admission that our client is highly suggestible and that she has been used as an unconscious stoolpigeon by pettus for the present we must proceed upon this basis suggestion is more or less accepted at the present time and we may be able to get the jury to admit our plea but i will not conceal from you the fact that your mother stands in danger of severe punishment the star has singled her out as a scapegoat and is behind the aikens they will push her hard i do not think they will follow her here but if they do i shall send you to my nephews homenow to morselli we must know just where he stands on this amazing branch of biology will you make this synopsis today  victors eyes glowed with the fire of his awakened pride and resolution if youll let me help you mr bartol ill show you what my training has been im quick in some things i will collate and put in order all the latest deductions of science he stopped but what exactly do you intend to do with my mother  i mean to confine her in such wise as to demonstrate precisely what she can do and what she cannot i must divide what is conscious from that which is unconscious i must understand precisely how she produces these messages voices and faces we are agreed that she is not consciously deceptive he questioned victor with a glance  i know she is honest  very well we must demonstrate her honesty we must photograph her socalled materializations side by side with her own body and we must register the work of these invisible hands and in every possible way demonstrate that she is the medium and not the originating cause of these messages in no other way can we save her from disgrace and a prison cell  the youth went away with a humming sound in his head the thought of his gentle little mother herded with vile women within the gray walls of a penitentiary filled him with such horror that his face went drawn and white it shall not be i will not have it so he said and yet he saw no other way in which to prevent it all depended upon the man whose impassioned words still rang in his ears and his admiration for the lawyer rose to that love which youth yields to the highest manhood  mrs joyce met him in the hall excited eager what did he say  victor passed his hand over his face in bewilderment i must think he protested he said so muchwhere is mother  she is on the porchwaiting let us go out to her  he followed her with troubled face but the bright sunshine and the songs of the birds miraculously restored him he looked up and down the piazza hoping to see leo but she was not in sight he took a seat in silence and mrs joyce saw his mother grow pale in sympathy as she read the trouble in his face  mrs joyce urged him to tell what had passed between them and he replied  i cant do it all i can say is this he believes mother is honest and that she has some strange power he will defend her in court but he intends to study into the whole business very closely and he wants us to help him  of course well help him responded mrs joyce readily  mrs ollnee went to the heart of the problem just what does he want to do victor  it is necessary to prove absolutely that you have nothing to do with these phenomena  but i do have everything to do with them she replied thats what being a medium means however i know what he needs better than you do he wants to prove that the messages are supranormal very well i am ready for any test  it will be a fierce one mother he intends to use electricity and machines for recording movements and instantaneous photography  i am willing provided he will proceed in cooperation with your father and watts  he will never do that declared victor he will not begin by granting the very thing hes trying to prove  it was upon this most solemn conference that leo descended pale and restrained and though victor sprang up with newborn love in his face she did not flush with responding warmth her mood of the moonlit walk had utterly vanished and he found himself checked chilled and thrust down from his high place of exaltation  it was as if she ashamed of her own weakness had resolved to punish him for presumption he smarted under her indifference but made no open protest though his hand in the pocket of his coat rested upon the jeweled sign of her selfsurrender  she lost a little of her indifference when she learned that bartol had been kept awake all night by the significance of the phenomena he had witnessed and she joined heartily in declaring that he must be met in every demand oh i wish i might see the experiments she exclaimed  he wishes you to do so replied victor eagerly the voices told him to have you in the circle you and mrs joyce  and marie added mrs ollnee marie is psychic  when do we try asked leo meeting his eyes a little unsteadily so it seemed to him  again mrs ollnee answered for him tonight mr bartol is telephoning now arranging for it  how do you know asked victor  your father is speaking to me  i hear him exclaimed mrs joyce listening intently  what does he say asked leo  mrs ollnee again replied he says be bravetrust us we will protect you  looking across at the girl in whose cheeks the roses were beginning to bloom again the youth resented the interposition of the supernatural he was eager to approach her to hint at the memory of her secret sweet embrace as he studied the exquisite curve of her lips their touch burned again upon his flesh and he rose with sudden reassertion of himself come leo lets return to morselli  he had never called her by her first name before and it produced a shock in them both she looked her reproof but he pretended not to see it and neither mrs joyce nor mrs ollnee seemed to think his familiarity worthy of remark  leo coldly answered i can only give a little time we must go home today  mrs joyce promptly said we cant desert the ship now leo  but we have nothing to wear the girl retorted  well send down and have some things brought up really this work for mr bartol is more important than clothes  i suppose it is leo admitted but at the same time one should have a decent regard to the conventions  the colloquy which followed filled victor with dismay it appeared that leo was really eager to get away as if she felt herself to be in a false position i cant afford to drop my daily affairs in the city why cant these experiments be put off for a day or two  i dont think we ought to ask a great and busy lawyer to accommodate himself to our piffling social plans replied mrs joyce a few minutes ago you were wild to join these experiments now you are crazy to go home  victor who imagined himself in full possession of the reason for her pause said nothing but his eyes spoke and the girl was restless under his glance  she gave in at last well if you will send for the things i need  victor had come from bartols study mightily resolved to do speedily and well any work that might fall to his hand but as he found himself seated close beside the daylight girl and listening to her voice transposing morselli into english his resolution weakened what were ghosts inventions theories compared to the satinsmooth curve of the maidens cheek or the delicate flutter of her lashes  try as he would his attention wandered the book smelled of the clinic the girl of the dawn morsellis problem was all of the night while on every side the young lover beheld trees flashing green mirrors to the sun and flowers riding like dainty boats on the billows of a soft western wind moreover the girls voice was like to the purling of brooks  twice she reproved him for his wandering wits and laggard pen and the second time he said i cant help it the time and place invite to other occupations lets go for a walk  a brave student you are she mocked mr bartol will find you a valuable aid in his scientific investigations  her look her flushed cheek and the hint of her bosom set him atremble the memory of his midnight visitor returned filling him with springtime madness  dont you make game of me he stammered warningly if you doill  she raised an amused glance what what will you do boy  boy her pose her smile were challenges that struck home with swift outflung arm he encircled her waist and drew her to his breast boy am i  she beat upon him pushed him with her small hands let me go brute  he laughed at her exulting in his strength oh i am a brute now am i well im not im a man and your master i want a kiss  she ceased to struggle but into her face and voice came something which paralyzed his arms repentant and ashamed he released her and stood before her humbly while she denounced him for a rowdy with the manners of a burglar this ends our acquaintance she added and she spurned the book on the floor as if it were his worthless self  he was scared now and boyishly pleaded dont godont be angry i was only joking  she knew better than this she had seen elemental fire flaming from his eyes and dared not remain with proud lift of head she walked away leaving him penitent bewildered crushed     xiv  the ordeal   in truth victor had not kept his headhow could he when each day brought some new temptation some unexpected danger or an unforeseen barrier was ever such a week of trial and perplexity thrust upon a youth and the worst of it lay in the fact that there were no signs of a release from these baffling foes loves distress now came to add to his bewilderment and alarm  leo did not appear at luncheon and her absence gave him great uneasiness till mrs joyce explained that she had only gone to town to fetch some needed clothing he still carried the little breastpin in his pocket but it no longer seemed the gage of a lovely girls affection he began to admit that he might be mistaken and that his dreamwoman and the jewel had no necessary connection one of the servants may have dropped it there he now admitted and yet how could that be it was under my pillow when i woke and i am sure it was not there when i went to sleep perhaps i am the one who walks in sleep can it be possible that i took it from her room  it was all very puzzling but he no longer possessed the fatuous selfconceit necessary to charge leo with such selfabandonment as the dream and the discovery of the brooch had at first seemed to indicate he sat among his elders at table silent and depressed very far from the triumphant mood of the morning and yet the stream of his admiration set toward the absent one with ever stronger current the most important thing in all the world at the moment was the winning of her forgiving smile  bartol was equally distraught and though he remained politely attentive to his guests he was plainly absorbed by some inner problem and left to mrs joyce the burden of the conversation  mrs ollnee listless and remote glanced at her host occasionally in the manner of one who awaits an expected sign to her son this attitude on her part was repellant for he understood it to mean that she was neither mother nor guest but an instrument he wondered whether bartol had not by some overmastering power of the mind already assumed control of her thoughts as well as of her actions and he chafed under the pressure of his hosts abstraction oh why cant she quit this business she must stop it he furiously declared  altogether they made a serious and restrained company and all felt the loss of leo as the meal progressed mrs joyce tried to secure from bartol some notion of what his plans were and he gravely replied  none of you must know no one shall enter my ghostroom till i am ready for my tests in fact i think i shall send you all out for a drive this afternoon so that you may not even hear the tap of a hammer  victor protested that he ought to study and to this bartol replied very well take a book with you but go off the farm i want to be able to say that not one of the persons most interested were on the place while my preparations were going on  in truth the man of law was not merely puzzled by the method of transmitting the messages he had been profoundly affected by the words themselves his wife and daughter had apparently spoken to him again each in distinctive way upon matters which no one but himself could recognize  but it was not alone what he had himself seen and heard and felt the reading to which he had set himself had opened a new world of science for him he was amazed at the enormous amount of direct evidence gathered and presented by careful men chemists applying the methods of the retort biologists working in their own laboratories psychologists and medical experts experimenting as upon a clinical subject presented the same or similar facts in austria in russia in england the results were identical to his mind accustomed to sift and relate evidence the most convincing thing of all was the substantial agreement of each and all of these investigators in a certain sense the sneer of the faithful was deserved these men of xray penetration and electrical annunciators had succeeded only in paralleling the phenomena of the early days of the healer and the magician  at its lowest termsor as some would say at its highest termsmrs ollnees power was related to a sort of transcendental physics her magic refilled the most ordinary block of wood or crumb of granite with all its ancient potency it widened and deepened the physical universe inimitably it discovered the human organism to be unspeakably subtle and complicate and made of the soul a visible demonstrable entity unthinkably swift as are the vibrations of the radium ray this substance called the brain is capable of receiving recording giving off still more intricate and marvelous motions of what avail to call it material  at times he glimpsed as through a narrow opening unknown regions of space not of three or four dimensions but an infinite number of worlds within worlds interpenetrating undying yet forever changing at such moments he perceived that the scientists of today were but children groping among the set scenery of a dark stage their textbooks like their bibles the records of the bewildered and stumbling myriads of the past  how absurd he said to attempt to make the present conform with the past the hebrew scriptures the vedas the sagas of the north are all useful as records of the aspirations of primitive men but the real understanding of the universe is to be obtained now or in the future the present contains all that the past has possessed and more men are less of the beast and more of the spirit their powers have intensified grown psychic compelling revealing and yet the mystery of the universe remains and must remain  in such ways and others his mind ran as he read swiftly through the wondrous record of experiments made in rome in naples in milan he liked these italians better than the greatest of the englishmen for the reason that they uttered no apology to the pope they proceeded on the assumption that they were biologists not priests they had no care whether their discoveries harmonized with some mans bible or whether they did not the question was simple could the human organism put forth from itself a supernumerary hand or arm could it project an etheric double of itself could it interpenetrate matter  along these lines he proposed with victors aid to study his psychic guest he had lost sight of the fact that he was to be her defender in courtor if he remembered it it was only as a secondary consideration he had no faintest hope of directly proving the continued existence of his wife and children but he could see that a demonstration of the power of the living body to project and maintain at a distance an etheric brain a voice made by inference a belief in immortality possible  this belief this possible life of the soul had nothing to do with the systems of celestial cosmogony built up by the followers of christ or gautama its world was not peopled with angels gods or devils it was merely another and interfusing material region wherein the spirit of man could move retaining at least a dim memory of the grosser material plane from which it fled it was inconceivable of course when scrutinized directly but he caught a glint of its wonders now and then as if from the corner of his halfclosed eye  these physical marvels were kept very near to him as he sat at his desk by minute tappings on his penholder on his chairback and by fairy chimes rung on the cutglass decanter at his elbow at times he felt the light touch of hands and once as he returned to his seat after a visit to the library he found a sheet of strange parchment thrust under his book and on this was written in exquisite oldfashioned script thou hast thy comfort and thy instrument hold not thy hand and it was signed aurelius  this was all very startling but he referred it to mrs ollnee herself to imagine it a direct message from the dead was beyond him  at four oclock the roadwagon brought from the station a small alert and businesslike young fellow accompanied by various boxes parcels and bags bartol met him at the door and took him at once to his study neither of them was seen again till dinnertime  the servants were profoundly excited by all this but were too well trained to betray their curiosity above stairs they knew now who mrs ollnee was but they believed in their masters government and listened to the hammering in the study with impassive faceswhile at their duties in the hall or diningroombut permitted themselves endless conjecture in their own quarters marie alone took no part in these discussions though she seemed more excited than any of the others  meanwhile victor watched and waited in a fever of anxiety for leos return at five oclock she came but went directly to her room  marie met her tense with excitement oh miss leo master has asked me to sit in the circle tonight and im scared  you mean mr bartol has asked you  yesmiss  well you should feel exalted marie it will be a wonderful experience  i suppose so miss but my hands are all cold and my stomach sick with thinking of it  leo laughed youre psychic thats whats the matter with you  oh do you think so  let me take your hands marie gave them leo smiled cold and wet yes you are it but dont let it interfere with dinner im hungry as a bear cheer up id give anything to be a psychic  i shall flunk it miss i cant go through it really  nonsense it will be good as a play  half an hour later the others came in and leo heard victors voice in the hall with a feeling of distaste she had gone out to him during that moonlit walk and was suffering now a natural revulsion it had not been love it had been she admitted only physical attraction and the fault the weakness had been hers his presuming upon her moment of compliance was of the nature of man it had frightened her to discover such deeps within herself we are all animals at bottom she charged in the unnatural cynicism of youth  notwithstanding this mood she clothed herself handsomely in a gown which lent beauty to the exceedingly dignified rôle she designed to play and so costumed went to her aunts room to hear the news  mrs joyce was lying down and her voice sounded tired as she said we were ordered out of the house at three and have been driving ever since alexander so marie says has had strange men working all the afternoon on some contrivance in his study evidently he is going to be very scientific  leo exclaimed with delight now well see if these faces and forms are real or not  why leo do you doubt  yes deep in my heart i do i cannot quite free myself from the belief that in some way lucy produces all these effects  of course she transmits them shes a medium  i dont mean it that wayand i dont mean that she cheats but somehow i never feel as if anything real came to me direct  mrs joyce did not feel able to pursue this line of argument whats the matter between you and victor  who told you anything was the matter  i sensed it  well why didnt you sense the cause  hes a nice boy you mustnt illtreat him leo  your solicitude is misplaced you should be concerned about me  you trust you to take care of yourself i never knew a more selfsufficient young person i am only waiting for some man to teach you your place  this was a frequent subject of very plain though jocular allusion between them a man maysome timebut not a rowdy boy how does lucy take the promise of a test  very calmly she is relying wholly on her band to protect her she feels the importance of the trial and does not shrink from it  the miss wood whom victor met as he entered the diningroom that night was precisely the young lady he had first seen a calm smiling superior person who looked down upon him with goodhumored tolerance of his youth and sex putting him into the position of the bad little boy who has promised not to do so again she not merely loftily forgave him she had apparently minimized the offense and this hurt worst of all im sorry not to have been able to work today she said but i really had to go to town  this lofty elderly sister air after her compliance to his arm eventually angered him his awe his gratitude of the morning were turned into the mans desire to be master he set his jaws in sullen slant and bided his time you cant treat me in this way when were alone he said beneath his breath  later he was hurt by her vivid interest in the young inventor whom bartol introduced as stinchfield he was a small man with a round red face and laughing blue eyes but he spoke with authority his knowledge was amazing for its wide grasp but especially for its precision he guessed at nothing he knewor if he did not know he said so frankly in the few short years of his professional career he had been associated with some of the greatest masters of matter his acquaintances were all men of exact information and trained judgment men who lived amid physical miracles and wrought epics in steel and stone  naturally he absorbed the attention of the table for in answer to questions he touched upon his career and his talk was absorbing he had been a year at panama he had helped to survey the route for a vast colorado irrigating tunnel and in his spare moments had perfected a number of important inventions in automobile construction  it was for all these reasons that bartol had phoned him urging him to come out and assist in the infinitely more important work of reducing to law the phenomena which sprang apparently without rule or reason from the trances of his latest and most interesting client here is your chance to get a grip on the phenomena that have puzzled the world for centuries he said  when mrs joyce asked stinchfield if he knew anything about spirit phenomena he replied candidly  not a thing directly mrs joyce of course i have read a good deal but i have never experimented it is not easy to secure cooperation on the part of those gifted with these powers the trouble seems to be they consider themselves in a sense priests keepers of a faith whereas i have the natural tendency to think of them in terms of physics  bartol smiling raised a hand i dont want the company drawn into controversy experts agree that argument defeats a psychic  mrs ollnee still wore the look of one who but half listens to what is said and mrs joyce slyly touched her hand with the tips of her fingers do you want to go to your room she asked  mrs ollnee shook her head no i am all right  we will have better results if we cut out dessert mrs joyce explained to bartol overeating has spoiled many a séance  is it as physical as that exclaimed stinchfield  i never eat when i am on a hard case said bartol  victor began to awaken to the crucial nature of the test which was about to be made of his mothers powers this laughing young physicist was precisely the sort of man to put the screws severely on it was all a problem in mechanics for him whether the psychic suffered or rejoiced in the operation did not concern him if she is deceiving us in any way he will discover it the son forecasted with a feeling of fear at his heart and yet how can i defend her  bartol said to mrs ollnee would you mind dressing for the performance id like you to go with mrs joyce and marie and clothe yourself in all black if possible so that i can say you came into my study not merely searched but reclothed  she said quite simply i have no objection at all i am in your hands  after the older women left the room victor drew near to leo with a low word poor little mother she is in the hands of the inquisition tonight  thrilling to the excitement of the hour she forgot her resentful superior pose isnt that little man magnificent why didnt you go in for civil engineering or chemistry  because no one had sense enough to advise me he bitterly answered  think where that funny little body has carried that head she continued still studying stinchfield if he had only been given shoulders like yours  im glad you like something about me  i was speaking of your body as a machine for carrying a brain around over the earth  you seem to think of me as having no brain  oh not quite so bad as that you have a brain but its undeveloped  im growing up rapidly these days seems like id lived a year since our walk last night  she colored a little forget that and ill forgive you  i cant forget that  have you any idea what the tests are to be she asked in an effort to change the subject  no im outside of it all i hope they wont scare my poor little mother out of her senses ought i to step in and stop it  no not unless the voices say so they welcome investigationso theyve always said what i should insist on if i were you is plenty of time and a series of sittings  she was speaking now in gracious mood and he eager to win from her a fuller expression of forgiveness spoke again bravely i hope you are not going to be angry with me  not at all she replied with disheartening impersonal cordiality i was partly to blame i forgot you were a hotheaded boy  dont take that tone with mei wont stand it  how can you help it she answered with a smile and moved toward the end of the table where bartol and stinchfield still sat smoking and leisurely sipping their coffee  the little engineer sprang up as she drew near and stood like a soldier at attention as she said are you in merciless mood tonight mr stinchfield  far from it he responded im in a receptive mood the fact that mr bartol has found enough in this subject to wish to investigate predisposes me to openmindedness  suppose we go into the library suggested bartol and they all followed him across the hall  leo walked with the engineer leaving victor in the rear hurt and suffering sorely  it was not so much her displayed interest in stinchfield as her haughty disregard of himself that touched his selfesteem thereafter he sulked like the boy she declared him to be  when his mother came in robed in black and looking the sad young widow he was on the verge of rebellion against the whole plan of action but he kept silence while bartol explained his design  it is customary for mediums to have things their own way but in this case mrs ollnee has placed herself entirely in my hands the tests will be made in my study he turned the key and unlocked the door mr stinchfield will enter first and see that the room is as we left it  the engineer entered and after a moments survey called all is untouched come in  bartol led the way with mrs ollnee and when victor the last to enter had paced slowly over the threshold stinchfield locked the door and handed the key to his host the inquisition was begun  the most notable furnishing of the room was a battery of three cameras so arranged that they could be operated instantaneously and mrs joyce asked anxiously has the band consented to this  they have consented to a trial answered mrs ollnee in a faint voice she had grown very pale and her hands were trembling to victor this seemed like the tremor of terror and his heart was aching with pity  on one side of the room a deep alcove lined with books had been turned into a darkroom by means of curtains and before these draperies stood the inevitable wooden table but beside it inclosing a chair was a conical cage of wire netting encircled by bands of copper  mrs joyce exclaimed you do not intend to cage her in that  that is my intention calmly replied bartol  have the controls consented asked mrs joyce  yes answered mrs ollnee  of the further intricacies of stinchfields preparation victor had no hint so artfully were they concealed but he recognized in it all a kind of humorous skepticism which the engineer radiated in spite of his manifest wish to appear respectful and as his mother entered her little torture tent victor said you neednt do this if you dont want to mother  your father commands it she replied submissively  stinchfield screwed the cage to the floor and made an attachment to a small wire which ran along the bookcase to a dark corner victor was enough of the physicist to infer that his mother was now surrounded by an electric current  bartol explained we are to start in total darkness and then we intend to try various degrees and colors of lights mrs ollnee how will you have us sit  i want victor opposite me with leo at his right and louise at his left mr stinchfield will then be able to operate his wires you mr bartol sit at leos right and nearest the cage her voice was now quite firm and her manner decided all sit at the table for a time  stinchfield snapped out the lights one by one till only two one red the other green struggled against the darkness when these went out the room was perfectly black  bartol then said in the cabinet behind the medium is a selfregistering column of mercury a typewriter and a switch which will light a lamp which hangs in the ceiling above the cabinet and which has no other connection the psychic is inclosed in a mesh of steel wire too fine to permit the putting forth of a finger if the lamp is lighted the column of mercury lifted or the typewriter keys depressed it will be by some supranormal power of the medium there is also on a table just inside the curtains with paper and pencils a small tin trumpet a bell and a zither upon it if possible we wish to obtain a written message independent of mrs ollnee  it is the unexpected that happens remarked mrs joyce shall we clasp hands lucy  yes answered mrs ollnee  victor reaching for leos hand tingled with something not scientific a current of something subtler than electricity which came from her palm he thought he detected in her fingers a returning warmth of grasp  they are here announced mrs joyce after some ten minutes of silence  who are here asked bartol  my bandand many others  how can you tell  i hear them a faint whisper soon distinguished itself and mrs joyce reported that mr blodgett was speaking he says he realizes the importance of this test and that he has summoned all the most powerful of the spirits within reach and that they will do all they can he says the wire cage is a new condition but they will meet it be patient the strain on lucy is very great but it cannot be avoided  in the silence which followed this conversation leo shuddered and clutched victors hand as if for protection the other world is opening dont you feel it she whispered i can hear the rustle of wings  he growing very tense himself answered i feel only my mothers anxiety are you comfortable mother he asked  she did not reply and mrs joyce said she is asleep and all became silent again  hello exclaimed stinchfield who touched me  no one in the circle answered mrs joyce highly elated  i certainly felt a hand on my shoulderthere it comes again shall i flash my camera  not now came a clear full whisper apparently from the cabinet you would fail now wait  who spoke asked bartol  as there was no reply mrs joyce asked is it you mr blodgett  no the whisper replied  is it watts  yes  it is isaac watts now it is his science against yours mr stinchfield  bartol fell into the mode at once we are glad to be so honored now watts i wantand i must haveincontestable proof of the psychics abnormal powernothing else can save her from state prison do you realize that  we do  very well proceed  what would you call incontestable proof  i should say a registered pressure on the key or the lighting of the lamp above the cabinet  a vivid red flash lit up the room stinchfield shouted the lampthe lamp was lit  his excitement to all but bartol was ludicrously high and mrs joyce openly chuckled what else do you want done mr science  writing independent of mrs ollnee replied bartol  after a long and painful silence the bell tinkled faintly and as all listened breathlessly the zither began to play  now who is doing that asked the engineer  turn on the green light suggested the voice  stinchfield lit the green lamp and by its glow the psychic was seen in her cage reclining limply her face ghostly white in the light bartol looked about the circle every hand was in view and yet the zither continued to play its weird and wistful little tune leo and mrs joyce took this as a matter of course but the men sat in rigid amazement  lights out whispered the voice  stinchfield put out his lamp that is astounding he said i cannot analyze that  will you swear the psychic did not do it asked the voice  the engineer hesitated yes he finally said  is this sufficient asked the unseen  bartol replied sufficient for my argument but i do not understand these physical effects and the jury may demand other proof it will be necessary for us to show that the messages which misled as well as those which comforted came from some power outside the psychic and beyond her control i believe that as in the case of anna rothecondemned by a german court to a long term of imprisonmentthe charge of imposture and swindling made against mrs ollnee must lie unless i can demonstrate that these messages come from her subconscious self in some occult way or from personalities other than herself in fact the whole case against mrs ollnee lies in the questiondoes she believe in the voices as entities existing and acting outside herself  he interrupted himself to say something is tapping my hand it feels like the small tin horn  it is came the answer in such volume that it could be heard all over the room  does this not prove the medium innocent of ventriloquism  stinchfieldwhat about this asked bartol  the engineer could only repeat i dont understand it it is out of my range  again the red lamp above the cabinet flashed and by its momentary glow the horn was seen floating high over the cage in which the medium sat motionless and ghastly white  shall i flashlight that asked stinchfield again  no answered the voice the flashlight is very dangerous we must use it only for the supreme thing be patient  there was no longer any spirit of jocularity in the room each one acknowledged the presence of something profoundly mysterious something capable of transforming physical science from top to bottom something so farreaching in its effect on law and morals as to benumb the faculties of those who perceived it it was in no sense a religious awe with bartol it was the humbleness which comes to the greatest minds as they confront the unknowable deeps of matter and of space  the boy and girl forgot their names their sex they touched hands as two infinitely small insects might do in the impenetrable night of their world their hates as unimportant as their loves only the bereaved wife and mother leaned forward with the believers full faith in the heaven from which the beloved forms of her dead were about to issue  suddenly the curtains of the alcove opened disclosing a narrow strip of some glowing white substance it was not metal and it was not drapery it was something not classified in science and stinchfield stared at it with analytic eyes talking under breath to bartol it is not phosphorus but like it i wonder if it emits heat  mrs joyce explained it is the halfopened door into the celestial plane i saw a face looking out  this light vanished as silently as it came and the zither began to play again and a multitude of fairy voiceslike a splendid chorus heard far down a shining hallsang exquisitely but sadly an unknown anthem while still the men of law and science listened in stupefaction the voices died out and the zither still playing rose in the air and at the instant when it was sounding nearest the ceiling the red lamp above the cabinet was again lighted and the instrument played by two faintly perceived hands continued floating in the air  silent openmouthed staring stinchfield heard the zither descend to the table before him then he awoke i must photograph that  not yet insisted the voice wait for a more important sign  in victors mind a complete revulsion to faith had come his heart went out in a rush of remorseful tenderness and awe the last lingering doubt of his mother disappeared like a flash of lightning memory swept back over his past all he had seen and heard of the ghostroom stood revealed in a pure white light it was all trueall of it she has never deceived me or any one else she is wonderful and pure as an angel incredible as were the effects he had seen and which he had rejected as unconscious trickery not one of them was more destructive of the teaching of his books than this vision of the zither played high in the air by sad sweet hands he longed to clasp his mother to his bosom to ask her forgiveness but his throat choked with an emotion he could not utter  bartol with tense voice said to stinchfield we have succeeded in paralleling crookes experiment with this alone i can save her  the flash of radiance from the cabinet interrupted him and a new voicean imperative voicecalled  green light  stinchfield turned his switch and there in the glow of the lamp stood a tall female figure with pale sweet oval face and dark mysterious eyes  it is altair exclaimed leo  victor shivered with awe and exalted admiration for the eyes seemed to look straight at him the room was filled with that familiar unaccountable odor and a cold wind blew as before from the celestial visitant with suggestions of limitless space and cold white light  be faithful the sweet voice said do not grieve do your work goodby  the vision lasted but an instant but in that moment stinchfield and bartol both perceived the psychic in her electric prison lying like a corpse with lolling head and ghostly sunken cheeks she seemed to have lost half her bulk like a partly filled garment she draped her chair  the engineer spoke in a voice soft pleading husky with excitement may i flashlight now  not thatbut this uttered a mans voice and forth from the cabinet a faintly luminous mist appeared  red lamp  in the glow of the sixteencandlepower light the face of a bearded man was plainly seen it wore a look of grave expectancy  shall i fire asked stinchfield  it may destroy our instrument answered the figure but proceed  the blinding flash which followed was accompanied by a cry followed by a moan and lucy ollnee was heard to topple from her chair to the floor in the moment of horrified silence which followed the voice commanded  be silent do not stir turn off your current  in his excitement stinchfield turned off both light and current and left the whole room in darkness victor was on his feet crying out she has fallen she is dying  stay where you are my son keep the room dark we will take care of your mother  so absolute was his faith at the moment victor resumed his seat though he was trembling with fear leo reached for his hand dont be frightened they will care for her  we have witnessed the miraculous declared bartol stricken into irresolution by what had taken place  mrs joyce accustomed to these marvels added her word of warning dont go to her yet spirits are all about her it has been a terrible shock but they will heal her  stunned silent baffled by what he had seen the scientist sat with his hand on the switches controlling the lights ready to carry out the orders of his invisible colleague  red light commanded the voice approachquietly victor take charge of your mothers body she will not reenter it her spirit is with us  victor went forward and knelt in agony while the engineer lifted the cage and delivered the unconscious psychic into his hands                                       lucy ollnee breathed no more she had died as she had lived a martyr to the unseen world  but her death was triumphant for on the sensitive plate of each camera science and law were able to read the proof of her power in the dark face of his grandsire victor read a stern contempt as though he said  deny and still deny in the end you must believe  in the alcove on the pad these words were written in his mothers hand do not grieve my work is done i do not go far i shall be near to cheer and guide you your future is secure work hard be patient and all will be well farewell but not goodby  below written in the quaint script which victor recognized were these words men of science and of law blazon forth the marvels you have seen and tested make the world ring with them in such wise will you advance veneration for god and remove the fear of death      watts     xv  the ring   bartol obeyed the command of the invisible powers he gladly blazoned the triumphant death of the psychic to the world lucy ollnee became at once a glorious martyr for her faith a victim of science liberal journals and religious journals alike lamented that it was necessary for the sake of proof as regards immortality that an innocent woman should be caged and tortured to death with electric batteries and even the star leader in the war against the mediums permitted itself an editorial word of regret and published in full bartols letter and also a long interview with stinchfield wherein he admitted the genuineness of the dead womans claims to supranormal power  but all this was at the moment of small comfort to victor for a long time he refused to believe in the reality of his mothers death insisting that she was in deep trance as she had been before but at last when the body was to be removed to mrs joyces home and doctor steele and doctor eberly had both examined it and found no signs of life he gave up all hope of her return  accompanied by mrs joyce he visited the california avenue flat for the last time to pack up the few things of value which his mother had been permitted to acquire his attitude toward the chairs the slates the old table had utterly changed they were now instinct with his mothers power permeated with some part of her subtler material self and he was minded to preserve them they were no longer the tools of a conjuror they were the sacred relics of a priestess  mrs joyce asked permission to house them for him till he had secured a home of his own and to this he consented for with his present feeling concerning them he was troubled by the thought of their being stored in dark vaults among masses of commonplace furniture  i shall keep the table in my own room said mrs joyce it may be that lucy will be able to manifest herself to me through it i have been promised such power  to this victor made no reply for while he now believed absolutely in all that his mother claimed to do he had not been brought to a belief in the return of the dead and it was this fundamental doubt which made his grief so bitter if only she could know that i believe in her he said to leo on the morning of the day when his mothers body was to be taken away think of it she died a thousand times for the curious and the selfish only to be called an impostor and a cheatand i her only son was afraid the charge was true if only i could have told her that i believed in her  she knows the girl gently assured him they were seated at the moment in the library and the morning was very warm and silent the birds seemed to be resting in preparation for their evensong your mother is near usshe may be listening to us this minute  i cant believe that he declared sadly im not sure that i want to believe it i cant endure the thought of my mothers destruction and yet the notion of her floating about somewhere like a wreath of mist is sorrowful to me  leo confessed to somewhat the same feeling heavenany kind of heavenhas always been incomprehensible to me and yet we must believe there is some sort of system of rewards and punishments anyhow your mothers death was glorious she died as she would have wished to diein proving her faith  she gave too much he protested all her life she was set apart to do a martyrs work i understand now why my father couldnt stand it i know how he must have resented these voices and i cannot blame him for going away would you marry a man like stainton moses or david home  she recoiled a little before the thought of course notbut  what  your mother was charming if your father really loved her  he did im sure of that at first but these ghosts destroyed his home my mother confessed to me that they tormented my father for his unbelief and he had to go  they are together now and he believes  victor fixed a penetrating look upon her do you really believe that the dead speak to us  i see no reason why they shouldntif they want to how else can you explain these voices  he shook his head im afraid these modern italian scientists are right the voices were only parasitic personalities nothing else but lets not talk of them im tired of the ghostroomall my life ive had itand now im going to forget it if i can  hush your mother may hear you and grieve  if she can hear me she will understand my feeling i like the world as it isi dont want the supernatural thrust into it  i think youre wrong she said firmly the larger view is that of the scientist who recognizes nothing supernatural in the universe i would not part with what your mother gave me for huge sums ive had wonderful thrilling experiences remember altair  altair yes he remembered her and remembering her he recalled the graceful figure at his bedside and the touch of the faintly clinging lips that mystery remained the most inexplicable of them all  while thus he sat dreamfilled and rapt the girl studied him and her face changed you believe in altair whats more you love her and i cant blame you for it she is more beautiful than angels you will not forsake the ghostroom so long as you have a hope that she may return  you are mistaken he protested altair is only a dream i worship her as a figure in a vision do you know what i think she was her look questioned and he went on for days i have pondered on her face and figure in the light of modern science and i am convinced that she was nothing but a union of my mothers astral self and you  she looked at him in startled thought what do you mean  he explained eagerly you must have noticed how much like my mother she was her brow was the sameher eyes the same  yes they were a little like hers  but her mouth and chin were exactly like yours her hands were like yours she held her head exactly as you doand then she changed sometimes my mother predominated in her sometimes you were the stronger  the girl was deeply affected by the significance of this analysis you imagined all that  he pushed on i did not and furthermore altair never came till you sat with my mother she never attained such powerso your aunt agreestill i came into the circle she represented my conception of my mother and you i loved my mother and i admired youand out of my love and admiration altair was created  that is absurd if ever a spirit came from heaven altair was that one why she was palpable ive touched her hands  he said slowly she was beautiful i confess so beautiful that on that first night she made even you seem coarse and material  i felt your disdain she thrust in with sudden hurt  but that was only for the moment i could see nothing but her faceso sad so wistful but let me ask you something did you the night after our walk on the drive in the moonlightdid you dream of me  her lip curled in a wondering smile what a question to ask of me  but did you come now be honest i have a reason for askingdid you  what is your reason for asking  that night altair came to my bedside  her eyes flashed and she rose to her feet you have an oriental imagination  dont gohear me out it was a beautiful experience  apparently it was to me your story is insulting  he lost patience a little and said bluntly you act as if i charged you with something i say altair came and to me her visit was very significant and beautiful because she testified to me that both you and my mother were thinking of me it was in fact your united astral selves that paid that visit altair was your materialized friendship and my mothers love  what a fantastic notion she said but she lingered held by something new and masterful in his voice  she added with some humor be kind enough to imagine that your mothers astral self preponderated in that vision  i do for when altair stooped to kiss me  stop she cried out sharply you go too far  leo he called and his voice checked her as quickly as if he had caught her by the arm i am not joking i am very serious you must remember that i have lost both my mother and altairyou alone remaini cant afford to lose you you are all i have now dont be angry with me  she considered him with a return to pity forgive me she hurriedly retracted i am very sorry for you and i dont want to seem unfriendly but it is only a week since we met what can you know of me in so short a time  i loved you the moment you came into my mothers room  nonsense you hated me  i did not like the way you treated me but i never hated you i was afraid of you  if your mother can hear you say that she is certainly smiling for she knows you are not afraid of anybody youre a very stiffnecked person  i know you have a right to laugh at me but i believe our guides have brought us together i need younowand if i dared id ask you to wear this he disclosed a ring in his hand  she looked at it narrowly i know that ring it was your mothers she kept it in a little velvet box together with an oldfashioned locket  yes it is hers it isnt very grand compared with your own but i wish youd put it on and consider it my promissory note  your promissory note  yes i promise to buy it back with all the money you have lost through my mothers advice will you wear it for me  where do you expect to find so much money  right here in this great city mr bartol is to take me into his office hes like a father to me already but i dont expect him to give me anything im going to work and im going to pay you back the money you have lost  extending her little finger she took the ring daintily on its tip all that sounds very romantic and yet young men do win wealth and fame right hereand why not you  thats just it i may be the future monopolizer of airships the maid appearing at the moment announced that a lady wished to see mr ollnee  did she give her name  no sir but she said she was a relative sir  tell her i will see her in a moment  as the maid left leo rose  dont go pleaded victor my visitor can wait you havent said whether you will wear my ring or not i dont know how long it may be before i can make good but it will help mightily to know that you are expecting me to do so  she pondered but her face was kindly and her voice very gentle as she said i dont want to seem unkind now in your hour of grief but i cant wear the ring his eyes filled with tears and she added ill keep it for you the real question between us will have to be decided some time in the futurewhen we know each other better you need not think of paying me go and see your relation it may be a rich aunt come to adopt you  couldnt you learn to love me he asked poignantly  i might she smiled i like you already and she went away leaving him with stronger will to dare and do     xvi  conclusion   as victor entered the library he was met by a very pale wideeyed young woman in a picturesque black hat her voice was deep and full of dramatic fervor as she said  you are victor ollnee  i am  her eyes large and very dark almost black gazed at him appealingly as she said pardon me for a little deception i am your relation only in a spiritual sensei share your sorrow and in other ways i am related to you i was eager to see you and i did not send in my name for the reason that it would have repelled you and you might have refused to meet me  victor thought her a very singular and very theatric young person certainly she was under some strong stress of emotion which caused her lips to quiver and her voice to vibrate tensely he knew her now she was the girl he had confronted in the courtroom and he stared at her uncertain of his footing she seemed like some of the figures he had seen on the stage vivid swift of change unreal but her voice was vibrantly charming he was sure she was the girl he had met on the street and she had stood beside the man aiken during their brief appearance in the courtroom  she approached a step or two as if throwing herself on his mercy my name is florence aiken i am a newspaper writer i am the one who brought all this trouble to you it was i who wrote that first article in the star denouncing your mother  he recoiled before her quite as dramatically as she could have wished you wrote that he exclaimed i thought a man did that job  she could not help a slight expression of pride in her work it was mine every word of it i was terribly vindictive i admit but you must know i had some provocation let me tell you will you listen to me please do im not so heartless as i seemed in that article and i cannot rest till i have made my peace with you  her voice her pale face her intense eyes and her tense contralto voice softened his resentment  ill listen but you cant expect me to forgive a thing like that  may i sit  certainly he answered but remained standing as if to retain his guard  dont condemn me altogether she pleaded wait till you know how much reason i had to hate the whole brood of clairvoyants seers and psychics my dear old grandmother was an easy mark for the cheapest of them and i who paid for her nurse out of my own thin little purse and waited upon her night and day had a right to consider her small fortune my own it wasnt much but it was enough to pay the cost of a flat and to see it all going to fakers and greasy palmistswell it was too much it made a crusader of meand it would have made one of you it was not a question of your motheralone i went to our managing editor at last and told him my story i made it clear to him that the city was full of these harpies who prey on poor old women like my grandmother they ought to be driven out of town i said cut loose he said and i did my article on your mother was honest i believed her to be simply another one of the same sort of impostors i took her just like three or four others whose methods i knew and i got my cousin frank aiken to bring suit against her i thought she was a crook i feel differently today since talking with judge bartol and mr stinchfield i handled both those assignments ive changed my estimate of her i have written a page article vindicating her ive come to tell you that her death in that cage has changed the situation for me i am convinced that she was sincere and i want to humble myself before you her son and ask your forgiveness i know you feel more like killing me but here i ami couldnt rest without letting you know that i need your pardon  her plea swift voiced in music and illustrated by her pale face glowing eyes and sensitive lips powerfully affected him he towered over her in savage silence for a little while then with effort he said i dont see how i can do anything to you for i felt the same wayi mean i didnt believe in my mothers business  she became radiant didnt you  no up to the very moment when that red lamp was lit i could not believe in her i couldnt help doubtingeven now i need the photographs to bolster up my belief  the reportorial instinct awoke in her i wish i might see those photographsto reassure myself not for publication may i see them  he did not observe that her desire for his pardon seemed suddenly to be met even though he had not yet put it in words and his mind was wholly on the question of the photographic tests as he slowly replied  they are very marvelousespecially those which came on the unexposed plates  her eyes widened in wonder what do you mean  mr stinchfield had several packages of plates opened ready to use in his cameras but the voices only let him make one flashlight it seems as if they knew the experiment would end my mothers life and yet on each of the unexposed plates are faces and forms some of which mr bartol recognized  let me see themplease she pleaded earnestly they will comfort me too for i am under conviction  he took from his pocket a package of small photographs here he said are the three flashlights of my grandfather nelson blodgett  the young woman almost snatched them in her eager haste oh wonderful what a document the medium plainly in her cageand this figure on the same plate  it is the most convincing picture in existence he said sadly but it cost me my mother  she fixed a dreamy gaze upon him if this is a spiritthen your mother can return to you has she done so  he moved uneasily i have not asked her to do that i dont care to be controlled or guided by spirits not even by her spirit  why  his voice was firm and assured as he replied because i want to live and work out my career like other men i dont want to see or hear any more of the astral plane he checked himself it isnt natural for a man like me to be mixed up with all this spirit business and im tired of it  i see what you mean you want to work and woo and marry like other men youre right of course youre right what have we who are young and vigorous to do with the dead anyway unless all human life is a mistake a foolish thing its our business to live it humanly she held out her hand for the other pictures let me see them all please  he handed them to her there were three cameras he explained hence these duplicates these faces are likenesses of mr bartols wife and two childrenand these plates remember were not exposedthey are of altair one of the guides  she studied the shadowy forms with keen gaze one of the strange things about this spirit photograph business is the resemblance they all bear to picturesi mean they all look as if they were photographs of framed portraits or drawings  again he betrayed restlessness mr stinchfield noticed that  what is his explanation  he does not think they come from spirits at all  she urged him to unbosom himself you have a conviction what is it  his theory is that they are only mental images transferred by some unknown mental power to the plates  what about the figure of your grandsire  his theory is that the figure was really the etheric self of my mothershaped to the form like my grandsire by her own mind  she stared at him and you accept that  i dont know what else to believe yes i accept that i dont believe the dead have any right to talk and fool with the lives of the living the way ive been fooled with and sidetracked his voice was full of fervor now im going to live my own life hereafter irrespective of the deadresponsible only to the living i will not be disciplined by ghosts  the girl laid the photographs down softly and looked at him with frank admiration youre a very extraordinary young man she said sagely  no im not he protested im just a good average a week ago my hottest ambition was to carry the winona ball team to victory if i had the money and the courage id go back there tomorrow and finish my course  what do you mean by courage  well you know what id be loaded up with to go back there now would be the devil and all your article broke my peaceful combination just a week ago last sunday  but i have undone my work i have vindicated your mother you have a right to be proud of her she was as real a martyr as ever went to the stake  i know but ill be a marked figure all the same  you were a marked figure before but consider all explanations have been madewait till you read my article go back she insisted i wish you would her voice was rich with pleading it would make me happy i feel horribly guiltyreally i do im only a grubbing reporterpersonive had to earn my way and keep house for my grandmother besides but id gladly share my salary to help you return to college please go backit will relieve my mind of a big burden  he took her hand in the spirit in which it was offered i am within a few days of graduation but  please go backfor the sake of a poor little newspaper wretch who feels that she has indirectly spoiled your career she pressed his hand fervidly promise me this and youll take a monstrous load off my shoulders  she had the face the temperament of the actress and loved to experiment on the hearts of men but she was deeply in earnest now bartol and stinchfield had really changed her point of view as regards mrs ollnee and this situation appealed to her at the moment with irresistible power life was to her a drama intense neverending romantic and at the moment she loved this splendid young man orphaned by her hand  he could not resist her caressing voice her appealing eyes her sensitive lips and he said i promise  thank you she said and dropping his hand she lifted burning yet tearful eyes to his face you are very generous  he went on i am sure you meant well  i dont want to rest under false imputations she repeated i did not mean well that first article was savage i was angry i struck blindly but i struck to hurt  well all that is ended he replied sadly my mother is to be buried today  she looked at him in silence for a moment i have one more request to make she said at last and her voice was very soft and hesitating id like to look upon her face i want to ask her forgiveness  his heart melted at this plea and he turned away to hide his tears when he could speak he said she is very beautiful i cannot believe even now that she is dead but i have given my consent to have her taken to the cemetery i will show her to you  in silence she followed him up the stairway and into the cool dark room where the coffin lay  the windows were open at the bottom and though the shades were drawn the chamber was filled with soft light the cries of the barnyard and the twitter of birds outside seemed strangely softened as the two young people so singularly brought together approached the still form of the seeress and looked into her face serene with the infinite repose of death  victor with choking throat and burning eyes stood at the bier unable to utter a sound but the girl after a long glance took a rose from her bosom and with a sigh gently laid it on the still small white hands of the silent form  accept my homage she intoned softly and if you can still see and hear pardon me and forget my bitter words  she stood a moment thereafter as if involuntarily listening waiting
