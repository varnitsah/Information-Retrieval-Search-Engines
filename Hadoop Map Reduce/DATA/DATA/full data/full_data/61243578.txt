61243578	the doliver romance and other pieces                           tales and sketches                         by nathaniel hawthorne                            times portraiture    being the carriers address to the patrons of the salem gazette for the 1st of january 1838  address  kind patronswe newspaper carriers are times errandboys and all the year round the old gentleman sends us from one of your doors to another to let you know what he is talking about and what he is doing we are a strange set of urchins for punctually on new years morning one and all of us are seized with a fit of rhyme and break forth in such hideous strains that it would be no wonder if the infant year with her step upon the threshold were frightened away by the discord with which we strive to welcome her  on these occasions most generous patrons you never fail to give us a taste of your bounty but whether as a reward for our verses or to purchase a respite from further infliction of them is best known to your worshipful selves  moreover we times errandboys as aforesaid feel it incumbent upon us on the first day of every year to present a sort of summary of our masters dealings with the world throughout the whole of the preceding twelvemonth  now it has so chanced by a misfortune heretofore unheard of that i your present petitioner have been altogether forgotten by the muse  instead of being able as i naturally expected to measure my ideas into sixfoot lilies and tack a rhyme at each of their tails i find myself this blessed morning the same simple proser that i was yesterday and shall probably be tomorrow  and to my further mortification being a humbleminded little sinner i feel no wise capable of talking to your worships with the customary wisdom of my brethren and giving sage opinions as to what time has done right and what he has done wrong and what of right or wrong he means to do hereafter  such being my unhappy predicament it is with no small confusion of face that i make bold to present myself at your doors  yet it were surely a pity that my nonappearance should defeat your bountiful designs for the replenishing of my pockets  wherefore i have bethought me that it might not displease your worships to hear a few particulars about the person and habits of father time with whom as being one of his errandboys i have more acquaintance than most lads of my years  for a great many years past there has been a woodcut on the cover of the farmers almanac pretending to be a portrait of father time  it represents that respectable personage as almost in a state of nudity with a single lock of hair on his forehead wings on his shoulders and accoutred with a scythe and an hourglass  these two latter symbols appear to betoken that the old fellow works in haying time by the hour but within my recollection time has never carried a scythe and an hourglass nor worn a pair of wings nor shown himself in the halfnaked condition that the almanac would make us believe  nowadays he is the most fashionably dressed figure about town and i take it to be his natural disposition old as he is to adopt every fashion of the day and of the hour  just at the present period you may meet him in a furred surtout with pantaloons strapped under his narrowtoed boots on his head instead of a single forelock he wears a smart auburn wig with bushy whiskers of the same hue the whole surmounted by a germanlustre hat  he has exchanged his hourglass for a gold patentlever watch which he carries in his vestpocket and as for his scythe he has either thrown it aside altogether or converted its handle into a cane not much stouter than a ridingswitch  if you stare him full in the face you will perhaps detect a few wrinkles but on a hasty glance you might suppose him to be in the very heyday of life as fresh as he was in the garden of eden  so much for the present aspect of time but i by no means insure that the description shall suit him a month hence or even at this hour tomorrow  it is another very common mistake to suppose that time wanders among old ruins and sits on mouldering walls and mossgrown stones meditating about matters which everybody else has forgotten  some people perhaps would expect to find him at the burialground in broad street poring over the halfillegible inscriptions on the tombs of the higginsons the hathornesnot hawthorne as one of the present representatives of the family has seen fit to transmogrify a good old namethe holyokes the brownes the olivers the pickmans the pickerings and other worthies with whom he kept company of old  some would look for him on the ridge of gallows hill where in one of his darkest moods he and cotton mather hung the witches  but they need not seek him there  time is invariably the first to forget his own deeds his own history and his own former associates  his place is in the busiest bustle of the world  if you would meet time face to face you have only to promenade in essex street between the hours of twelve and one and there among beaux and belles you will see old father time apparently the gayest of the gay  he walks arm in arm with the young men talking about balls and theatres and afternoon rides and midnight merrymakings he recommends such and such a fashionable tailor and sneers at every garment of six months antiquity and generally before parting he invites his friends to drink champagnea wine in which time delights on account of its rapid effervescence  and time treads lightly beside the fair girls whispering to them the old deceiver that they are the sweetest angels he ever was acquainted with  he tells them that they have nothing to do but dance and sing and twine roses in their hair and gather a train of lovers and that the world will always be like an illuminated ballroom  and time goes to the commercial newsroom and visits the insuranceoffices and stands at the corner of essex and st peters streets talking with the merchants  however time seldom has occasion to mention the gentlemans name so that it is no great matter how he spells or pronounces it about the arrival of ships the rise and fall of stocks the price of cotton and breadstuffs the prospects of the whalingbusiness and the codfishery and all other news of the day  and the young gentlemen and the pretty girls and the merchants and all others with whom he makes acquaintance are apt to think that there is nobody like time and that time is all in all  but time is not near so good a fellow as they take him for  he is continually on the watch for mischief and often seizes a sly opportunity to lay his cane over the shoulders of some middleaged gentleman and lo and behold  the poor mans back is bent his hair turns gray and his face looks like a shrivelled apple  this is what is meant by being timestricken  it is the worst feature in times character that he always inflicts the greatest injuries on his oldest friends  yet shamefully as he treats them they evince no desire to cut his acquaintance and can seldom bear to think of a final separation  again there is a very prevalent idea that time loves to sit by the fireside telling stories of the puritans the witch persecutors and the heroes of the old french war and the revolution and that he has no memory for anything more recent than the days of the first president adams  this is another great mistake  time is so eager to talk of novelties that he never fails to give circulation to the most incredible rumors of the day though at the hazard of being compelled to eat his own words tomorrow  he shows numberless instances of this propensity while the national elections are in progress  a month ago his mouth was full of the wonderful whig victories and to do him justice he really seems to have told the truth for once  whether the same story will hold good another year we must leave time himself to show  he has a good deal to say at the present juncture concerning the revolutionary movements in canada he blusters a little about the northeastern boundary question he expresses great impatience at the sluggishness of our commanders in the florida war he gets considerably excited whenever the subject of abolition is brought forward and so much the more as he appears hardly to have made up his mind on one side or the other  whenever this happens to be the caseas it often doestime works himself into such a rage that you would think he were going to tear the universe to pieces but i never yet knew him to proceed in good earnest to such terrible extremities  during the last six or seven months he has been seized with intolerable sulkiness at the slightest mention of the currency for nothing vexes time so much as to be refused cash upon the nail  the above are the chief topics of general interest which time is just now in the habit of discussing for his more private gossip he has rumors of new matches of old ones broken off with now and then a whisper of goodnatured scandal sometimes too he condescends to criticise a sermon or a lyceum lecture or performance of the gleeclub and to be brief catch the volatile essence of present talk and transitory opinions and you will have times gossip word for word  i may as well add that he expresses great approbation of mr russells vocal abilities and means to be present from beginning to end of his next concert  it is not every singer that could keep time with his voice and instrument for a whole evening perhaps you will inquire what are times literary tastes and here again there is a general mistake  it is conceived by many that time spends his leisure hours at the athenaeum turning over the musty leaves of those large wormeaten folios which nobody else has disturbed since the death of the venerable dr oliver  so far from this being the case times profoundest studies are the new novels from messrs ives and jewetts circulating library  he skims over the lighter articles in the periodicals of the day glances at the newspapers and then throws them aside forever all except the salem gazette of which he preserves a file for his amusement a century or two hence  we will now consider time as a man of business  in this capacity our citizens are in the habit of complaining not wholly without reason that time is sluggish and dull  you may see him occasionally at the end of derby wharf leaning against a post or sitting on the breech of an iron cannon staring listlessly at an unrigged east indiaman  or if you look through the windows of the union marine insurance office you may get a glimpse of him there nodding over a newspaper among the old weatherbeaten seacaptains who recollect when time was quite a different sort of fellow  if you enter any of the drygoods stores along essex street you will be likely to find him with his elbows on the counter bargaining for a yard of tape or a paper of pins  to catch him in his idlest mood you must visit the office of some young lawyer still however time does contrive to do a little business among us and should not be denied the credit of it  during the past season he has worked pretty diligently upon the railroad and promises to start the cars by the middle of next summer  then we may fly from essex street to state street and be back again before time misses us  in conjunction with our worthy mayor with whose ancestor the lord mayor of london time was well acquainted more than two hundred years ago he has laid the cornerstone of a new city hall the granite front of which is already an ornament to court street  but besides these public affairs time busies himself a good deal in private  just at this season of the year he is engaged in collecting bills and may be seen at almost any hour peregrinating from street to street and knocking at half the doors in town with a great bundle of these infernal documents  on such errands he appears in the likeness of an undersized portly old gentleman with gray hair a bluff red face and a loud tone of voice and many people mistake him for the pennypost  never does a marriage take place but time is present among the weddingguests for marriage is an affair in which time takes more interest than in almost any other  he generally gives away the bride and leads the bridegroom by the hand to the threshold of the bridal chamber  although time pretends to be very merry on these occasions yet if you watch him well you may often detect a sigh  whenever a babe is born into this weary world time is in attendance and receives the wailing infant in his arms  and the poor babe shudders instinctively at his embrace and sets up a feeble cry  then again from the birthchamber he must hurry to the bedside of some old acquaintance whose business with time is ended forever though their accounts remain to be settled at a future day  it is terrible sometimes to perceive the lingering reluctance the shivering agony with which the poor souls bid time farewell if they have gained no other friend to supply the gray deceivers place  how do they cling to time and steal another and yet another glance at his familiar aspect but time the hardhearted old fellow goes through such scenes with infinite composure and dismisses his best friends from memory the moment they are out of sight  others who have not been too intimate with time as knowing him to be a dangerous character and apt to ruin his associatesthese take leave of him with joy and pass away with a look of triumph on their features  they know that in spite of all his flattering promises he could not make them happy but that now they shall be so long after time is dead and buried  for time is not immortal  time must die and be buried in the deep grave of eternity  and let him die  from the hour when he passed forth through the gate of eden till this very moment he has gone to and fro about the earth staining his hands with blood committing crimes innumerable and bringing misery on himself and all mankind  sometimes he has been a pagan sometimes a persecutor  sometimes he has spent centuries in darkness where he could neither read nor write  these were called the dark ages  there has hardly been a single year when he has not stirred up strife among the nations  sometimes as in france less than fifty years ago he has been seized with fits of frenzy and murdered thousands of innocent people at noonday  he pretends indeed that he has grown wiser and better now  trust him who will for my part i rejoice that time shall not live forever  he hath an appointed office to perform  let him do his task and die  fresh and young as he would make himself appear he is already hoary with age and the very garments that he wears about the town were put on thousands of years ago and have been patched and pieced to suit the present fashion there is nothing new in him nor about him  were he to die while i am speaking we could not pronounce it an untimely death  methinks with his heavy heart and weary brain time should himself be glad to die  meanwhile gentle patrons as time has brought round another new year pray remember your poor petitioner  for so small a lad you will agree that i talk pretty passably well and have fairly earned whatever spare specie time has left in your pockets  be kind to me and i have good hope that time will be kind to you  after all the hard things which i have said about him he is reallythat is if you take him for neither more nor less than he is worth and use him as not abusing himtime is really a very tolerable old fellow and may be endured for a little while that we are to keep him company  be generous kind patrons to times errandboy  so may he bring to the merchant his ship safe from the indies to the lawyer a goodly number of new suits to the doctor a crowd of patients with the dyspepsia and fat purses to the farmer a golden crop and a ready market to the mechanic steady employment and good wages to the idle gentleman some honest business to the rich kind hearts and liberal hands to the poor warm firesides and food enough patient spirits and the hope of better days to our country a return of specie payments and to you sweet maid the youth who stole into your dream last night  and next new years day if i find nothing better to do in the mean while may time again bring to your doors your loving little friend
