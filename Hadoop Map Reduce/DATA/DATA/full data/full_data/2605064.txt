generations and bore indeed the name of their birthplacebretton of bretton whether by coincidence or because some remote ancestor had been a personage of sufficient importance to leave his name to his neighbourhood i know not  when i was a girl i went to bretton about twice a year and well i liked the visit the house and its inmates specially suited me the large peaceful rooms the wellarranged furniture the clear wide windows the balcony outside looking down on a fine antique street where sundays and holidays seemed always to abideso quiet was its atmosphere so clean its pavementthese things pleased me well  one child in a household of grown people is usually made very much of and in a quiet way i was a good deal taken notice of by mrs bretton who had been left a widow with one son before i knew her her husband a physician having died while she was yet a young and handsome woman  she was not young as i remember her but she was still handsome tall wellmade and though dark for an englishwoman yet wearing always the clearness of health in her brunette cheek and its vivacity in a pair of fine cheerful black eyes people esteemed it a grievous pity that she had not conferred her complexion on her son whose eyes were bluethough even in boyhood very piercingand the colour of his long hair such as friends did not venture to specify except as the sun shone on it when they called it golden he inherited the lines of his mothers features however also her good teeth her stature or the promise of her stature for he was not yet fullgrown and what was better her health without flaw and her spirits of that tone and equality which are better than a fortune to the possessor  in the autumn of the year  i was staying at bretton my godmother having come in person to claim me of the kinsfolk with whom was at that time fixed my permanent residence i believe she then plainly saw events coming whose very shadow i scarce guessed yet of which the faint suspicion sufficed to impart unsettled sadness and made me glad to change scene and society  time always flowed smoothly for me at my godmothers side not with tumultuous swiftness but blandly like the gliding of a full river through a plain my visits to her resembled the sojourn of christian and hopeful beside a certain pleasant stream with green trees on each bank and meadows beautified with lilies all the year round the charm of variety there was not nor the excitement of incident but i liked peace so well and sought stimulus so little that when the latter came i almost felt it a disturbance and wished rather it had still held aloof  one day a letter was received of which the contents evidently caused mrs bretton surprise and some concern i thought at first it was from home and trembled expecting i know not what disastrous communication to me however no reference was made and the cloud seemed to pass  the next day on my return from a long walk i found as i entered my bedroom an unexpected change in addition to my own french bed in its shady recess appeared in a corner a small crib draped with white and in addition to my mahogany chest of drawers i saw a tiny rosewood chest i stood still gazed and considered  of what are these things the signs and tokens i asked the answer was obvious a second guest is coming mrs bretton expects other visitors  on descending to dinner explanations ensued a little girl i was told would shortly be my companion the daughter of a friend and distant relation of the late dr brettons this little girl it was added had recently lost her mother though indeed mrs bretton ere long subjoined the loss was not so great as might at first appear mrs home home it seems was the name had been a very pretty but a giddy careless woman who had neglected her child and disappointed and disheartened her husband so far from congenial had the union proved that separation at last ensuedseparation by mutual consent not after any legal process soon after this event the lady having overexerted herself at a ball caught cold took a fever and died after a very brief illness her husband naturally a man of very sensitive feelings and shocked inexpressibly by too sudden communication of the news could hardly it seems now be persuaded but that some overseverity on his partsome deficiency in patience and indulgencehad contributed to hasten her end he had brooded over this idea till his spirits were seriously affected the medical men insisted on travelling being tried as a remedy and meanwhile mrs bretton had offered to take charge of his little girl and i hope added my godmother in conclusion the child will not be like her mamma as silly and frivolous a little flirt as ever sensible man was weak enough to marry for said she mr home is a sensible man in his way though not very practical he is fond of science and lives half his life in a laboratory trying experimentsa thing his butterfly wife could neither comprehend nor endure and indeed confessed my godmother i should not have liked it myself  in answer to a question of mine she further informed me that her late husband used to say mr home had derived this scientific turn from a maternal uncle a french savant for he came it seems of mixed french and scottish origin and had connections now living in france of whom more than one wrote de before his name and called himself noble  that same evening at nine oclock a servant was despatched to meet the coach by which our little visitor was expected mrs bretton and i sat alone in the drawingroom waiting her coming john graham bretton being absent on a visit to one of his schoolfellows who lived in the country my godmother read the evening paper while she waited i sewed it was a wet night the rain lashed the panes and the wind sounded angry and restless  poor child said mrs bretton from time to time what weather for her journey i wish she were safe here  a little before ten the doorbell announced warrens return no sooner was the door opened than i ran down into the hall there lay a trunk and some bandboxes beside them stood a person like a nursegirl and at the foot of the staircase was warren with a shawled bundle in his arms  is that the child i asked  yes miss  i would have opened the shawl and tried to get a peep at the face but it was hastily turned from me to warrens shoulder  put me down please said a small voice when warren opened the drawingroom door and take off this shawl continued the speaker extracting with its minute hand the pin and with a sort of fastidious haste doffing the clumsy wrapping the creature which now appeared made a deft attempt to fold the shawl but the drapery was much too heavy and large to be sustained or wielded by those hands and arms give it to harriet please was then the direction and she can put it away this said it turned and fixed its eyes on mrs bretton  come here little dear said that lady come and let me see if you are cold and damp come and let me warm you at the fire  the child advanced promptly relieved of her wrapping she appeared exceedingly tiny but was a neat completelyfashioned little figure light slight and straight seated on my godmothers ample lap she looked a mere doll her neck delicate as wax her head of silky curls increased i thought the resemblance  mrs bretton talked in little fond phrases as she chafed the childs hands arms and feet first she was considered with a wistful gaze but soon a smile answered her mrs bretton was not generally a caressing woman even with her deeplycherished son her manner was rarely sentimental often the reverse but when the small stranger smiled at her she kissed it asking what is my little ones name  missy  but besides missy  polly papa calls her  will polly be content to live with me  not always but till papa comes home papa is gone away she shook her head expressively  he will return to polly or send for her  will he maam do you know he will  i think so  but harriet thinks not at least not for a long while he is ill  her eyes filled she drew her hand from mrs brettons and made a movement to leave her lap it was at first resisted but she saidplease i wish to go i can sit on a stool  she was allowed to slip down from the knee and taking a footstool she carried it to a corner where the shade was deep and there seated herself mrs bretton though a commanding and in grave matters even a peremptory woman was often passive in trifles she allowed the child her way she said to me take no notice at present but i did take notice i watched polly rest her small elbow on her small knee her head on her hand i observed her draw a square inch or two of pockethandkerchief from the dollpocket of her dollskirt and then i heard her weep other children in grief or pain cry aloud without shame or restraint but this being wept the tiniest occasional sniff testified to her emotion mrs bretton did not hear it which was quite as well ere long a voice issuing from the corner demandedmay the bell be rung for harriet  i rang the nurse was summoned and came  harriet i must be put to bed said her little mistress you must ask where my bed is  harriet signified that she had already made that inquiry  ask if you sleep with me harriet  no missy said the nurse you are to share this young ladys room designating me  missy did not leave her seat but i saw her eyes seek me after some minutes silent scrutiny she emerged from her corner  i wish you maam good night said she to mrs bretton but she passed me mute  goodnight polly i said  no need to say goodnight since we sleep in the same chamber was the reply with which she vanished from the drawingroom we heard harriet propose to carry her upstairs no need was again her answerno need no need and her small step toiled wearily up the staircase  on going to bed an hour afterwards i found her still wide awake she had arranged her pillows so as to support her little person in a sitting posture her hands placed one within the other rested quietly on the sheet with an oldfashioned calm most unchildlike i abstained from speaking to her for some time but just before extinguishing the light i recommended her to lie down  by and by was the answer  but you will take cold missy  she took some tiny article of raiment from the chair at her crib side and with it covered her shoulders i suffered her to do as she pleased listening awhile in the darkness i was aware that she still weptwept under restraint quietly and cautiously  on awaking with daylight a trickling of water caught my ear behold there she was risen and mounted on a stool near the washstand with pains and difficulty inclining the ewer which she could not lift so as to pour its contents into the basin it was curious to watch her as she washed and dressed so small busy and noiseless evidently she was little accustomed to perform her own toilet and the buttons strings hooks and eyes offered difficulties which she encountered with a perseverance good to witness she folded her nightdress she smoothed the drapery of her couch quite neatly withdrawing into a corner where the sweep of the white curtain concealed her she became still i half rose and advanced my head to see how she was occupied on her knees with her forehead bent on her hands i perceived that she was praying  her nurse tapped at the door she started up  i am dressed harriet said she i have dressed myself but i do not feel neat make me neat  why did you dress yourself missy  hush speak low harriet for fear of waking the girl meaning me who now lay with my eyes shut i dressed myself to learn against the time you leave me  do you want me to go  when you are cross i have many a time wanted you to go but not now tie my sash straight make my hair smooth please  your sash is straight enough what a particular little body you are  it must be tied again please to tie it  there then when i am gone you must get that young lady to dress you  on no account  why she is a very nice young lady i hope you mean to behave prettily to her missy and not show your airs  she shall dress me on no account  comical little thing  you are not passing the comb straight through my hair harriet the line will be crooked  ay you are ill to please does that suit  pretty well where should i go now that i am dressed  i will take you into the breakfastroom  come then  they proceeded to the door she stopped  oh harriet i wish this was papas house i dont know these people  be a good child missy  i am good but i ache here putting her hand to her heart and moaning while she reiterated papa papa  i roused myself and started up to check this scene while it was yet within bounds  say goodmorning to the young lady dictated harriet she said goodmorning and then followed her nurse from the room harriet temporarily left that same day to go to her own friends who lived in the neighbourhood  on descending i found paulina the child called herself polly but her full name was paulina mary seated at the breakfasttable by mrs brettons side a mug of milk stood before her a morsel of bread filled her hand which lay passive on the tablecloth she was not eating  how we shall conciliate this little creature said mrs bretton to me i dont know she tastes nothing and by her looks she has not slept  i expressed my confidence in the effects of time and kindness  if she were to take a fancy to anybody in the house she would soon settle but not till then replied mrs bretton     chapter ii  paulina   some days elapsed and it appeared she was not likely to take much of a fancy to anybody in the house she was not exactly naughty or wilful she was far from disobedient but an object less conducive to comfortto tranquillity eventhan she presented it was scarcely possible to have before ones eyes she moped no grown person could have performed that uncheering business better no furrowed face of adult exile longing for europe at europes antipodes ever bore more legibly the signs of home sickness than did her infant visage she seemed growing old and unearthly i lucy snowe plead guiltless of that curse an overheated and discursive imagination but whenever opening a roomdoor i found her seated in a corner alone her head in her pigmy hand that room seemed to me not inhabited but haunted  and again when of moonlight nights on waking i beheld her figure white and conspicuous in its nightdress kneeling upright in bed and praying like some catholic or methodist enthusiastsome precocious fanatic or untimely sainti scarcely know what thoughts i had but they ran risk of being hardly more rational and healthy than that childs mind must have been  i seldom caught a word of her prayers for they were whispered low sometimes indeed they were not whispered at all but put up unuttered such rare sentences as reached my ear still bore the burden papa my dear papa this i perceived was a oneidead nature betraying that monomaniac tendency i have ever thought the most unfortunate with which man or woman can be cursed  what might have been the end of this fretting had it continued unchecked can only be conjectured it received however a sudden turn  one afternoon mrs bretton coaxing her from her usual station in a corner had lifted her into the windowseat and by way of occupying her attention told her to watch the passengers and count how many ladies should go down the street in a given time she had sat listlessly hardly looking and not counting whenmy eye being fixed on hersi witnessed in its iris and pupil a startling transfiguration these sudden dangerous naturessensitive as they are calledoffer many a curious spectacle to those whom a cooler temperament has secured from participation in their angular vagaries the fixed and heavy gaze swum trembled then glittered in fire the small overcast brow cleared the trivial and dejected features lit up the sad countenance vanished and in its place appeared a sudden eagerness an intense expectancy it is were her words  like a bird or a shaft or any other swift thing she was gone from the room how she got the housedoor open i cannot tell probably it might be ajar perhaps warren was in the way and obeyed her behest which would be impetuous enough iwatching calmly from the windowsaw her in her black frock and tiny braided apron to pinafores she had an antipathy dart half the length of the street and as i was on the point of turning and quietly announcing to mrs bretton that the child was run out mad and ought instantly to be pursued i saw her caught up and rapt at once from my cool observation and from the wondering stare of the passengers a gentleman had done this good turn and now covering her with his cloak advanced to restore her to the house whence he had seen her issue  i concluded he would leave her in a servants charge and withdraw but he entered having tarried a little while below he came upstairs  his reception immediately explained that he was known to mrs bretton she recognised him she greeted him and yet she was fluttered surprised taken unawares her look and manner were even expostulatory and in reply to these rather than her words he saidi could not help it madam i found it impossible to leave the country without seeing with my own eyes how she settled  but you will unsettle her  i hope not and how is papas little polly  this question he addressed to paulina as he sat down and placed her gently on the ground before him  how is pollys papa was the reply as she leaned on his knee and gazed up into his face  it was not a noisy not a wordy scene for that i was thankful but it was a scene of feeling too brimful and which because the cup did not foam up high or furiously overflow only oppressed one the more on all occasions of vehement unrestrained expansion a sense of disdain or ridicule comes to the weary spectators relief whereas i have ever felt most burdensome that sort of sensibility which bends of its own will a giant slave under the sway of good sense  mr home was a sternfeaturedperhaps i should rather say a hardfeatured man his forehead was knotty and his cheekbones were marked and prominent the character of his face was quite scotch but there was feeling in his eye and emotion in his now agitated countenance his northern accent in speaking harmonised with his physiognomy he was at once proudlooking and homelylooking he laid his hand on the childs uplifted head she saidkiss polly  he kissed her i wished she would utter some hysterical cry so that i might get relief and be at ease she made wonderfully little noise she seemed to have got what she wantedall she wanted and to be in a trance of content neither in mien nor in features was this creature like her sire and yet she was of his strain her mind had been filled from his as the cup from the flagon  indisputably mr home owned manly selfcontrol however he might secretly feel on some matters polly he said looking down on his little girl go into the hall you will see papas greatcoat lying on a chair put your hand into the pockets you will find a pockethandkerchief there bring it to me  she obeyed went and returned deftly and nimbly he was talking to mrs bretton when she came back and she waited with the handkerchief in her hand it was a picture in its way to see her with her tiny stature and trim neat shape standing at his knee seeing that he continued to talk apparently unconscious of her return she took his hand opened the unresisting fingers insinuated into them the handkerchief and closed them upon it one by one he still seemed not to see or to feel her but byandby he lifted her to his knee she nestled against him and though neither looked at nor spoke to the other for an hour following i suppose both were satisfied  during tea the minute things movements and behaviour gave as usual full occupation to the eye first she directed warren as he placed the chairs  put papas chair here and mine near it between papa and mrs bretton i must hand his tea  she took her own seat and beckoned with her hand to her father  be near me as if we were at home papa  and again as she intercepted his cup in passing and would stir the sugar and put in the cream herself i always did it for you at home papa nobody could do it as well not even your own self  throughout the meal she continued her attentions rather absurd they were the sugartongs were too wide for one of her hands and she had to use both in wielding them the weight of the silver creamewer the breadandbutter plates the very cup and saucer tasked her insufficient strength and dexterity but she would lift this hand that and luckily contrived through it all to break nothing candidly speaking i thought her a little busybody but her father blind like other parents seemed perfectly content to let her wait on him and even wonderfully soothed by her offices  she is my comfort he could not help saying to mrs bretton that lady had her own comfort and nonpareil on a much larger scale and for the moment absent so she sympathised with his foible  this second comfort came on the stage in the course of the evening i knew this day had been fixed for his return and was aware that mrs bretton had been expecting him through all its hours we were seated round the fire after tea when graham joined our circle i should rather say broke it upfor of course his arrival made a bustle and then as mr graham was fasting there was refreshment to be provided he and mr home met as old acquaintance of the little girl he took no notice for a time  his meal over and numerous questions from his mother answered he turned from the table to the hearth opposite where he had placed himself was seated mr home and at his elbow the child when i say child i use an inappropriate and undescriptive terma term suggesting any picture rather than that of the demure little person in a mourning frock and white chemisette that might just have fitted a goodsized dollperched now on a high chair beside a stand whereon was her toy workbox of white varnished wood and holding in her hands a shred of a handkerchief which she was professing to hem and at which she bored perseveringly with a needle that in her fingers seemed almost a skewer pricking herself ever and anon marking the cambric with a track of minute red dots occasionally starting when the perverse weaponswerving from her controlinflicted a deeper stab than usual but still silent diligent absorbed womanly  graham was at that time a handsome faithlesslooking youth of sixteen i say faithlesslooking not because he was really of a very perfidious disposition but because the epithet strikes me as proper to describe the fair celtic not saxon character of his good looks his waved light auburn hair his supple symmetry his smile frequent and destitute neither of fascination nor of subtlety in no bad sense a spoiled whimsical boy he was in those days  mother he said after eyeing the little figure before him in silence for some time and when the temporary absence of mr home from the room relieved him from the halflaughing bashfulness which was all he knew of timiditymother i see a young lady in the present society to whom i have not been introduced  mr homes little girl i suppose you mean said his mother  indeed maam replied her son i consider your expression of the least ceremonious miss home i should certainly have said in venturing to speak of the gentlewoman to whom i allude  now graham i will not have that child teased dont flatter yourself that i shall suffer you to make her your butt  miss home pursued graham undeterred by his mothers remonstrance might i have the honour to introduce myself since no one else seems willing to render you and me that service your slave john graham bretton  she looked at him he rose and bowed quite gravely she deliberately put down thimble scissors work descended with precaution from her perch and curtsying with unspeakable seriousness said how do you do  i have the honour to be in fair health only in some measure fatigued with a hurried journey i hope maam i see you well  torrerably well was the ambitious reply of the little woman and she now essayed to regain her former elevation but finding this could not be done without some climbing and straininga sacrifice of decorum not to be thought ofand being utterly disdainful of aid in the presence of a strange young gentleman she relinquished the high chair for a low stool towards that low stool graham drew in his chair  i hope maam the present residence my mothers house appears to you a convenient place of abode  not particererly i want to go home  a natural and laudable desire maam but one which notwithstanding i shall do my best to oppose i reckon on being able to get out of you a little of that precious commodity called amusement which mamma and mistress snowe there fail to yield me  i shall have to go with papa soon i shall not stay long at your mothers  yes yes you will stay with me i am sure i have a pony on which you shall ride and no end of books with pictures to show you  are you going to live here now  i am does that please you do you like me  no  why  i think you queer  my face maam  your face and all about you you have long red hair  auburn hair if you please mamma calls it auburn or golden and so do all her friends but even with my long red hair and he waved his mane with a sort of triumphtawny he himself well knew that it was and he was proud of the leonine hue i cannot possibly be queerer than is your ladyship  you call me queer  certainly  after a pause i think i shall go to bed  a little thing like you ought to have been in bed many hours since but you probably sat up in the expectation of seeing me  no indeed  you certainly wished to enjoy the pleasure of my society you knew i was coming home and would wait to have a look at me  i sat up for papa and not for you  very good miss home i am going to be a favourite preferred before papa soon i daresay  she wished mrs bretton and myself goodnight she seemed hesitating whether grahams deserts entitled him to the same attention when he caught her up with one hand and with that one hand held her poised aloft above his head she saw herself thus lifted up on high in the glass over the fireplace the suddenness the freedom the disrespect of the action were too much  for shame mr graham was her indignant cry put me downand when again on her feet i wonder what you would think of me if i were to treat you in that way lifting you with my hand raising that mighty member as warren lifts the little cat  so saying she departed     chapter iii  the playmates   mr home stayed two days during his visit he could not be prevailed on to go out he sat all day long by the fireside sometimes silent sometimes receiving and answering mrs brettons chat which was just of the proper sort for a man in his morbid moodnot oversympathetic yet not too uncongenial sensible and even with a touch of the motherlyshe was sufficiently his senior to be permitted this touch  as to paulina the child was at once happy and mute busy and watchful her father frequently lifted her to his knee she would sit there till she felt or fancied he grew restless then it waspapa put me down i shall tire you with my weight  and the mighty burden slid to the rug and establishing itself on carpet or stool just at papas feet the white workbox and the scarletspeckled handkerchief came into play this handkerchief it seems was intended as a keepsake for papa and must be finished before his departure consequently the demand on the sempstresss industry she accomplished about a score of stitches in halfanhour was stringent  the evening by restoring graham to the maternal roof his days were passed at school brought us an accession of animationa quality not diminished by the nature of the scenes pretty sure to be enacted between him and miss paulina  a distant and haughty demeanour had been the result of the indignity put upon her the first evening of his arrival her usual answer when he addressed her wasi cant attend to you i have other things to think about being implored to state what things  business  graham would endeavour to seduce her attention by opening his desk and displaying its multifarious contents seals bright sticks of wax penknives with a miscellany of engravingssome of them gaily colouredwhich he had amassed from time to time nor was this powerful temptation wholly unavailing her eyes furtively raised from her work cast many a peep towards the writingtable rich in scattered pictures an etching of a child playing with a blenheim spaniel happened to flutter to the floor  pretty little dog said she delighted  graham prudently took no notice ere long stealing from her corner she approached to examine the treasure more closely the dogs great eyes and long ears and the childs hat and feathers were irresistible  nice picture was her favourable criticism  wellyou may have it said graham  she seemed to hesitate the wish to possess was strong but to accept would be a compromise of dignity no she put it down and turned away  you wont have it then polly  i would rather not thank you  shall i tell you what i will do with the picture if you refuse it  she half turned to listen  cut it into strips for lighting the taper  no  but i shall  pleasedont  graham waxed inexorable on hearing the pleading tone he took the scissors from his mothers workbasket  here goes said he making a menacing flourish right through fidos head and splitting little harrys nose  no no no  then come to me come quickly or it is done  she hesitated lingered but complied  now will you have it he asked as she stood before him  please  but i shall want payment  how much  a kiss  give the picture first into my hand  polly as she said this looked rather faithless in her turn graham gave it she absconded a debtor darted to her father and took refuge on his knee graham rose in mimic wrath and followed she buried her face in mr homes waistcoat  papapapasend him away  ill not be sent away said graham  with face still averted she held out her hand to keep him off  then i shall kiss the hand said he but that moment it became a miniature fist and dealt him payment in a small coin that was not kisses  grahamnot failing in his way to be as wily as his little playmateretreated apparently quite discomfited he flung himself on a sofa and resting his head against the cushion lay like one in pain polly finding him silent presently peeped at him his eyes and face were covered with his hands she turned on her fathers knee and gazed at her foe anxiously and long graham groaned  papa what is the matter she whispered  you had better ask him polly  is he hurt groan second  he makes a noise as if he were said mr home  mother suggested graham feebly i think you had better send for the doctor oh my eye renewed silence broken only by sighs from graham  if i were to become blind suggested this last  his chastiser could not bear the suggestion she was beside him directly  let me see your eye i did not mean to touch it only your mouth and i did not think i hit so very hard  silence answered her her features workedi am sorry i am sorry  then succeeded emotion faltering weeping  have done trying that child graham said mrs bretton  it is all nonsense my pet cried mr home  and graham once more snatched her aloft and she again punished him and while she pulled his lions locks termed himthe naughtiest rudest worst untruest person that ever was                                       on the morning of mr homes departure he and his daughter had some conversation in a windowrecess by themselves i heard part of it  couldnt i pack my box and go with you papa she whispered earnestly  he shook his head  should i be a trouble to you  yes polly  because i am little  because you are little and tender it is only great strong people that should travel but dont look sad my little girl it breaks my heart papa will soon come back to his polly  indeed indeed i am not sad scarcely at all  polly would be sorry to give papa pain would she not  sorrier than sorry  then polly must be cheerful not cry at parting not fret afterwards she must look forward to meeting again and try to be happy meanwhile can she do this  she will try  i see she will farewell then it is time to go  nowjust now  just now  she held up quivering lips her father sobbed but she i remarked did not having put her down he shook hands with the rest present and departed  when the streetdoor closed she dropped on her knees at a chair with a crypapa  it was low and long a sort of why hast thou forsaken me during an ensuing space of some minutes i perceived she endured agony she went through in that brief interval of her infant life emotions such as some never feel it was in her constitution she would have more of such instants if she lived nobody spoke mrs bretton being a mother shed a tear or two graham who was writing lifted up his eyes and gazed at her i lucy snowe was calm  the little creature thus left unharassed did for herself what none other could docontended with an intolerable feeling and ere long in some degree repressed it that day she would accept solace from none nor the next day she grew more passive afterwards  on the third evening as she sat on the floor worn and quiet graham coming in took her up gently without a word she did not resist she rather nestled in his arms as if weary when he sat down she laid her head against him in a few minutes she slept he carried her upstairs to bed i was not surprised that the next morning the first thing she demanded was where is mr graham  it happened that graham was not coming to the breakfasttable he had some exercises to write for that mornings class and had requested his mother to send a cup of tea into the study polly volunteered to carry it she must be busy about something look after somebody the cup was entrusted to her for if restless she was also careful as the study was opposite the breakfastroom the doors facing across the passage my eye followed her  what are you doing she asked pausing on the threshold  writing said graham  why dont you come to take breakfast with your mamma  too busy  do you want any breakfast  of course  there then  and she deposited the cup on the carpet like a jailor putting a prisoners pitcher of water through his celldoor and retreated presently she returned  what will you have besides teawhat to eat  anything good bring me something particularly nice thats a kind little woman  she came back to mrs bretton  please maam send your boy something good  you shall choose for him polly what shall my boy have  she selected a portion of whatever was best on the table and ere long came back with a whispered request for some marmalade which was not there having got it however for mrs bretton refused the pair nothing graham was shortly after heard lauding her to the skies promising that when he had a house of his own she should be his housekeeper and perhapsif she showed any culinary geniushis cook and as she did not return and i went to look after her i found graham and her breakfasting têteàtêteshe standing at his elbow and sharing his fare excepting the marmalade which she delicately refused to touch lest i suppose it should appear that she had procured it as much on her own account as his she constantly evinced these nice perceptions and delicate instincts  the league of acquaintanceship thus struck up was not hastily dissolved on the contrary it appeared that time and circumstances served rather to cement than loosen it illassimilated as the two were in age sex pursuits c they somehow found a great deal to say to each other as to paulina i observed that her little character never properly came out except with young bretton as she got settled and accustomed to the house she proved tractable enough with mrs bretton but she would sit on a stool at that ladys feet all day long learning her task or sewing or drawing figures with a pencil on a slate and never kindling once to originality or showing a single gleam of the peculiarities of her nature i ceased to watch her under such circumstances she was not interesting but the moment grahams knock sounded of an evening a change occurred she was instantly at the head of the staircase usually her welcome was a reprimand or a threat  you have not wiped your shoes properly on the mat i shall tell your mamma  little busybody are you there  yesand you cant reach me i am higher up than you peeping between the rails of the banister she could not look over them  polly  my dear boy such was one of her terms for him adopted in imitation of his mother  i am fit to faint with fatigue declared graham leaning against the passagewall in seeming exhaustion dr digby the headmaster has quite knocked me up with overwork just come down and help me to carry up my books  ah youre cunning  not at all pollyit is positive fact im as weak as a rush come down  your eyes are quiet like the cats but youll spring  spring nothing of the kind it isnt in me come down  perhaps i mayif youll promise not to touchnot to snatch me up and not to whirl me round  i i couldnt do it sinking into a chair  then put the books down on the first step and go three yards off  this being done she descended warily and not taking her eyes from the feeble graham of course her approach always galvanized him to new and spasmodic life the game of romps was sure to be exacted sometimes she would be angry sometimes the matter was allowed to pass smoothly and we could hear her say as she led him upstairs now my dear boy come and take your teai am sure you must want something  it was sufficiently comical to observe her as she sat beside graham while he took that meal in his absence she was a still personage but with him the most officious fidgety little body possible i often wished she would mind herself and be tranquil but noherself was forgotten in him he could not be sufficiently well waited on nor carefully enough looked after he was more than the grand turk in her estimation she would gradually assemble the various plates before him and when one would suppose all he could possibly desire was within his reach she would find out something else maam she would whisper to mrs brettonperhaps your son would like a little cakesweet cake you knowthere is some in there pointing to the sideboard cupboard mrs bretton as a rule disapproved of sweet cake at tea but still the request was urgedone little pieceonly for himas he goes to school girlssuch as me and miss snowedont need treats but he would like it  graham did like it very well and almost always got it to do him justice he would have shared his prize with her to whom he owed it but that was never allowed to insist was to ruffle her for the evening to stand by his knee and monopolize his talk and notice was the reward she wantednot a share of the cake  with curious readiness did she adapt herself to such themes as interested him one would have thought the child had no mind or life of her own but must necessarily live move and have her being in another now that her father was taken from her she nestled to graham and seemed to feel by his feelings to exist in his existence she learned the names of all his schoolfellows in a trice she got by heart their characters as given from his lips a single description of an individual seemed to suffice she never forgot or confused identities she would talk with him the whole evening about people she had never seen and appear completely to realise their aspect manners and dispositions some she learned to mimic an undermaster who was an aversion of young brettons had it seems some peculiarities which she caught up in a moment from grahams representation and rehearsed for his amusement this however mrs bretton disapproved and forbade  the pair seldom quarrelled yet once a rupture occurred in which her feelings received a severe shock  one day graham on the occasion of his birthday had some friendslads of his own ageto dine with him paulina took much interest in the coming of these friends she had frequently heard of them they were amongst those of whom graham oftenest spoke after dinner the young gentlemen were left by themselves in the diningroom where they soon became very merry and made a good deal of noise chancing to pass through the hall i found paulina sitting alone on the lowest step of the staircase her eyes fixed on the glossy panels of the diningroom door where the reflection of the halllamp was shining her little brow knit in anxious meditation  what are you thinking about polly  nothing particular only i wish that door was clear glassthat i might see through it the boys seem very cheerful and i want to go to them i want to be with graham and watch his friends  what hinders you from going  i feel afraid but may i try do you think may i knock at the door and ask to be let in  i thought perhaps they might not object to have her as a playmate and therefore encouraged the attempt  she knockedtoo faintly at first to be heard but on a second essay the door unclosed grahams head appeared he looked in high spirits but impatient  what do you want you little monkey  to come to you  do you indeed as if i would be troubled with you away to mamma and mistress snowe and tell them to put you to bed the auburn head and bright flushed face vanishedthe door shut peremptorily she was stunned  why does he speak so he never spoke so before she said in consternation what have i done  nothing polly but graham is busy with his schoolfriends  and he likes them better than me he turns me away now they are here  i had some thoughts of consoling her and of improving the occasion by inculcating some of those maxims of philosophy whereof i had ever a tolerable stock ready for application she stopped me however by putting her fingers in her ears at the first words i uttered and then lying down on the mat with her face against the flags nor could either warren or the cook root her from that position she was allowed to lie therefore till she chose to rise of her own accord  graham forgot his impatience the same evening and would have accosted her as usual when his friends were gone but she wrenched herself from his hand her eye quite flashed she would not bid him goodnight she would not look in his face the next day he treated her with indifference and she grew like a bit of marble the day after he teased her to know what was the matter her lips would not unclose of course he could not feel real anger on his side the match was too unequal in every way he tried soothing and coaxing why was she so angry what had he done byandby tears answered him he petted her and they were friends but she was one on whom such incidents were not lost i remarked that never after this rebuff did she seek him or follow him or in any way solicit his notice i told her once to carry a book or some other article to graham when he was shut up in his study  i shall wait till he comes out said she proudly i dont choose to give him the trouble of rising to open the door  young bretton had a favourite pony on which he often rode out from the window she always watched his departure and return it was her ambition to be permitted to have a ride round the courtyard on this pony but far be it from her to ask such a favour one day she descended to the yard to watch him dismount as she leaned against the gate the longing wish for the indulgence of a ride glittered in her eye  come polly will you have a canter asked graham half carelessly  i suppose she thought he was too careless  no thank you said she turning away with the utmost coolness  youd better pursued he you will like it i am sure  dont think i should care a fig about it was the response  that is not true you told lucy snowe you longed to have a ride  lucy snowe is a tatterbox i heard her say her imperfect articulation was the least precocious thing she had about her and with this she walked into the house  graham coming in soon after observed to his mothermamma i believe that creature is a changeling she is a perfect cabinet of oddities but i should be dull without her she amuses me a great deal more than you or lucy snowe                                       miss snowe said paulina to me she had now got into the habit of occasionally chatting with me when we were alone in our room at night do you know on what day in the week i like graham best  how can i possibly know anything so strange is there one day out of the seven when he is otherwise than on the other six  to be sure cant you see dont you know i find him the most excellent on a sunday then we have him the whole day and he is quiet and in the evening so kind  this observation was not altogether groundless going to church c kept graham quiet on the sunday and the evening he generally dedicated to a serene though rather indolent sort of enjoyment by the parlour fireside he would take possession of the couch and then he would call polly  graham was a boy not quite as other boys are all his delight did not lie in action he was capable of some intervals of contemplation he could take a pleasure too in reading nor was his selection of books wholly indiscriminate there were glimmerings of characteristic preference and even of instinctive taste in the choice he rarely it is true remarked on what he read but i have seen him sit and think of it  polly being near him kneeling on a little cushion or the carpet a conversation would begin in murmurs not inaudible though subdued i caught a snatch of their tenor now and then and in truth some influence better and finer than that of every day seemed to soothe graham at such times into no ungentle mood  have you learned any hymns this week polly  i have learned a very pretty one four verses long shall i say it  speak nicely then dont be in a hurry  the hymn being rehearsed or rather halfchanted in a little singing voice graham would take exceptions at the manner and proceed to give a lesson in recitation she was quick in learning apt in imitating and besides her pleasure was to please graham she proved a ready scholar to the hymn would succeed some readingperhaps a chapter in the bible correction was seldom required here for the child could read any simple narrative chapter very well and when the subject was such as she could understand and take an interest in her expression and emphasis were something remarkable joseph cast into the pit the calling of samuel daniel in the lions denthese were favourite passages of the first especially she seemed perfectly to feel the pathos  poor jacob she would sometimes say with quivering lips how he loved his son joseph as much she once addedas much graham as i love you if you were to die and she reopened the book sought the verse and read i should refuse to be comforted and go down into the grave to you mourning  with these words she gathered graham in her little arms drawing his longtressed head towards her the action i remember struck me as strangely rash exciting the feeling one might experience on seeing an animal dangerous by nature and but halftamed by art too heedlessly fondled not that i feared graham would hurt or very roughly check her but i thought she ran risk of incurring such a careless impatient repulse as would be worse almost to her than a blow on the whole however these demonstrations were borne passively sometimes even a sort of complacent wonder at her earnest partiality would smile not unkindly in his eyes once he saidyou like me almost as well as if you were my little sister polly  oh i do like you said she i do like you very much  i was not long allowed the amusement of this study of character she had scarcely been at bretton two months when a letter came from mr home signifying that he was now settled amongst his maternal kinsfolk on the continent that as england was become wholly distasteful to him he had no thoughts of returning hither perhaps for years and that he wished his little girl to join him immediately  i wonder how she will take this news said mrs bretton when she had read the letter i wondered too and i took upon myself to communicate it  repairing to the drawingroomin which calm and decorated apartment she was fond of being alone and where she could be implicitly trusted for she fingered nothing or rather soiled nothing she fingeredi found her seated like a little odalisque on a couch half shaded by the drooping draperies of the window near she seemed happy all her appliances for occupation were about her the white wood workbox a shred or two of muslin an end or two of ribbon collected for conversion into dollmillinery the doll duly nightcapped and nightgowned lay in its cradle she was rocking it to sleep with an air of the most perfect faith in its possession of sentient and somnolent faculties her eyes at the same time being engaged with a picturebook which lay open on her lap  miss snowe said she in a whisper this is a wonderful book candace the doll christened by graham for indeed its begrimed complexion gave it much of an ethiopian aspectcandace is asleep now and i may tell you about it only we must both speak low lest she should waken this book was given me by graham it tells about distant countries a long long way from england which no traveller can reach without sailing thousands of miles over the sea wild men live in these countries miss snowe who wear clothes different from ours indeed some of them wear scarcely any clothes for the sake of being cool you know for they have very hot weather here is a picture of thousands gathered in a desolate placea plain spread with sandround a man in blacka good good englishmana missionary who is preaching to them under a palmtree she showed a little coloured cut to that effect and here are pictures she went on more stranger grammar was occasionally forgotten than that there is the wonderful great wall of china here is a chinese lady with a foot littler than mine there is a wild horse of tartary and here most strange of allis a land of ice and snow without green fields woods or gardens in this land they found some mammoth bones there are no mammoths now you dont know what it was but i can tell you because graham told me a mighty goblin creature as high as this room and as long as the hall but not a fierce flesheating thing graham thinks he believes if i met one in a forest it would not kill me unless i came quite in its way when it would trample me down amongst the bushes as i might tread on a grasshopper in a hayfield without knowing it  thus she rambled on  polly i interrupted should you like to travel  not just yet was the prudent answer but perhaps in twenty years when i am grown a woman as tall as mrs bretton i may travel with graham we intend going to switzerland and climbing mount blanck and some day we shall sail over to south america and walk to the top of kimkimborazo  but how would you like to travel now if your papa was with you  her replynot given till after a pauseevinced one of those unexpected turns of temper peculiar to her  where is the good of talking in that silly way said she why do you mention papa what is papa to you i was just beginning to be happy and not think about him so much and there it will be all to do over again  her lip trembled i hastened to disclose the fact of a letter having been received and to mention the directions given that she and harriet should immediately rejoin this dear papa now polly are you not glad i added  she made no answer she dropped her book and ceased to rock her doll she gazed at me with gravity and earnestness  shall not you like to go to papa  of course she said at last in that trenchant manner she usually employed in speaking to me and which was quite different from that she used with mrs bretton and different again from the one dedicated to graham i wished to ascertain more of what she thought but no she would converse no more hastening to mrs bretton she questioned her and received the confirmation of my news the weight and importance of these tidings kept her perfectly serious the whole day in the evening at the moment grahams entrance was heard below i found her at my side she began to arrange a locketribbon about my neck she displaced and replaced the comb in my hair while thus busied graham entered  tell him byandby she whispered tell him i am going  in the course of teatime i made the desired communication graham it chanced was at that time greatly preoccupied about some schoolprize for which he was competing the news had to be told twice before it took proper hold of his attention and even then he dwelt on it but momently  polly going what a pity dear little mousie i shall be sorry to lose her she must come to us again mamma  and hastily swallowing his tea he took a candle and a small table to himself and his books and was soon buried in study  little mousie crept to his side and lay down on the carpet at his feet her face to the floor mute and motionless she kept that post and position till bedtime once i saw grahamwholly unconscious of her proximitypush her with his restless foot she receded an inch or two a minute after one little hand stole out from beneath her face to which it had been pressed and softly caressed the heedless foot when summoned by her nurse she rose and departed very obediently having bid us all a subdued goodnight  i will not say that i dreaded going to bed an hour later yet i certainly went with an unquiet anticipation that i should find that child in no peaceful sleep the forewarning of my instinct was but fulfilled when i discovered her all cold and vigilant perched like a white bird on the outside of the bed i scarcely knew how to accost her she was not to be managed like another child she however accosted me as i closed the door and put the light on the dressingtable she turned tome with these wordsi cannotcannot sleep and in this way i cannotcannot live  i asked what ailed her  dedful mizery said she with her piteous lisp  shall i call mrs bretton  that is downright silly was her impatient reply and indeed i well knew that if she had heard mrs brettons foot approach she would have nestled quiet as a mouse under the bedclothes whilst lavishing her eccentricities regardlessly before mefor whom she professed scarcely the semblance of affectionshe never showed my godmother one glimpse of her inner self for her she was nothing but a docile somewhat quaint little maiden i examined her her cheek was crimson her dilated eye was both troubled and glowing and painfully restless in this state it was obvious she must not be left till morning i guessed how the case stood  would you like to bid graham goodnight again i asked he is not gone to his room yet  she at once stretched out her little arms to be lifted folding a shawl round her i carried her back to the drawingroom graham was just coming out  she cannot sleep without seeing and speaking to you once more i said she does not like the thought of leaving you  ive spoilt her said he taking her from me with good humour and kissing her little hot face and burning lips polly you care for me more than for papa now  i do care for you but you care nothing for me was her whisper  she was assured to the contrary again kissed restored to me and i carried her away but alas not soothed  when i thought she could listen to me i saidpaulina you should not grieve that graham does not care for you so much as you care for him it must be so  her lifted and questioning eyes asked why  because he is a boy and you are a girl he is sixteen and you are only six his nature is strong and gay and yours is otherwise  but i love him so much he should love me a little  he does he is fond of you you are his favourite  am i grahams favourite  yes more than any little child i know  the assurance soothed her she smiled in her anguish  but i continued dont fret and dont expect too much of him or else he will feel you to be troublesome and then it is all over  all over she echoed softly then ill be good ill try to be good lucy snowe  i put her to bed  will he forgive me this one time she asked as i undressed myself i assured her that he would that as yet he was by no means alienated that she had only to be careful for the future  there is no future said she i am going shall i evereversee him again after i leave england  i returned an encouraging response the candle being extinguished a still halfhour elapsed i thought her asleep when the little white shape once more lifted itself in the crib and the small voice askeddo you like graham miss snowe  like him yes a little  only a little do you like him as i do  i think not no not as you do  do you like him much  i told you i liked him a little where is the use of caring for him so very much he is full of faults  is he  all boys are  more than girls  very likely wise people say it is folly to think anybody perfect and as to likes and dislikes we should be friendly to all and worship none  are you a wise person  i mean to try to be so go to sleep  i cannot go to sleep have you no pain just here laying her elfish hand on her elfish breast when you think you shall have to leave graham for your home is not here  surely polly said i you should not feel so much pain when you are very soon going to rejoin your father have you forgotten him do you no longer wish to be his little companion  dead silence succeeded this question  child lie down and sleep i urged  my bed is cold said she i cant warm it  i saw the little thing shiver come to me i said wishing yet scarcely hoping that she would comply for she was a most strange capricious little creature and especially whimsical with me she came however instantly like a small ghost gliding over the carpet i took her in she was chill i warmed her in my arms she trembled nervously i soothed her thus tranquillized and cherished she at last slumbered  a very unique child thought i as i viewed her sleeping countenance by the fitful moonlight and cautiously and softly wiped her glittering eyelids and her wet cheeks with my handkerchief how will she get through this world or battle with this life how will she bear the shocks and repulses the humiliations and desolations which books and my own reason tell me are prepared for all flesh  she departed the next day trembling like a leaf when she took leave but exercising selfcommand     chapter iv  miss marchmont   on quitting bretton which i did a few weeks after paulinas departurelittle thinking then i was never again to visit it never more to tread its calm old streetsi betook myself home having been absent six months it will be conjectured that i was of course glad to return to the bosom of my kindred well the amiable conjecture does no harm and may therefore be safely left uncontradicted far from saying nay indeed i will permit the reader to picture me for the next eight years as a bark slumbering through halcyon weather in a harbour still as glassthe steersman stretched on the little deck his face up to heaven his eyes closed buried if you will in a long prayer a great many women and girls are supposed to pass their lives something in that fashion why not i with the rest  picture me then idle basking plump and happy stretched on a cushioned deck warmed with constant sunshine rocked by breezes indolently soft however it cannot be concealed that in that case i must somehow have fallen overboard or that there must have been wreck at last i too well remember a timea long timeof cold of danger of contention to this hour when i have the nightmare it repeats the rush and saltness of briny waves in my throat and their icy pressure on my lungs i even know there was a storm and that not of one hour nor one day for many days and nights neither sun nor stars appeared we cast with our own hands the tackling out of the ship a heavy tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was taken away in fine the ship was lost the crew perished  as far as i recollect i complained to no one about these troubles indeed to whom could i complain of mrs bretton i had long lost sight impediments raised by others had years ago come in the way of our intercourse and cut it off besides time had brought changes for her too the handsome property of which she was left guardian for her son and which had been chiefly invested in some jointstock undertaking had melted it was said to a fraction of its original amount graham i learned from incidental rumours had adopted a profession both he and his mother were gone from bretton and were understood to be now in london thus there remained no possibility of dependence on others to myself alone could i look i know not that i was of a selfreliant or active nature but selfreliance and exertion were forced upon me by circumstances as they are upon thousands besides and when miss marchmont a maiden lady of our neighbourhood sent for me i obeyed her behest in the hope that she might assign me some task i could undertake  miss marchmont was a woman of fortune and lived in a handsome residence but she was a rheumatic cripple impotent foot and hand and had been so for twenty years she always sat upstairs her drawingroom adjoined her bedroom i had often heard of miss marchmont and of her peculiarities she had the character of being very eccentric but till now had never seen her i found her a furrowed greyhaired woman grave with solitude stern with long affliction irritable also and perhaps exacting it seemed that a maid or rather companion who had waited on her for some years was about to be married and she hearing of my bereaved lot had sent for me with the idea that i might supply this persons place she made the proposal to me after tea as she and i sat alone by her fireside  it will not be an easy life said she candidly for i require a good deal of attention and you will be much confined yet perhaps contrasted with the existence you have lately led it may appear tolerable  i reflected of course it ought to appear tolerable i argued inwardly but somehow by some strange fatality it would not to live here in this close room the watcher of sufferingsometimes perhaps the butt of temperthrough all that was to come of my youth while all that was gone had passed to say the least not blissfully my heart sunk one moment then it revived for though i forced myself to realise evils i think i was too prosaic to idealise and consequently to exaggerate them  my doubt is whether i should have strength for the undertaking i observed  that is my own scruple said she for you look a wornout creature  so i did i saw myself in the glass in my mourningdress a faded holloweyed vision yet i thought little of the wan spectacle the blight i believed was chiefly external i still felt life at lifes sources  what else have you in viewanything  nothing clear as yet but i may find something  so you imagine perhaps you are right try your own method then and if it does not succeed test mine the chance i have offered shall be left open to you for three months  this was kind i told her so and expressed my gratitude while i was speaking a paroxysm of pain came on i ministered to her made the necessary applications according to her directions and by the time she was relieved a sort of intimacy was already formed between us i for my part had learned from the manner in which she bore this attack that she was a firm patient woman patient under physical pain though sometimes perhaps excitable under long mental canker and she from the goodwill with which i succoured her discovered that she could influence my sympathies such as they were she sent for me the next day for five or six successive days she claimed my company closer acquaintance while it developed both faults and eccentricities opened at the same time a view of a character i could respect stern and even morose as she sometimes was i could wait on her and sit beside her with that calm which always blesses us when we are sensible that our manners presence contact please and soothe the persons we serve even when she scolded mewhich she did now and then very tartlyit was in such a way as did not humiliate and left no sting it was rather like an irascible mother rating her daughter than a harsh mistress lecturing a dependant lecture indeed she could not though she could occasionally storm moreover a vein of reason ever ran through her passion she was logical even when fierce ere long a growing sense of attachment began to present the thought of staying with her as companion in quite a new light in another week i had agreed to remain  two hot close rooms thus became my world and a crippled old woman my mistress my friend my all her service was my dutyher pain my sufferingher relief my hopeher anger my punishmenther regard my reward i forgot that there were fields woods rivers seas an everchanging sky outside the steamdimmed lattice of this sick chamber i was almost content to forget it all within me became narrowed to my lot tame and still by habit disciplined by destiny i demanded no walks in the fresh air my appetite needed no more than the tiny messes served for the invalid in addition she gave me the originality of her character to study the steadiness of her virtues i will add the power of her passions to admire the truth of her feelings to trust all these things she had and for these things i clung to her  for these things i would have crawled on with her for twenty years if for twenty years longer her life of endurance had been protracted but another decree was written it seemed i must be stimulated into action i must be goaded driven stung forced to energy my little morsel of human affection which i prized as if it were a solid pearl must melt in my fingers and slip thence like a dissolving hailstone my small adopted duty must be snatched from my easily contented conscience i had wanted to compromise with fate to escape occasional great agonies by submitting to a whole life of privation and small pains fate would not so be pacified nor would providence sanction this shrinking sloth and cowardly indolence  one february nighti remember it wellthere came a voice near miss marchmonts house heard by every inmate but translated perhaps only by one after a calm winter storms were ushering in the spring i had put miss marchmont to bed i sat at the fireside sewing the wind was wailing at the windows it had wailed all day but as night deepened it took a new tonean accent keen piercing almost articulate to the ear a plaint piteous and disconsolate to the nerves trilled in every gust  oh hush hush i said in my disturbed mind dropping my work and making a vain effort to stop my ears against that subtle searching cry i had heard that very voice ere this and compulsory observation had forced on me a theory as to what it boded three times in the course of my life events had taught me that these strange accents in the stormthis restless hopeless crydenote a coming state of the atmosphere unpropitious to life epidemic diseases i believed were often heralded by a gasping sobbing tormented longlamenting east wind hence i inferred arose the legend of the banshee i fancied too i had noticedbut was not philosopher enough to know whether there was any connection between the circumstancesthat we often at the same time hear of disturbed volcanic action in distant parts of the world of rivers suddenly rushing above their banks and of strange high tides flowing furiously in on low seacoasts our globe i had said to myself seems at such periods torn and disordered the feeble amongst us wither in her distempered breath rushing hot from steaming volcanoes  i listened and trembled miss marchmont slept  about midnight the storm in one halfhour fell to a dead calm the fire which had been burning dead glowed up vividly i felt the air change and become keen raising blind and curtain i looked out and saw in the stars the keen sparkle of a sharp frost  turning away the object that met my eyes was miss marchmont awake lifting her head from the pillow and regarding me with unusual earnestness  is it a fine night she asked  i replied in the affirmative  i thought so she said for i feel so strong so well raise me i feel young tonight she continued young lighthearted and happy what if my complaint be about to take a turn and i am yet destined to enjoy health it would be a miracle  and these are not the days of miracles i thought to myself and wondered to hear her talk so she went on directing her conversation to the past and seeming to recall its incidents scenes and personages with singular vividness  i love memory tonight she said i prize her as my best friend she is just now giving me a deep delight she is bringing back to my heart in warm and beautiful life realitiesnot mere empty ideas but what were once realities and that i long have thought decayed dissolved mixed in with gravemould i possess just now the hours the thoughts the hopes of my youth i renew the love of my lifeits only lovealmost its only affection for i am not a particularly good woman i am not amiable yet i have had my feelings strong and concentrated and these feelings had their object which in its single self was dear to me as to the majority of men and women are all the unnumbered points on which they dissipate their regard while i loved and while i was loved what an existence i enjoyed what a glorious year i can recallhow bright it comes back to me what a living springwhat a warm glad summerwhat soft moonlight silvering the autumn eveningswhat strength of hope under the icebound waters and frosthoar fields of that years winter through that year my heart lived with franks heart o my noble frankmy faithful frankmy good frank so much better than myselfhis standard in all things so much higher this i can now see and say if few women have suffered as i did in his loss few have enjoyed what i did in his love it was a far better kind of love than common i had no doubts about it or him it was such a love as honoured protected and elevated no less than it gladdened her to whom it was given let me now ask just at this moment when my mind is so strangely clearlet me reflect why it was taken from me for what crime was i condemned after twelve months of bliss to undergo thirty years of sorrow  i do not know she continued after a pause i cannotcannot see the reason yet at this hour i can say with sincerity what i never tried to say before inscrutable god thy will be done and at this moment i can believe that death will restore me to frank i never believed it till now  he is dead then i inquired in a low voice  my dear girl she said one happy christmas eve i dressed and decorated myself expecting my lover very soon to be my husband would come that night to visit me i sat down to wait once more i see that momenti see the snow twilight stealing through the window over which the curtain was not dropped for i designed to watch him ride up the white walk i see and feel the soft firelight warming me playing on my silk dress and fitfully showing me my own young figure in a glass i see the moon of a calm winter night float full clear and cold over the inky mass of shrubbery and the silvered turf of my grounds i wait with some impatience in my pulse but no doubt in my breast the flames had died in the fire but it was a bright mass yet the moon was mounting high but she was still visible from the lattice the clock neared ten he rarely tarried later than this but once or twice he had been delayed so long  would he for once fail me nonot even for once and now he was comingand coming fastto atone for lost time frank you furious rider i said inwardly listening gladly yet anxiously to his approaching gallop you shall be rebuked for this i will tell you it is my neck you are putting in peril for whatever is yours is in a dearer and tenderer sense mine there he was i saw him but i think tears were in my eyes my sight was so confused i saw the horse i heard it stampi saw at least a mass i heard a clamour was it a horse or what heavy dragging thing was it crossing strangely dark the lawn how could i name that thing in the moonlight before me or how could i utter the feeling which rose in my soul  i could only run out a great animaltruly franks black horsestood trembling panting snorting before the door a man held it frank as i thought  what is the matter i demanded thomas my own servant answered by saying sharply go into the house madam and then calling to another servant who came hurrying from the kitchen as if summoned by some instinct ruth take missis into the house directly but i was kneeling down in the snow beside something that lay theresomething that i had seen dragged along the groundsomething that sighed that groaned on my breast as i lifted and drew it to me he was not dead he was not quite unconscious i had him carried in i refused to be ordered about and thrust from him i was quite collected enough not only to be my own mistress but the mistress of others they had begun by trying to treat me like a child as they always do with people struck by gods hand but i gave place to none except the surgeon and when he had done what he could i took my dying frank to myself he had strength to fold me in his arms he had power to speak my name he heard me as i prayed over him very softly he felt me as i tenderly and fondly comforted him  maria he said i am dying in paradise he spent his last breath in faithful words for me when the dawn of christmas morning broke my frank was with god  and that she went on happened thirty years ago i have suffered since i doubt if i have made the best use of all my calamities soft amiable natures they would have refined to saintliness of strong evil spirits they would have made demons as for me i have only been a woestruck and selfish woman  you have done much good i said for she was noted for her liberal almsgiving  i have not withheld money you mean where it could assuage affliction what of that it cost me no effort or pang to give but i think from this day i am about to enter a better frame of mind to prepare myself for reunion with frank you see i still think of frank more than of god and unless it be counted that in thus loving the creature so much so long and so exclusively i have not at least blasphemed the creator small is my chance of salvation what do you think lucy of these things be my chaplain and tell me  this question i could not answer i had no words it seemed as if she thought i had answered it  very right my child we should acknowledge god merciful but not always for us comprehensible we should accept our own lot whatever it be and try to render happy that of others should we not well tomorrow i will begin by trying to make you happy i will endeavour to do something for you lucy something that will benefit you when i am dead my head aches now with talking too much still i am happy go to bed the clock strikes two how late you sit up or rather how late i in my selfishness keep you up but go now have no more anxiety for me i feel i shall rest well  she composed herself as if to slumber i too retired to my crib in a closet within her room the night passed in quietness quietly her doom must at last have come peacefully and painlessly in the morning she was found without life nearly cold but all calm and undisturbed her previous excitement of spirits and change of mood had been the prelude of a fit one stroke sufficed to sever the thread of an existence so long fretted by affliction     chapter v  turning a new leaf   my mistress being dead and i once more alone i had to look out for a new place about this time i might be a littlea very littleshaken in nerves i grant i was not looking well but on the contrary thin haggard and holloweyed like a sitterup at night like an overwrought servant or a placeless person in debt in debt however i was not nor quite poor for though miss marchmont had not had time to benefit me as on that last night she said she intended yet after the funeral my wages were duly paid by her second cousin the heir an avariciouslooking man with pinched nose and narrow temples who indeed i heard long afterwards turned out a thorough miser a direct contrast to his generous kinswoman and a foil to her memory blessed to this day by the poor and needy the possessor then of fifteen pounds of health though worn not broken and of a spirit in similar condition i might still in comparison with many people be regarded as occupying an enviable position an embarrassing one it was however at the same time as i felt with some acuteness on a certain day of which the corresponding one in the next week was to see my departure from my present abode while with another i was not provided  in this dilemma i went as a last and sole resource to see and consult an old servant of our family once my nurse now housekeeper at a grand mansion not far from miss marchmonts i spent some hours with her she comforted but knew not how to advise me still all inward darkness i left her about twilight a walk of two miles lay before me it was a clear frosty night in spite of my solitude my poverty and my perplexity my heart nourished and nerved with the vigour of a youth that had not yet counted twentythree summers beat light and not feebly not feebly i am sure or i should have trembled in that lonely walk which lay through still fields and passed neither village nor farmhouse nor cottage i should have quailed in the absence of moonlight for it was by the leading of stars only i traced the dim path i should have quailed still more in the unwonted presence of that which tonight shone in the north a moving mysterythe aurora borealis but this solemn stranger influenced me otherwise than through my fears some new power it seemed to bring i drew in energy with the keen low breeze that blew on its path a bold thought was sent to my mind my mind was made strong to receive it  leave this wilderness it was said to me and go out hence  where was the query  i had not very far to look gazing from this country parish in that flat rich middle of englandi mentally saw within reach what i had never yet beheld with my bodily eyes i saw london  the next day i returned to the hall and asking once more to see the housekeeper i communicated to her my plan  mrs barrett was a grave judicious woman though she knew little more of the world than myself but grave and judicious as she was she did not charge me with being out of my senses and indeed i had a staid manner of my own which ere now had been as good to me as cloak and hood of hodden grey since under its favour i had been enabled to achieve with impunity and even approbation deeds that if attempted with an excited and unsettled air would in some minds have stamped me as a dreamer and zealot  the housekeeper was slowly propounding some difficulties while she prepared orangerind for marmalade when a child ran past the window and came bounding into the room it was a pretty child and as it danced laughing up to mefor we were not strangers nor indeed was its mothera young married daughter of the housea strangeri took it on my knee  different as were our social positions now this childs mother and i had been schoolfellows when i was a girl of ten and she a young lady of sixteen and i remembered her goodlooking but dull in a lower class than mine  i was admiring the boys handsome dark eyes when the mother young mrs leigh entered what a beautiful and kindlooking woman was the goodnatured and comely but unintellectual girl become wifehood and maternity had changed her thus as i have since seen them change others even less promising than she me she had forgotten i was changed too though not i fear for the better i made no attempt to recall myself to her memory why should i she came for her son to accompany her in a walk and behind her followed a nurse carrying an infant i only mention the incident because in addressing the nurse mrs leigh spoke french very bad french by the way and with an incorrigibly bad accent again forcibly reminding me of our schooldays and i found the woman was a foreigner the little boy chattered volubly in french too when the whole party were withdrawn mrs barrett remarked that her young lady had brought that foreign nurse home with her two years ago on her return from a continental excursion that she was treated almost as well as a governess and had nothing to do but walk out with the baby and chatter french with master charles and added mrs barrett she says there are many englishwomen in foreign families as well placed as she  i stored up this piece of casual information as careful housewives store seemingly worthless shreds and fragments for which their prescient minds anticipate a possible use some day before i left my old friend she gave me the address of a respectable oldfashioned inn in the city which she said my uncles used to frequent in former days  in going to london i ran less risk and evinced less enterprise than the reader may think in fact the distance was only fifty miles my means would suffice both to take me there to keep me a few days and also to bring me back if i found no inducement to stay i regarded it as a brief holiday permitted for once to workweary faculties rather than as an adventure of life and death there is nothing like taking all you do at a moderate estimate it keeps mind and body tranquil whereas grandiloquent notions are apt to hurry both into fever  fifty miles were then a days journey for i speak of a time gone by my hair which till a late period withstood the frosts of time lies now at last white under a white cap like snow beneath snow about nine oclock of a wet february night i reached london  my reader i know is one who would not thank me for an elaborate reproduction of poetic first impressions and it is well inasmuch as i had neither time nor mood to cherish such arriving as i did late on a dark raw and rainy evening in a babylon and a wilderness of which the vastness and the strangeness tried to the utmost any powers of clear thought and steady selfpossession with which in the absence of more brilliant faculties nature might have gifted me  when i left the coach the strange speech of the cabmen and others waiting round seemed to me odd as a foreign tongue i had never before heard the english language chopped up in that way however i managed to understand and to be understood so far as to get myself and trunk safely conveyed to the old inn whereof i had the address how difficult how oppressive how puzzling seemed my flight in london for the first time at an inn for the first time tired with travelling confused with darkness palsied with cold unfurnished with either experience or advice to tell me how to act and yetto act obliged  into the hands of common sense i confided the matter common sense however was as chilled and bewildered as all my other faculties and it was only under the spur of an inexorable necessity that she spasmodically executed her trust thus urged she paid the porter considering the crisis i did not blame her too much that she was hugely cheated she asked the waiter for a room she timorously called for the chambermaid what is far more she bore without being wholly overcome a highly supercilious style of demeanour from that young lady when she appeared  i recollect this same chambermaid was a pattern of town prettiness and smartness so trim her waist her cap her dressi wondered how they had all been manufactured her speech had an accent which in its mincing glibness seemed to rebuke mine as by authority her spruce attire flaunted an easy scorn to my plain country garb  well it cant be helped i thought and then the scene is new and the circumstances i shall gain good  maintaining a very quiet manner towards this arrogant little maid and subsequently observing the same towards the parsoniclooking blackcoated whiteneckclothed waiter i got civility from them ere long i believe at first they thought i was a servant but in a little while they changed their minds and hovered in a doubtful state between patronage and politeness  i kept up well till i had partaken of some refreshment warmed myself by a fire and was fairly shut into my own room but as i sat down by the bed and rested my head and arms on the pillow a terrible oppression overcame me all at once my position rose on me like a ghost anomalous desolate almost blank of hope it stood what was i doing here alone in great london what should i do on the morrow what prospects had i in life what friends had i on earth whence did i come whither should i go what should i do  i wet the pillow my arms and my hair with rushing tears a dark interval of most bitter thought followed this burst but i did not regret the step taken nor wish to retract it a strong vague persuasion that it was better to go forward than backward and that i could go forwardthat a way however narrow and difficult would in time openpredominated over other feelings its influence hushed them so far that at last i became sufficiently tranquil to be able to say my prayers and seek my couch i had just extinguished my candle and lain down when a deep low mighty tone swung through the night at first i knew it not but it was uttered twelve times and at the twelfth colossal hum and trembling knell i said i lie in the shadow of st pauls     chapter vi  london   the next day was the first of march and when i awoke rose and opened my curtain i saw the risen sun struggling through fog above my head above the housetops coelevate almost with the clouds i saw a solemn orbed mass dark blue and dimthe dome while i looked my inner self moved my spirit shook its alwaysfettered wings half loose i had a sudden feeling as if i who never yet truly lived were at last about to taste life in that morning my soul grew as fast as jonahs gourd  i did well to come i said proceeding to dress with speed and care i like the spirit of this great london which i feel around me who but a coward would pass his whole life in hamlets and for ever abandon his faculties to the eating rust of obscurity  being dressed i went down not travelworn and exhausted but tidy and refreshed when the waiter came in with my breakfast i managed to accost him sedately yet cheerfully we had ten minutes discourse in the course of which we became usefully known to each other  he was a greyhaired elderly man and it seemed had lived in his present place twenty years having ascertained this i was sure he must remember my two uncles charles and wilmot who fifteen years ago were frequent visitors here i mentioned their names he recalled them perfectly and with respect having intimated my connection my position in his eyes was henceforth clear and on a right footing he said i was like my uncle charles i suppose he spoke truth because mrs barrett was accustomed to say the same thing a ready and obliging courtesy now replaced his former uncomfortably doubtful manner henceforth i need no longer be at a loss for a civil answer to a sensible question  the street on which my little sittingroom window looked was narrow perfectly quiet and not dirty the few passengers were just such as one sees in provincial towns here was nothing formidable i felt sure i might venture out alone  having breakfasted out i went elation and pleasure were in my heart to walk alone in london seemed of itself an adventure presently i found myself in paternoster rowclassic ground this i entered a booksellers shop kept by one jones i bought a little booka piece of extravagance i could ill afford but i thought i would one day give or send it to mrs barrett mr jones a driedin man of business stood behind his desk he seemed one of the greatest and i one of the happiest of beings  prodigious was the amount of life i lived that morning finding myself before st pauls i went in i mounted to the dome i saw thence london with its river and its bridges and its churches i saw antique westminster and the green temple gardens with sun upon them and a glad blue sky of early spring above and between them and it not too dense a cloud of haze  descending i went wandering whither chance might lead in a still ecstasy of freedom and enjoyment and i goti know not howi got into the heart of city life i saw and felt london at last i got into the strand i went up cornhill i mixed with the life passing along i dared the perils of crossings to do this and to do it utterly alone gave me perhaps an irrational but a real pleasure since those days i have seen the west end the parks the fine squares but i love the city far better the city seems so much more in earnest its business its rush its roar are such serious things sights and sounds the city is getting its livingthe west end but enjoying its pleasure at the west end you may be amused but in the city you are deeply excited  faint at last and hungry it was years since i had felt such healthy hunger i returned about two oclock to my dark old and quiet inn i dined on two dishesa plain joint and vegetables both seemed excellent how much better than the small dainty messes miss marchmonts cook used to send up to my kind dead mistress and me and to the discussion of which we could not bring half an appetite between us delightfully tired i lay down on three chairs for an hour the room did not boast a sofa i slept then i woke and thought for two hours  my state of mind and all accompanying circumstances were just now such as most to favour the adoption of a new resolute and daringperhaps desperateline of action i had nothing to lose unutterable loathing of a desolate existence past forbade return if i failed in what i now designed to undertake who save myself would suffer if i died far away fromhome i was going to say but i had no homefrom england then who would weep  i might suffer i was inured to suffering death itself had not i thought those terrors for me which it has for the softly reared i had ere this looked on the thought of death with a quiet eye prepared then for any consequences i formed a project  that same evening i obtained from my friend the waiter information respecting the sailing of vessels for a certain continental port bouemarine no time i found was to be lost that very night i must take my berth i might indeed have waited till the morning before going on board but would not run the risk of being too late  better take your berth at once maam counselled the waiter i agreed with him and having discharged my bill and acknowledged my friends services at a rate which i now know was princely and which in his eyes must have seemed absurdand indeed while pocketing the cash he smiled a faint smile which intimated his opinion of the donors savoirfairehe proceeded to call a coach to the driver he also recommended me giving at the same time an injunction about taking me i think to the wharf and not leaving me to the watermen which that functionary promised to observe but failed in keeping his promise on the contrary he offered me up as an oblation served me as a dripping roast making me alight in the midst of a throng of watermen  this was an uncomfortable crisis it was a dark night the coachman instantly drove off as soon as he had got his fare the watermen commenced a struggle for me and my trunk their oaths i hear at this moment they shook my philosophy more than did the night or the isolation or the strangeness of the scene one laid hands on my trunk i looked on and waited quietly but when another laid hands on me i spoke up shook off his touch stepped at once into a boat desired austerely that the trunk should be placed beside mejust therewhich was instantly done for the owner of the boat i had chosen became now an ally i was rowed off  black was the river as a torrent of ink lights glanced on it from the piles of building round ships rocked on its bosom they rowed me up to several vessels i read by lanternlight their names painted in great white letters on a dark ground the ocean the phoenix the consort the dolphin were passed in turns but the vivid was my ship and it seemed she lay further down  down the sable flood we glided i thought of the styx and of charon rowing some solitary soul to the land of shades amidst the strange scene with a chilly wind blowing in my face and midnight clouds dropping rain above my head with two rude rowers for companions whose insane oaths still tortured my ear i asked myself if i was wretched or terrified i was neither often in my life have i been far more so under comparatively safe circumstances how is this said i methinks i am animated and alert instead of being depressed and apprehensive i could not tell how it was  the vivid started out white and glaring from the black night at lasthere you are said the waterman and instantly demanded six shillings  you ask too much i said he drew off from the vessel and swore he would not embark me till i paid it a young man the steward as i found afterwards was looking over the ships side he grinned a smile in anticipation of the coming contest to disappoint him i paid the money three times that afternoon i had given crowns where i should have given shillings but i consoled myself with the reflection it is the price of experience  theyve cheated you said the steward exultingly when i got on board i answered phlegmatically that i knew it and went below  a stout handsome and showy woman was in the ladies cabin i asked to be shown my berth she looked hard at me muttered something about its being unusual for passengers to come on board at that hour and seemed disposed to be less than civil what a face she hadso comelyso insolent and so selfish  now that i am on board i shall certainly stay here was my answer i will trouble you to show me my berth  she complied but sullenly i took off my bonnet arranged my things and lay down some difficulties had been passed through a sort of victory was won my homeless anchorless unsupported mind had again leisure for a brief repose till the vivid arrived in harbour no further action would be required of me but then oh i could not look forward harassed exhausted i lay in a halftrance  the stewardess talked all night not to me but to the young steward her son and her very picture he passed in and out of the cabin continually they disputed they quarrelled they made it up again twenty times in the course of the night she professed to be writing a letter homeshe said to her father she read passages of it aloud heeding me no more than a stockperhaps she believed me asleep several of these passages appeared to comprise family secrets and bore special reference to one charlotte a younger sister who from the bearing of the epistle seemed to be on the brink of perpetrating a romantic and imprudent match loud was the protest of this elder lady against the distasteful union the dutiful son laughed his mothers correspondence to scorn she defended it and raved at him they were a strange pair she might be thirtynine or forty and was buxom and blooming as a girl of twenty hard loud vain and vulgar her mind and body alike seemed brazen and imperishable i should think from her childhood she must have lived in public stations and in her youth might very likely have been a barmaid  towards morning her discourse ran on a new theme the watsons a certain expected familyparty of passengers known to her it appeared and by her much esteemed on account of the handsome profit realized in their fees she said it was as good as a little fortune to her whenever this family crossed  at dawn all were astir and by sunrise the passengers came on board boisterous was the welcome given by the stewardess to the watsons and great was the bustle made in their honour they were four in number two males and two females besides them there was but one other passengera young lady whom a gentlemanly though languidlooking man escorted the two groups offered a marked contrast the watsons were doubtless rich people for they had the confidence of conscious wealth in their bearing the womenyouthful both of them and one perfectly handsome as far as physical beauty wentwere dressed richly gaily and absurdly out of character for the circumstances their bonnets with bright flowers their velvet cloaks and silk dresses seemed better suited for park or promenade than for a damp packet deck the men were of low stature plain fat and vulgar the oldest plainest greasiest broadest i soon found was the husbandthe bridegroom i suppose for she was very youngof the beautiful girl deep was my amazement at this discovery and deeper still when i perceived that instead of being desperately wretched in such a union she was gay even to giddiness her laughter i reflected must be the mere frenzy of despair and even while this thought was crossing my mind as i stood leaning quiet and solitary against the ships side she came tripping up to me an utter stranger with a campstool in her hand and smiling a smile of which the levity puzzled and startled me though it showed a perfect set of perfect teeth she offered me the accommodation of this piece of furniture i declined it of course with all the courtesy i could put into my manner she danced off heedless and lightsome she must have been goodnatured but what had made her marry that individual who was at least as much like an oilbarrel as a man  the other lady passenger with the gentlemancompanion was quite a girl pretty and fair her simple print dress untrimmed strawbonnet and large shawl gracefully worn formed a costume plain to quakerism yet for her becoming enough before the gentleman quitted her i observed him throwing a glance of scrutiny over all the passengers as if to ascertain in what company his charge would be left with a most dissatisfied air did his eye turn from the ladies with the gay flowers he looked at me and then he spoke to his daughter niece or whatever she was she also glanced in my direction and slightly curled her short pretty lip it might be myself or it might be my homely mourning habit that elicited this mark of contempt more likely both a bell rang her father i afterwards knew that it was her father kissed her and returned to land the packet sailed  foreigners say that it is only english girls who can thus be trusted to travel alone and deep is their wonder at the daring confidence of english parents and guardians as for the jeunes meess by some their intrepidity is pronounced masculine and inconvenant others regard them as the passive victims of an educational and theological system which wantonly dispenses with proper surveillance whether this particular young lady was of the sort that can the most safely be left unwatched i do not know or rather did not then know but it soon appeared that the dignity of solitude was not to her taste she paced the deck once or twice backwards and forwards she looked with a little sour air of disdain at the flaunting silks and velvets and the bears which thereon danced attendance and eventually she approached me and spoke  are you fond of a seavoyage was her question  i explained that my fondness for a seavoyage had yet to undergo the test of experience i had never made one  oh how charming cried she i quite envy you the novelty first impressions you know are so pleasant now i have made so many i quite forget the first i am quite blasée about the sea and all that  i could not help smiling  why do you laugh at me she inquired with a frank testiness that pleased me better than her other talk  because you are so young to be blasée about anything  i am seventeen a little piqued  you hardly look sixteen do you like travelling alone  bah i care nothing about it i have crossed the channel ten times alone but then i take care never to be long alone i always make friends  you will scarcely make many friends this voyage i think glancing at the watsongroup who were now laughing and making a great deal of noise on deck  not of those odious men and women said she such people should be steerage passengers are you going to school  no  where are you going  i have not the least ideabeyond at least the port of bouemarine  she stared then carelessly ran on  i am going to school oh the number of foreign schools i have been at in my life and yet i am quite an ignoramus i know nothingnothing in the worldi assure you except that i play and dance beautifullyand french and german of course i know to speak but i cant read or write them very well do you know they wanted me to translate a page of an easy german book into english the other day and i couldnt do it papa was so mortified he says it looks as if m de bassompierremy godpapa who pays all my schoolbillshad thrown away all his money and then in matters of informationin history geography arithmetic and so on i am quite a baby and i write english so badlysuch spelling and grammar they tell me into the bargain i have quite forgotten my religion they call me a protestant you know but really i am not sure whether i am one or not i dont well know the difference between romanism and protestantism however i dont in the least care for that i was a lutheran once at bonndear bonncharming bonnwhere there were so many handsome students every nice girl in our school had an admirer they knew our hours for walking out and almost always passed us on the promenade schönes mädchen we used to hear them say i was excessively happy at bonn  and where are you now i inquired  oh atchose said she  now miss ginevra fanshawe such was this young persons name only substituted this word chose in temporary oblivion of the real name it was a habit she had chose came in at every turn in her conversationthe convenient substitute for any missing word in any language she might chance at the time to be speaking french girls often do the like from them she had caught the custom chose however i found in this instance stood for villettethe great capital of the great kingdom of labassecour  do you like villette i asked  pretty well the natives you know are intensely stupid and vulgar but there are some nice english families  are you in a school  yes  a good one  oh no horrid but i go out every sunday and care nothing about the maîtresses or the professeurs or the élèves and send lessons au diable one darent say that in english you know but it sounds quite right in french and thus i get on charmingly you are laughing at me again  noi am only smiling at my own thoughts  what are they without waiting for an answernow do tell me where you are going  where fate may lead me my business is to earn a living where i can find it  to earn in consternation are you poor then  as poor as job  after a pausebah how unpleasant but i know what it is to be poor they are poor enough at homepapa and mamma and all of them papa is called captain fanshawe he is an officer on halfpay but welldescended and some of our connections are great enough but my uncle and godpapa de bassompierre who lives in france is the only one that helps us he educates us girls i have five sisters and three brothers byandby we are to marryrather elderly gentlemen i suppose with cash papa and mamma manage that my sister augusta is married now to a man much olderlooking than papa augusta is very beautifulnot in my stylebut dark her husband mr davies had the yellow fever in india and he is still the colour of a guinea but then he is rich and augusta has her carriage and establishment and we all think she has done perfectly well now this is better than earning a living as you say by the way are you clever  nonot at all  you can play sing speak three or four languages  by no means  still i think you are clever a pause and a yawn  shall you be seasick  shall you  oh immensely as soon as ever we get in sight of the sea i begin indeed to feel it already i shall go below and wont i order about that fat odious stewardess heureusement je sais faire aller mon monde  down she went  it was not long before the other passengers followed her throughout the afternoon i remained on deck alone when i recall the tranquil and even happy mood in which i passed those hours and remember at the same time the position in which i was placed its hazardoussome would have said its hopelesscharacter i feel that as    stone walls do not a prison make   nor iron barsa cage  so peril loneliness an uncertain future are not oppressive evils so long as the frame is healthy and the faculties are employed so long especially as liberty lends us her wings and hope guides us by her star  i was not sick till long after we passed margate and deep was the pleasure i drank in with the seabreeze divine the delight i drew from the heaving channel waves from the seabirds on their ridges from the white sails on their dark distance from the quiet yet beclouded sky overhanging all in my reverie methought i saw the continent of europe like a wide dreamland far away sunshine lay on it making the long coast one line of gold tiniest tracery of clustered town and snowgleaming tower of woods deep massed of heights serrated of smooth pasturage and veiny stream embossed the metalbright prospect for background spread a sky solemn and dark blue andgrand with imperial promise soft with tints of enchantmentstrode from north to south a godbent bow an arch of hope  cancel the whole of that if you please readeror rather let it stand and draw thence a moralan alliterative texthand copy    daydreams are delusions of the demon  becoming excessively sick i faltered down into the cabin  miss fanshawes berth chanced to be next mine and i am sorry to say she tormented me with an unsparing selfishness during the whole time of our mutual distress nothing could exceed her impatience and fretfulness the watsons who were very sick too and on whom the stewardess attended with shameless partiality were stoics compared with her many a time since have i noticed in persons of ginevra fanshawes light careless temperament and fair fragile style of beauty an entire incapacity to endure they seem to sour in adversity like small beer in thunder the man who takes such a woman for his wife ought to be prepared to guarantee her an existence all sunshine indignant at last with her teasing peevishness i curtly requested her to hold her tongue the rebuff did her good and it was observable that she liked me no worse for it  as dark night drew on the sea roughened larger waves swayed strong against the vessels side it was strange to reflect that blackness and water were round us and to feel the ship ploughing straight on her pathless way despite noise billow and rising gale articles of furniture began to fall about and it became needful to lash them to their places the passengers grew sicker than ever miss fanshawe declared with groans that she must die  not just yet honey said the stewardess were just in port accordingly in another quarter of an hour a calm fell upon us all and about midnight the voyage ended  i was sorry yes i was sorry my restingtime was past my difficultiesmy stringent difficultiesrecommenced when i went on deck the cold air and black scowl of the night seemed to rebuke me for my presumption in being where i was the lights of the foreign seaport town glimmering round the foreign harbour met me like unnumbered threatening eyes friends came on board to welcome the watsons a whole family of friends surrounded and bore away miss fanshawe ibut i dared not for one moment dwell on a comparison of positions  yet where should i go i must go somewhere necessity dare not be nice as i gave the stewardess her feeand she seemed surprised at receiving a coin of more value than from such a quarter her coarse calculations had probably reckoned oni said be kind enough to direct me to some quiet respectable inn where i can go for the night  she not only gave me the required direction but called a commissionaire and bid him take charge of me andnot my trunk for that was gone to the customhouse  i followed this man along a rudelypaved street lit now by a fitful gleam of moonlight he brought me to the inn i offered him sixpence which he refused to take supposing it not enough i changed it for a shilling but this also he declined speaking rather sharply in a language to me unknown a waiter coming forward into the lamplit innpassage reminded me in broken english that my money was foreign money not current here i gave him a sovereign to change this little matter settled i asked for a bedroom supper i could not take i was still seasick and unnerved and trembling all over how deeply glad i was when the door of a very small chamber at length closed on me and my exhaustion again i might rest though the cloud of doubt would be as thick tomorrow as ever the necessity for exertion more urgent the peril of destitution nearer the conflict for existence more severe     chapter vii  villette   i awoke next morning with courage revived and spirits refreshed physical debility no longer enervated my judgment my mind felt prompt and clear  just as i finished dressing a tap came to the door i said come in expecting the chambermaid whereas a rough man walked in and said  gif me your keys meess  why i asked  gif said he impatiently and as he halfsnatched them from my hand he added all right haf your tronc soon  fortunately it did turn out all right he was from the customhouse where to go to get some breakfast i could not tell but i proceeded not without hesitation to descend  i now observed what i had not noticed in my extreme weariness last night viz that this inn was in fact a large hotel and as i slowly descended the broad staircase halting on each step for i was in wonderfully little haste to get down i gazed at the high ceiling above me at the painted walls around at the wide windows which filled the house with light at the veined marble i trod for the steps were all of marble though uncarpeted and not very clean and contrasting all this with the dimensions of the closet assigned to me as a chamber with the extreme modesty of its appointments i fell into a philosophizing mood  much i marvelled at the sagacity evinced by waiters and chambermaids in proportioning the accommodation to the guest how could innservants and shipstewardesses everywhere tell at a glance that i for instance was an individual of no social significance and little burdened by cash they did know it evidently i saw quite well that they all in a moments calculation estimated me at about the same fractional value the fact seemed to me curious and pregnant i would not disguise from myself what it indicated yet managed to keep up my spirits pretty well under its pressure  having at last landed in a great hall full of skylight glare i made my way somehow to what proved to be the coffeeroom it cannot be denied that on entering this room i trembled somewhat felt uncertain solitary wretched wished to heaven i knew whether i was doing right or wrong felt convinced that it was the last but could not help myself acting in the spirit and with the calm of a fatalist i sat down at a small table to which a waiter presently brought me some breakfast and i partook of that meal in a frame of mind not greatly calculated to favour digestion there were many other people breakfasting at other tables in the room i should have felt rather more happy if amongst them all i could have seen any women however there was not oneall present were men but nobody seemed to think i was doing anything strange one or two gentlemen glanced at me occasionally but none stared obtrusively i suppose if there was anything eccentric in the business they accounted for it by this word anglaise  breakfast over i must again movein what direction go to villette said an inward voice prompted doubtless by the recollection of this slight sentence uttered carelessly and at random by miss fanshawe as she bid me goodby i wish you would come to madame becks she has some marmots whom you might look after she wants an english gouvernante or was wanting one two months ago  who madame beck was where she lived i knew not i had asked but the question passed unheard miss fanshawe hurried away by her friends left it unanswered i presumed villette to be her residenceto villette i would go the distance was forty miles i knew i was catching at straws but in the wide and weltering deep where i found myself i would have caught at cobwebs having inquired about the means of travelling to villette and secured a seat in the diligence i departed on the strength of this outlinethis shadow of a project before you pronounce on the rashness of the proceeding reader look back to the point whence i started consider the desert i had left note how little i perilled mine was the game where the player cannot lose and may win  of an artistic temperament i deny that i am yet i must possess something of the artists faculty of making the most of present pleasure that is to say when it is of the kind to my taste i enjoyed that day though we travelled slowly though it was cold though it rained somewhat bare flat and treeless was the route along which our journey lay and slimy canals crept like halftorpid green snakes beside the road and formal pollard willows edged level fields tilled like kitchengarden beds the sky too was monotonously gray the atmosphere was stagnant and humid yet amidst all these deadening influences my fancy budded fresh and my heart basked in sunshine these feelings however were well kept in check by the secret but ceaseless consciousness of anxiety lying in wait on enjoyment like a tiger crouched in a jungle the breathing of that beast of prey was in my ear always his fierce heart panted close against mine he never stirred in his lair but i felt him i knew he waited only for sundown to bound ravenous from his ambush  i had hoped we might reach villette ere night set in and that thus i might escape the deeper embarrassment which obscurity seems to throw round a first arrival at an unknown bourne but what with our slow progress and long stoppageswhat with a thick fog and small dense raindarkness that might almost be felt had settled on the city by the time we gained its suburbs  i know we passed through a gate where soldiers were stationedso much i could see by lamplight then having left behind us the miry chaussée we rattled over a pavement of strangely rough and flinty surface at a bureau the diligence stopped and the passengers alighted my first business was to get my trunk a small matter enough but important to me understanding that it was best not to be importunate or overeager about luggage but to wait and watch quietly the delivery of other boxes till i saw my own and then promptly claim and secure it i stood apart my eye fixed on that part of the vehicle in which i had seen my little portmanteau safely stowed and upon which piles of additional bags and boxes were now heaped one by one i saw these removed lowered and seized on  i was sure mine ought to be by this time visible it was not i had tied on the directioncard with a piece of green ribbon that i might know it at a glance not a fringe or fragment of green was perceptible every package was removed every tincase and brownpaper parcel the oilcloth cover was lifted i saw with distinct vision that not an umbrella cloak cane hatbox or bandbox remained  and my portmanteau with my few clothes and little pocketbook enclasping the remnant of my fifteen pounds where were they  i ask this question now but i could not ask it then i could say nothing whatever not possessing a phrase of speaking french and it was french and french only the whole world seemed now gabbling around me what should i do approaching the conductor i just laid my hand on his arm pointed to a trunk thence to the  diligenceroof and tried to express a question with my eyes he misunderstood me seized the trunk indicated and was about to hoist it on the vehicle  let that alonewill you said a voice in good english then in correction questce que vous faîtes donc cette malle est à moi  but i had heard the fatherland accents they rejoiced my heart i turned sir said i appealing to the stranger without in my distress noticing what he was like i cannot speak french may i entreat you to ask this man what he has done with my trunk  without discriminating for the moment what sort of face it was to which my eyes were raised and on which they were fixed i felt in its expression halfsurprise at my appeal and halfdoubt of the wisdom of interference  do ask him i would do as much for you said i  i dont know whether he smiled but he said in a gentlemanly tonethat is to say a tone not hard nor terrifyingwhat sort of trunk was yours  i described it including in my description the green ribbon and forthwith he took the conductor under hand and i felt through all the storm of french which followed that he raked him fore and aft presently he returned to me  the fellow avers he was overloaded and confesses that he removed your trunk after you saw it put on and has left it behind at bouemarine with other parcels he has promised however to forward it tomorrow the day after therefore you will find it safe at this bureau  thank you said i but my heart sank  meantime what should i do perhaps this english gentleman saw the failure of courage in my face he inquired kindly have you any friends in this city  no and i dont know where to go  there was a little pause in the course of which as he turned more fully to the light of a lamp above him i saw that he was a young distinguished and handsome man he might be a lord for anything i knew nature had made him good enough for a prince i thought his face was very pleasant he looked high but not arrogant manly but not overbearing i was turning away in the deep consciousness of all absence of claim to look for further help from such a one as he  was all your money in your trunk he asked stopping me  how thankful was i to be able to answer with truthno i have enough in my purse for i had near twenty francs to keep me at a quiet inn till the day after tomorrow but i am quite a stranger in villette and dont know the streets and the inns  i can give you the address of such an inn as you want said he and it is not far off with my direction you will easily find it  he tore a leaf from his pocketbook wrote a few words and gave it to me i did think him kind and as to distrusting him or his advice or his address i should almost as soon have thought of distrusting the bible there was goodness in his countenance and honour in his bright eyes  your shortest way will be to follow the boulevard and cross the park he continued but it is too late and too dark for a woman to go through the park alone i will step with you thus far  he moved on and i followed him through the darkness and the small soaking rain the boulevard was all deserted its path miry the water dripping from its trees the park was black as midnight in the double gloom of trees and fog i could not see my guide i could only follow his tread not the least fear had i i believe i would have followed that frank tread through continual night to the worlds end  now said he when the park was traversed you will go along this broad street till you come to steps two lamps will show you where they are these steps you will descend a narrower street lies below following that at the bottom you will find your inn they speak english there so your difficulties are now pretty well over goodnight  goodnight sir said i accept my sincerest thanks and we parted  the remembrance of his countenance which i am sure wore a light not unbenignant to the friendlessthe sound in my ear of his voice which spoke a nature chivalric to the needy and feeble as well as the youthful and fairwere a sort of cordial to me long after he was a true young english gentleman  on i went hurrying fast through a magnificent street and square with the grandest houses round and amidst them the huge outline of more than one overbearing pile which might be palace or churchi could not tell just as i passed a portico two mustachioed men came suddenly from behind the pillars they were smoking cigars their dress implied pretensions to the rank of gentlemen but poor things they were very plebeian in soul they spoke with insolence and fast as i walked they kept pace with me a long way at last i met a sort of patrol and my dreaded hunters were turned from the pursuit but they had driven me beyond my reckoning when i could collect my faculties i no longer knew where i was the staircase i must long since have passed puzzled out of breath all my pulses throbbing in inevitable agitation i knew not where to turn it was terrible to think of again encountering those bearded sneering simpletons yet the ground must be retraced and the steps sought out  i came at last to an old and worn flight and taking it for granted that this must be the one indicated i descended them the street into which they led was indeed narrow but it contained no inn on i wandered in a very quiet and comparatively clean and wellpaved street i saw a light burning over the door of a rather large house loftier by a story than those round it this might be the inn at last i hastened on my knees now trembled under me i was getting quite exhausted  no inn was this a brassplate embellished the great portecochère pensionnat de demoiselles was the inscription and beneath a name madame beck  i started about a hundred thoughts volleyed through my mind in a moment yet i planned nothing and considered nothing i had not time providence said stop here this is your inn fate took me in her strong hand mastered my will directed my actions i rang the doorbell  while i waited i would not reflect i fixedly looked at the streetstones where the doorlamp shone and counted them and noted their shapes and the glitter of wet on their angles i rang again they opened at last a bonne in a smart cap stood before me  may i see madame beck i inquired  i believe if i had spoken french she would not have admitted me but as i spoke english she concluded i was a foreign teacher come on business connected with the pensionnat and even at that late hour she let me in without a word of reluctance or a moment of hesitation  the next moment i sat in a cold glittering salon with porcelain stove unlit and gilded ornaments and polished floor a pendule on the mantelpiece struck nine oclock  a quarter of an hour passed how fast beat every pulse in my frame how i turned cold and hot by turns i sat with my eyes fixed on the doora great white foldingdoor with gilt mouldings i watched to see a leaf move and open all had been quiet not a mouse had stirred the white doors were closed and motionless  you ayre engliss said a voice at my elbow i almost bounded so unexpected was the sound so certain had i been of solitude  no ghost stood beside me nor anything of spectral aspect merely a motherly dumpy little woman in a large shawl a wrappinggown and a clean trim nightcap  i said i was english and immediately without further prelude we fell to a most remarkable conversation madame beck for madame beck it wasshe had entered by a little door behind me and being shod with the shoes of silence i had heard neither her entrance nor approachmadame beck had exhausted her command of insular speech when she said you ayre engliss and she now proceeded to work away volubly in her own tongue i answered in mine she partly understood me but as i did not at all understand herthough we made together an awful clamour anything like madames gift of utterance i had not hitherto heard or imaginedwe achieved little progress she rang ere long for aid which arrived in the shape of a maîtresse who had been partly educated in an irish convent and was esteemed a perfect adept in the english language a bluff little personage this maîtresse waslabassecourienne from top to toe and how she did slaughter the speech of albion however i told her a plain tale which she translated i told her how i had left my own country intent on extending my knowledge and gaining my bread how i was ready to turn my hand to any useful thing provided it was not wrong or degrading how i would be a childsnurse or a ladysmaid and would not refuse even housework adapted to my strength madame heard this and questioning her countenance i almost thought the tale won her ear  il ny a que les anglaises pour ces sortes dentreprises said she sontelles donc intrépides ces femmes là  she asked my name my age she sat and looked at menot pityingly not with interest never a gleam of sympathy or a shade of compassion crossed her countenance during the interview i felt she was not one to be led an inch by her feelings grave and considerate she gazed consulting her judgment and studying my narrative a bell rang  voilà pour la prière du soir said she and rose through her interpreter she desired me to depart now and come back on the morrow but this did not suit me i could not bear to return to the perils of darkness and the street with energy yet with a collected and controlled manner i said addressing herself personally and not the maîtresse be assured madame that by instantly securing my services your interests will be served and not injured you will find me one who will wish to give in her labour a full equivalent for her wages and if you hire me it will be better that i should stay here this night having no acquaintance in villette and not possessing the language of the country how can i secure a lodging  it is true said she but at least you can give a reference  none  she inquired after my luggage i told her when it would arrive she mused at that moment a mans step was heard in the vestibule hastily proceeding to the outer door i shall go on with this part of my tale as if i had understood all that passed for though it was then scarce intelligible to me i heard it translated afterwards  who goes out now demanded madame beck listening to the tread  m paul replied the teacher he came this evening to give a reading to the first class  the very man i should at this moment most wish to see call him  the teacher ran to the salon door m paul was summoned he entered a small dark and spare man in spectacles  mon cousin began madame i want your opinion we know your skill in physiognomy use it now read that countenance  the little man fixed on me his spectacles a resolute compression of the lips and gathering of the brow seemed to say that he meant to see through me and that a veil would be no veil for him  i read it he pronounced  et quen dites vous  maisbien des choses was the oracular answer  bad or good  of each kind without doubt pursued the diviner  may one trust her word  are you negotiating a matter of importance  she wishes me to engage her as bonne or gouvernante tells a tale full of integrity but gives no reference  she is a stranger  an englishwoman as one may see  she speaks french  not a word  she understands it  no  one may then speak plainly in her presence  doubtless  he gazed steadily do you need her services  i could do with them you know i am disgusted with madame svini  still he scrutinized the judgment when it at last came was as indefinite as what had gone before it  engage her if good predominates in that nature the action will bring its own reward if evileh bien ma cousine ce sera toujours une bonne oeuvre and with a bow and a bon soir this vague arbiter of my destiny vanished  and madame did engage me that very nightby gods blessing i was spared the necessity of passing forth again into the lonesome dreary hostile street     chapter viii  madame beck   being delivered into the charge of the maîtresse i was led through a long narrow passage into a foreign kitchen very clean but very strange it seemed to contain no means of cookingneither fireplace nor oven i did not understand that the great black furnace which filled one corner was an efficient substitute for these surely pride was not already beginning its whispers in my heart yet i felt a sense of relief when instead of being left in the kitchen as i half anticipated i was led forward to a small inner room termed a cabinet a cook in a jacket a short petticoat and sabots brought my supper to witsome meat nature unknown served in an odd and acid but pleasant sauce some chopped potatoes made savoury with i know not what vinegar and sugar i think a tartine or slice of bread and butter and a baked pear being hungry i ate and was grateful  after the prière du soir madame herself came to have another look at me she desired me to follow her upstairs through a series of the queerest little dormitorieswhich i heard afterwards had once been nuns cells for the premises were in part of ancient dateand through the oratorya long low gloomy room where a crucifix hung pale against the wall and two tapers kept dim vigilsshe conducted me to an apartment where three children were asleep in three tiny beds a heated stove made the air of this room oppressive and to mend matters it was scented with an odour rather strong than delicate a perfume indeed altogether surprising and unexpected under the circumstances being like the combination of smoke with some spirituous essencea smell in short of whisky  beside a table on which flared the remnant of a candle guttering to waste in the socket a coarse woman heterogeneously clad in a broad striped showy silk dress and a stuff apron sat in a chair fast asleep to complete the picture and leave no doubt as to the state of matters a bottle and an empty glass stood at the sleeping beautys elbow  madame contemplated this remarkable tableau with great calm she neither smiled nor scowled no impress of anger disgust or surprise ruffled the equality of her grave aspect she did not even wake the woman serenely pointing to a fourth bed she intimated that it was to be mine then having extinguished the candle and substituted for it a nightlamp she glided through an inner door which she left ajarthe entrance to her own chamber a large wellfurnished apartment as was discernible through the aperture  my devotions that night were all thanksgiving strangely had i been led since morningunexpectedly had i been provided for scarcely could i believe that not fortyeight hours had elapsed since i left london under no other guardianship than that which protects the passengerbirdwith no prospect but the dubious cloudtracery of hope  i was a light sleeper in the dead of night i suddenly awoke all was hushed but a white figure stood in the roommadame in her nightdress moving without perceptible sound she visited the three children in the three beds she approached me i feigned sleep and she studied me long a small pantomime ensued curious enough i daresay she sat a quarter of an hour on the edge of my bed gazing at my face she then drew nearer bent close over me slightly raised my cap and turned back the border so as to expose my hair she looked at my hand lying on the bedclothes this done she turned to the chair where my clothes lay it was at the foot of the bed hearing her touch and lift them i opened my eyes with precaution for i own i felt curious to see how far her taste for research would lead her it led her a good way every article did she inspect i divined her motive for this proceeding viz the wish to form from the garments a judgment respecting the wearer her station means neatness c the end was not bad but the means were hardly fair or justifiable in my dress was a pocket she fairly turned it inside out she counted the money in my purse she opened a little memorandumbook coolly perused its contents and took from between the leaves a small plaited lock of miss marchmonts grey hair to a bunch of three keys being those of my trunk desk and workbox she accorded special attention with these indeed she withdrew a moment to her own room i softly rose in my bed and followed her with my eye these keys reader were not brought back till they had left on the toilet of the adjoining room the impress of their wards in wax all being thus done decently and in order my property was returned to its place my clothes were carefully refolded of what nature were the conclusions deduced from this scrutiny were they favourable or otherwise vain question madames face of stone for of stone in its present night aspect it looked it had been human and as i said before motherly in the salon betrayed no response  her duty donei felt that in her eyes this business was a dutyshe rose noiseless as a shadow she moved towards her own chamber at the door she turned fixing her eye on the heroine of the bottle who still slept and loudly snored mrs svini i presume this was mrs svini anglicé or hibernicé sweenymrs sweenys doom was in madame becks eyean immutable purpose that eye spoke madames visitations for shortcomings might be slow but they were sure all this was very unenglish truly i was in a foreign land  the morrow made me further acquainted with mrs sweeny it seems she had introduced herself to her present employer as an english lady in reduced circumstances a native indeed of middlesex professing to speak the english tongue with the purest metropolitan accent madamereliant on her own infallible expedients for finding out the truth in timehad a singular intrepidity in hiring service offhand as indeed seemed abundantly proved in my own case she received mrs sweeny as nurserygoverness to her three children i need hardly explain to the reader that this lady was in effect a native of ireland her station i do not pretend to fix she boldly declared that she had had the bringingup of the son and daughter of a marquis i think myself she might possibly have been a hangeron nurse fosterer or washerwoman in some irish family she spoke a smothered tongue curiously overlaid with mincing cockney inflections by some means or other she had acquired and now held in possession a wardrobe of rather suspicious splendourgowns of stiff and costly silk fitting her indifferently and apparently made for other proportions than those they now adorned caps with real lace borders andthe chief item in the inventory the spell by which she struck a certain awe through the household quelling the otherwise scornfully disposed teachers and servants and so long as her broad shoulders wore the folds of that majestic drapery even influencing madame herselfa real indian shawlun véritable cachemire as madame beck said with unmixed reverence and amaze i feel quite sure that without this cachemire she would not have kept her footing in the pensionnat for two days by virtue of it and it only she maintained the same a month  but when mrs sweeny knew that i was come to fill her shoes then it was that she declared herselfthen did she rise on madame beck in her full powerthen come down on me with her concentrated weight madame bore this revelation and visitation so well so stoically that i for very shame could not support it otherwise than with composure for one little moment madame beck absented herself from the room ten minutes after an agent of the police stood in the midst of us mrs sweeny and her effects were removed madames brow had not been ruffled during the sceneher lips had not dropped one sharplyaccented word  this brisk little affair of the dismissal was all settled before breakfast order to march given policeman called mutineer expelled chambre denfans fumigated and cleansed windows thrown open and every trace of the accomplished mrs sweenyeven to the fine essence and spiritual fragrance which gave token so subtle and so fatal of the head and front of her offendingwas annihilated from the rue fossette all this i say was done between the moment of madame becks issuing like aurora from her chamber and that in which she coolly sat down to pour out her first cup of coffee  about noon i was summoned to dress madame it appeared my place was to be a hybrid between gouvernante and ladysmaid till noon she haunted the house in her wrappinggown shawl and soundless slippers how would the ladychief of an english school approve this custom  the dressing of her hair puzzled me she had plenty of it auburn unmixed with grey though she was forty years old seeing my embarrassment she said you have not been a femmedechambre in your own country and taking the brush from my hand and setting me aside not ungently or disrespectfully she arranged it herself in performing other offices of the toilet she halfdirected halfaided me without the least display of temper or impatience nbthat was the first and last time i was required to dress her henceforth on rosine the portress devolved that duty  when attired madame beck appeared a personage of a figure rather short and stout yet still graceful in its own peculiar way that is with the grace resulting from proportion of parts her complexion was fresh and sanguine not too rubicund her eye blue and serene her dark silk dress fitted her as a french sempstress alone can make a dress fit she looked well though a little bourgeoise as bourgeoise indeed she was i know not what of harmony pervaded her whole person and yet her face offered contrast too its features were by no means such as are usually seen in conjunction with a complexion of such blended freshness and repose their outline was stern her forehead was high but narrow it expressed capacity and some benevolence but no expanse nor did her peaceful yet watchful eye ever know the fire which is kindled in the heart or the softness which flows thence her mouth was hard it could be a little grim her lips were thin for sensibility and genius with all their tenderness and temerity i felt somehow that madame would be the right sort of minos in petticoats  in the long run i found she was something else in petticoats too her name was modeste maria beck née kint it ought to have been ignacia she was a charitable woman and did a great deal of good there never was a mistress whose rule was milder i was told that she never once remonstrated with the intolerable mrs sweeny despite her tipsiness disorder and general neglect yet mrs sweeny had to go the moment her departure became convenient i was told too that neither masters nor teachers were found fault with in that establishment yet both masters and teachers were often changed they vanished and others filled their places none could well explain how  the establishment was both a pensionnat and an externat the externes or daypupils exceeded one hundred in number the boarders were about a score madame must have possessed high administrative powers she ruled all these together with four teachers eight masters six servants and three children managing at the same time to perfection the pupils parents and friends and that without apparent effort without bustle fatigue fever or any symptom of undue excitement occupied she always wasbusy rarely it is true that madame had her own system for managing and regulating this mass of machinery and a very pretty system it was the reader has seen a specimen of it in that small affair of turning my pocket inside out and reading my private memoranda surveillance espionagethese were her watchwords  still madame knew what honesty was and liked itthat is when it did not obtrude its clumsy scruples in the way of her will and interest she had a respect for angleterre and as to les anglaises she would have the women of no other country about her own children if she could help it  often in the evening after she had been plotting and counterplotting spying and receiving the reports of spies all day she would come up to my rooma trace of real weariness on her browand she would sit down and listen while the children said their little prayers to me in english the lords prayer and the hymn beginning gentle jesus these little catholics were permitted to repeat at my knee and when i had put them to bed she would talk to me i soon gained enough french to be able to understand and even answer her about england and englishwomen and the reasons for what she was pleased to term their superior intelligence and more real and reliable probity very good sense she often showed very sound opinions she often broached she seemed to know that keeping girls in distrustful restraint in blind ignorance and under a surveillance that left them no moment and no corner for retirement was not the best way to make them grow up honest and modest women but she averred that ruinous consequences would ensue if any other method were tried with continental children they were so accustomed to restraint that relaxation however guarded would be misunderstood and fatally presumed on she was sick she would declare of the means she had to use but use them she must and after discoursing often with dignity and delicacy to me she would move away on her souliers de silence and glide ghostlike through the house watching and spying everywhere peering through every keyhole listening behind every door  after all madames system was not badlet me do her justice nothing could be better than all her arrangements for the physical wellbeing of her scholars no minds were overtasked the lessons were well distributed and made incomparably easy to the learner there was a liberty of amusement and a provision for exercise which kept the girls healthy the food was abundant and good neither pale nor puny faces were anywhere to be seen in the rue fossette she never grudged a holiday she allowed plenty of time for sleeping dressing washing eating her method in all these matters was easy liberal salutary and rational many an austere english schoolmistress would do vastly well to imitate herand i believe many would be glad to do so if exacting english parents would let them  as madame beck ruled by espionage she of course had her staff of spies she perfectly knew the quality of the tools she used and while she would not scruple to handle the dirtiest for a dirty occasionflinging this sort from her like refuse rind after the orange has been duly squeezedi have known her fastidious in seeking pure metal for clean uses and when once a bloodless and rustless instrument was found she was careful of the prize keeping it in silk and cottonwool yet woe be to that man or woman who relied on her one inch beyond the point where it was her interest to be trustworthy interest was the masterkey of madames naturethe mainspring of her motivesthe alpha and omega of her life i have seen her feelings appealed to and i have smiled in halfpity halfscorn at the appellants none ever gained her ear through that channel or swayed her purpose by that means on the contrary to attempt to touch her heart was the surest way to rouse her antipathy and to make of her a secret foe it proved to her that she had no heart to be touched it reminded her where she was impotent and dead never was the distinction between charity and mercy better exemplified than in her while devoid of sympathy she had a sufficiency of rational benevolence she would give in the readiest manner to people she had never seenrather however to classes than to individuals pour les pauvres she opened her purse freelyagainst the poor man as a rule she kept it closed in philanthropic schemes for the benefit of society at large she took a cheerful part no private sorrow touched her no force or mass of suffering concentrated in one heart had power to pierce hers not the agony in gethsemane not the death on calvary could have wrung from her eyes one tear  i say again madame was a very great and a very capable woman that school offered her for her powers too limited a sphere she ought to have swayed a nation she should have been the leader of a turbulent legislative assembly nobody could have browbeaten her none irritated her nerves exhausted her patience or overreached her astuteness in her own single person she could have comprised the duties of a first minister and a superintendent of police wise firm faithless secret crafty passionless watchful and inscrutable acute and insensatewithal perfectly decorouswhat more could be desired  the sensible reader will not suppose that i gained all the knowledge here condensed for his benefit in one month or in one halfyear no what i saw at first was the thriving outside of a large and flourishing educational establishment here was a great house full of healthy lively girls all welldressed and many of them handsome gaining knowledge by a marvellously easy method without painful exertion or useless waste of spirits not perhaps making very rapid progress in anything taking it easy but still always employed and never oppressed here was a corps of teachers and masters more stringently tasked as all the real headlabour was to be done by them in order to save the pupils yet having their duties so arranged that they relieved each other in quick succession whenever the work was severe here in short was a foreign school of which the life movement and variety made it a complete and most charming contrast to many english institutions of the same kind  behind the house was a large garden and in summer the pupils almost lived out of doors amongst the rosebushes and the fruittrees under the vast and vinedraped berceau madame would take her seat on summer afternoons and send for the classes in turns to sit round her and sew and read meantime masters came and went delivering short and lively lectures rather than lessons and the pupils made notes of their instructions or did not make themjust as inclination prompted secure that in case of neglect they could copy the notes of their companions besides the regular monthly jours de sortie the catholic fêtedays brought a succession of holidays all the year round and sometimes on a bright summer morning or soft summer evening the boarders were taken out for a long walk into the country regaled with gaufres and vin blanc or new milk and pain bis or pistolets au beurre rolls and coffee all this seemed very pleasant and madame appeared goodness itself and the teachers not so bad but they might be worse and the pupils perhaps a little noisy and rough but types of health and glee  thus did the view appear seen through the enchantment of distance but there came a time when distance was to melt for mewhen i was to be called down from my watchtower of the nursery whence i had hitherto made my observations and was to be compelled into closer intercourse with this little world of the rue fossette  i was one day sitting upstairs as usual hearing the children their english lessons and at the same time turning a silk dress for madame when she came sauntering into the room with that absorbed air and brow of hard thought she sometimes wore and which made her look so little genial dropping into a seat opposite mine she remained some minutes silent désirée the eldest girl was reading to me some little essay of mrs barbaulds and i was making her translate currently from english to french as she proceeded by way of ascertaining that she comprehended what she read madame listened  presently without preface or prelude she said almost in the tone of one making an accusation meess in england you were a governess  no madame said i smiling you are mistaken  is this your first essay at teachingthis attempt with my children  i assured her it was again she became silent but looking up as i took a pin from the cushion i found myself an object of study she held me under her eye she seemed turning me round in her thoughtsmeasuring my fitness for a purpose weighing my value in a plan madame had ere this scrutinized all i had and i believe she esteemed herself cognizant of much that i was but from that day for the space of about a fortnight she tried me by new tests she listened at the nursery door when i was shut in with the children she followed me at a cautious distance when i walked out with them stealing within earshot whenever the trees of park or boulevard afforded a sufficient screen a strict preliminary process having thus been observed she made a move forward  one morning coming on me abruptly and with the semblance of hurry she said she found herself placed in a little dilemma mr wilson the english master had failed to come at his hour she feared he was ill the pupils were waiting in classe there was no one to give a lesson should i for once object to giving a short dictation exercise just that the pupils might not have it to say they had missed their english lesson  in classe madame i asked  yes in classe in the second division  where there are sixty pupils said i for i knew the number and with my usual base habit of cowardice i shrank into my sloth like a snail into its shell and alleged incapacity and impracticability as a pretext to escape action if left to myself i should infallibly have let this chance slip inadventurous unstirred by impulses of practical ambition i was capable of sitting twenty years teaching infants the hornbook turning silk dresses and making childrens frocks not that true contentment dignified this infatuated resignation my work had neither charm for my taste nor hold on my interest but it seemed to me a great thing to be without heavy anxiety and relieved from intimate trial the negation of severe suffering was the nearest approach to happiness i expected to know besides i seemed to hold two livesthe life of thought and that of reality and provided the former was nourished with a sufficiency of the strange necromantic joys of fancy the privileges of the latter might remain limited to daily bread hourly work and a roof of shelter  come said madame as i stooped more busily than ever over the cuttingout of a childs pinafore leave that work  but fifine wants it madame  fifine must want it then for i want you  and as madame beck did really want and was resolved to have meas she had long been dissatisfied with the english master with his shortcomings in punctuality and his careless method of tuitionas too she did not lack resolution and practical activity whether i lacked them or notshe without more ado made me relinquish thimble and needle my hand was taken into hers and i was conducted downstairs when we reached the carré a large square hall between the dwellinghouse and the pensionnat she paused dropped my hand faced and scrutinized me i was flushed and tremulous from head to foot tell it not in gath i believe i was crying in fact the difficulties before me were far from being wholly imaginary some of them were real enough and not the least substantial lay in my want of mastery over the medium through which i should be obliged to teach i had indeed studied french closely since my arrival in villette learning its practice by day and its theory in every leisure moment at night to as late an hour as the rule of the house would allow candlelight but i was far from yet being able to trust my powers of correct oral expression  dîtes donc said madame sternly vous sentez vous réellement trop faible  i might have said yes and gone back to nursery obscurity and there perhaps mouldered for the rest of my life but looking up at madame i saw in her countenance a something that made me think twice ere i decided at that instant she did not wear a womans aspect but rather a mans power of a particular kind strongly limned itself in all her traits and that power was not my kind of power neither sympathy nor congeniality nor submission were the emotions it awakened i stoodnot soothed nor won nor overwhelmed it seemed as if a challenge of strength between opposing gifts was given and i suddenly felt all the dishonour of my diffidenceall the pusillanimity of my slackness to aspire  will you she said go backward or forward indicating with her hand first the small door of communication with the dwellinghouse and then the great double portals of the classes or schoolrooms  en avant i said  but pursued she cooling as i warmed and continuing the hard look from very antipathy to which i drew strength and determination can you face the classes or are you overexcited  she sneered slightly in saying this nervous excitability was not much to madames taste  i am no more excited than this stone i said tapping the flag with my toe or than you i added returning her look  bon but let me tell you these are not quiet decorous english girls you are going to encounter ce sont des labassecouriennes rondes franches brusques et tant soit peu rebelles  i said i know and i know too that though i have studied french hard since i came here yet i still speak it with far too much hesitationtoo little accuracy to be able to command their respect i shall make blunders that will lay me open to the scorn of the most ignorant still i mean to give the lesson  they always throw over timid teachers said she  i know that too madame i have heard how they rebelled against and persecuted miss turnera poor friendless english teacher whom madame had employed and lightly discarded and to whose piteous history i was no stranger  cest vrai said she coolly miss turner had no more command over them than a servant from the kitchen would have had she was weak and wavering she had neither tact nor intelligence decision nor dignity miss turner would not do for these girls at all  i made no reply but advanced to the closed schoolroom door  you will not expect aid from me or from any one said madame that would at once set you down as incompetent for your office  i opened the door let her pass with courtesy and followed her there were three schoolrooms all large that dedicated to the second division where i was to figure was considerably the largest and accommodated an assemblage more numerous more turbulent and infinitely more unmanageable than the other two in after days when i knew the ground better i used to think sometimes if such a comparison may be permitted that the quiet polished tame first division was to the robust riotous demonstrative second division what the english house of lords is to the house of commons  the first glance informed me that many of the pupils were more than girlsquite young women i knew that some of them were of noble family as nobility goes in labassecour and i was well convinced that not one amongst them was ignorant of my position in madames household as i mounted the estràde a low platform raised a step above the flooring where stood the teachers chair and desk i beheld opposite to me a row of eyes and brows that threatened stormy weathereyes full of an insolent light and brows hard and unblushing as marble the continental female is quite a different being to the insular female of the same age and class i never saw such eyes and brows in england madame beck introduced me in one cool phrase sailed from the room and left me alone in my glory  i shall never forget that first lesson nor all the undercurrent of life and character it opened up to me then first did i begin rightly to see the wide difference that lies between the novelists and poets ideal jeune fille and the said jeune fille as she really is  it seems that three titled belles in the first row had sat down predetermined that a bonne denfants should not give them lessons in english they knew they had succeeded in expelling obnoxious teachers before now they knew that madame would at any time throw overboard a professeur or maitresse who became unpopular with the schoolthat she never assisted a weak official to retain his placethat if he had not strength to fight or tact to win his way down he went looking at miss snowe they promised themselves an easy victory  mesdemoiselles blanche virginie and angélique opened the campaign by a series of titterings and whisperings these soon swelled into murmurs and short laughs which the remoter benches caught up and echoed more loudly this growing revolt of sixty against one soon became oppressive enough my command of french being so limited and exercised under such cruel constraint  could i but have spoken in my own tongue i felt as if i might have gained a hearing for in the first place though i knew i looked a poor creature and in many respects actually was so yet nature had given me a voice that could make itself heard if lifted in excitement or deepened by emotion in the second place while i had no flow only a hesitating trickle of language in ordinary circumstances yetunder stimulus such as was now rife through the mutinous massi could in english have rolled out readily phrases stigmatizing their proceedings as such proceedings deserved to be stigmatized and then with some sarcasm flavoured with contemptuous bitterness for the ringleaders and relieved with easy banter for the weaker but less knavish followers it seemed to me that one might possibly get command over this wild herd and bring them into training at least all i could now do was to walk up to blanchemademoiselle de melcy a young baronnethe eldest tallest handsomest and most viciousstand before her desk take from under her hand her exercisebook remount the estrade deliberately read the composition which i found very stupid and as deliberately and in the face of the whole school tear the blotted page in two  this action availed to draw attention and check noise one girl alone quite in the background persevered in the riot with undiminished energy i looked at her attentively she had a pale face hair like night broad strong eyebrows decided features and a dark mutinous sinister eye i noted that she sat close by a little door which door i was well aware opened into a small closet where books were kept she was standing up for the purpose of conducting her clamour with freer energies i measured her stature and calculated her strength she seemed both tall and wiry but so the conflict were brief and the attack unexpected i thought i might manage her  advancing up the room looking as cool and careless as i possibly could in short ayant lair de rien i slightly pushed the door and found it was ajar in an instant and with sharpness i had turned on her in another instant she occupied the closet the door was shut and the key in my pocket  it so happened that this girl dolores by name and a catalonian by race was the sort of character at once dreaded and hated by all her associates the act of summary justice above noted proved popular there was not one present but in her heart liked to see it done they were stilled for a moment then a smilenot a laughpassed from desk to desk thenwhen i had gravely and tranquilly returned to the estrade courteously requested silence and commenced a dictation as if nothing at all had happenedthe pens travelled peacefully over the pages and the remainder of the lesson passed in order and industry  cest bien said madame beck when i came out of class hot and a little exhausted ca ira  she had been listening and peeping through a spyhole the whole time  from that day i ceased to be nursery governess and became english teacher madame raised my salary but she got thrice the work out of me she had extracted from mr wilson at half the expense     chapter ix  isidore   my time was now well and profitably filled up what with teaching others and studying closely myself i had hardly a spare moment it was pleasant i felt i was getting on not lying the stagnant prey of mould and rust but polishing my faculties and whetting them to a keen edge with constant use experience of a certain kind lay before me on no narrow scale villette is a cosmopolitan city and in this school were girls of almost every european nation and likewise of very varied rank in life equality is much practised in labassecour though not republican in form it is nearly so in substance and at the desks of madame becks establishment the young countess and the young bourgeoise sat side by side nor could you always by outward indications decide which was noble and which plebeian except that indeed the latter had often franker and more courteous manners while the former bore away the bell for a delicatelybalanced combination of insolence and deceit in the former there was often quick french blood mixed with the marshphlegm i regret to say that the effect of this vivacious fluid chiefly appeared in the oilier glibness with which flattery and fiction ran from the tongue and in a manner lighter and livelier but quite heartless and insincere  to do all parties justice the honest aboriginal labassecouriennes had an hypocrisy of their own too but it was of a coarse order such as could deceive few whenever a lie was necessary for their occasions they brought it out with a careless ease and breadth altogether untroubled by the rebuke of conscience not a soul in madame becks house from the scullion to the directress herself but was above being ashamed of a lie they thought nothing of it to invent might not be precisely a virtue but it was the most venial of faults jai menti plusieurs fois formed an item of every girls and womans monthly confession the priest heard unshocked and absolved unreluctant if they had missed going to mass or read a chapter of a novel that was another thing these were crimes whereof rebuke and penance were the unfailing weed  while yet but halfconscious of this state of things and unlearned in its results i got on in my new sphere very well after the first few difficult lessons given amidst peril and on the edge of a moral volcano that rumbled under my feet and sent sparks and hot fumes into my eyes the eruptive spirit seemed to subside as far as i was concerned my mind was a good deal bent on success i could not bear the thought of being baffled by mere undisciplined disaffection and wanton indocility in this first attempt to get on in life many hours of the night i used to lie awake thinking what plan i had best adopt to get a reliable hold on these mutineers to bring this stiffnecked tribe under permanent influence in the first place i saw plainly that aid in no shape was to be expected from madame her righteous plan was to maintain an unbroken popularity with the pupils at any and every cost of justice or comfort to the teachers for a teacher to seek her alliance in any crisis of insubordination was equivalent to securing her own expulsion in intercourse with her pupils madame only took to herself what was pleasant amiable and recommendatory rigidly requiring of her lieutenants sufficiency for every annoying crisis where to act with adequate promptitude was to be unpopular thus i must look only to myself  imprimisit was clear as the day that this swinish multitude were not to be driven by force they were to be humoured borne with very patiently a courteous though sedate manner impressed them a very rare flash of raillery did good severe or continuous mental application they could not or would not bear heavy demand on the memory the reason the attention they rejected pointblank where an english girl of not more than average capacity and docility would quietly take a theme and bind herself to the task of comprehension and mastery a labassecourienne would laugh in your face and throw it back to you with the phrasedieu que cest difficile je nen veux pas cela mennuie trop  a teacher who understood her business would take it back at once without hesitation contest or expostulationproceed with even exaggerated care to smoothe every difficulty to reduce it to the level of their understandings return it to them thus modified and lay on the lash of sarcasm with unsparing hand they would feel the sting perhaps wince a little under it but they bore no malice against this sort of attack provided the sneer was not sour but hearty and that it held well up to them in a clear light and bold type so that she who ran might read their incapacity ignorance and sloth they would riot for three additional lines to a lesson but i never knew them rebel against a wound given to their selfrespect the little they had of that quality was trained to be crushed and it rather liked the pressure of a firm heel than otherwise  by degrees as i acquired fluency and freedom in their language and could make such application of its more nervous idioms as suited their case the elder and more intelligent girls began rather to like me in their way i noticed that whenever a pupil had been roused to feel in her soul the stirring of worthy emulation or the quickening of honest shame from that date she was won if i could but once make their usually large ears burn under their thick glossy hair all was comparatively well byandby bouquets began to be laid on my desk in the morning by way of acknowledgment for this little foreign attention i used sometimes to walk with a select few during recreation in the course of conversation it befel once or twice that i made an unpremeditated attempt to rectify some of their singularly distorted notions of principle especially i expressed my ideas of the evil and baseness of a lie in an unguarded moment i chanced to say that of the two errors i considered falsehood worse than an occasional lapse in churchattendance the poor girls were tutored to report in catholic ears whatever the protestant teacher said an edifying consequence ensued somethingan unseen an indefinite a namelesssomething stole between myself and these my best pupils the bouquets continued to be offered but conversation thenceforth became impracticable as i paced the alleys or sat in the berceau a girl never came to my right hand but a teacher as if by magic appeared at my left also wonderful to relate madames shoes of silence brought her continually to my back as quick as noiseless and unexpected as some wandering zephyr  the opinion of my catholic acquaintance concerning my spiritual prospects was somewhat naïvely expressed to me on one occasion a pensionnaire to whom i had rendered some little service exclaimed one day as she sat beside me mademoiselle what a pity you are a protestant  why isabelle  parceque quand vous serez mortevous brûlerez tout de suite dans lenfer  croyezvous  certainement que jy crois tout le monde le sait et dailleurs le prêtre me la dit  isabelle was an odd blunt little creature she added sotto voce pour assurer votre salut làhaut on ferait bien de vous brûler toute vive icibas  i laughed as indeed it was impossible to do otherwise                                       has the reader forgotten miss ginevra fanshawe if so i must be allowed to reintroduce that young lady as a thriving pupil of madame becks for such she was on her arrival in the rue fossette two or three days after my sudden settlement there she encountered me with very little surprise she must have had good blood in her veins for never was any duchess more perfectly radically unaffectedly nonchalante than she a weak transient amaze was all she knew of the sensation of wonder most of her other faculties seemed to be in the same flimsy condition her liking and disliking her love and hate were mere cobweb and gossamer but she had one thing about her that seemed strong and durable enough and that washer selfishness  she was not proud andbonne denfants as i wasshe would forthwith have made of me a sort of friend and confidant she teased me with a thousand vapid complaints about schoolquarrels and household economy the cookery was not to her taste the people about her teachers and pupils she held to be despicable because they were foreigners i bore with her abuse of the fridays salt fish and hard eggswith her invective against the soup the bread the coffeewith some patience for a time but at last wearied by iteration i turned crusty and put her to rights a thing i ought to have done in the very beginning for a salutary setting down always agreed with her  much longer had i to endure her demands on me in the way of work her wardrobe so far as concerned articles of external wear was well and elegantly supplied but there were other habiliments not so carefully provided what she had needed frequent repair she hated needledrudgery herself and she would bring her hose c to me in heaps to be mended a compliance of some weeks threatening to result in the establishment of an intolerable borei at last distinctly told her she must make up her mind to mend her own garments she cried on receiving this information and accused me of having ceased to be her friend but i held by my decision and let the hysterics pass as they could  notwithstanding these foibles and various others needless to mentionbut by no means of a refined or elevating characterhow pretty she was how charming she looked when she came down on a sunny sunday morning welldressed and wellhumoured robed in pale lilac silk and with her fair long curls reposing on her white shoulders sunday was a holiday which she always passed with friends resident in town and amongst these friends she speedily gave me to understand was one who would fain become something more by glimpses and hints it was shown me and by the general buoyancy of her look and manner it was ere long proved that ardent admirationperhaps genuine lovewas at her command she called her suitor isidore this however she intimated was not his real name but one by which it pleased her to baptize himhis own she hinted not being very pretty once when she had been bragging about the vehemence of isidores attachment i asked if she loved him in return  comme cela said she he is handsome and he loves me to distraction so that i am well amused ca suffit  finding that she carried the thing on longer than from her very fickle tastes i had anticipated i one day took it upon me to make serious inquiries as to whether the gentleman was such as her parents and especially her uncleon whom it appeared she was dependentwould be likely to approve she allowed that this was very doubtful as she did not believe isidore had much money  do you encourage him i asked  furieusement sometimes said she  without being certain that you will be permitted to marry him  oh how dowdyish you are i dont want to be married i am too young  but if he loves you as much as you say and yet it comes to nothing in the end he will be made miserable  of course he will break his heart i should be shocked and disappointed if he didnt  i wonder whether this m isidore is a fool said i  he is about me but he is wise in other things à ce quon dit mrs cholmondeley considers him extremely clever she says he will push his way by his talents all i know is that he does little more than sigh in my presence and that i can wind him round my little finger  wishing to get a more definite idea of this lovestricken m isidore whose position seemed to me of the least secure i requested her to favour me with a personal description but she could not describe she had neither words nor the power of putting them together so as to make graphic phrases she even seemed not properly to have noticed him nothing of his looks of the changes in his countenance had touched her heart or dwelt in her memorythat he was beau mais plutôt bel homme que joli garçon was all she could assert my patience would often have failed and my interest flagged in listening to her but for one thing all the hints she dropped all the details she gave went unconsciously to prove to my thinking that m isidores homage was offered with great delicacy and respect i informed her very plainly that i believed him much too good for her and intimated with equal plainness my impression that she was but a vain coquette she laughed shook her curls from her eyes and danced away as if i had paid her a compliment  miss ginevras schoolstudies were little better than nominal there were but three things she practised in earnest viz music singing and dancing also embroidering the fine cambric handkerchiefs which she could not afford to buy ready worked such mere trifles as lessons in history geography grammar and arithmetic she left undone or got others to do for her very much of her time was spent in visiting madame aware that her stay at school was now limited to a certain period which would not be extended whether she made progress or not allowed her great licence in this particular mrs cholmondeleyher chaperona gay fashionable lady invited her whenever she had company at her own house and sometimes took her to eveningparties at the houses of her acquaintance ginevra perfectly approved this mode of procedure it had but one inconvenience she was obliged to be well dressed and she had not money to buy variety of dresses all her thoughts turned on this difficulty her whole soul was occupied with expedients for effecting its solution it was wonderful to witness the activity of her otherwise indolent mind on this point and to see the muchdaring intrepidity to which she was spurred by a sense of necessity and the wish to shine  she begged boldly of mrs cholmondeleyboldly i say not with an air of reluctant shame but in this strain  my darling mrs c i have nothing in the world fit to wear for your party next week you must give me a bookmuslin dress and then a ceinture bleu celeste dotheres an angel will you  the darling mrs c yielded at first but finding that applications increased as they were complied with she was soon obliged like all miss fanshawes friends to oppose resistance to encroachment after a while i heard no more of mrs cholmondeleys presents but still visiting went on and the absolutely necessary dresses continued to be supplied also many little expensive etceteragloves bouquets even trinkets these things contrary to her custom and even naturefor she was not secretivewere most sedulously kept out of sight for a time but one evening when she was going to a large party for which particular care and elegance of costume were demanded she could not resist coming to my chamber to show herself in all her splendour  beautiful she looked so young so fresh and with a delicacy of skin and flexibility of shape altogether english and not found in the list of continental female charms her dress was new costly and perfect i saw at a glance that it lacked none of those finishing details which cost so much and give to the general effect such an air of tasteful completeness  i viewed her from top to toe she turned airily round that i might survey her on all sides conscious of her charms she was in her best humour her rather small blue eyes sparkled gleefully she was going to bestow on me a kiss in her schoolgirl fashion of showing her delights but i said steady let us be steady and know what we are about and find out the meaning of our magnificenceand so put her off at arms length to undergo cooler inspection  shall i do was her question  do said i there are different ways of doing and by my word i dont understand yours  but how do i look  you look well dressed  she thought the praise not warm enough and proceeded to direct attention to the various decorative points of her attire look at this parure said she the brooch the earrings the bracelets no one in the school has such a setnot madame herself  i see them all pause did m de bassompierre give you those jewels  my uncle knows nothing about them  were they presents from mrs cholmondeley  not they indeed mrs cholmondeley is a mean stingy creature she never gives me anything now  i did not choose to ask any further questions but turned abruptly away  now old crustyold diogenes these were her familiar terms for me when we disagreed what is the matter now  take yourself away i have no pleasure in looking at you or your parure  for an instant she seemed taken by surprise  what now mother wisdom i have not got into debt for itthat is not for the jewels nor the gloves nor the bouquet my dress is certainly not paid for but uncle de bassompierre will pay it in the bill he never notices items but just looks at the total and he is so rich one need not care about a few guineas more or less  will you go i want to shut the door ginevra people may tell you you are very handsome in that ballattire but in my eyes you will never look so pretty as you did in the gingham gown and plain straw bonnet you wore when i first saw you  other people have not your puritanical tastes was her angry reply and besides i see no right you have to sermonize me  certainly i have little right and you perhaps have still less to come flourishing and fluttering into my chambera mere jay in borrowed plumes i have not the least respect for your feathers miss fanshawe and especially the peacocks eyes you call a parure very pretty things if you had bought them with money which was your own and which you could well spare but not at all pretty under present circumstances  on est là pour mademoiselle fanshawe was announced by the portress and away she tripped  this semimystery of the parure was not solved till two or three days afterwards when she came to make a voluntary confession  you need not be sulky with me she began in the idea that i am running somebody papa or m de bassompierre deeply into debt i assure you nothing remains unpaid for but the few dresses i have lately had all the rest is settled  there i thought lies the mystery considering that they were not given you by mrs cholmondeley and that your own means are limited to a few shillings of which i know you to be excessively careful  ecoutez she went on drawing near and speaking in her most confidential and coaxing tone for my sulkiness was inconvenient to her she liked me to be in a talking and listening mood even if i only talked to chide and listened to rail ecoutez chère grogneuse i will tell you all how and about it and you will then see not only how right the whole thing is but how cleverly managed in the first place i must go out papa himself said that he wished me to see something of the world he particularly remarked to mrs cholmondeley that though i was a sweet creature enough i had rather a breadandbuttereating schoolgirl air of which it was his special desire that i should get rid by an introduction to society here before i make my regular début in england well then if i go out i must dress mrs cholmondeley is turned shabby and will give nothing more it would be too hard upon uncle to make him pay for all the things i need that you cant denythat agrees with your own preachments well but somebody who heard me quite by chance i assure you complaining to mrs cholmondeley of my distressed circumstances and what straits i was put to for an ornament or twosomebody far from grudging one a present was quite delighted at the idea of being permitted to offer some trifle you should have seen what a blancbec he looked when he first spoke of it how he hesitated and blushed and positively trembled from fear of a repulse  that will do miss fanshawe i suppose i am to understand that m isidore is the benefactor that it is from him you have accepted that costly parure that he supplies your bouquets and your gloves  you express yourself so disagreeably said she one hardly knows how to answer what i mean to say is that i occasionally allow isidore the pleasure and honour of expressing his homage by the offer of a trifle  it comes to the same thing now ginevra to speak the plain truth i dont very well understand these matters but i believe you are doing very wrongseriously wrong perhaps however you now feel certain that you will be able to marry m isidore your parents and uncle have given their consent and for your part you love him entirely  mais pas du tout she always had recourse to french when about to say something specially heartless and perverse je suis sa reine mais il nest pas mon roi  excuse me i must believe this language is mere nonsense and coquetry there is nothing great about you yet you are above profiting by the good nature and purse of a man to whom you feel absolute indifference you love m isidore far more than you think or will avow  no i danced with a young officer the other night whom i love a thousand times more than he i often wonder why i feel so very cold to isidore for everybody says he is handsome and other ladies admire him but somehow he bores me let me see now how it is  and she seemed to make an effort to reflect in this i encouraged her  yes i said try to get a clear idea of the state of your mind to me it seems in a great messchaotic as a ragbag  it is something in this fashion she cried out ere long the man is too romantic and devoted and he expects something more of me than i find it convenient to be he thinks i am perfect furnished with all sorts of sterling qualities and solid virtues such as i never had nor intend to have now one cant help in his presence rather trying to justify his good opinion and it does so tire one to be goody and to talk sensefor he really thinks i am sensible i am far more at my ease with you old ladyyou you dear crosspatchwho take me at my lowest and know me to be coquettish and ignorant and flirting and fickle and silly and selfish and all the other sweet things you and i have agreed to be a part of my character  this is all very well i said making a strenuous effort to preserve that gravity and severity which ran risk of being shaken by this whimsical candour but it does not alter that wretched business of the presents pack them up ginevra like a good honest girl and send them back  indeed i wont said she stoutly  then you are deceiving m isidore it stands to reason that by accepting his presents you give him to understand he will one day receive an equivalent in your regard  but he wont she interrupted he has his equivalent now in the pleasure of seeing me wear themquite enough for him he is only bourgeois  this phrase in its senseless arrogance quite cured me of the temporary weakness which had made me relax my tone and aspect she rattled on  my present business is to enjoy youth and not to think of fettering myself by promise or vow to this man or that when first i saw isidore i believed he would help me to enjoy it i believed he would be content with my being a pretty girl and that we should meet and part and flutter about like two butterflies and be happy lo and behold i find him at times as grave as a judge and deepfeeling and thoughtful bah les penseurs les hommes profonds et passionnés ne sont pas à mon goût le colonel alfred de hamal suits me far better va pour les beaux fats et les jolis fripons vive les joies et les plaisirs a bas les grandes passions et les sévères vertus  she looked for an answer to this tirade i gave none  jaime mon beau colonel she went on je naimerai jamais son rival je ne serai jamais femme de bourgeois moi  i now signified that it was imperatively necessary my apartment should be relieved of the honour of her presence she went away laughing     chapter x  dr john   madame beck was a most consistent character forbearing with all the world and tender to no part of it her own children drew her into no deviation from the even tenor of her stoic calm she was solicitous about her family vigilant for their interests and physical wellbeing but she never seemed to know the wish to take her little children upon her lap to press their rosy lips with her own to gather them in a genial embrace to shower on them softly the benignant caress the loving word  i have watched her sometimes sitting in the garden viewing the little bees afar off as they walked in a distant alley with trinette their bonne in her mien spoke care and prudence i know she often pondered anxiously what she called leur avenir but if the youngest a puny and delicate but engaging child chancing to spy her broke from its nurse and toddling down the walk came all eager and laughing and panting to clasp her knee madame would just calmly put out one hand so as to prevent inconvenient concussion from the childs sudden onset prends garde mon enfant she would say unmoved patiently permit it to stand near her a few moments and then without smile or kiss or endearing syllable rise and lead it back to trinette  her demeanour to the eldest girl was equally characteristic in another way this was a vicious child quelle peste que cette désirée quel poison que cet enfant là were the expressions dedicated to her alike in kitchen and in schoolroom amongst her other endowments she boasted an exquisite skill in the art of provocation sometimes driving her bonne and the servants almost wild she would steal to their attics open their drawers and boxes wantonly tear their best caps and soil their best shawls she would watch her opportunity to get at the buffet of the salleàmanger where she would smash articles of porcelain or glassor to the cupboard of the storeroom where she would plunder the preserves drink the sweet wine break jars and bottles and so contrive as to throw the onus of suspicion on the cook and the kitchenmaid all this when madame saw and of which when she received report her sole observation uttered with matchless serenity was  désirée a besoin dune surveillance toute particulière accordingly she kept this promising olivebranch a good deal at her side never once i believe did she tell her faithfully of her faults explain the evil of such habits and show the results which must thence ensue surveillance must work the whole cure it failed of course désirée was kept in some measure from the servants but she teased and pillaged her mamma instead whatever belonging to madames worktable or toilet she could lay her hands on she stole and hid madame saw all this but she still pretended not to see she had not rectitude of soul to confront the child with her vices when an article disappeared whose value rendered restitution necessary she would profess to think that désirée had taken it away in play and beg her to restore it désirée was not to be so cheated she had learned to bring falsehood to the aid of theft and would deny having touched the brooch ring or scissors carrying on the hollow system the mother would calmly assume an air of belief and afterwards ceaselessly watch and dog the child till she tracked her to her hidingplacessome hole in the gardenwallsome chink or cranny in garret or outhouse this done madame would send désirée out for a walk with her bonne and profit by her absence to rob the robber désirée proved herself the true daughter of her astute parent by never suffering either her countenance or manner to betray the least sign of mortification on discovering the loss  the second child fifine was said to be like its dead father certainly though the mother had given it her healthy frame her blue eye and ruddy cheek not from her was derived its moral being it was an honest gleeful little soul a passionate warmtempered bustling creature it was too and of the sort likely to blunder often into perils and difficulties one day it bethought itself to fall from top to bottom of a steep flight of stone steps and when madame hearing the noise she always heard every noise issued from the salleàmanger and picked it up she said quietlycet enfant a un os cassé  at first we hoped this was not the case it was however but too true one little plump arm hung powerless  let meess meaning me take her said madame et quon aille tout de suite chercher un fiacre  in a fiacre she promptly but with admirable coolness and selfpossession departed to fetch a surgeon  it appeared she did not find the familysurgeon at home but that mattered not she sought until she laid her hand on a substitute to her mind and brought him back with her meantime i had cut the childs sleeve from its arm undressed and put it to bed  we none of us i suppose by we i mean the bonne the cook the portress and myself all which personages were now gathered in the small and heated chamber looked very scrutinizingly at the new doctor when he came into the room i at least was taken up with endeavouring to soothe fifine whose cries for she had good lungs were appalling to hear these cries redoubled in intensity as the stranger approached her bed when he took her up let alone she cried passionately in her broken english for she spoke english as did the other children i will not you i will dr pillule  and dr pillule is my very good friend was the answer in perfect english but he is busy at a place three leagues off and i am come in his stead so now when we get a little calmer we must commence business and we will soon have that unlucky little arm bandaged and in right order  hereupon he called for a glass of eau sucrée fed her with some teaspoonfuls of the sweet liquid fifine was a frank gourmande anybody could win her heart through her palate promised her more when the operation should be over and promptly went to work some assistance being needed he demanded it of the cook a robust strongarmed woman but she the portress and the nurse instantly fled i did not like to touch that small tortured limb but thinking there was no alternative my hand was already extended to do what was requisite i was anticipated madame beck had put out her own hand hers was steady while mine trembled  ca vaudra mieux said the doctor turning from me to her  he showed wisdom in his choice mine would have been feigned stoicism forced fortitude hers was neither forced nor feigned  merci madame très bien fort bien said the operator when he had finished voilà un sangfroid bien opportun et qui vaut mille élans de sensibilité déplacée  he was pleased with her firmness she with his compliment it was likely too that his whole general appearance his voice mien and manner wrought impressions in his favour indeed when you looked well at him and when a lamp was brought infor it was evening and now waxing duskyou saw that unless madame beck had been less than woman it could not well be otherwise this young doctor he was young had no common aspect his stature looked imposingly tall in that little chamber and amidst that group of dutchmade women his profile was clear fine and expressive perhaps his eye glanced from face to face rather too vividly too quickly and too often but it had a most pleasant character and so had his mouth his chin was full cleft grecian and perfect as to his smile one could not in a hurry make up ones mind as to the descriptive epithet it merited there was something in it that pleased but something too that brought surging up into the mind all ones foibles and weak points all that could lay one open to a laugh yet fifine liked this doubtful smile and thought the owner genial much as he had hurt her she held out her hand to bid him a friendly goodnight he patted the little hand kindly and then he and madame went downstairs together she talking in her highest tide of spirits and volubility he listening with an air of goodnatured amenity dashed with that unconscious roguish archness i find it difficult to describe  i noticed that though he spoke french well he spoke english better he had too an english complexion eyes and form i noticed more as he passed me in leaving the room turning his face in my direction one momentnot to address me but to speak to madame yet so standing that i almost necessarily looked up at hima recollection which had been struggling to form in my memory since the first moment i heard his voice started up perfected this was the very gentleman to whom i had spoken at the bureau who had helped me in the matter of the trunk who had been my guide through the dark wet park listening as he passed down the long vestibule out into the street i recognised his very tread it was the same firm and equal stride i had followed under the dripping trees                                       it was to be concluded that this young surgeonphysicians first visit to the rue fossette would be the last the respectable dr pillule being expected home the next day there appeared no reason why his temporary substitute should again represent him but the fates had written their decree to the contrary  dr pillule had been summoned to see a rich old hypochondriac at the antique university town of bouquinmoisi and upon his prescribing change of air and travel as remedies he was retained to accompany the timid patient on a tour of some weeks it but remained therefore for the new doctor to continue his attendance at the rue fossette  i often saw him when he came for madame would not trust the little invalid to trinette but required me to spend much of my time in the nursery i think he was skilful fifine recovered rapidly under his care yet even her convalescence did not hasten his dismissal destiny and madame beck seemed in league and both had ruled that he should make deliberate acquaintance with the vestibule the private staircase and upper chambers of the rue fossette  no sooner did fifine emerge from his hands than désirée declared herself ill that possessed child had a genius for simulation and captivated by the attentions and indulgences of a sickroom she came to the conclusion that an illness would perfectly accommodate her tastes and took her bed accordingly she acted well and her mother still better for while the whole case was transparent to madame beck as the day she treated it with an astonishingly wellassured air of gravity and good faith  what surprised me was that dr john so the young englishman had taught fifine to call him and we all took from her the habit of addressing him by this name till it became an established custom and he was known by no other in the rue fossettethat dr john consented tacitly to adopt madames tactics and to fall in with her manoeuvres he betrayed indeed a period of comic doubt cast one or two rapid glances from the child to the mother indulged in an interval of selfconsultation but finally resigned himself with a good grace to play his part in the farce désirée eat like a raven gambolled day and night in her bed pitched tents with the sheets and blankets lounged like a turk amidst pillows and bolsters diverted herself with throwing her shoes at her bonne and grimacing at her sistersoverflowed in short with unmerited health and evil spirits only languishing when her mamma and the physician paid their diurnal visit madame beck i knew was glad at any price to have her daughter in bed out of the way of mischief but i wondered that dr john did not tire of the business  every day on this mere pretext of a motive he gave punctual attendance madame always received him with the same empressement the same sunshine for himself the same admirably counterfeited air of concern for her child dr john wrote harmless prescriptions for the patient and viewed her mother with a shrewdly sparkling eye madame caught his rallying looks without resenting themshe had too much good sense for that supple as the young doctor seemed one could not despise himthis pliant part was evidently not adopted in the design to curry favour with his employer while he liked his office at the pensionnat and lingered strangely about the rue fossette he was independent almost careless in his carriage there and yet too he was often thoughtful and preoccupied  it was not perhaps my business to observe the mystery of his bearing or search out its origin or aim but placed as i was i could hardly help it he laid himself open to my observation according to my presence in the room just that degree of notice and consequence a person of my exterior habitually expects that is to say about what is given to unobtrusive articles of furniture chairs of ordinary joiners work and carpets of no striking pattern often while waiting for madame he would muse smile watch or listen like a man who thinks himself alone i meantime was free to puzzle over his countenance and movements and wonder what could be the meaning of that peculiar interest and attachmentall mixed up with doubt and strangeness and inexplicably ruled by some presiding spellwhich wedded him to this demiconvent secluded in the builtup core of a capital he i believe never remembered that i had eyes in my head much less a brain behind them  nor would he ever have found this out but that one day while he sat in the sunshine and i was observing the colouring of his hair whiskers and complexionthe whole being of such a tone as a strong light brings out with somewhat perilous force indeed i recollect i was driven to compare his beamy head in my thoughts to that of the golden image which nebuchadnezzar the king had set up an idea new sudden and startling riveted my attention with an overmastering strength and power of attraction i know not to this day how i looked at him the force of surprise and also of conviction made me forget myself and i only recovered wonted consciousness when i saw that his notice was arrested and that it had caught my movement in a clear little oval mirror fixed in the side of the window recessby the aid of which reflector madame often secretly spied persons walking in the garden below though of so gay and sanguine a temperament he was not without a certain nervous sensitiveness which made him ill at ease under a direct inquiring gaze on surprising me thus he turned and said in a tone which though courteous had just so much dryness in it as to mark a shade of annoyance as well as to give to what was said the character of rebuke mademoiselle does not spare me i am not vain enough to fancy that it is my merits which attract her attention it must then be some defect dare i askwhat  i was confounded as the reader may suppose yet not with an irrecoverable confusion being conscious that it was from no emotion of incautious admiration nor yet in a spirit of unjustifiable inquisitiveness that i had incurred this reproof i might have cleared myself on the spot but would not i did not speak i was not in the habit of speaking to him suffering him then to think what he chose and accuse me of what he would i resumed some work i had dropped and kept my head bent over it during the remainder of his stay there is a perverse mood of the mind which is rather soothed than irritated by misconstruction and in quarters where we can never be rightly known we take pleasure i think in being consummately ignored what honest man on being casually taken for a housebreaker does not feel rather tickled than vexed at the mistake     chapter xi  the portresss cabinet   it was summer and very hot georgette the youngest of madame becks children took a fever désirée suddenly cured of her ailments was together with fifine packed off to bonnemaman in the country by way of precaution against infection medical aid was now really needed and madame choosing to ignore the return of dr pillule who had been at home a week conjured his english rival to continue his visits one or two of the pensionnaires complained of headache and in other respects seemed slightly to participate in georgettes ailment now at last i thought dr pillule must be recalled the prudent directress will never venture to permit the attendance of so young a man on the pupils  the directress was very prudent but she could also be intrepidly venturous she actually introduced dr john to the schooldivision of the premises and established him in attendance on the proud and handsome blanche de melcy and the vain flirting angélique her friend dr john i thought testified a certain gratification at this mark of confidence and if discretion of bearing could have justified the step it would by him have been amply justified here however in this land of convents and confessionals such a presence as his was not to be suffered with impunity in a pensionnat de demoiselles the school gossiped the kitchen whispered the town caught the rumour parents wrote letters and paid visits of remonstrance madame had she been weak would now have been lost a dozen rival educational houses were ready to improve this false stepif false step it wereto her ruin but madame was not weak and little jesuit though she might be yet i clapped the hands of my heart and with its voice cried brava as i watched her able bearing her skilled management her temper and her firmness on this occasion  she met the alarmed parents with a goodhumoured easy grace for nobody matched her in i know not whether to say the possession or the assumption of a certain rondeur et franchise de bonne femme which on various occasions gained the point aimed at with instant and complete success where severe gravity and serious reasoning would probably have failed  ce pauvre docteur jean she would say chuckling and rubbing joyously her fat little white hands ce cher jeune homme le meilleur créature du monde and go on to explain how she happened to be employing him for her own children who were so fond of him they would scream themselves into fits at the thought of another doctor how where she had confidence for her own she thought it natural to repose trust for others and au reste it was only the most temporary expedient in the world blanche and angélique had the migraine dr john had written a prescription voilà tout  the parents mouths were closed blanche and angélique saved her all remaining trouble by chanting loud duets in their physicians praise the other pupils echoed them unanimously declaring that when they were ill they would have dr john and nobody else and madame laughed and the parents laughed too the labassecouriens must have a large organ of philoprogenitiveness at least the indulgence of offspring is carried by them to excessive lengths the law of most households being the childrens will madame now got credit for having acted on this occasion in a spirit of motherly partiality she came off with flying colours people liked her as a directress better than ever  to this day i never fully understood why she thus risked her interest for the sake of dr john what people said of course i know well the whole housepupils teachers servants includedaffirmed that she was going to marry him so they had settled it difference of age seemed to make no obstacle in their eyes it was to be so  it must be admitted that appearances did not wholly discountenance this idea madame seemed so bent on retaining his services so oblivious of her former protégé pillule she made too such a point of personally receiving his visits and was so unfailingly cheerful blithe and benignant in her manner to him moreover she paid about this time marked attention to dress the morning dishabille the nightcap and shawl were discarded dr johns early visits always found her with auburn braids all nicely arranged silk dress trimly fitted on neat laced brodequins in lieu of slippers in short the whole toilette complete as a model and fresh as a flower i scarcely think however that her intention in this went further than just to show a very handsome man that she was not quite a plain woman and plain she was not without beauty of feature or elegance of form she pleased without youth and its gay graces she cheered one never tired of seeing her she was never monotonous or insipid or colourless or flat her unfaded hair her eye with its temperate blue light her cheek with its wholesome fruitlike bloomthese things pleased in moderation but with constancy  had she indeed floating visions of adopting dr john as a husband taking him to her wellfurnished home endowing him with her savings which were said to amount to a moderate competency and making him comfortable for the rest of his life did dr john suspect her of such visions i have met him coming out of her presence with a mischievous halfsmile about his lips and in his eyes a look as of masculine vanity elate and tickled with all his good looks and goodnature he was not perfect he must have been very imperfect if he roguishly encouraged aims he never intended to be successful but did he not intend them to be successful people said he had no money that he was wholly dependent upon his profession madamethough perhaps some fourteen years his seniorwas yet the sort of woman never to grow old never to wither never to break down they certainly were on good terms he perhaps was not in love but how many people ever do love or at least marry for love in this world we waited the end  for what he waited i do not know nor for what he watched but the peculiarity of his manner his expectant vigilant absorbed eager look never wore off it rather intensified he had never been quite within the compass of my penetration and i think he ranged farther and farther beyond it  one morning little georgette had been more feverish and consequently more peevish she was crying and would not be pacified i thought a particular draught ordered disagreed with her and i doubted whether it ought to be continued i waited impatiently for the doctors coming in order to consult him  the doorbell rang he was admitted i felt sure of this for i heard his voice addressing the portress it was his custom to mount straight to the nursery taking about three degrees of the staircase at once and coming upon us like a cheerful surprise five minutes elapsedtenand i saw and heard nothing of him what could he be doing possibly waiting in the corridor below little georgette still piped her plaintive wail appealing to me by her familiar term minnie minnie me very poorly till my heart ached i descended to ascertain why he did not come the corridor was empty whither was he vanished was he with madame in the salleàmanger impossible i had left her but a short time since dressing in her own chamber i listened three pupils were just then hard at work practising in three proximate roomsthe diningroom and the greater and lesser drawingrooms between which and the corridor there was but the portresss cabinet communicating with the salons and intended originally for a boudoir farther off at a fourth instrument in the oratory a whole class of a dozen or more were taking a singing lesson and just then joining in a barcarole i think they called it whereof i yet remember these words fraîchë brisë and venisë under these circumstances what could i hear a great deal certainly had it only been to the purpose  yes i heard a giddy treble laugh in the abovementioned little cabinet close by the door of which i stoodthat door halfunclosed a mans voice in a soft deep pleading tone uttered some words whereof i only caught the adjuration for gods sake then after a seconds pause forth issued dr john his eye full shining but not with either joy or triumph his fair english cheek highcoloured a baffled tortured anxious and yet a tender meaning on his brow  the open door served me as a screen but had i been full in his way i believe he would have passed without seeing me some mortification some strong vexation had hold of his soul or rather to write my impressions now as i received them at the time i should say some sorrow some sense of injustice i did not so much think his pride was hurt as that his affections had been woundedcruelly wounded it seemed to me but who was the torturer what being in that house had him so much in her power madame i believed to be in her chamber the room whence he had stepped was dedicated to the portresss sole use and she rosine matou an unprincipled though pretty little french grisette airy fickle dressy vain and mercenaryit was not surely to her hand he owed the ordeal through which he seemed to have passed  but while i pondered her voice clear though somewhat sharp broke out in a lightsome french song trilling through the door still ajar i glanced in doubting my senses there at the table she sat in a smart dress of jaconas rose trimming a tiny blond cap not a living thing save herself was in the room except indeed some gold fish in a glass globe some flowers in pots and a broad july sunbeam  here was a problem but i must go upstairs to ask about the medicine  dr john sat in a chair at georgettes bedside madame stood before him the little patient had been examined and soothed and now lay composed in her crib madame beck as i entered was discussing the physicians own health remarking on some real or fancied change in his looks charging him with overwork and recommending rest and change of air he listened goodnaturedly but with laughing indifference telling her that she was trop bonne and that he felt perfectly well madame appealed to medr john following her movement with a slow glance which seemed to express languid surprise at reference being made to a quarter so insignificant  what do you think miss lucie asked madame is he not paler and thinner  it was very seldom that i uttered more than monosyllables in dr johns presence he was the kind of person with whom i was likely ever to remain the neutral passive thing he thought me now however i took licence to answer in a phrase and a phrase i purposely made quite significant  he looks ill at this moment but perhaps it is owing to some temporary cause dr john may have been vexed or harassed i cannot tell how he took this speech as i never sought his face for information georgette here began to ask me in her broken english if she might have a glass of eau sucrée i answered her in english for the first time i fancy he noticed that i spoke his language hitherto he had always taken me for a foreigner addressing me as mademoiselle and giving in french the requisite directions about the childrens treatment he seemed on the point of making a remark but thinking better of it held his tongue  madame recommenced advising him he shook his head laughing rose and bid her goodmorning with courtesy but still with the regardless air of one whom too much unsolicited attention was surfeiting and spoiling  when he was gone madame dropped into the chair he had just left she rested her chin in her hand all that was animated and amiable vanished from her face she looked stony and stern almost mortified and morose she sighed a single but a deep sigh a loud bell rang for morningschool she got up as she passed a dressingtable with a glass upon it she looked at her reflected image one single white hair streaked her nutbrown tresses she plucked it out with a shudder in the full summer daylight her face though it still had the colour could plainly be seen to have lost the texture of youth and then where were youths contours ah madame wise as you were even you knew weakness never had i pitied madame before but my heart softened towards her when she turned darkly from the glass a calamity had come upon her that hag disappointment was greeting her with a grisly allhail and her soul rejected the intimacy  but rosine my bewilderment there surpasses description i embraced five opportunities of passing her cabinet that day with a view to contemplating her charms and finding out the secret of their influence she was pretty young and wore a wellmade dress all very good points and i suppose amply sufficient to account in any philosophic mind for any amount of agony and distraction in a young man like dr john still i could not help forming half a wish that the said doctor were my brother or at least that he had a sister or a mother who would kindly sermonize him i say half a wish i broke it and flung it away before it became a whole one discovering in good time its exquisite folly somebody i argued might as well sermonize madame about her young physician and what good would that do  i believe madame sermonized herself she did not behave weakly or make herself in any shape ridiculous it is true she had neither strong feelings to overcome nor tender feelings by which to be miserably pained it is true likewise that she had an important avocation a real business to fill her time divert her thoughts and divide her interest it is especially true that she possessed a genuine good sense which is not given to all women nor to all men and by dint of these combined advantages she behaved wiselyshe behaved well brava once more madame beck i saw you matched against an apollyon of a predilection you fought a good fight and you overcame     chapter xii  the casket   behind the house at the rue fossette there was a gardenlarge considering that it lay in the heart of a city and to my recollection at this day it seems pleasant but time like distance lends to certain scenes an influence so softening and where all is stone around blank wall and hot pavement how precious seems one shrub how lovely an enclosed and planted spot of ground  there went a tradition that madame becks house had in old days been a convent that in years gone byhow long gone by i cannot tell but i think some centuriesbefore the city had overspread this quarter and when it was tilled ground and avenue and such deep and leafy seclusion as ought to embosom a religious housethat something had happened on this site which rousing fear and inflicting horror had left to the place the inheritance of a ghoststory a vague tale went of a black and white nun sometimes on some night or nights of the year seen in some part of this vicinage the ghost must have been built out some ages ago for there were houses all round now but certain conventrelics in the shape of old and huge fruittrees yet consecrated the spot and at the foot of onea methuselah of a peartree dead all but a few boughs which still faithfully renewed their perfumed snow in spring and their honeysweet pendants in autumnyou saw in scraping away the mossy earth between the halfbared roots a glimpse of slab smooth hard and black the legend went unconfirmed and unaccredited but still propagated that this was the portal of a vault imprisoning deep beneath that ground on whose surface grass grew and flowers bloomed the bones of a girl whom a monkish conclave of the drear middle ages had here buried alive for some sin against her vow her shadow it was that tremblers had feared through long generations after her poor frame was dust her black robe and white veil that for timid eyes moonlight and shade had mocked as they fluctuated in the nightwind through the gardenthicket  independently of romantic rubbish however that old garden had its charms on summer mornings i used to rise early to enjoy them alone on summer evenings to linger solitary to keep tryste with the rising moon or taste one kiss of the evening breeze or fancy rather than feel the freshness of dew descending the turf was verdant the gravelled walks were white sunbright nasturtiums clustered beautiful about the roots of the doddered orchard giants there was a large berceau above which spread the shade of an acacia there was a smaller more sequestered bower nestled in the vines which ran all along a high and grey wall and gathered their tendrils in a knot of beauty and hung their clusters in loving profusion about the favoured spot where jasmine and ivy met and married them  doubtless at high noon in the broad vulgar middle of the day when madame becks large school turned out rampant and externes and pensionnaires were spread abroad vying with the denizens of the boys college close at hand in the brazen exercise of their lungs and limbsdoubtless then the garden was a trite troddendown place enough but at sunset or the hour of salut when the externes were gone home and the boarders quiet at their studies pleasant was it then to stray down the peaceful alleys and hear the bells of st jean baptiste peal out with their sweet soft exalted sound  i was walking thus one evening and had been detained farther within the verge of twilight than usual by the stilldeepening calm the mellow coolness the fragrant breathing with which flowers no sunshine could win now answered the persuasion of the dew i saw by a light in the oratory window that the catholic household were then gathered to evening prayera rite from attendance on which i now and then as a protestant exempted myself  one moment longer whispered solitude and the summer moon stay with us all is truly quiet now for another quarter of an hour your presence will not be missed the days heat and bustle have tired you enjoy these precious minutes  the windowless backs of houses built in this garden and in particular the whole of one side was skirted by the rear of a long line of premisesbeing the boardinghouses of the neighbouring college this rear however was all blank stone with the exception of certain attic loopholes high up opening from the sleepingrooms of the womenservants and also one casement in a lower story said to mark the chamber or study of a master but though thus secure an alley which ran parallel with the very high wall on that side the garden was forbidden to be entered by the pupils it was called indeed lallée défendue and any girl setting foot there would have rendered herself liable to as severe a penalty as the mild rules of madame becks establishment permitted teachers might indeed go there with impunity but as the walk was narrow and the neglected shrubs were grown very thick and close on each side weaving overhead a roof of branch and leaf which the suns rays penetrated but in rare chequers this alley was seldom entered even during day and after dusk was carefully shunned  from the first i was tempted to make an exception to this rule of avoidance the seclusion the very gloom of the walk attracted me for a long time the fear of seeming singular scared me away but by degrees as people became accustomed to me and my habits and to such shades of peculiarity as were engrained in my natureshades certainly not striking enough to interest and perhaps not prominent enough to offend but born in and with me and no more to be parted with than my identityby slow degrees i became a frequenter of this strait and narrow path i made myself gardener of some tintless flowers that grew between its closelyranked shrubs i cleared away the relics of past autumns choking up a rustic seat at the far end borrowing of goton the cuisinière a pail of water and a scrubbingbrush i made this seat clean madame saw me at work and smiled approbation whether sincerely or not i dont know but she seemed sincere  voyezvous cried she comme elle est propre cette demoiselle lucie vous aimez done cette allée meess yes i said it is quiet and shady  cest juste cried she with an air of bonté and she kindly recommended me to confine myself to it as much as i chose saying that as i was not charged with the surveillance i need not trouble myself to walk with the pupils only i might permit her children to come there to talk english with me  on the night in question i was sitting on the hidden seat reclaimed from fungi and mould listening to what seemed the faroff sounds of the city far off in truth they were not this school was in the citys centre hence it was but five minutes walk to the park scarce ten to buildings of palatial splendour quite near were wide streets brightly lit teeming at this moment with life carriages were rolling through them to balls or to the opera the same hour which tolled curfew for our convent which extinguished each lamp and dropped the curtain round each couch rang for the gay city about us the summons to festal enjoyment of this contrast i thought not however gay instincts my nature had few ball or opera i had never seen and though often i had heard them described and even wished to see them it was not the wish of one who hopes to partake a pleasure if she could only reach itwho feels fitted to shine in some bright distant sphere could she but thither win her way it was no yearning to attain no hunger to taste only the calm desire to look on a new thing  a moon was in the sky not a full moon but a young crescent i saw her through a space in the boughs overhead she and the stars visible beside her were no strangers where all else was strange my childhood knew them i had seen that golden sign with the dark globe in its curve leaning back on azure beside an old thorn at the top of an old field in old england in long past days just as it now leaned back beside a stately spire in this continental capital  oh my childhood i had feelings passive as i lived little as i spoke cold as i looked when i thought of past days i could feel about the present it was better to be stoical about the futuresuch a future as mineto be dead and in catalepsy and a dead trance i studiously held the quick of my nature  at that time i well remember whatever could excitecertain accidents of the weather for instance were almost dreaded by me because they woke the being i was always lulling and stirred up a craving cry i could not satisfy one night a thunderstorm broke a sort of hurricane shook us in our beds the catholics rose in panic and prayed to their saints as for me the tempest took hold of me with tyranny i was roughly roused and obliged to live i got up and dressed myself and creeping outside the casement close by my bed sat on its ledge with my feet on the roof of a lower adjoining building it was wet it was wild it was pitchdark within the dormitory they gathered round the nightlamp in consternation praying loud i could not go in too resistless was the delight of staying with the wild hour black and full of thunder pealing out such an ode as language never delivered to mantoo terribly glorious the spectacle of clouds split and pierced by white and blinding bolts  i did long achingly then and for four and twenty hours afterwards for something to fetch me out of my present existence and lead me upwards and onwards this longing and all of a similar kind it was necessary to knock on the head which i did figuratively after the manner of jael to sisera driving a nail through their temples unlike sisera they did not die they were but transiently stunned and at intervals would turn on the nail with a rebellious wrench then did the temples bleed and the brain thrill to its core  tonight i was not so mutinous nor so miserable my sisera lay quiet in the tent slumbering and if his pain ached through his slumbers something like an angelthe idealknelt near dropping balm on the soothed temples holding before the sealed eyes a magic glass of which the sweet solemn visions were repeated in dreams and shedding a reflex from her moonlight wings and robe over the transfixed sleeper over the tent threshold over all the landscape lying without jael the stern woman sat apart relenting somewhat over her captive but more prone to dwell on the faithful expectation of heber coming home by which words i mean that the cool peace and dewy sweetness of the night filled me with a mood of hope not hope on any definite point but a general sense of encouragement and heartease  should not such a mood so sweet so tranquil so unwonted have been the harbinger of good alas no good came of it i presently the rude real burst coarsely inall evil grovelling and repellent as she too often is  amid the intense stillness of that pile of stone overlooking the walk the trees the high wall i heard a sound a casement all the windows here are casements opening on hinges creaked ere i had time to look up and mark where in which story or by whom unclosed a tree overhead shook as if struck by a missile some object dropped prone at my feet  nine was striking by st jean baptistes clock day was fading but it was not dark the crescent moon aided little but the deep gilding of that point in heaven where the sun beamed last and the crystalline clearness of a wide space above sustained the summer twilight even in my dark walk i could by approaching an opening have managed to read print of a small type easy was it to see then that the missile was a box a small box of white and coloured ivory its loose lid opened in my hand violets lay within violets smothering a closely folded bit of pink paper a note superscribed pour la robe grise i wore indeed a dress of french grey  good was this a billetdoux a thing i had heard of but hitherto had not had the honour of seeing or handling was it this sort of commodity i held between my finger and thumb at this moment  scarcely i did not dream it for a moment suitor or admirer my very thoughts had not conceived all the teachers had dreams of some lover one but she was naturally of a credulous turn believed in a future husband all the pupils above fourteen knew of some prospective bridegroom two or three were already affianced by their parents and had been so from childhood but into the realm of feelings and hopes which such prospects open my speculations far less my presumptions had never once had warrant to intrude if the other teachers went into town or took a walk on the boulevards or only attended mass they were very certain according to the accounts brought back to meet with some individual of the opposite sex whose rapt earnest gaze assured them of their power to strike and to attract i cant say that my experience tallied with theirs in this respect i went to church and i took walks and am very well convinced that nobody minded me there was not a girl or woman in the rue fossette who could not and did not testify to having received an admiring beam from our young doctors blue eyes at one time or other i am obliged however humbling it may sound to except myself as far as i was concerned those blue eyes were guiltless and calm as the sky to whose tint theirs seemed akin so it came to pass that i heard the others talk wondered often at their gaiety security and selfsatisfaction but did not trouble myself to look up and gaze along the path they seemed so certain of treading this then was no billetdoux and it was in settled conviction to the contrary that i quietly opened it thus it rani translate  angel of my dreams a thousand thousand thanks for the promise kept scarcely did i venture to hope its fulfilment i believed you indeed to be

person addressed in this choice document than to the writer thereof perhaps it was from the fiancé of one of the engaged pupils and in that case there was no great harm done or intendedonly a small irregularity several of the girls the majority indeed had brothers or cousins at the neighbouring college but la robe grise le chapeau de paille here surely was a cluea very confusing one the strawhat was an ordinary garden headscreen common to a score besides myself the grey dress hardly gave more definite indication madame beck herself ordinarily wore a grey dress just now another teacher and three of the pensionnaires had had grey dresses purchased of the same shade and fabric as mine it was a sort of everyday wear which happened at that time to be in vogue  meanwhile as i pondered i knew i must go in lights moving in the dormitory announced that prayers were over and the pupils going to bed another halfhour and all doors would be lockedall lights extinguished the front door yet stood

admitted stood with her two minutes in parley there seemed a demur a delay rosine came to the garden door lamp in hand she stood on the steps lifting her lamp looking round vaguely  quel conte she cried with a coquettish laugh personne ny a été  let me pass pleaded a voice i knew i ask but five minutes and a familiar shape tall and grand as we of the rue fossette all thought it issued from the house and strode down amongst the beds and walks it was sacrilegethe intrusion of a man into that spot at that hour but he knew himself privileged and perhaps he trusted to the friendly night he wandered down the alleys looking on this side and on thathe was lost in the shrubs trampling flowers and breaking branches in his searchhe penetrated at last the forbidden walk there i met him like some ghost i suppose  dr john it is found  he did not ask by whom for with his quick eye he perceived that i held it in my hand  do not betray her he said looking at me as if i were indeed a dragon  were i ever so disposed to treachery i cannot betray what i do not know was my answer read the note and you will see how little it reveals  perhaps you have read it i thought to myself and yet i could not believe he wrote it that could hardly be his style besides i was fool enough to think there would be a degree of hardship in his calling me such names his own look vindicated him he grew hot and coloured as he read  this is indeed too much this is cruel this is humiliating were the words that fell from him  i thought it was cruel when i saw his countenance so moved no matter whether he was to blame or not somebody it seemed to me must be more to blame  what shall you do about it he inquired of me shall you tell madame beck what you have found and cause a stiran esclandre  i thought i ought to tell and said so adding that i did not believe there would be either stir or esclandre madame was much too prudent to make a noise about an affair of that sort connected with her establishment  he stood looking down and meditating he was both too proud and too honourable to entreat my secresy on a point which duty evidently commanded me to communicate i wished to do right yet loathed to grieve or injure him just then rosine glanced out through the open door she could not see us though between the trees i could plainly see her her dress was grey like mine this circumstance taken in connection with prior transactions suggested to me that perhaps the case however deplorable was one in which i was under no obligation whatever to concern myself accordingly i saidif you can assure me that none of madame becks pupils are implicated in this business i shall be very happy to stand aloof from all interference take the casket the bouquet and the billet for my part i gladly forget the whole affair  look there he whispered suddenly as his hand closed on what i offered and at the same time he pointed through the boughs  i looked behold madame in shawl wrappinggown and slippers softly descending the steps and stealing like a cat round the garden in two minutes she would have been upon dr john if she were like a cat however he quite as much resembled a leopard nothing could be lighter than his tread when he chose he watched and as she turned a corner he took the garden at two noiseless bounds she reappeared and he was gone rosine helped him instantly interposing the door between him and his huntress i too might have got away but i preferred to meet madame openly  though it was my frequent and wellknown custom to spend twilight in the garden yet never till now had i remained so late full sure was i that madame had missedwas come in search of me and designed now to pounce on the defaulter unawares i expected a reprimand no madame was all goodness she tendered not even a remonstrance she testified no shade of surprise with that consummate tact of hers in which i believe she was never surpassed by living thing she even professed merely to have issued forth to taste la brise du soir  quelle belle nuit cried she looking up at the starsthe moon was now gone down behind the broad tower of jean baptiste quil fait bon que lair est frais  and instead of sending me in she detained me to take a few turns with her down the principal alley when at last we both reentered she leaned affably on my shoulder by way of support in mounting the frontdoor steps at parting her cheek was presented to my lips and bon soir my bonne amie dormez bien was her kindly adieu for the night  i caught myself smiling as i lay awake and thoughtful on my couchsmiling at madame the unction the suavity of her behaviour offered for one who knew her a sure token that suspicion of some kind was busy in her brain from some aperture or summit of observation through parted bough or open window she had doubtless caught a glimpse remote or near deceptive or instructive of that nights transactions finely accomplished as she was in the art of surveillance it was next to impossible that a casket could be thrown into her garden or an interloper could cross her walks to seek it without that she in shaken branch passing shade unwonted footfall or stilly murmur and though dr john had spoken very low in the few words he dropped me yet the hum of his mans voice pervaded i thought the whole conventual groundwithout i say that she should have caught intimation of things extraordinary transpiring on her premises what things she might by no means see or at that time be able to discover but a delicious little ravelled plot lay tempting her to disentanglement and in the midst folded round and round in cobwebs had she not secured meess lucie clumsily involved like the foolish fly she was     chapter xiii  a sneeze out of season   i had occasion to smilenay to laugh at madame again within the space of four and twenty hours after the little scene treated of in the last chapter  villette owns a climate as variable though not so humid as that of any english town a night of high wind followed upon that soft sunset and all the next day was one of dry stormdark beclouded yet rainlessthe streets were dim with sand and dust whirled from the boulevards i know not that even lovely weather would have tempted me to spend the eveningtime of study and recreation where i had spent it yesterday my alley and indeed all the walks and shrubs in the garden had acquired a new but not a pleasant interest their seclusion was now become precarious their calminsecure that casement which rained billets had vulgarized the once dear nook it overlooked and elsewhere the eyes of the flowers had gained vision and the knots in the treeboles listened like secret ears some plants there were indeed trodden down by dr john in his search and his hasty and heedless progress which i wished to prop up water and revive some footmarks too he had left on the beds but these in spite of the strong wind i found a moments leisure to efface very early in the morning ere common eyes had discovered them with a pensive sort of content i sat down to my desk and my german while the pupils settled to their evening lessons and the other teachers took up their needlework  the scene of the etude du soir was always the refectory a much smaller apartment than any of the three classes or schoolrooms for here none save the boarders were ever admitted and these numbered only a score two lamps hung from the ceiling over the two tables these were lit at dusk and their kindling was the signal for schoolbooks being set aside a grave demeanour assumed general silence enforced and then commenced la lecture pieuse this said lecture pieuse was i soon found mainly designed as a wholesome mortification of the intellect a useful humiliation of the reason and such a dose for common sense as she might digest at her leisure and thrive on as she best could  the book brought out it was never changed but when finished recommenced was a venerable volume old as the hillsgrey as the hôtel de ville  i would have given two francs for the chance of getting that book once into my bands turning over the sacred yellow leaves ascertaining the title and perusing with my own eyes the enormous figments which as an unworthy heretic it was only permitted me to drink in with my bewildered ears this book contained legends of the saints good god i speak the words reverently what legends they were what gasconading rascals those saints must have been if they first boasted these exploits or invented these miracles these legends however were no more than monkish extravagances over which one laughed inwardly there were besides priestly matters and the priestcraft of the book was far worse than its monkery the ears burned on each side of my head as i listened perforce to tales of moral martyrdom inflicted by rome the dread boasts of confessors who had wickedly abused their office trampling to deep degradation highborn ladies making of countesses and princesses the most tormented slaves under the sun stories like that of conrad and elizabeth of hungary recurred again and again with all its dreadful viciousness sickening tyranny and black impiety tales that were nightmares of oppression privation and agony  i sat out this lecture pieuse for some nights as well as i could and as quietly too only once breaking off the points of my scissors by involuntarily sticking them somewhat deep in the wormeaten board of the table before me but at last it made me so burning hot and my temples and my heart and my wrist throbbed so fast and my sleep afterwards was so broken with excitement that i could sit no longer prudence recommended henceforward a swift clearance of my person from the place the moment that guilty old book was brought out no mause headrigg ever felt a stronger call to take up her testimony against sergeant bothwell than ito speak my mind in this matter of the popish lecture pieuse however i did manage somehow to curb and rein in and though always as soon as rosine came to light the lamps i shot from the room quickly yet also i did it quietly seizing that vantage moment given by the little bustle before the dead silence and vanishing whilst the boarders put their books away  when i vanishedit was into darkness candles were not allowed to be carried about and the teacher who forsook the refectory had only the unlit hall schoolroom or bedroom as a refuge in winter i sought the long classes and paced them fast to keep myself warmfortunate if the moon shone and if there were only stars soon reconciled to their dim gleam or even to the total eclipse of their absence in summer it was never quite dark and then i went upstairs to my own quarter of the long dormitory opened my own casement that chamber was lit by five casements large as great doors and leaning out looked forth upon the city beyond the garden and listened to bandmusic from the park or the palacesquare thinking meantime my own thoughts living my own life in my own still shadowworld  this evening fugitive as usual before the pope and his works i mounted the staircase approached the dormitory and quietly opened the door which was always kept carefully shut and which like every other door in this house revolved noiselessly on welloiled hinges before i saw i felt that life was in the great room usually void not that there was either stir or breath or rustle of sound but vacuum lacked solitude was not at home all the white bedsthe lits dange as they were poetically termedlay visible at a glance all were empty no sleeper reposed therein the sound of a drawer cautiously slid out struck my ear stepping a little to one side my vision took a free range unimpeded by falling curtains i now commanded my own bed and my own toilet with a locked workbox upon it and locked drawers underneath  very good a dumpy motherly little body in decent shawl and the cleanest of possible nightcaps stood before this toilet hard at work apparently doing me the kindness of tidying out the meuble open stood the lid of the workbox open the top drawer duly and impartially was each succeeding drawer opened in turn not an article of their contents but was lifted and unfolded not a paper but was glanced over not a little box but was unlidded and beautiful was the adroitness exemplary the care with which the search was accomplished madame wrought at it like a true star unhasting yet unresting i will not deny that it was with a secret glee i watched her had i been a gentleman i believe madame would have found favour in my eyes she was so handy neat thorough in all she did some peoples movements provoke the soul by their loose awkwardness herssatisfied by their trim compactness i stood in short fascinated but it was necessary to make an effort to break this spell a retreat must be beaten the searcher might have turned and caught me there would have been nothing for it then but a scene and she and i would have had to come all at once with a sudden clash to a thorough knowledge of each other down would have gone conventionalities away swept disguises and i should have looked into her eyes and she into minewe should have known that we could work together no more and parted in this life for ever  where was the use of tempting such a catastrophe i was not angry and had no wish in the world to leave her i could hardly get another employer whose yoke would be so light and so easy of carriage and truly i liked madame for her capital sense whatever i might think of her principles as to her system it did me no harm she might work me with it to her hearts content nothing would come of the operation loverless and inexpectant of love i was as safe from spies in my heartpoverty as the beggar from thieves in his destitution of purse i turned then and fled descending the stairs with progress as swift and soundless as that of the spider which at the same instant ran down the bannister  how i laughed when i reached the schoolroom i knew now she had certainly seen dr john in the garden i knew what her thoughts were the spectacle of a suspicious nature so far misled by its own inventions tickled me much yet as the laugh died a kind of wrath smote me and then bitterness followed it was the rock struck and meribahs waters gushing out i never had felt so strange and contradictory an inward tumult as i felt for an hour that evening soreness and laughter and fire and grief shared my heart between them i cried hot tears not because madame mistrusted mei did not care twopence for her mistrustbut for other reasons complicated disquieting thoughts broke up the whole repose of my nature however that turmoil subsided next day i was again lucy snowe  on revisiting my drawers i found them all securely locked the closest subsequent examination could not discover change or apparent disturbance in the position of one object my few dresses were folded as i had left them a certain little bunch of white violets that had once been silently presented to me by a stranger a stranger to me for we had never exchanged words and which i had dried and kept for its sweet perfume between the folds of my best dress lay there unstirred my black silk scarf my lace chemisette and collars were unrumpled had she creased one solitary article i own i should have felt much greater difficulty in forgiving her but finding all straight and orderly i said let bygones be bygones i am unharmed why should i bear malice                                       a thing there was which puzzled myself and i sought in my brain a key to that riddle almost as sedulously as madame had sought a guide to useful knowledge in my toilet drawers how was it that dr john if he had not been accessory to the dropping of that casket into the garden should have known that it was dropped and appeared so promptly on the spot to seek it so strong was the wish to clear up this point that i began to entertain this daring suggestion why may i not in case i should ever have the opportunity ask dr john himself to explain this coincidence  and so long as dr john was absent i really believed i had courage to test him with such a question  little georgette was now convalescent and her physician accordingly made his visits very rare indeed he would have ceased them altogether had not madame insisted on his giving an occasional call till the child should be quite well  she came into the nursery one evening just after i had listened to georgettes lisped and broken prayer and had put her to bed taking the little ones hand she said cette enfant a toujours un peu de fièvre and presently afterwards looking at me with a quicker glance than was habitual to her quiet eye le docteur john latil vue dernièrement non nestce pas  of course she knew this better than any other person in the house well she continued i am going out pour faire quelques courses en fiacre i shall call on dr john and send him to the child i will that he sees her this evening her cheeks are flushed her pulse is quick you will receive himfor my part i shall be from home  now the child was well enough only warm with the warmth of july it was scarcely less needful to send for a priest to administer extreme unction than for a doctor to prescribe a dose also madame rarely made courses as she called them in the evening moreover this was the first time she had chosen to absent herself on the occasion of a visit from dr john the whole arrangement indicated some plan this i saw but without the least anxiety ha ha madame laughed lightheart the beggar your crafty wits are on the wrong tack  she departed attired very smartly in a shawl of price and a certain chapeau vert tendrehazardous as to its tint for any complexion less fresh than her own but to her not unbecoming i wondered what she intended whether she really would send dr john or not or whether indeed he would come he might be engaged  madame had charged me not to let georgette sleep till the doctor came i had therefore sufficient occupation in telling her nursery tales and palavering the little language for her benefit i affected georgette she was a sensitive and a loving child to hold her in my lap or carry her in my arms was to me a treat tonight she would have me lay my head on the pillow of her crib she even put her little arms round my neck her clasp and the nestling action with which she pressed her cheek to mine made me almost cry with a tender pain feeling of no kind abounded in that house this pure little drop from a pure little source was too sweet it penetrated deep and subdued the heart and sent a gush to the eyes half an hour or an hour passed georgette murmured in her soft lisp that she was growing sleepy and you shall sleep thought i malgré maman and médecin if they are not here in ten minutes  hark there was the ring and there the tread astonishing the staircase by the fleetness with which it left the steps behind rosine introduced dr john and with a freedom of manner not altogether peculiar to herself but characteristic of the domestics of villette generally she stayed to hear what he had to say madames presence would have awed her back to her own realm of the vestibule and the cabinetfor mine or that of any other teacher or pupil she cared not a jot smart trim and pert she stood a hand in each pocket of her gay grisette apron eyeing dr john with no more fear or shyness than if he had been a picture instead of a living gentleman  le marmot na rien nestce pas said she indicating georgette with a jerk of her chin  pas beaucoup was the answer as the doctor hastily scribbled with his pencil some harmless prescription  eh bien pursued rosine approaching him quite near while he put up his pencil and the boxdid you get it monsieur went off like a coupdevent the other night i had not time to ask him  i found it yes  and who threw it then continued rosine speaking quite freely the very words i should so much have wished to say but had no address or courage to bring it out how short some people make the road to a point which for others seems unattainable  that may be my secret rejoined dr john briefly but with no sort of hauteur he seemed quite to understand the rosine or grisette character  mais enfin continued she nothing abashed monsieur knew it was thrown since he came to seek ithow did he know  i was attending a little patient in the college near said he and saw it dropped out of his chamber window and so came to pick it up  how simple the whole explanation the note had alluded to a physician as then examining gustave  ah ça pursued rosine il ny a donc rien làdessous pas de mystère pas damourette par exemple  pas plus que sur ma main responded the doctor showing his palm  quel dommage responded the grisette et moià qui tout cela commençait à donner des idées  vraiment vous en êtes pour vos frais was the doctors cool rejoinder  she pouted the doctor could not help laughing at the sort of moue she made when he laughed he had something peculiarly goodnatured and genial in his look i saw his hand incline to his pocket  how many times have you opened the door for me within this last month he asked  monsieur ought to have kept count of that said rosine quite readily  as if i had not something better to do rejoined he but i saw him give her a piece of gold which she took unscrupulously and then danced off to answer the doorbell ringing just now every five minutes as the various servants came to fetch the halfboarders  the reader must not think too hardly of rosine on the whole she was not a bad sort of person and had no idea there could be any disgrace in grasping at whatever she could get or any effrontery in chattering like a pie to the best gentleman in christendom  i had learnt something from the above scene besides what concerned the ivory box viz that not on the robe de jaconas pink or grey nor yet on the frilled and pocketed apron lay the blame of breaking dr johns heart these items of array were obviously guiltless as georgettes little blue tunic so much the better but who then was the culprit what was the groundwhat the originwhat the perfect explanation of the whole business some points had been cleared but how many yet remained obscure as night  however i said to myself it is no affair of yours and turning from the face on which i had been unconsciously dwelling with a questioning gaze i looked through the window which commanded the garden below dr john meantime standing by the bedside was slowly drawing on his gloves and watching his little patient as her eyes closed and her rosy lips parted in coming sleep i waited till he should depart as usual with a quick bow and scarce articulate goodnight just as he took his hat my eyes fixed on the tall houses bounding the garden saw the one lattice already commemorated cautiously open forth from the aperture projected a hand and a white handkerchief both waved i know not whether the signal was answered from some viewless quarter of our own dwelling but immediately after there fluttered from the lattice a falling object white and lightbillet the second of course  there i ejaculated involuntarily  where asked dr john with energy making direct for the window what is it  they have gone and done it again was my reply a handkerchief waved and something fell and i pointed to the lattice now closed and looking hypocritically blank  go at once pick it up and bring it here was his prompt direction adding nobody will take notice of you i should be seen  straight i went after some little search i found a folded paper lodged on the lower branch of a shrub i seized and brought it direct to dr john this time i believe not even rosine saw me  he instantly tore the billet into small pieces without reading it it is not in the least her fault you must remember he said looking at me  whose fault i asked who is it  you dont yet know then  not in the least  have you no guess  none  if i knew you better i might be tempted to risk some confidence and thus secure you as guardian over a most innocent and excellent but somewhat inexperienced being  as a duenna i asked  yes said he abstractedly what snares are round her he added musingly and now certainly for the first time he examined my face anxious doubtless to see if any kindly expression there would warrant him in recommending to my care and indulgence some ethereal creature against whom powers of darkness were plotting i felt no particular vocation to undertake the surveillance of ethereal creatures but recalling the scene at the bureau it seemed to me that i owed him a good turn if i could help him then i would and it lay not with me to decide how with as little reluctance as might be i intimated that i was willing to do what i could towards taking care of any person in whom he might be interested  i am no farther interested than as a spectator said he with a modesty admirable as i thought to witness i happen to be acquainted with the rather worthless character of the person who from the house opposite has now twice invaded the sanctity of this place i have also met in society the object at whom these vulgar attempts are aimed her exquisite superiority and innate refinement ought one would think to scare impertinence from her very idea it is not so however and innocent unsuspicious as she is i would guard her from evil if i could in person however i can do nothing i cannot come near herhe paused  well i am willing to help you said i only tell me how and busily in my own mind i ran over the list of our inmates seeking this paragon this pearl of great price this gem without flaw it must be madame i concluded she only amongst us all has the art even to seem superior but as to being unsuspicious inexperienced c dr john need not distract himself about that however this is just his whim and i will not contradict him he shall be humoured his angel shall be an angel  just notify the quarter to which my care is to be directed i continued gravely chuckling however to myself over the thought of being set to chaperon madame beck or any of her pupils now dr john had a fine set of nerves and he at once felt by instinct what no more coarsely constituted mind would have detected namely that i was a little amused at him the colour rose to his cheek with half a smile he turned and took his hathe was going my heart smote me  i willi will help you said i eagerly i will do what you wish i will watch over your angel i will take care of her only tell me who she is  but you must know said he then with earnestness yet speaking very low so spotless so good so unspeakably beautiful impossible that one house should contain two like her i allude of course  here the latch of madame becks chamberdoor opening into the nursery gave a sudden click as if the hand holding it had been slightly convulsed there was the suppressed explosion of an irrepressible sneeze these little accidents will happen to the best of us madameexcellent woman was then on duty she had come home quietly stolen upstairs on tiptoe she was in her chamber if she had not sneezed she would have heard all and so should i but that unlucky sternutation routed dr john while he stood aghast she came forward alert composed in the best yet most tranquil spirits no novice to her habits but would have thought she had just come in and scouted the idea of her ear having been glued to the keyhole for at least ten minutes she affected to sneeze again declared she was enrhumée and then proceeded volubly to recount her courses en fiacre the prayerbell rang and i left her with the doctor     chapter xiv  the fÊte   as soon as georgette was well madame sent her away into the country i was sorry i loved the child and her loss made me poorer than before but i must not complain i lived in a house full of robust life i might have had companions and i chose solitude each of the teachers in turn made me overtures of special intimacy i tried them all one i found to be an honest woman but a narrow thinker a coarse feeler and an egotist the second was a parisienne externally refinedat heart corruptwithout a creed without a principle without an affection having penetrated the outward crust of decorum in this character you found a slough beneath she had a wonderful passion for presents and in this point the third teachera person otherwise characterless and insignificantclosely resembled her this lastnamed had also one other distinctive propertythat of avarice in her reigned the love of money for its own sake the sight of a piece of gold would bring into her eyes a green glisten singular to witness she once as a mark of high favour took me upstairs and opening a secret door showed me a hoarda mass of coarse large coinabout fifteen guineas in fivefranc pieces she loved this hoard as a bird loves its eggs these were her savings she would come and talk to me about them with an infatuated and persevering dotage strange to behold in a person not yet twentyfive  the parisienne on the other hand was prodigal and profligate in disposition that is as to action i do not know that latter quality showed its snakehead to me but once peeping out very cautiously a curious kind of reptile it seemed judging from the glimpse i got its novelty whetted my curiosity if it would have come out boldly perhaps i might philosophically have stood my ground and coolly surveyed the long thing from forked tongue to scaly tailtip but it merely rustled in the leaves of a bad novel and on encountering a hasty and illadvised demonstration of wrath recoiled and vanished hissing she hated me from that day  this parisienne was always in debt her salary being anticipated not only in dress but in perfumes cosmetics confectionery and condiments what a cold callous epicure she was in all things i see her now thin in face and figure sallow in complexion regular in features with perfect teeth lips like a thread a large prominent chin a wellopened but frozen eye of light at once craving and ingrate she mortally hated work and loved what she called pleasure being an insipid heartless brainless dissipation of time  madame beck knew this womans character perfectly well she once talked to me about her with an odd mixture of discrimination indifference and antipathy i asked why she kept her in the establishment she answered plainly because it suited her interest to do so and pointed out a fact i had already noticed namely that mademoiselle st pierre possessed in an almost unique degree the power of keeping order amongst her undisciplined ranks of scholars a certain petrifying influence accompanied and surrounded her without passion noise or violence she held them in check as a breezeless frostair might still a brawling stream she was of little use as far as communication of knowledge went but for strict surveillance and maintenance of rules she was invaluable je sais bien quelle na pas de principes ni peutêtre de moeurs admitted madame frankly but added with philosophy son maintien en classe est toujours convenable et rempli même dune certaine dignité cest tout ce quil faut ni les élèves ni les parents ne regardent plus loin ni par conséquent moi non plus                                       a strange frolicsome noisy little world was this school great pains were taken to hide chains with flowers a subtle essence of romanism pervaded every arrangement large sensual indulgence so to speak was permitted by way of counterpoise to jealous spiritual restraint each mind was being reared in slavery but to prevent reflection from dwelling on this fact every pretext for physical recreation was seized and made the most of there as elsewhere the church strove to bring up her children robust in body feeble in soul fat ruddy hale joyous ignorant unthinking unquestioning eat drink and live she says look after your bodies leave your souls to me i hold their cureguide their course i guarantee their final fate a bargain in which every true catholic deems himself a gainer lucifer just offers the same terms all this power will i give thee and the glory of it for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will i give it if thou therefore wilt worship me all shall be thine  about this timein the ripest glow of summermadame becks house became as merry a place as a school could well be all day long the broad foldingdoors and the twoleaved casements stood wide open settled sunshine seemed naturalized in the atmosphere clouds were far off sailing away beyond sea resting no doubt round islands such as englandthat dear land of mistsbut withdrawn wholly from the drier continent we lived far more in the garden than under a roof classes were held and meals partaken of in the grand berceau moreover there was a note of holiday preparation which almost turned freedom into licence the autumnal long vacation was but two months distant but before that a great dayan important ceremonynone other than the fête of madameawaited celebration  the conduct of this fête devolved chiefly on mademoiselle st pierre madame herself being supposed to stand aloof disinterestedly unconscious of what might be going forward in her honour especially she never knew never in the least suspected that a subscription was annually levied on the whole school for the purchase of a handsome present the polite tact of the reader will please to leave out of the account a brief secret consultation on this point in madames own chamber  what will you have this year was asked by her parisian lieutenant  oh no matter let it alone let the poor children keep their francs and madame looked benign and modest  the st pierre would here protrude her chin she knew madame by heart she always called her airs of bontédes grimaces she never even professed to respect them one instant  vite she would say coldly name the article shall it be jewellery or porcelain haberdashery or silver  eh bien deux ou trois cuillers et autant de fourchettes en argent  and the result was a handsome case containing 300 francs worth of plate  the programme of the fêtedays proceedings comprised presentation of plate collation in the garden dramatic performance with pupils and teachers for actors a dance and supper very gorgeous seemed the effect of the whole to me as i well remember zélie st pierre understood these things and managed them ably  the play was the main point a months previous drilling being there required the choice too of the actors required knowledge and care then came lessons in elocution in attitude and then the fatigue of countless rehearsals for all this as may well be supposed st pierre did not suffice other management other accomplishments than hers were requisite here they were supplied in the person of a masterm paul emanuel professor of literature it was never my lot to be present at the histrionic lessons of m paul but i often saw him as he crossed the carré a square hall between the dwellinghouse and schoolhouse i heard him too in the warm evenings lecturing with open doors and his name with anecdotes of him resounded in ones ears from all sides especially our former acquaintance miss ginevra fanshawewho had been selected to take a prominent part in the playused in bestowing upon me a large portion of her leisure to lard her discourse with frequent allusions to his sayings and doings she esteemed him hideously plain and used to profess herself frightened almost into hysterics at the sound of his step or voice a dark little man he certainly was pungent and austere even to me he seemed a harsh apparition with his closeshorn black head his broad sallow brow his thin cheek his wide and quivering nostril his thorough glance and hurried bearing irritable he was one heard that as he apostrophized with vehemence the awkward squad under his orders sometimes he would break out on these raw amateur actresses with a passion of impatience at their falseness of conception their coldness of emotion their feebleness of delivery ecoutez he would cry and then his voice rang through the premises like a trumpet and when mimicking it came the small pipe of a ginevra a mathilde or a blanche one understood why a hollow groan of scorn or a fierce hiss of rage rewarded the tame echo  vous nêtes donc que des poupées i heard him thunder vous navez pas de passionsvous autres vous ne sentez donc rien votre chair est de neige votre sang de glace moi je veux que tout cela sallume quil ait une vie une âme  vain resolve and when he at last found it was vain he suddenly broke the whole business down hitherto he had been teaching them a grand tragedy he tore the tragedy in morsels and came next day with a compact little comic trifle to this they took more kindly he presently knocked it all into their smooth round pates  mademoiselle st pierre always presided at m emanuels lessons and i was told that the polish of her manner her seeming attention her tact and grace impressed that gentleman very favourably she had indeed the art of pleasing for a given time whom she would but the feeling would not last in an hour it was dried like dew vanished like gossamer  the day preceding madames fête was as much a holiday as the fête itself it was devoted to clearing out cleaning arranging and decorating the three schoolrooms all withindoors was the gayest bustle neither upstairs nor down could a quiet isolated person find rest for the sole of her foot accordingly for my part i took refuge in the garden the whole day did i wander or sit there alone finding warmth in the sun shelter among the trees and a sort of companionship in my own thoughts i well remember that i exchanged but two sentences that day with any living being not that i felt solitary i was glad to be quiet for a lookeron it sufficed to pass through the rooms once or twice observe what changes were being wrought how a greenroom and a dressingroom were being contrived a little stage with scenery erected how m paul emanuel in conjunction with mademoiselle st pierre was directing all and how an eager band of pupils amongst them ginevra fanshawe were working gaily under his control  the great day arrived the sun rose hot and unclouded and hot and unclouded it burned on till evening all the doors and all the windows were set open which gave a pleasant sense of summer freedomand freedom the most complete seemed indeed the order of the day teachers and pupils descended to breakfast in dressinggowns and curlpapers anticipating avec délices the toilette of the evening they seemed to take a pleasure in indulging that forenoon in a luxury of slovenliness like aldermen fasting in preparation for a feast about nine oclock am an important functionary the coiffeur arrived sacrilegious to state he fixed his headquarters in the oratory and there in presence of bénitier candle and crucifix solemnised the mysteries of his art each girl was summoned in turn to pass through his hands emerging from them with head as smooth as a shell intersected by faultless white lines and wreathed about with grecian plaits that shone as if lacquered i took my turn with the rest and could hardly believe what the glass said when i applied to it for information afterwards the lavished garlandry of woven brown hair amazed mei feared it was not all my own and it required several convincing pulls to give assurance to the contrary i then acknowledged in the coiffeur a firstrate artistone who certainly made the most of indifferent materials  the oratory closed the dormitory became the scene of ablutions arrayings and bedizenings curiously elaborate to me it was and ever must be an enigma how they contrived to spend so much time in doing so little the operation seemed close intricate prolonged the result simple a clear white muslin dress a blue sash the virgins colours a pair of white or strawcolour kid glovessuch was the gala uniform to the assumption whereof that houseful of teachers and pupils devoted three mortal hours but though simple it must be allowed the array was perfectperfect in fashion fit and freshness every head being also dressed with exquisite nicety and a certain compact tastesuiting the full firm comeliness of labassecourien contours though too stiff for any more flowing and flexible style of beautythe general effect was on the whole commendable  in beholding this diaphanous and snowy mass i well remember feeling myself to be a mere shadowy spot on a field of light the courage was not in me to put on a transparent white dress something thin i must wearthe weather and rooms being too hot to give substantial fabrics sufferance so i had sought through a dozen shops till i lit upon a crapelike material of purplegraythe colour in short of dun mist lying on a moor in bloom my tailleuse had kindly made it as well as she could because as she judiciously observed it was si tristesi pen voyant care in the fashion was the more imperative it was well she took this view of the matter for i had no flower no jewel to relieve it and what was more i had no natural rose of complexion  we become oblivious of these deficiencies in the uniform routine of daily drudgery but they will force upon us their unwelcome blank on those bright occasions when beauty should shine  however in this same gown of shadow i felt at home and at ease an advantage i should not have enjoyed in anything more brilliant or striking madame beck too kept me in countenance her dress was almost as quiet as mine except that she wore a bracelet and a large brooch bright with gold and fine stones we chanced to meet on the stairs and she gave me a nod and smile of approbation not that she thought i was looking wella point unlikely to engage her interestbut she considered me dressed convenablement décemment and la convenance et la décence were the two calm deities of madames worship she even paused laid on my shoulder her gloved hand holding an embroidered and perfumed handkerchief and confided to my ear a sarcasm on the other teachers whom she had just been complimenting to their faces nothing so absurd she said as for des femmes mûres to dress themselves like girls of fifteenquant à la st pierre elle a lair dune vieille coquette qui fait lingénue  being dressed at least a couple of hours before anybody else i felt a pleasure in betaking myselfnot to the garden where servants were busy propping up long tables placing seats and spreading cloths in readiness for the collation but to the schoolrooms now empty quiet cool and clean their walls fresh stained their planked floors fresh scoured and scarce dry flowers fresh gathered adorning the recesses in pots and draperies fresh hung beautifying the great windows  withdrawing to the first classe a smaller and neater room than the others and taking from the glazed bookcase of which i kept the key a volume whose title promised some interest i sat down to read the glassdoor of this classe or schoolroom opened into the large berceau acaciaboughs caressed its panes as they stretched across to meet a rosebush blooming by the opposite lintel in this rosebush bees murmured busy and happy i commenced reading just as the stilly hum the embowering shade the warm lonely calm of my retreat were beginning to steal meaning from the page vision from my eyes and to lure me along the track of reverie down into some deep dell of dreamlandjust then the sharpest ring of the streetdoor bell to which that muchtried instrument had ever thrilled snatched me back to consciousness  now the bell had been ringing all the morning as workmen or servants or coiffeurs or tailleuses went and came on their several errands moreover there was good reason to expect it would ring all the afternoon since about one hundred externes were yet to arrive in carriages or fiacres nor could it be expected to rest during the evening when parents and friends would gather thronging to the play under these circumstances a ringeven a sharp ringwas a matter of course yet this particular peal had an accent of its own which chased my dream and startled my book from my knee  i was stooping to pick up this last whenfirm fast straightright on through vestibulealong corridor across carré through first division second division grand sallestrode a step quick regular intent the closed door of the first classemy sanctuaryoffered no obstacle it burst open and a paletôt and a bonnet grec filled the void also two eyes first vaguely struck upon and then hungrily dived into me  cest cela said a voice je la connais cest langlaise tant pis toute anglaise et par conséquent toute bégueule quelle soitelle fera mon affaire ou je saurai pourquoi  then with a certain stern politeness i suppose he thought i had not caught the drift of his previous uncivil mutterings and in a jargon the most execrable that ever was heard meess play you must i am planted there  what can i do for you m paul emanuel i inquired for m paul emanuel it was and in a state of no little excitement  play you must i will not have you shrink or frown or make the prude i read your skull that night you came i see your moyens play you can play you must  but how m paul what do you mean  there is no time to be lost he went on now speaking in french and let us thrust to the wall all reluctance all excuses all minauderies you must take a part  in the vaudeville  in the vaudeville you have said it  i gasped horrorstruck what did the little man mean  listen he said the case shall be stated and you shall then answer me yes or no and according to your answer shall i ever after estimate you  the scarcesuppressed impetus of a most irritable nature glowed in his cheek fed with sharp shafts his glances a naturethe injudicious the mawkish the hesitating the sullen the affected above all the unyielding might quickly render violent and implacable silence and attention was the best balm to apply i listened  the whole matter is going to fail he began louise vanderkelkov has fallen illat least so her ridiculous mother asserts for my part i feel sure she might play if she would it is only goodwill that lacks she was charged with a rôle as you know or do not knowit is equal without that rôle the play is stopped there are now but a few hours in which to learn it not a girl in this school would hear reason and accept the task forsooth it is not an interesting not an amiable part their vile amourproprethat base quality of which women have so muchwould revolt from it englishwomen are either the best or the worst of their sex dieu sait que je les déteste comme la peste ordinairement this between his recreant teeth i apply to an englishwoman to rescue me what is her answeryes or no  a thousand objections rushed into my mind the foreign language the limited time the public display inclination recoiled ability faltered selfrespect that vile quality trembled non non non said all these but looking up at m paul and seeing in his vexed fiery and searching eye a sort of appeal behind all its menace my lips dropped the word oui for a moment his rigid countenance relaxed with a quiver of content quickly bent up again however he went on  vite à louvrage here is the book here is your rôle read and i read he did not commend at some passages he scowled and stamped he gave me a lesson i diligently imitated it was a disagreeable parta mansan emptyheaded fops one could put into it neither heart nor soul i hated it the playa mere trifleran chiefly on the efforts of a brace of rivals to gain the hand of a fair coquette one lover was called the ours a good and gallant but unpolished man a sort of diamond in the rough the other was a butterfly a talker and a traitor and i was to be the butterfly talker and traitor  i did my bestwhich was bad i know it provoked m paul he fumed putting bothhands to the work i endeavoured to do better than my best i presume he gave me credit for good intentions he professed to be partially content ca ira he cried and as voices began sounding from the garden and white dresses fluttering among the trees he added you must withdraw you must be alone to learn this come with me  without being allowed time or power to deliberate i found myself in the same breath convoyed along as in a species of whirlwind upstairs up two pair of stairs nay actually up three for this fiery little man seemed as by instinct to know his way everywhere to the solitary and lofty attic was i borne put in and locked in the key being in the door and that key he took with him and vanished  the attic was no pleasant place i believe he did not know how unpleasant it was or he never would have locked me in with so little ceremony in this summer weather it was hot as africa as in winter it was always cold as greenland boxes and lumber filled it old dresses draped its unstained wallcobwebs its unswept ceiling well was it known to be tenanted by rats by black beetles and by cockroachesnay rumour affirmed that the ghostly nun of the garden had once been seen here a partial darkness obscured one end across which as for deeper mystery an old russet curtain was drawn by way of screen to a sombre band of winter cloaks pendent each from its pin like a malefactor from his gibbet from amongst these cloaks and behind that curtain the nun was said to issue i did not believe this nor was i troubled by apprehension thereof but i saw a very dark and large rat with a long tail come gliding out from that squalid alcove and moreover my eye fell on many a blackbeetle dotting the floor these objects discomposed me more perhaps than it would be wise to say as also did the dust lumber and stifling heat of the place the last inconvenience would soon have become intolerable had i not found means to open and prop up the skylight thus admitting some freshness underneath this aperture i pushed a large empty chest and having mounted upon it a smaller box and wiped from both the dust i gathered my dress my best the reader must remember and therefore a legitimate object of care fastidiously around me ascended this species of extempore throne and being seated commenced the acquisition of my task while i learned not forgetting to keep a sharp lookout on the blackbeetles and cockroaches of which more even i believe than of the rats i sat in mortal dread  my impression at first was that i had undertaken what it really was impossible to perform and i simply resolved to do my best and be resigned to fail i soon found however that one part in so short a piece was not more than memory could master at a few hours notice i learned and learned on first in a whisper and then aloud perfectly secure from human audience i acted my part before the garretvermin entering into its emptiness frivolity and falsehood with a spirit inspired by scorn and impatience i took my revenge on this fat by making him as fatuitous as i possibly could  in this exercise the afternoon passed day began to glide into evening and i who had eaten nothing since breakfast grew excessively hungry now i thought of the collation which doubtless they were just then devouring in the garden far below i had seen in the vestibule a basketful of small pâtés à la crême than which nothing in the whole range of cookery seemed to me better a pâté or a square of cake it seemed to me would come very àpropos and as my relish for those dainties increased it began to appear somewhat hard that i should pass my holiday fasting and in prison remote as was the attic from the streetdoor and vestibule yet the evertinkling bell was faintly audible here and also the ceaseless roll of wheels on the tormented pavement i knew that the house and garden were thronged and that all was gay and glad below here it began to grow dusk the beetles were fading from my sight i trembled lest they should steal on me a march mount my throne unseen and unsuspected invade my skirts impatient and apprehensive i recommenced the rehearsal of my part merely to kill time just as i was concluding the longdelayed rattle of the key in the lock came to my earno unwelcome sound m paul i could just see through the dusk that it was m paul for light enough still lingered to show the velvet blackness of his closeshorn head and the sallow ivory of his brow looked in  brava cried he holding the door open and remaining at the threshold jai tout entendu cest assez bien encore  a moment i hesitated  encore said he sternly et point de grimaces a bas la timidité  again i went through the part but not half so well as i had spoken it alone  enfin elle sait said he half dissatisfied and one cannot be fastidious or exacting under the circumstances then he added you may yet have twenty minutes for preparation au revoir and he was going  monsieur i called out taking courage  eh bien questce que cest mademoiselle  jai bien faim  comment vous avez faim et la collation  i know nothing about it i have not seen it shut up here  ah cest vrai cried he  in a moment my throne was abdicated the attic evacuated an inverse repetition of the impetus which had brought me up into the attic instantly took me downdowndown to the very kitchen i thought i should have gone to the cellar the cook was imperatively ordered to produce food and i as imperatively was commanded to eat to my great joy this food was limited to coffee and cake i had feared wine and sweets which i did not like how he guessed that i should like a petit pâté à la crême i cannot tell but he went out and procured me one from some quarter with considerable willingness i ate and drank keeping the petit pâté till the last as a bonne bouche m paul superintended my repast and almost forced upon me more than i could swallow  a la bonne heure he cried when i signified that i really could take no more and with uplifted hands implored to be spared the additional roll on which he had just spread butter you will set me down as a species of tyrant and bluebeard starving women in a garret whereas after all i am no such thing now mademoiselle do you feel courage and strength to appear  i said i thought i did though in truth i was perfectly confused and could hardly tell how i felt but this little man was of the order of beings who must not be opposed unless you possessed an alldominant force sufficient to crush him at once  come then said he offering his hand  i gave him mine and he set off with a rapid walk which obliged me to run at his side in order to keep pace in the carré he stopped a moment it was lit with large lamps the wide doors of the classes were open and so were the equally wide gardendoors orangetrees in tubs and tall flowers in pots ornamented these portals on each side groups of ladies and gentlemen in eveningdress stood and walked amongst the flowers within the long vista of the schoolrooms presented a thronging undulating murmuring waving streaming multitude all rose and blue and half translucent white there were lustres burning overhead far off there was a stage a solemn green curtain a row of footlights  nestce pas que cest beau demanded my companion  i should have said it was but my heart got up into my throat m paul discovered this and gave me a sidescowl and a little shake for my pains  i will do my best but i wish it was over said i then i asked are we to walk through that crowd  by no means i manage matters better we pass through the gardenhere  in an instant we were out of doors the cool calm night revived me somewhat it was moonless but the reflex from the many glowing windows lit the court brightly and even the alleysdimly heaven was cloudless and grand with the quiver of its living fires how soft are the nights of the continent how bland balmy safe no seafog no chilling damp mistless as noon and fresh as morning  having crossed court and garden we reached the glass door of the first classe it stood open like all other doors that night we passed and then i was ushered into a small cabinet dividing the first classe from the grand salle this cabinet dazzled me it was so full of light it deafened me it was clamorous with voices it stifled me it was so hot choking thronged  de lordre du silence cried m paul is this chaos he demanded and there was a hush with a dozen words and as many gestures he turned out half the persons present and obliged the remnant to fall into rank those left were all in costume they were the performers and this was the greenroom m paul introduced me all stared and some tittered it was a surprise they had not expected the englishwoman would play in a vaudeville ginevra fanshawe beautifully dressed for her part and looking fascinatingly pretty turned on me a pair of eyes as round as beads in the highest spirit unperturbed by fear or bashfulness delighted indeed at the thought of shining off before hundredsmy entrance seemed to transfix her with amazement in the midst of her joy she would have exclaimed but m paul held her and all the rest in check  having surveyed and criticized the whole troop he turned to me  you too must be dressed for your part  dresseddressed like a man exclaimed zélie st pierre darting forwards adding with officiousness i will dress her myself  to be dressed like a man did not please and would not suit me i had consented to take a mans name and part as to his dresshalte là no i would keep my own dress come what might m paul might storm might rage i would keep my own dress i said so with a voice as resolute in intent as it was low and perhaps unsteady in utterance  he did not immediately storm or rage as i fully thought he would he stood silent but zélie again interposed  she will make a capital petitmâitre here are the garments allall complete somewhat too large buti will arrange all that come chère amiebelle anglaise  and she sneered for i was not belle she seized my hand she was drawing me away m paul stood impassableneutral  you must not resist pursued st pierrefor resist i did you will spoil all destroy the mirth of the piece the enjoyment of the company sacrifice everything to your amourpropre this would be too badmonsieur will never permit this  she sought his eye i watched likewise for a glance he gave her one and then he gave me one stop he said slowly arresting st pierre who continued her efforts to drag me after her everybody awaited the decision he was not angry not irritated i perceived that and took heart  you do not like these clothes he asked pointing to the masculine vestments  i dont object to some of them but i wont have them all  how must it be then how accept a mans part and go on the stage dressed as a woman this is an amateur affair it is truea vaudeville de pensionnat certain modifications i might sanction yet something you must have to announce you as of the nobler sex  and i will monsieur but it must be arranged in my own way nobody must meddle the things must not be forced upon me just let me dress myself  monsieur without another word took the costume from st pierre gave it to me and permitted me to pass into the dressingroom once alone i grew calm and collectedly went to work retaining my womans garb without the slightest retrenchment i merely assumed in addition a little vest a collar and cravat and a paletôt of small dimensions the whole being the costume of a brother of one of the pupils having loosened my hair out of its braids made up the long backhair close and brushed the front hair to one side i took my hat and gloves in my hand and came out m paul was waiting and so were the others he looked at me that may pass in a pensionnat he pronounced then added not unkindly courage mon ami un peu de sangfroidun peu daplomb m lucien et tout ira bien  st pierre sneered again in her cold snaky manner  i was irritable because excited and i could not help turning upon her and saying that if she were not a lady and i a gentleman i should feel disposed to call her out  after the play after the play said m paul i will then divide my pair of pistols between you and we will settle the dispute according to form it will only be the old quarrel of france and england  but now the moment approached for the performance to commence m paul setting us before him harangued us briefly like a general addressing soldiers about to charge i dont know what he said except that he recommended each to penetrate herself with a sense of her personal insignificance god knows i thought this advice superfluous for some of us a bell tinkled i and two more were ushered on to the stage the bell tinkled again i had to speak the very first words  do not look at the crowd nor think of it whispered m paul in my ear imagine yourself in the garret acting to the rats  he vanished the curtain drew upshrivelled to the ceiling the bright lights the long room the gay throng burst upon us i thought of the blackbeetles the old boxes the wormeaten bureau i said my say badly but i said it that first speech was the difficulty it revealed to me this fact that it was not the crowd i feared so much as my own voice foreigners and strangers the crowd were nothing to me nor did i think of them when my tongue once got free and my voice took its true pitch and found its natural tone i thought of nothing but the personage i representedand of m paul who was listening watching prompting in the sidescenes  byandby feeling the right power comethe spring demanded gush and rise inwardlyi became sufficiently composed to notice my fellowactors some of them played very well especially ginevra fanshawe who had to coquette between two suitors and managed admirably in fact she was in her element i observed that she once or twice threw a certain marked fondness and pointed partiality into her manner towards methe fop with such emphasis and animation did she favour me such glances did she dart out into the listening and applauding crowd that to mewho knew herit presently became evident she was acting at some one and i followed her eye her smile her gesture and ere long discovered that she had at least singled out a handsome and distinguished aim for her shafts full in the path of those arrowstaller than other spectators and therefore more sure to receive themstood in attitude quiet but intent a wellknown formthat of dr john  the spectacle seemed somehow suggestive there was language in dr johns look though i cannot tell what he said it animated me i drew out of it a history i put my idea into the part i per formed i threw it into my wooing of ginevra in the ours or sincere lover i saw dr john did i pity him as erst no i hardened my heart rivalled and outrivalled him i knew myself but a fop but where he was outcast i could please now i know acted as if wishful and resolute to win and conquer ginevra seconded me between us we halfchanged the nature of the rôle gilding it from top to toe between the acts m paul told us he knew not what possessed us and half expostulated cest peutêtre plus beau que votre modèle said he mais ce nest pas juste i know not what possessed me either but somehow my longing was to eclipse the ours ie dr john ginevra was tender how could i be otherwise than chivalric retaining the letter i recklessly altered the spirit of the rôle without heart without interest i could not play it at all it must be playedin went the yearnedfor seasoningthus favoured i played it with relish  what i felt that night and what i did i no more expected to feel and do than to be lifted in a trance to the seventh heaven cold reluctant apprehensive i had accepted a part to please another ere long warming becoming interested taking courage i acted to please myself yet the next day when i thought it over i quite disapproved of these amateur performances and though glad that i had obliged m paul and tried my own strength for once i took a firm resolution never to be drawn into a similar affair a keen relish for dramatic expression had revealed itself as part of my nature to cherish and exercise this newfound faculty might gift me with a world of delight but it would not do for a mere lookeron at life the strength and longing must be put by and i put them by and fastened them in with the lock of a resolution which neither time nor temptation has since picked  no sooner was the play over and well over than the choleric and arbitrary m paul underwent a metamorphosis his hour of managerial responsibility past he at once laid aside his magisterial austerity in a moment he stood amongst us vivacious kind and social shook hands with us all round thanked us separately and announced his determination that each of us should in turn be his partner in the coming ball on his claiming my promise i told him i did not dance for once i must was the answer and if i had not slipped aside and kept out of his way he would have compelled me to this second performance but i had acted enough for one evening it was time i retired into myself and my ordinary life my duncoloured dress did well enough under a paletôt on the stage but would not suit a waltz or a quadrille withdrawing to a quiet nook whence unobserved i could observethe ball its splendours and its pleasures passed before me as a spectacle  again ginevra fanshawe was the belle the fairest and the gayest present she was selected to open the ball very lovely she looked very gracefully she danced very joyously she smiled such scenes were her triumphsshe was the child of pleasure work or suffering found her listless and dejected powerless and repining but gaiety expanded her butterflys wings lit up their golddust and bright spots made her flash like a gem and flush like a flower at all ordinary diet and plain beverage she would pout but she fed on creams and ices like a hummingbird on honeypaste sweet wine was her element and sweet cake her daily bread ginevra lived her full life in a ballroom elsewhere she drooped dispirited  think not reader that she thus bloomed and sparkled for the mere sake of m paul her partner or that she lavished her best graces that night for the edification of her companions only or for that of the parents and grandparents who filled the carré and lined the ballroom under circumstances so insipid and limited with motives so chilly and vapid ginevra would scarce have deigned to walk one quadrille and weariness and fretfulness would have replaced animation and goodhumour but she knew of a leaven in the otherwise heavy festal mass which lighted the whole she tasted a condiment which gave it zest she perceived reasons justifying the display of her choicest attractions  in the ballroom indeed not a single male spectator was to be seen who was not married and a fatherm paul exceptedthat gentleman too being the sole creature of his sex permitted to lead out a pupil to the dance and this exceptional part was allowed him partly as a matter of oldestablished custom for he was a kinsman of madame becks and high in her confidence partly because he would always have his own way and do as he pleased and partly becausewilful passionate partial as he might behe was the soul of honour and might be trusted with a regiment of the fairest and purest in perfect security that under his leadership they would come to no harm many of the girlsit may be noted in parenthesiswere not pureminded at all very much otherwise but they no more dare betray their natural coarseness in m pauls presence than they dare tread purposely on his corns laugh in his face during a stormy apostrophe or speak above their breath while some crisis of irritability was covering his human visage with the mask of an intelligent tiger m paul then might dance with whom he wouldand woe be to the interference which put him out of step  others there were admitted as spectatorswith seeming reluctance through prayers by influence under restriction by special and difficult exercise of madame becks gracious goodnature and whom she all the eveningwith her own personal surveillancekept far aloof at the remotest drearest coldest darkest side of the carréa small forlorn band of jeunes gens these being all of the best families grownup sons of mothers present and whose sisters were pupils in the school that whole evening was madame on duty beside these jeunes gensattentive to them as a mother but strict with them as a dragon there was a sort of cordon stretched before them which they wearied her with prayers to be permitted to pass and just to revive themselves by one dance with that belle blonde or that jolie brune or cette jeune fille magnifique aux cheveux noirs comme le jais  taisezvous madame would reply heroically and inexorably vous ne passerez pas à moins que ce ne soit sur mon cadavre et vous ne danserez quavec la nonnette du jardin alluding to the legend and she majestically walked to and fro along their disconsolate and impatient line like a little bonaparte in a mousecoloured silk gown  madame knew something of the world madame knew much of human nature i dont think that another directress in villette would have dared to admit a jeune homme within her walls but madame knew that by granting such admission on an occasion like the present a bold stroke might be struck and a great point gained  in the first place the parents were made accomplices to the deed for it was only through their mediation it was brought about secondly the admission of these rattlesnakes so fascinating and so dangerous served to draw out madame precisely in her strongest characterthat of a firstrate surveillante thirdly their presence furnished a most piquant ingredient to the entertainment the pupils knew it and saw it and the view of such golden apples shining afar off animated them with a spirit no other circumstance could have kindled the childrens pleasure spread to the parents life and mirth circulated quickly round the ballroom the jeunes gens themselves though restrained were amused for madame never permitted them to feel dulland thus madame becks fête annually ensured a success unknown to the fête of any other directress in the land  i observed that dr john was at first permitted to walk at large through the classes there was about him a manly responsible look that redeemed his youth and halfexpiated his beauty but as soon as the ball began madame ran up to him  come wolf come said she laughing you wear sheeps clothing but you must quit the fold notwithstanding come i have a fine menagerie of twenty here in the carré let me place you amongst my collection  but first suffer me to have one dance with one pupil of my choice  have you the face to ask such a thing it is madness it is impiety sortez sortez au plus vite  she drove him before her and soon had him enclosed within the cordon  ginevra being i suppose tired with dancing sought me out in my retreat she threw herself on the bench beside me and a demonstration i could very well have dispensed with cast her arms round my neck  lucy snowe lucy snowe she cried in a somewhat sobbing voice half hysterical  what in the world is the matter i drily said  how do i lookhow do i look tonight she demanded  as usual said i preposterously vain  caustic creature you never have a kind word for me but in spite of you and all other envious detractors i know i am beautiful i feel it i see itfor there is a great lookingglass in the dressingroom where i can view my shape from head to foot will you go with me now and let us two stand before it  i will miss fanshawe you shall be humoured even to the top of your bent  the dressingroom was very near and we stepped in putting her arm through mine she drew me to the mirror without resistance remonstrance or remark i stood and let her selflove have its feast and triumph curious to see how much it could swallowwhether it was possible it could feed to satietywhether any whisper of consideration for others could penetrate her heart and moderate its vainglorious exultation  not at all she turned me and herself round she viewed us both on all sides she smiled she waved her curls she retouched her sash she spread her dress and finally letting go my arm and curtseying with mock respect she said i would not be you for a kingdom  the remark was too naïve to rouse anger i merely said very good  and what would you give to be me she inquired  not a bad sixpencestrange as it may sound i replied you are but a poor creature  you dont think so in your heart  no for in my heart you have not the outline of a place i only occasionally turn you over in my brain  well but said she in an expostulatory tone just listen to the difference of our positions and then see how happy am i and how miserable are you  go on i listen  in the first place i am the daughter of a gentleman of family and though my father is not rich i have expectations from an uncle then i am just eighteen the finest age possible i have had a continental education and though i cant spell i have abundant accomplishments i am pretty you cant deny that i may have as many admirers as i choose this very night i have been breaking the hearts of two gentlemen and it is the dying look i had from one of them just now which puts me in such spirits i do so like to watch them turn red and pale and scowl and dart fiery glances at each other and languishing ones at me there is mehappy me now for you poor soul  i suppose you are nobodys daughter since you took care of little children when you first came to villette you have no relations you cant call yourself young at twentythree you have no attractive accomplishmentsno beauty as to admirers you hardly know what they are you cant even talk on the subject you sit dumb when the other teachers quote their conquests i believe you never were in love and never will be you dont know the feeling and so much the better for though you might have your own heart broken no living heart will you ever break isnt it all true  a good deal of it is true as gospel and shrewd besides there must be good in you ginevra to speak so honestly that snake zélie st pierre could not utter what you have uttered still miss fanshawe hapless as i am according to your showing sixpence i would not give to purchase you body and soul  just because i am not clever and that is all you think of nobody in the world but you cares for cleverness  on the contrary i consider you are clever in your wayvery smart indeed but you were talking of breaking heartsthat edifying amusement into the merits of which i dont quite enter pray on whom does your vanity lead you to think you have done execution tonight  she approached her lips to my earisidore and alfred de hamal are both here she whispered  oh they are i should like to see them  theres a dear creature your curiosity is roused at last follow me i will point them out  she proudly led the waybut you cannot see them well from the classes said she turning madame keeps them too far off let us cross the garden enter by the corridor and get close to them behind we shall be scolded if we are seen but never mind  for once i did not mind through the garden we wentpenetrated into the corridor by a quiet private entrance and approaching the carré yet keeping in the corridor shade commanded a near view of the band of jeunes gens  i believe i could have picked out the conquering de hamal even undirected he was a straightnosed very correctfeatured little dandy i say little dandy though he was not beneath the middle standard in stature but his lineaments were small and so were his hands and feet and he was pretty and smooth and as trim as a doll so nicely dressed so nicely curled so booted and gloved and cravatedhe was charming indeed i said so what a dear personage cried i and commended ginevras taste warmly and asked her what she thought de hamal might have done with the precious fragments of that heart she had brokenwhether he kept them in a scentvial and conserved them in otto of roses i observed too with deep rapture of approbation that the colonels hands were scarce larger than miss fanshawes own and suggested that this circumstance might be convenient as he could wear her gloves at a pinch on his dear curls i told her i doated and as to his low grecian brow and exquisite classic headpiece i confessed i had no language to do such perfections justice  and if he were your lover suggested the cruelly exultant ginevra  oh heavens what bliss said i but do not be inhuman miss fanshawe to put such thoughts into my head is like showing poor outcast cain a far glimpse of paradise  you like him then  as i like sweets and jams and comfits and conservatory flowers  ginevra admired my taste for all these things were her adoration she could then readily credit that they were mine too  now for isidore i went on i own i felt still more curious to see him than his rival but ginevra was absorbed in the latter  alfred was admitted here tonight said she through the influence of his aunt madame la baronne de dorlodot and now having seen him can you not understand why i have been in such spirits all the evening and acted so well and danced with such life and why i am now happy as a queen dieu dieu it was such good fun to glance first at him and then at the other and madden them both  but that otherwhere is he show me isidore  i dont like  why not  i am ashamed of him  for what reason  becausebecause in a whisper he has suchsuch whiskers orangeredthere now  the murder is out i subjoined never mind show him all the same i engage not to faint  she looked round just then an english voice spoke behind her and me  you are both standing in a draught you must leave this corridor  there is no draught dr john said i turning  she takes cold so easily he pursued looking at ginevra with extreme kindness she is delicate she must be cared for fetch her a shawl  permit me to judge for myself said miss fanshawe with hauteur i want no shawl  your dress is thin you have been dancing you are heated  always preaching retorted she always coddling and admonishing  the answer dr john would have given did not come that his heart was hurt became evident in his eye darkened and saddened and pained he turned a little aside but was patient i knew where there were plenty of shawls near at hand i ran and fetched one  she shall wear this if i have strength to make her said i folding it well round her muslin dress covering carefully her neck and her arms is that isidore i asked in a somewhat fierce whisper  she pushed up her lip smiled and nodded  is that isidore i repeated giving her a shake i could have given her a dozen  cest luimême said she how coarse he is compared with the colonelcount and thenoh cielthe whiskers  dr john now passed on  the colonelcount i echoed the dollthe puppetthe manikinthe poor inferior creature a mere lackey for dr john his valet his footboy is it possible that fine generous gentlemanhandsome as a visionoffers you his honourable hand and gallant heart and promises to protect your flimsy person and feckless mind through the storms and struggles of lifeand you hang backyou scorn you sting you torture him have you power to do this who gave you that power where is it does it lie all in your beautyyour pink and white complexion and your yellow hair does this bind his soul at your feet and bend his neck under your yoke does this purchase for you his affection his tenderness his thoughts his hopes his interest his noble cordial loveand will you not have it do you scorn it you are only dissembling you are not in earnest you love him you long for him but you trifle with his heart to make him more surely yours  bah how you run on i dont understand half you have said  i had got her out into the garden ere this i now set her down on a seat and told her she should not stir till she had avowed which she meant in the end to acceptthe man or the monkey  him you call the man said she is bourgeois sandyhaired and answers to the name of johncela suffit je nen veux pas colonel de hamal is a gentleman of excellent connections perfect manners sweet appearance with pale interesting face and hair and eyes like an italian then too he is the most delightful company possiblea man quite in my way not sensible and serious like the other but one with whom i can talk on equal termswho does not plague and bore and harass me with depths and heights and passions and talents for which i have no taste there now dont hold me so fast  i slackened my grasp and she darted off i did not care to pursue her  somehow i could not avoid returning once more in the direction of the corridor to get another glimpse of dr john but i met him on the gardensteps standing where the light from a window fell broad his wellproportioned figure was not to be mistaken for i doubt whether there was another in that assemblage his equal he carried his hat in his hand his uncovered head his face and fine brow were most handsome and manly his features were not delicate not slight like those of a woman nor were they cold frivolous and feeble though well cut they were not so chiselled so frittered away as to lose in expression or significance what they gained in unmeaning symmetry much feeling spoke in them at times and more sat silent in his eye such at least were my thoughts of him to me he seemed all this an inexpressible sense of wonder occupied me as i looked at this man and reflected that he could not be slighted  it was not my intention to approach or address him in the garden our terms of acquaintance not warranting such a step i had only meant to view him in the crowdmyself unseen coming upon him thus alone i withdrew but he was looking out for me or rather for her who had been with me therefore he descended the steps and followed me down the alley  you know miss fanshawe i have often wished to ask whether you knew her said he  yes i know her  intimately  quite as intimately as i wish  what have you done with her now  am i her keeper i felt inclined to ask but i simply answered i have shaken her well and would have shaken her better but she escaped out of my hands and ran away  would you favour me he asked by watching over her this one evening and observing that she does nothing imprudentdoes not for instance run out into the nightair immediately after dancing  i may perhaps look after her a little since you wish it but she likes her own way too well to submit readily to control  she is so young so thoroughly artless said he  to me she is an enigma i responded  is she he askedmuch interested how  it would be difficult to say howdifficult at least to tell you how  and why me  i wonder she is not better pleased that you are so much her friend  but she has not the slightest idea how much i am her friend that is precisely the point i cannot teach her may i inquire did she ever speak of me to you  under the name of isidore she has talked about you often but i must add that it is only within the last ten minutes i have discovered that you and isidore are identical it is only dr john within that brief space of time i have learned that ginevra fanshawe is the person under this roof in whom you have long been interestedthat she is the magnet which attracts you to the rue fossette that for her sake you venture into this garden and seek out caskets dropped by rivals  you know all  i know so much  for more than a year i have been accustomed to meet her in society mrs cholmondeley her friend is an acquaintance of mine thus i see her every sunday but you observed that under the name of isidore she often spoke of me may iwithout inviting you to a breach of confidenceinquire what was the tone what the feeling of her remarks i feel somewhat anxious to know being a little tormented with uncertainty as to how i stand with her  oh she varies she shifts and changes like the wind  still you can gather some general idea  i can thought i but it would not do to communicate that general idea to you besides if i said she did not love you i know you would not believe me  you are silent he pursued i suppose you have no good news to impart no matter if she feels for me positive coldness and aversion it is a sign i do not deserve her  do you doubt yourself do you consider yourself the inferior of colonel de hamal  i love miss fanshawe far more than de hamal loves any human being and would care for and guard her better than he respecting de hamal i fear she is under an illusion the mans character is known to me all his antecedents all his scrapes he is not worthy of your beautiful young friend  my beautiful young friend ought to know that and to know or feel who is worthy of her said i if her beauty or her brains will not serve her so far she merits the sharp lesson of experience  are you not a little severe  i am excessively severemore severe than i choose to show you you should hear the strictures with which i favour my beautiful young friend only that you would be unutterably shocked at my want of tender considerateness for her delicate nature  she is so lovely one cannot but be loving towards her youevery woman older than herself must feel for such a simple innocent girlish fairy a sort of motherly or eldersisterly fondness graceful angel does not your heart yearn towards her when she pours into your ear her pure childlike confidences how you are privileged and he sighed  i cut short these confidences somewhat abruptly now and then said i but excuse me dr john may i change the theme for one instant what a godlike person is that de hamal what a nose on his faceperfect model one in putty or clay you could not make a better or straighter or neater and then such classic lips and chinand his bearingsublime  de hamal is an unutterable puppy besides being a very whitelivered hero  you dr john and every man of a lessrefined mould than he must feel for him a sort of admiring affection such as mars and the coarser deities may be supposed to have borne the young graceful apollo  an unprincipled gambling little jackanapes said dr john curtly whom with one hand i could lift up by the waistband any day and lay low in the kennel if i liked  the sweet seraph said i what a cruel idea are you not a little severe dr john  and now i paused for the second time that night i was going beyond myselfventuring out of what i looked on as my natural habitsspeaking in an unpremeditated impulsive strain which startled me strangely when i halted to reflect on rising that morning had i anticipated that before night i should have acted the part of a gay lover in a vaudeville and an hour after frankly discussed with dr john the question of his hapless suit and rallied him on his illusions i had no more presaged such feats than i had looked forward to an ascent in a balloon or a voyage to cape horn  the doctor and i having paced down the walk were now returning the reflex from the window again lit his face he smiled but his eye was melancholy how i wished that he could feel heartsease how i grieved that he brooded over pain and pain from such a cause he with his great advantages he to love in vain i did not then know that the pensiveness of reverse is the best phase for some minds nor did i reflect that some herbs though scentless when entire yield fragrance when theyre bruised  do not be sorrowful do not grieve i broke out if there is in ginevra one spark of worthiness of your affection she willshe must feel devotion in return be cheerful be hopeful dr john who should hope if not you  in return for this speech i gotwhat it must be supposed i deserveda look of surprise i thought also of some disapprobation we parted and i went into the house very chill the clocks struck and the bells tolled midnight people were leaving fast the fête was over the lamps were fading in another hour all the dwellinghouse and all the pensionnat were dark and hushed i too was in bed but not asleep to me it was not easy to sleep after a day of such excitement     chapter xv  the long vacation   following madame becks fête with its three preceding weeks of relaxation its brief twelve hours burst of hilarity and dissipation and its one subsequent day of utter languor came a period of reaction two months of real application of close hard study these two months being the last of the année scolaire were indeed the only genuine working months in the year to them was procrastinatedinto them concentrated alike by professors mistresses and pupilsthe main burden of preparation for the examinations preceding the distribution of prizes candidates for rewards had then to work in good earnest masters and teachers had to set their shoulders to the wheel to urge on the backward and diligently aid and train the more promising a showy demonstrationa telling exhibitionmust be got up for public view and all means were fair to this end  i scarcely noted how the other teachers went to work i had my own business to mind and my task was not the least onerous being to imbue some ninety sets of brains with a due tincture of what they considered a most complicated and difficult science that of the english language and to drill ninety tongues in what for them was an almost impossible pronunciationthe lisping and hissing dentals of the isles  the examinationday arrived awful day prepared for with anxious care dressed for with silent despatchnothing vaporous or fluttering nowno white gauze or azure streamers the grave close compact was the order of the toilette it seemed to me that i was this day especially doomedthe main burden and trial falling on me alone of all the female teachers the others were not expected to examine in the studies they taught the professor of literature m paul taking upon himself this duty he this school autocrat gathered all and sundry reins into the hollow of his one hand he irefully rejected any colleague he would not have help madame herself who evidently rather wished to undertake the examination in geographyher favourite study which she taught wellwas forced to succumb and be subordinate to her despotic kinsmans direction the whole staff of instructors male and female he set aside and stood on the examiners estrade alone it irked him that he was forced to make one exception to this rule he could not manage english he was obliged to leave that branch of education in the english teachers hands which he did not without a flash of naïve jealousy  a constant crusade against the amourpropre of every human being but himself was the crotchet of this able but fiery and grasping little man he had a strong relish for public representation in his own person but an extreme abhorrence of the like display in any other he quelled he kept down when he could and when he could not he fumed like a bottled storm  on the evening preceding the examinationday i was walking in the garden as were the other teachers and all the boarders m emanuel joined me in the allée défendue his cigar was at his lips his paletôta most characteristic garment of no particular shapehung dark and menacing the tassel of his bonnet grec sternly shadowed his left temple his black whiskers curled like those of a wrathful cat his blue eye had a cloud in its glitter  ainsi he began abruptly fronting and arresting me vous allez trôner comme une reine demaintrôner à mes côtés sans doute vous savourez davance les délices de lautorité je crois voir en je ne sais quoi de rayonnante petite ambitieuse  now the fact was he happened to be entirely mistaken i did notcould notestimate the admiration or the good opinion of tomorrows audience at the same rate he did had that audience numbered as many personal friends and acquaintance for me as for him i know not how it might have been i speak of the case as it stood on me schooltriumphs shed but a cold lustre i had wonderedand i wondered nowhow it was that for him they seemed to shine as with hearthwarmth and hearthglow he cared for them perhaps too much i probably too little however i had my own fancies as well as he i liked for instance to see m emanuel jealous it lit up his nature and woke his spirit it threw all sorts of queer lights and shadows over his dun face and into his violetazure eyes he used to say that his black hair and blue eyes were une de ses beautés there was a relish in his anger it was artless earnest quite unreasonable but never hypocritical i uttered no disclaimer then of the complacency he attributed to me i merely asked where the english examination came inwhether at the commencement or close of the day  i hesitate said he whether at the very beginning before many persons are come and when your aspiring nature will not be gratified by a large audience or quite at the close when everybody is tired and only a jaded and wornout attention will be at your service  que vous êtes dur monsieur i said affecting dejection  one ought to be dur with you you are one of those beings who must be kept down i know you i know you other people in this house see you pass and think that a colourless shadow has gone by as for me i scrutinized your face once and it sufficed  you are satisfied that you understand me  without answering directly he went on were you not gratified when you succeeded in that vaudeville i watched you and saw a passionate ardour for triumph in your physiognomy what fire shot into the glance not mere light but flame je me tiens pour averti  what feeling i had on that occasion monsieurand pardon me if i say you immensely exaggerate both its quality and quantitywas quite abstract i did not care for the vaudeville i hated the part you assigned me i had not the slightest sympathy with the audience below the stage they are good people doubtless but do i know them are they anything to me can i care for being brought before their view again tomorrow will the examination be anything but a task to mea task i wish well over  shall i take it out of your hands  with all my heart if you do not fear failure  but i should fail i only know three phrases of english and a few words par exemple de sonn de mone de staresestce bien dit my opinion is that it would be better to give up the thing altogether to have no english examination eh  if madame consents i consent  heartily  very heartily  he smoked his cigar in silence he turned suddenly  donnezmoi la main said he and the spite and jealousy melted out of his face and a generous kindliness shone there instead  come we will not be rivals we will be friends he pursued the examination shall take place and i will choose a good moment and instead of vexing and hindering as i felt halfinclined ten minutes agofor i have my malevolent moods i always had from childhoodi will aid you sincerely after all you are solitary and a stranger and have your way to make and your bread to earn it may be well that you should become known we will be friends do you agree  out of my heart monsieur i am glad of a friend i like that better than a triumph  pauvrette said he and turned away and left the alley  the examination passed over well m paul was as good as his word and did his best to make my part easy the next day came the distribution of prizes that also passed the school broke up the pupils went home and now began the long vacation  that vacation shall i ever forget it i think not madame beck went the first day of the holidays to join her children at the seaside all the three teachers had parents or friends with whom they took refuge every professor quitted the city some went to paris some to bouemarine m paul set forth on a pilgrimage to rome the house was left quite empty but for me a servant and a poor deformed and imbecile pupil a sort of crétin whom her stepmother in a distant province would not allow to return home  my heart almost died within me miserable longings strained its chords how long were the september days how silent how lifeless how vast and void seemed the desolate premises how gloomy the forsaken gardengrey now with the dust of a town summer departed looking forward at the commencement of those eight weeks i hardly knew how i was to live to the end my spirits had long been gradually sinking now that the prop of employment was withdrawn they went down fast even to look forward was not to hope the dumb future spoke no comfort offered no promise gave no inducement to bear present evil in reliance on future good a sorrowful indifference to existence often pressed on mea despairing resignation to reach betimes the end of all things earthly alas when i had full leisure to look on life as life must be looked on by such as me i found it but a hopeless desert tawny sands with no green fields no palmtree no well in view the hopes which are dear to youth which bear it up and lead it on i knew not and dared not know if they knocked at my heart sometimes an inhospitable bar to admission must be inwardly drawn when they turned away thus rejected tears sad enough sometimes flowed but it could not be helped i dared not give such guests lodging so mortally did i fear the sin and weakness of presumption  religious reader you will preach to me a long sermon about what i have just written and so will you moralist and you stern sage you stoic will frown you cynic sneer you epicure laugh well each and all take it your own way i accept the sermon frown sneer and laugh perhaps you are all right and perhaps circumstanced like me you would have been like me wrong the first month was indeed a long black heavy month to me  the crétin did not seem unhappy i did my best to feed her well and keep her warm and she only asked food and sunshine or when that lacked fire her weak faculties approved of inertion her brain her eyes her ears her heart slept content they could not wake to work so lethargy was their paradise  three weeks of that vacation were hot fair and dry but the fourth and fifth were tempestuous and wet i do not know why that change in the atmosphere made a cruel impression on me why the raging storm and beating rain crushed me with a deadlier paralysis than i had experienced while the air had remained serene but so it was and my nervous system could hardly support what it had for many days and nights to undergo in that huge empty house how i used to pray to heaven for consolation and support with what dread force the conviction would grasp me that fate was my permanent foe never to be conciliated i did not in my heart arraign the mercy or justice of god for this i concluded it to be a part of his great plan that some must deeply suffer while they live and i thrilled in the certainty that of this number i was one  it was some relief when an aunt of the crétin a kind old woman came one day and took away my strange deformed companion the hapless creature had been at times a heavy charge i could not take her out beyond the garden and i could not leave her a minute alone for her poor mind like her body was warped its propensity was to evil a vague bent to mischief an aimless malevolence made constant vigilance indispensable as she very rarely spoke and would sit for hours together moping and mowing and distorting her features with indescribable grimaces it was more like being prisoned with some strange tameless animal than associating with a human being then there were personal attentions to be rendered which required the nerve of a hospital nurse my resolution was so tried it sometimes fell deadsick these duties should not have fallen on me a servant now absent had rendered them hitherto and in the hurry of holiday departure no substitute to fill this office had been provided this tax and trial were by no means the least i have known in life still menial and distasteful as they were my mental pain was far more wasting and wearing attendance on the crétin deprived me often of the power and inclination to swallow a meal and sent me faint to the fresh air and the well or fountain in the court but this duty never wrung my heart or brimmed my eyes or scalded my cheek with tears hot as molten metal  the crétin being gone i was free to walk out at first i lacked courage to venture very far from the rue fossette but by degrees i sought the city gates and passed them and then went wandering away far along chaussées through fields beyond cemeteries catholic and protestant beyond farmsteads to lanes and little woods and i know not where a goad thrust me on a fever forbade me to rest a want of companionship maintained in my soul the cravings of a most deadly famine i often walked all day through the burning noon and the arid afternoon and the dusk evening and came back with moonrise  while wandering in solitude i would sometimes picture the present probable position of others my acquaintance there was madame beck at a cheerful wateringplace with her children her mother and a whole troop of friends who had sought the same scene of relaxation zélie st pierre was at paris with her relatives the other teachers were at their homes there was ginevra fanshawe whom certain of her connections had carried on a pleasant tour southward ginevra seemed to me the happiest she was on the route of beautiful scenery these september suns shone for her on fertile plains where harvest and vintage matured under their mellow beam these gold and crystal moons rose on her vision over blue horizons waved in mounted lines  but all this was nothing i too felt those autumn suns and saw those harvest moons and i almost wished to be covered in with earth and turf deep out of their influence for i could not live in their light nor make them comrades nor yield them affection but ginevra had a kind of spirit with her empowered to give constant strength and comfort to gladden daylight and embalm darkness the best of the good genii that guard humanity curtained her with his wings and canopied her head with his bending form by true love was ginevra followed never could she be alone was she insensible to this presence it seemed to me impossible i could not realize such deadness i imagined her grateful in secret loving now with reserve but purposing one day to show how much she loved i pictured her faithful hero half conscious of her coy fondness and comforted by that consciousness i conceived an electric chord of sympathy between them a fine chain of mutual understanding sustaining union through a separation of a hundred leaguescarrying across mound and hollow communication by prayer and wish ginevra gradually became with me a sort of heroine one day perceiving this growing illusion i said i really believe my nerves are getting overstretched my mind has suffered somewhat too much a malady is growing upon itwhat shall i do how shall i keep well  indeed there was no way to keep well under the circumstances at last a day and night of peculiarly agonizing depression were succeeded by physical illness i took perforce to my bed about this time the indian summer closed and the equinoctial storms began and for nine dark and wet days of which the hours rushed on all turbulent deaf dishevelledbewildered with sounding hurricanei lay in a strange fever of the nerves and blood sleep went quite away i used to rise in the night look round for her beseech her earnestly to return a rattle of the window a cry of the blast only repliedsleep never came  i err she came once but in anger impatient of my importunity she brought with her an avenging dream by the clock of st jean baptiste that dream remained scarce fifteen minutesa brief space but sufficing to wring my whole frame with unknown anguish to confer a nameless experience that had the hue the mien the terror the very tone of a visitation from eternity between twelve and one that night a cup was forced to my lips black strong strange drawn from no well but filled up seething from a bottomless and boundless sea suffering brewed in temporal or calculable measure and mixed for mortal lips tastes not as this suffering tasted having drank and woke i thought all was over the end come and past by trembling fearfullyas consciousness returnedready to cry out on some fellowcreature to help me only that i knew no fellowcreature was near enough to catch the wild summonsgoton in her far distant attic could not heari rose on my knees in bed some fearful hours went over me indescribably was i torn racked and oppressed in mind amidst the horrors of that dream i think the worst lay here methought the wellloved dead who had loved me well in life met me elsewhere alienated galled was my inmost spirit with an unutterable sense of despair about the future motive there was none why i should try to recover or wish to live and yet quite unendurable was the pitiless and haughty voice in which death challenged me to engage his unknown terrors when i tried to pray i could only utter these words from my youth up thy terrors have i suffered with a troubled mind  most true was it  on bringing me my tea next morning goton urged me to call in a doctor i would not i thought no doctor could cure me  one eveningand i was not delirious i was in my sane mind i got upi dressed myself weak and shaking the solitude and the stillness of the long dormitory could not be borne any longer the ghastly white beds were turning into spectresthe coronal of each became a deathshead huge and sunbleacheddead dreams of an elder world and mightier race lay frozen in their wide gaping eyeholes that evening more firmly than ever fastened into my soul the conviction that fate was of stone and hope a false idolblind bloodless and of granite core i felt too that the trial god had appointed me was gaining its climax and must now be turned by my own hands hot feeble trembling as they were it rained still and blew but with more clemency i thought than it had poured and raged all day twilight was falling and i deemed its influence pitiful from the lattice i saw coming nightclouds trailing low like banners drooping it seemed to me that at this hour there was affection and sorrow in heaven above for all pain suffered on earth beneath the weight of my dreadful dream became alleviatedthat insufferable thought of being no more lovedno more owned halfyielded to hope of the contraryi was sure this hope would shine clearer if i got out from under this houseroof which was crushing as the slab of a tomb and went outside the city to a certain quiet hill a long way distant in the fields covered with a cloak i could not be delirious for i had sense and recollection to put on warm clothing forth i set the bells of a church arrested me in passing they seemed to call me in to the salut and i went in any solemn rite any spectacle of sincere worship any opening for appeal to god was as welcome to me then as bread to one in extremity of want i knelt down with others on the stone pavement it was an old solemn church its pervading gloom not gilded but purpled by light shed through stained glass  few worshippers were assembled and the salut over half of them departed i discovered soon that those left remained to confess i did not stir carefully every door of the church was shut a holy quiet sank upon and a solemn shade gathered about us after a space breathless and spent in prayer a penitent approached the confessional i watched she whispered her avowal her shrift was whispered back she returned consoled another went and another a pale lady kneeling near me said in a low kind voicego you now i am not quite prepared  mechanically obedient i rose and went i knew what i was about my mind had run over the intent with lightningspeed to take this step could not make me more wretched than i was it might soothe me  the priest within the confessional never turned his eyes to regard me he only quietly inclined his ear to my lips he might be a good man but this duty had become to him a sort of form he went through it with the phlegm of custom i hesitated of the formula of confession i was ignorant instead of commencing then with the prelude usual i saidmon père je suis protestante  he directly turned he was not a native priest of that class the cast of physiognomy is almost invariably grovelling i saw by his profile and brow he was a frenchman though grey and advanced in years he did not i think lack feeling or intelligence he inquired not unkindly why being a protestant i came to him  i said i was perishing for a word of advice or an accent of comfort i had been living for some weeks quite alone i had been ill i had a pressure of affliction on my mind of which it would hardly any longer endure the weight  was it a sin a crime he inquired somewhat startled i reassured him on this point and as well as i could i showed him the mere outline of my experience  he looked thoughtful surprised puzzled you take me unawares said he i have not had such a case as yours before ordinarily we know our routine and are prepared but this makes a great break in the common course of confession i am hardly furnished with counsel fitting the circumstances  of course i had not expected he would be but the mere relief of communication in an ear which was human and sentient yet consecratedthe mere pouring out of some portion of long accumulating long pentup pain into a vessel whence it could not be again diffusedhad done me good i was already solaced  must i go father i asked of him as he sat silent  my daughter he said kindlyand i am sure he was a kind man he had a compassionate eyefor the present you had better go but i assure you your words have struck me confession like other things is apt to become formal and trivial with habit you have come and poured your heart out a thing seldom done i would fain think your case over and take it with me to my oratory were you of our faith i should know what to saya mind so tossed can find repose but in the bosom of retreat and the punctual practice of piety the world it is well known has no satisfaction for that class of natures holy men have bidden penitents like you to hasten their path upward by penance selfdenial and difficult good works tears are given them here for meat and drinkbread of affliction and waters of afflictiontheir recompence comes hereafter it is my own conviction that these impressions under which you are smarting are messengers from god to bring you back to the true church you were made for our faith depend upon it our faith alone could heal and help youprotestantism is altogether too dry cold prosaic for you the further i look into this matter the more plainly i see it is entirely out of the common order of things on no account would i lose sight of you go my daughter for the present but return to me again  i rose and thanked him i was withdrawing when he signed me to return  you must not come to this church said he i see you are ill and this church is too cold you must come to my house i live and he gave me his address be there tomorrow morning at ten  in reply to this appointment i only bowed and pulling down my veil and gathering round me my cloak i glided away  did i do you suppose reader contemplate venturing again within that worthy priests reach as soon should i have thought of walking into a babylonish furnace that priest had arms which could influence me he was naturally kind with a sentimental french kindness to whose softness i knew myself not wholly impervious without respecting some sorts of affection there was hardly any sort having a fibre of root in reality which i could rely on my force wholly to withstand had i gone to him he would have shown me all that was tender and comforting and gentle in the honest popish superstition then he would have tried to kindle blow and stir up in me the zeal of good works i know not how it would all have ended we all think ourselves strong in some points we all know ourselves weak in many the probabilities are that had i visited numero 10 rue des mages at the hour and day appointed i might just now instead of writing this heretic narrative be counting my beads in the cell of a certain carmelite convent on the boulevard of crécy in villette there was something of fénélon about that benign old priest and whatever most of his brethren may be and whatever i may think of his church and creed and i like neither of himself i must ever retain a grateful recollection he was kind when i needed kindness he did me good may heaven bless him  twilight had passed into night and the lamps were lit in the streets ere i issued from that sombre church to turn back was now become possible to me the wild longing to breathe this october wind on the little hill far without the city walls had ceased to be an imperative impulse and was softened into a wish with which reason could cope she put it down and i turned as i thought to the rue fossette but i had become involved in a part of the city with which i was not familiar it was the old part and full of narrow streets of picturesque ancient and mouldering houses i was much too weak to be very collected and i was still too careless of my own welfare and safety to be cautious i grew embarrassed i got immeshed in a network of turns unknown i was lost and had no resolution to ask guidance of any passenger  if the storm had lulled a little at sunset it made up now for lost time strong and horizontal thundered the current of the wind from northwest to southeast it brought rain like spray and sometimes a sharp hail like shot it was cold and pierced me to the vitals i bent my head to meet it but it beat me back my heart did not fail at all in this conflict i only wished that i had wings and could ascend the gale spread and repose my pinions on its strength career in its course sweep where it swept while wishing this i suddenly felt colder where before i was cold and more powerless where before i was weak i tried to reach the porch of a great building near but the mass of frontage and the giant spire turned black and vanished from my eyes instead of sinking on the steps as i intended i seemed to pitch headlong down an abyss i remember no more     chapter xvi  auld lang syne   where my soul went during that swoon i cannot tell whatever she saw or wherever she travelled in her trance on that strange night she kept her own secret never whispering a word to memory and baffling imagination by an indissoluble silence she may have gone upward and come in sight of her eternal home hoping for leave to rest now and deeming that her painful union with matter was at last dissolved while she so deemed an angel may have warned her away from heavens threshold and guiding her weeping down have bound her once more all shuddering and unwilling to that poor frame cold and wasted of whose companionship she was grown more than weary  i know she reentered her prison with pain with reluctance with a moan and a long shiver the divorced mates spirit and substance were hard to reunite they greeted each other not in an embrace but a racking sort of struggle the returning sense of sight came upon me red as if it swam in blood suspended hearing rushed back loud like thunder consciousness revived in fear i sat up appalled wondering into what region amongst what strange beings i was waking at first i knew nothing i looked on a wall was not a walla lamp not a lamp i should have understood what we call a ghost as well as i did the commonest object which is another way of intimating that all my eye rested on struck it as spectral but the faculties soon settled each in his place the lifemachine presently resumed its wonted and regular working  still i knew not where i was only in time i saw i had been removed from the spot where i fell i lay on no porticostep night and tempest were excluded by walls windows and ceiling into some house i had been carriedbut what house  i could only think of the pensionnat in the rue fossette still halfdreaming i tried hard to discover in what room they had put me whether the great dormitory or one of the little dormitories i was puzzled because i could not make the glimpses of furniture i saw accord with my knowledge of any of these apartments the empty white beds were wanting and the long line of large windows surely thought i it is not to madame becks own chamber they have carried me and here my eye fell on an easychair covered with blue damask other seats cushioned to match dawned on me by degrees and at last i took in the complete fact of a pleasant parlour with a wood fire on a clearshining hearth a carpet where arabesques of bright blue relieved a ground of shaded fawn pale walls over which a slight but endless garland of azure forgetmenots ran mazed and bewildered amongst myriad gold leaves and tendrils a gilded mirror filled up the space between two windows curtained amply with blue damask in this mirror i saw myself laid not in bed but on a sofa i looked spectral my eyes larger and more hollow my hair darker than was natural by contrast with my thin and ashen face it was obvious not only from the furniture but from the position of windows doors and fireplace that this was an unknown room in an unknown house  hardly less plain was it that my brain was not yet settled for as i gazed at the blue armchair it appeared to grow familiar so did a certain scrollcouch and not less so the round centretable with a bluecovering bordered with autumntinted foliage and above all two little footstools with worked covers and a small ebonyframed chair of which the seat and back were also worked with groups of brilliant flowers on a dark ground  struck with these things i explored further strange to say old acquaintance were all about me and auld lang syne smiled out of every nook there were two oval miniatures over the mantelpiece of which i knew by heart the pearls about the high and powdered heads the velvets circling the white throats the swell of the full muslin kerchiefs the pattern of the lace sleeveruffles upon the mantelshelf there were two china vases some relics of a diminutive teaservice as smooth as enamel and as thin as eggshell and a white centre ornament a classic group in alabaster preserved under glass of all these things i could have told the peculiarities numbered the flaws or cracks like any clairvoyante above all there was a pair of handscreens with elaborate pencildrawings finished like line engravings these my very eyes ached at beholding again recalling hours when they had followed stroke by stroke and touch by touch a tedious feeble finical schoolgirl pencil held in these fingers now so skeletonlike  where was i not only in what spot of the world but in what year of our lord for all these objects were of past days and of a distant country ten years ago i bade them goodby since my fourteenth year they and i had never met i gasped audibly where am i  a shape hitherto unnoticed stirred rose came forward a shape inharmonious with the environment serving only to complicate the riddle further this was no more than a sort of native bonne in a commonplace bonnes cap and printdress she spoke neither french nor english and i could get no intelligence from her not understanding her phrases of dialect but she bathed my temples and forehead with some cool and perfumed water and then she heightened the cushion on which i reclined made signs that i was not to speak and resumed her post at the foot of the sofa  she was busy knitting her eyes thus drawn from me i could gaze on her without interruption i did mightily wonder how she came there or what she could have to do among the scenes or with the days of my girlhood still more i marvelled what those scenes and days could now have to do with me  too weak to scrutinize thoroughly the mystery i tried to settle it by saying it was a mistake a dream a feverfit and yet i knew there could be no mistake and that i was not sleeping and i believed i was sane i wished the room had not been so well lighted that i might not so clearly have seen the little pictures the ornaments the screens the worked chair all these objects as well as the bluedamask furniture were in fact precisely the same in every minutest detail with those i so well remembered and with which i had been so thoroughly intimate in the drawingroom of my godmothers house at bretton methought the apartment only was changed being of different proportions and dimensions  i thought of bedreddin hassan transported in his sleep from cairo to the gates of damascus had a genius stooped his dark wing down the storm to whose stress i had succumbed and gathering me from the churchsteps and rising high into the air as the eastern tale said had he borne me over land and ocean and laid me quietly down beside a hearth of old england but no i knew the fire of that hearth burned before its lares no moreit went out long ago and the household gods had been carried elsewhere  the bonne turned again to survey me and seeing my eyes wide open and i suppose deeming their expression perturbed and excited she put down her knitting i saw her busied for a moment at a little stand she poured out water and measured drops from a phial glass in hand she approached me what darktinged draught might she now be offering what geniielixir or magidistillation  it was too late to inquirei had swallowed it passively and at once a tide of quiet thought now came gently caressing my brain softer and softer rose the flow with tepid undulations smoother than balm the pain of weakness left my limbs my muscles slept i lost power to move but losing at the same time wish it was no privation that kind bonne placed a screen between me and the lamp i saw her rise to do this but do not remember seeing her resume her place in the interval between the two acts i fell on sleep                                       at waking lo all was again changed the light of high day surrounded me not indeed a warm summer light but the leaden gloom of raw and blustering autumn i felt sure now that i was in the pensionnatsure by the beating rain on the casement sure by the wuther of wind amongst trees denoting a garden outside sure by the chill the whiteness the solitude amidst which i lay i say whitenessfor the dimity curtains dropped before a french bed bounded my view  i lifted them i looked out my eye prepared to take in the range of a long large and whitewashed chamber blinked baffled on encountering the limited area of a small cabineta cabinet with seagreen walls also instead of five wide and naked windows there was one high lattice shaded with muslin festoons instead of two dozen little stands of painted wood each holding a basin and an ewer there was a toilettetable dressed like a lady for a ball in a white robe over a pink skirt a polished and large glass crowned and a pretty pincushion frilled with lace adorned it this toilette together with a small low green and white chintz armchair a washstand topped with a marble slab and supplied with utensils of pale greenware sufficiently furnished the tiny chamber  reader i felt alarmed why you will ask what was there in this simple and somewhat pretty sleepingcloset to startle the most timid merely thisthese articles of furniture could not be real solid armchairs lookingglasses and washstandsthey must be the ghosts of such articles or if this were denied as too wild an hypothesisand confounded as i was i did deny itthere remained but to conclude that i had myself passed into an abnormal state of mind in short that i was very ill and delirious and even then mine was the strangest figment with which delirium had ever harassed a victim  i knewi was obliged to knowthe green chintz of that little chair the little snug chair itself the carved shiningblack foliated frame of that glass the smooth milkygreen of the china vessels on the stand the very stand too with its top of grey marble splintered at one cornerall these i was compelled to recognise and to hail as last night i had perforce recognised and hailed the rosewood the drapery the porcelain of the drawingroom  bretton bretton and ten years ago shone reflected in that mirror and why did bretton and my fourteenth year haunt me thus why if they came at all did they not return complete why hovered before my distempered vision the mere furniture while the rooms and the locality were gone as to that pincushion made of crimson satin ornamented with gold beads and frilled with threadlace i had the same right to know it as to know the screensi had made it myself rising with a start from the bed i took the cushion in my hand and examined it there was the cipher l l b formed in gold beds and surrounded with an oval wreath embroidered in white silk these were the initials of my godmothers namelonisa lucy bretton  am i in england am i at bretton i muttered and hastily pulling up the blind with which the lattice was shrouded i looked out to try and discover where i was halfprepared to meet the calm old handsome buildings and clean grey pavement of st anns street and to see at the end the towers of the minster or if otherwise fully expectant of a town view somewhere a rue in villette if not a street in a pleasant and ancient english city  i looked on the contrary through a frame of leafage clustering round the high lattice and forth thence to a grassy meadlike level a lawnterrace with trees rising from the lower ground beyondhigh foresttrees such as i had not seen for many a day they were now groaning under the gale of october and between their trunks i traced the line of an avenue where yellow leaves lay in heaps and drifts or were whirled singly before the sweeping west wind whatever landscape might lie further must have been flat and these tall beeches shut it out the place seemed secluded and was to me quite strange i did not know it at all  once more i lay down my bed stood in a little alcove on turning my face to the wall the room with its bewildering accompaniments became excluded excluded no for as i arranged my position in this hope behold on the green space between the divided and loopedup curtains hung a broad gilded pictureframe enclosing a portrait it was drawnwell drawn though but a sketchin watercolours a head a boys head fresh lifelike speaking and animated it seemed a youth of sixteen faircomplexioned with sanguine health in his cheek hair long not dark and with a sunny sheen penetrating eyes an arch mouth and a gay smile on the whole a most pleasant face to look at especially for those claiming a right to that youths affectionsparents for instance or sisters any romantic little schoolgirl might almost have loved it in its frame those eyes looked as if when somewhat older they would flash a lightningresponse to love i cannot tell whether they kept in store the steadybeaming shine of faith for whatever sentiment met him in form too facile his lips menaced beautifully but surely caprice and light esteem  striving to take each new discovery as quietly as i could i whispered to myself  ah that portrait used to hang in the breakfastroom over the mantelpiece somewhat too high as i thought i well remember how i used to mount a musicstool for the purpose of unhooking it holding it in my hand and searching into those bonny wells of eyes whose glance under their hazel lashes seemed like a pencilled laugh and well i liked to note the colouring of the cheek and the expression of the mouth i hardly believed fancy could improve on the curve of that mouth or of the chin even my ignorance knew that both were beautiful and pondered perplexed over this doubt how it was that what charmed so much could at the same time so keenly pain once by way of test i took little missy home and lifting her in my arms told her to look at the picture  do you like it polly i asked she never answered but gazed long and at last a darkness went trembling through her sensitive eye as she said put me down so i put her down saying to myself the child feels it too  all these things do i now think over adding he had his faults yet scarce ever was a finer nature liberal suave impressible my reflections closed in an audibly pronounced word graham  graham echoed a sudden voice at the bedside do you want graham  i looked the plot was but thickening the wonder but culminating if it was strange to see that wellremembered pictured form on the wall still stranger was it to turn and behold the equally wellremembered living form oppositea woman a lady most real and substantial tall wellattired wearing widows silk and such a cap as best became her matron and motherly braids of hair hers too was a good face too marked perhaps now for beauty but not for sense or character she was little changed something sterner something more robustbut she was my godmother still the distinct vision of mrs bretton  i kept quiet yet internally i was much agitated my pulse fluttered and the blood left my cheek which turned cold  madam where am i i inquired  in a very safe asylum well protected for the present make your mind quite easy till you get a little better you look ill this morning  i am so entirely bewildered i do not know whether i can trust my senses at all or whether they are misleading me in every particular but you speak english do you not madam  i should think you might hear that it would puzzle me to hold a long discourse in french  you do not come from england  i am lately arrived thence have you been long in this country you seem to know my son  do i madam perhaps i do your sonthe picture there  that is his portrait as a youth while looking at it you pronounced his name  graham bretton  she nodded  i speak to mrs bretton formerly of bretton shire  quite right and you i am told are an english teacher in a foreign school here my son recognised you as such  how was i found madam and by whom  my son shall tell you that byandby said she but at present you are too confused and weak for conversation try to eat some breakfast and then sleep  notwithstanding all i had undergonethe bodily fatigue the perturbation of spirits the exposure to weatherit seemed that i was better the fever the real malady which had oppressed my frame was abating for whereas during the last nine days i had taken no solid food and suffered from continual thirst this morning on breakfast being offered i experienced a craving for nourishment an inward faintness which caused me eagerly to taste the tea this lady offered and to eat the morsel of dry toast she allowed in accompaniment it was only a morsel but it sufficed keeping up my strength till some two or three hours afterwards when the bonne brought me a little cup of broth and a biscuit  as evening began to darken and the ceaseless blast still blew wild and cold and the rain streamed on delugelike i grew wearyvery weary of my bed the room though pretty was small i felt it confining i longed for a change the increasing chill and gathering gloom too depressed me i wanted to seeto feel firelight besides i kept thinking of the son of that tall matron when should i see him certainly not till i left my room  at last the bonne came to make my bed for the night she prepared to wrap me in a blanket and place me in the little chintz chair but declining these attentions i proceeded to dress myself  the business was just achieved and i was sitting down to take breath when mrs bretton once more appeared  dressed she exclaimed smiling with that smile i so well knewa pleasant smile though not soft you are quite better then quite strongeh  she spoke to me so much as of old she used to speak that i almost fancied she was beginning to know me there was the same sort of patronage in her voice and manner that as a girl i had always experienced from hera patronage i yielded to and even liked it was not founded on conventional grounds of superior wealth or station in the last particular there had never been any inequality her degree was mine but on natural reasons of physical advantage it was the shelter the tree gives the herb i put a request without further ceremony  do let me go downstairs madam i am so cold and dull here  i desire nothing better if you are strong enough to bear the change was her reply come then here is an arm and she offered me hers i took it and we descended one flight of carpeted steps to a landing where a tall door standing open gave admission into the bluedamask room how pleasant it was in its air of perfect domestic comfort how warm in its amber lamplight and vermilion fireflush to render the picture perfect tea stood ready on the tablean english tea whereof the whole shining service glanced at me familiarly from the solid silver urn of antique pattern and the massive pot of the same metal to the thin porcelain cups dark with purple and gilding i knew the very seedcake of peculiar form baked in a peculiar mould which always had a place on the teatable at bretton graham liked it and there it was as of yoreset before grahams plate with the silver knife and fork beside it graham was then expected to tea graham was now perhaps in the house ere many minutes i might see him  sit downsit down said my conductress as my step faltered a little in passing to the hearth she seated me on the sofa but i soon passed behind it saying the fire was too hot in its shade i found another seat which suited me better mrs bretton was never wont to make a fuss about any person or anything without remonstrance she suffered me to have my own way she made the tea and she took up the newspaper i liked to watch every action of my godmother all her movements were so young she must have been now above fifty yet neither her sinews nor her spirit seemed yet touched by the rust of age though portly she was alert and though serene she was at times impetuousgood health and an excellent temperament kept her green as in her spring  while she read i perceived she listenedlistened for her son she was not the woman ever to confess herself uneasy but there was yet no lull in the weather and if graham were out in that hoarse windroaring still unsatisfiedi well knew his mothers heart would be out with him  ten minutes behind his time said she looking at her watch then in another minute a lifting of her eyes from the page and a slight inclination of her head towards the door denoted that she heard some sound presently her brow cleared and then even my ear less practised caught the iron clash of a gate swung to steps on gravel lastly the doorbell he was come his mother filled the teapot from the urn she drew nearer the hearth the stuffed and cushioned blue chairher own chair by right but i saw there was one who might with impunity usurp it and when that one came up the stairswhich he soon did after i suppose some such attention to the toilet as the wild and wet night rendered necessary and strode straight in  is it you graham said his mother hiding a glad smile and speaking curtly  who else should it be mamma demanded the unpunctual possessing himself irreverently of the abdicated throne  dont you deserve cold tea for being late  i shall not get my deserts for the urn sings cheerily  wheel yourself to the table lazy boy no seat will serve you but mine if you had one spark of a sense of propriety you would always leave that chair for the old lady  so i should only the dear old lady persists in leaving it for me how is your patient mamma  will she come forward and speak for herself said mrs bretton turning to my corner and at this invitation forward i came graham courteously rose up to greet me he stood tall on the hearth a figure justifying his mothers unconcealed pride  so you are come down said he you must be better thenmuch better i scarcely expected we should meet thus or here i was alarmed last night and if i had not been forced to hurry away to a dying patient i certainly would not have left you but my mother herself is something of a doctress and martha an excellent nurse i saw the case was a faintingfit not necessarily dangerous what brought it on i have yet to learn and all particulars meantime i trust you really do feel better  much better i said calmly much better i thank you dr john  for reader this tall young manthis darling sonthis host of minethis graham bretton was dr john he and no other and what is more i ascertained this identity scarcely with surprise what is more when i heard grahams step on the stairs i knew what manner of figure would enter and for whose aspect to prepare my eyes the discovery was not of today its dawn had penetrated my perceptions long since of course i remembered young bretton well and though ten years from sixteen to twentysix may greatly change the boy as they mature him to the man yet they could bring no such utter difference as would suffice wholly to blind my eyes or baffle my memory dr john graham bretton retained still an affinity to the youth of sixteen he had his eyes he had some of his features to wit all the excellentlymoulded lower half of the face i found him out soon i first recognised him on that occasion noted several chapters back when my unguardedlyfixed attention had drawn on me the mortification of an implied rebuke subsequent observation confirmed in every point that early surmise i traced in the gesture the port and the habits of his manhood all his boys promise i heard in his now deep tones the accent of former days certain turns of phrase peculiar to him of old were peculiar to him still and so was many a trick of eye and lip many a smile many a sudden ray levelled from the irid under his wellcharactered brow  to say anything on the subject to hint at my discovery had not suited my habits of thought or assimilated with my system of feeling on the contrary i had preferred to keep the matter to myself i liked entering his presence covered with a cloud he had not seen through while he stood before me under a ray of special illumination which shone all partial over his head trembled about his feet and cast light no farther  well i knew that to him it could make little difference were i to come forward and announce this is lucy snowe so i kept back in my teachers place and as he never asked my name so i never gave it he heard me called miss and miss lucy he never heard the surname snowe as to spontaneous recognitionthough i perhaps was still less changed than hethe idea never approached his mind and why should i suggest it  during tea dr john was kind as it was his nature to be that meal over and the tray carried out he made a cosy arrangement of the cushions in a corner of the sofa and obliged me to settle amongst them he and his mother also drew to the fire and ere we had sat ten minutes i caught the eye of the latter fastened steadily upon me women are certainly quicker in some things than men  well she exclaimed presently i have seldom seen a stronger likeness graham have you observed it  observed what what ails the old lady now how you stare mamma one would think you had an attack of second sight  tell me graham of whom does that young lady remind you pointing to me  mamma you put her out of countenance i often tell you abruptness is your fault remember too that to you she is a stranger and does not know your ways  now when she looks down now when she turns sideways who is she like graham  indeed mamma since you propound the riddle i think you ought to solve it  and you have known her some time you sayever since you first began to attend the school in the rue fossetteyet you never mentioned to me that singular resemblance  i could not mention a thing of which i never thought and which i do not now acknowledge what can you mean  stupid boy look at her  graham did look but this was not to be endured i saw how it must end so i thought it best to anticipate  dr john i said has had so much to do and think of since he and i shook hands at our last parting in st anns street that while i readily found out mr graham bretton some months ago it never occurred to me as possible that he should recognise lucy snowe  lucy snowe i thought so i knew it cried mrs bretton and she at once stepped across the hearth and kissed me some ladies would perhaps have made a great bustle upon such a discovery without being particularly glad of it but it was not my godmothers habit to make a bustle and she preferred all sentimental demonstrations in basrelief so she and i got over the surprise with few words and a single salute yet i daresay she was pleased and i know i was while we renewed old acquaintance graham sitting opposite silently disposed of his paroxysm of astonishment  mamma calls me a stupid boy and i think i am so at length he said for upon my honour often as i have seen you i never once suspected this fact and yet i perceive it all now lucy snowe to be sure i recollect her perfectly and there she sits not a doubt of it but he added you surely have not known me as an old acquaintance all this time and never mentioned it  that i have was my answer  dr john commented not i supposed he regarded my silence as eccentric but he was indulgent in refraining from censure i daresay too he would have deemed it impertinent to have interrogated me very closely to have asked me the why and wherefore of my reserve and though he might feel a little curious the importance of the case was by no means such as to tempt curiosity to infringe on discretion  for my part i just ventured to inquire whether he remembered the circumstance of my once looking at him very fixedly for the slight annoyance he had betrayed on that occasion still lingered sore on my mind  i think i do said he i think i was even cross with you  you considered me a little bold perhaps i inquired  not at all only shy and retiring as your general manner was i wondered what personal or facial enormity in me proved so magnetic to your usually averted eyes  you see how it was now  perfectly  and here mrs bretton broke in with many many questions about past times and for her satisfaction i had to recur to goneby troubles to explain causes of seeming estrangement to touch on singlehanded conflict with life with death with grief with fate dr john listened saying little he and she then told me of changes they had known even with them all had not gone smoothly and fortune had retrenched her once abundant gifts but so courageous a mother with such a champion in her son was well fitted to fight a good fight with the world and to prevail ultimately dr john himself was one of those on whose birth benign planets have certainly smiled adversity might set against him her most sullen front he was the man to beat her down with smiles strong and cheerful and firm and courteous not rash yet valiant he was the aspirant to woo destiny herself and to win from her stone eyeballs a beam almost loving  in the profession he had adopted his success was now quite decided within the last three months he had taken this house a small château they told me about half a league without the porte de crécy this country site being chosen for the sake of his mothers health with which town air did not now agree hither he had invited mrs bretton and she on leaving england had brought with her such residue furniture of the former st anns street mansion as she had thought fit to keep unsold hence my bewilderment at the phantoms of chairs and the wraiths of lookingglasses teaurns and teacups  as the clock struck eleven dr john stopped his mother  miss snowe must retire now he said she is beginning to look very pale tomorrow i will venture to put some questions respecting the cause of her loss of health she is much changed indeed since last july when i saw her enact with no little spirit the part of a very killing fine gentleman as to last nights catastrophe i am sure thereby hangs a tale but we will inquire no further this evening goodnight miss lucy  and so he kindly led me to the door and holding a waxcandle lighted me up the one flight of stairs  when i had said my prayers and when i was undressed and laid down i felt that i still had friends friends not professing vehement attachment not offering the tender solace of wellmatched and congenial relationship on whom therefore but moderate demand of affection was to be made of whom but moderate expectation formed but towards whom my heart softened instinctively and yearned with an importunate gratitude which i entreated reason betimes to check  do not let me think of them too often too much too fondly i implored let me be content with a temperate draught of this living stream let me not run athirst and apply passionately to its welcome waters let me not imagine in them a sweeter taste than earths fountains know oh would to god i may be enabled to feel enough sustained by an occasional amicable intercourse rare brief unengrossing and tranquil quite tranquil  still repeating this word i turned to my pillow and still repeating it i steeped that pillow with tears     chapter xvii  la terrasse   these struggles with the natural character the strong native bent of the heart may seem futile and fruitless but in the end they do good they tend however slightly to give the actions the conduct that turn which reason approves and which feeling perhaps too often opposes they certainly make a

i was dressing and at intervals drinking cold water from the carafe on my washstand with design to brace up that trembling weakness which made dressing so difficult in came mrs bretton  here is an absurdity was her morning accost not so she added and dealing with me at once in her own brusque energetic fashionthat fashion which i used formerly to enjoy seeing applied to her son and by him vigorously resistedin two minutes she consigned me captive to the french bed  there you lie till afternoon said she my boy left orders before he went out that such should be the case and i can assure you my son is master and must be obeyed presently you shall have breakfast  presently she brought that mealbrought it with her own active handsnot leaving me to servants she seated herself on the bed while i ate now it is not everybody even amongst our respected friends and esteemed acquaintance whom we like to have near us whom we like to watch us to wait on us to approach us with the proximity of a nurse to a patient it is not every friend whose eye is a light in a sick room whose presence is there a solace but all this was mrs bretton to me all this she had ever been food or drink never pleased me so well as when it came through her hands i do not remember the occasion when her entrance into a room had not made that room cheerier our natures own predilections and antipathies alike strange there are people from whom we secretly shrink whom we would personally avoid though reason confesses that they are good people there are others with faults of temper c evident enough beside whom we live content as if the air about them did us good my godmothers lively black eye and clear brunette cheek her warm prompt hand her selfreliant mood her decided bearing were all beneficial to me as the atmosphere of some salubrious climate her son used to call her the old lady it filled me with pleasant wonder to note how the alacrity and power of fiveandtwenty still breathed from her and around her  i would bring my work here she said as she took from me the emptied teacup and sit with you the whole day if that overbearing john graham had not put his veto upon such a proceeding now mamma he said when he went out take notice you are not to knock up your goddaughter with gossip and he particularly desired me to keep close to my own quarters and spare you my fine company he says lucy he thinks you have had a nervous fever judging from your lookis that so  i replied that i did not quite know what my ailment had been but that i had certainly suffered a good deal especially in mind further on this subject i did not consider it advisable to dwell for the details of what i had undergone belonged to a portion of my existence in which i never expected my godmother to take a share into what a new region would such a confidence have led that hale serene nature the difference between her and me might be figured by that between the stately ship cruising safe on smooth seas with its full complement of crew a captain gay and brave and venturous and provident and the lifeboat which most days of the year lies dry and solitary in an old dark boathouse only putting to sea when the billows run high in rough weather when cloud encounters water when danger and death divide between them the rule of the great deep no the louisa bretton never was out of harbour on such a night and in such a scene her crew could not conceive it so the halfdrowned lifeboat man keeps his own counsel and spins no yarns  she left me and i lay in bed content it was good of graham to remember me before he went out  my day was lonely but the prospect of coming evening abridged and cheered it then too i felt weak and rest seemed welcome and after the morning hours were gone bythose hours which always bring even to the necessarily unoccupied a sense of business to be done of tasks waiting fulfilment a vague impression of obligation to be employedwhen this stirring time was past and the silent descent of afternoon hushed housemaid steps on the stairs and in the chambers i then passed into a dreamy mood not unpleasant  my calm little room seemed somehow like a cave in the sea there was no colour about it except that white and pale green suggestive of foam and deep water the blanched cornice was adorned with shellshaped ornaments and there were white mouldings like dolphins in the ceilingangles even that one touch of colour visible in the red satin pincushion bore affinity to coral even that dark shining glass might have mirrored a mermaid when i closed my eyes i heard a gale subsiding at last bearing upon the housefront like a settling swell upon a rockbase i heard it drawn and withdrawn far far off like a tide retiring from a shore of the upper worlda world so high above that the rush of its largest waves the dash of its fiercest breakers could sound down in this submarine home only like murmurs and a lullaby  amidst these dreams came evening and then martha brought a light with her aid i was quickly dressed and stronger now than in the morning i made my way down to the blue saloon unassisted  dr john it appears had concluded his round of professional calls earlier than usual his form was the first object that met my eyes as i entered the parlour he stood in that windowrecess opposite the door reading the close type of a newspaper by such dull light as closing day yet gave the fire shone clear but the lamp stood on the table unlit and tea was not yet brought up  as to mrs bretton my active godmotherwho i afterwards found had been out in the open air all daylay halfreclined in her deepcushioned chair actually lost in a nap her son seeing me came forward i noticed that he trod carefully not to wake the sleeper he also spoke low his mellow voice never had any sharpness in it modulated as at present it was calculated rather to soothe than startle slumber  this is a quiet little château he observed after inviting me to sit near the casement i dont know whether you may have noticed it in your walks though indeed from the chaussée it is not visible just a mile beyond the porte de crécy you turn down a lane which soon becomes an avenue and that leads you on through meadow and shade to the very door of this house it is not a modern place but built somewhat in the old style of the basseville it is rather a manoir than a château they call it la terrasse because its front rises from a broad turfed walk whence steps lead down a grassy slope to the avenue see yonder the moon rises she looks well through the treeboles  where indeed does the moon not look well what is the scene confined or expansive which her orb does not hallow rosy or fiery she mounted now above a not distant bank even while we watched her flushed ascent she cleared to gold and in very brief space floated up stainless into a now calm sky did moonlight soften or sadden dr bretton did it touch him with romance i think it did albeit of no sighing mood he sighed in watching it sighed to himself quietly no need to ponder the cause or the course of that sigh i knew it was wakened by beauty i knew it pursued ginevra knowing this the idea pressed upon me that it was in some sort my duty to speak the name he meditated of course he was ready for the subject i saw in his countenance a teeming plenitude of comment question and interest a pressure of language and sentiment only checked i thought by sense of embarrassment how to begin to spare him this embarrassment was my best indeed my sole use i had but to utter the idols name and loves tender litany would flow out i had just found a fitting phrase you know that miss fanshawe is gone on a tour with the cholmondeleys and was opening my lips to speak to it when he scattered my plans by introducing another theme  the first thing this morning said he putting his sentiment in his pocket turning from the moon and sitting down i went to the rue fossette and told the cuisinière that you were safe and in good hands do you know that i actually found that she had not yet discovered your absence from the house she thought you safe in the great dormitory with what care you must have been waited on  oh all that is very conceivable said i goton could do nothing for me but bring me a little tisane and a crust of bread and i had rejected both so often during the past week that the good woman got tired of useless journeys from the dwellinghouse kitchen to the schooldormitory and only came once a day at noon to make my bed i believe however that she is a goodnatured creature and would have been delighted to cook me côtelettes de mouton if i could have eaten them  what did madame beck mean by leaving you alone  madame beck could not foresee that i should fall ill  your nervous system bore a good share of the suffering  i am not quite sure what my nervous system is but i was dreadfully lowspirited  which disables me from helping you by pill or potion medicine can give nobody good spirits my art halts at the threshold of hypochondria she just looks in and sees a chamber of torture but can neither say nor do much cheerful society would be of use you should be as little alone as possible you should take plenty of exercise  acquiescence and a pause followed these remarks they sounded all right i thought and bore the safe sanction of custom and the wellworn stamp of use  miss snowe recommenced dr johnmy health nervous system included being now somewhat to my relief discussed and done withis it permitted me to ask what your religion is are you a catholic  i looked up in some surprisea catholic no why suggest such an idea  the manner in which you were consigned to me last night made me doubt  i consigned to you but indeed i forget it yet remains for me to learn how i fell into your hands  why under circumstances that puzzled me i had been in attendance all day yesterday on a case of singularly interesting and critical character the disease being rare and its treatment doubtful i saw a similar and still finer case in a hospital in paris but that will not interest you at last a mitigation of the patients most urgent symptoms acute pain is one of its accompaniments liberated me and i set out homeward my shortest way lay through the basseville and as the night was excessively dark wild and wet i took it in riding past an old church belonging to a community of béguines i saw by a lamp burning over the porch or deep arch of the entrance a priest lifting some object in his arms the lamp was bright enough to reveal the priests features clearly and i recognised him he was a man i have often met by the sick beds of both rich and poor and chiefly the latter he is i think a good old man far better than most of his class in this country superior indeed in every way better informed as well as more devoted to duty our eyes met he called on me to stop what he supported was a woman fainting or dying i alighted  this person is one of your countrywomen he said save her if she is not dead  my countrywoman on examination turned out to be the english teacher at madame becks pensionnat she was perfectly unconscious perfectly bloodless and nearly cold  what does it all mean was my inquiry  he communicated a curious account that you had been to him that evening at confessional that your exhausted and suffering appearance coupled with some things you had said  things i had said i wonder what things  awful crimes no doubt but he did not tell me what there you know the seal of the confessional checked his garrulity and my curiosity your confidences however had not made an enemy of the good father it seems he was so struck and felt so sorry that you should be out on such a night alone that he had esteemed it a christian duty to watch you when you quitted the church and so to manage as not to lose sight of you till you should have reached home perhaps the worthy man might half unconsciously have blent in this proceeding some little of the subtlety of his class it might have been his resolve to learn the locality of your homedid you impart that in your confession  i did not on the contrary i carefully avoided the shadow of any indication and as to my confession dr john i suppose you will think me mad for taking such a step but i could not help it i suppose it was all the fault of what you call my nervous system i cannot put the case into words but my days and nights were grown intolerable a cruel sense of desolation pained my mind a feeling that would make its way rush out or kill melike and this you will understand dr john the current which passes through the heart and which if aneurism or any other morbid cause obstructs its natural channels seeks abnormal outlet i wanted companionship i wanted friendship i wanted counsel i could find none of these in closet or chamber so i went and sought them in church and confessional as to what i said it was no confidence no narrative i have done nothing wrong my life has not been active enough for any dark deed either of romance or reality all i poured out was a dreary desperate complaint  lucy you ought to travel for about six months why your calm nature is growing quite excitable confound madame beck has the little buxom widow no bowels to condemn her best teacher to solitary confinement  it was not madame becks fault said i it is no living beings fault and i wont hear any one blamed  who is in the wrong then lucy  medr johnme and a great abstraction on whose wide shoulders i like to lay the mountains of blame they were sculptured to bear me and fate  me must take better care in future said dr johnsmiling i suppose at my bad grammar  change of airchange of scene those are my prescriptions pursued the practical young doctor but to return to our muttons lucy as yet père silas with all his tact they say he is a jesuit is no wiser than you choose him to be for instead of returning to the rue fossette your fevered wanderingsthere must have been high fever  no dr john the fever took its turn that nightnow dont make out that i was delirious for i know differently  good you were as collected as myself at this moment no doubt your wanderings had taken an opposite direction to the pensionnat near the béguinage amidst the stress of flood and gust and in the perplexity of darkness you had swooned and fallen the priest came to your succour and the physician as we have seen supervened between us we procured a fiacre and brought you here père silas old as he is would carry you upstairs and lay you on that couch himself he would certainly have remained with you till suspended animation had been restored and so should i but at that juncture a hurried messenger arrived from the dying patient i had scarcely leftthe last duties were called forthe physicians last visit and the priests last rite extreme unction could not be deferred père silas and myself departed together my mother was spending the evening abroad we gave you in charge to martha leaving directions which it seems she followed successfully now are you a catholic  not yet said i with a smile and never let père silas know where i live or he will try to convert me but give him my best and truest thanks when you see him and if ever i get rich i will send him money for his charities see dr john your mother wakes you ought to ring for tea  which he did and as mrs bretton sat upastonished and indignant at herself for the indulgence to which she had succumbed and fully prepared to deny that she had slept at allher son came gaily to the attack  hushaby mamma sleep again you look the picture of innocence in your slumbers  my slumbers john graham what are you talking about you know i never do sleep by day it was the slightest doze possible  exactly a seraphs gentle lapsea fairys dream mamma under such circumstances you always remind me of titania  that is because you yourself are so like bottom  miss snowedid you ever hear anything like mammas wit she is a most sprightly woman of her size and age  keep your compliments to yourself sir and do not neglect your own size which seems to me a good deal on the increase lucy has he not rather the air of an incipient john bull he used to be slender as an eel and now i fancy in him a sort of heavy dragoon benta beefeater tendency graham take notice if you grow fat i disown you  as if you could not sooner disown your own personality i am indispensable to the old ladys happiness lucy she would pine away in green and yellow melancholy if she had not my six feet of iniquity to scold it keeps her livelyit maintains the wholesome ferment of her spirits  the two were now standing opposite to each other one on each side the fireplace their words were not very fond but their mutual looks atoned for verbal deficiencies at least the best treasure of mrs brettons life was certainly casketed in her sons bosom her dearest pulse throbbed in his heart as to him of course another love shared his feelings with filial love and no doubt as the new passion was the latest born so he assigned it in his emotions benjamins portion ginevra ginevra did mrs bretton yet know at whose feet her own young idol had laid his homage would she approve that choice i could not tell but i could well guess that if she knew miss fanshawes conduct towards graham her alternations between coldness and coaxing and repulse and allurement if she could at all suspect the pain with which she had tried him if she could have seen as i had seen his fine spirits subdued and harassed his inferior preferred before him his subordinate made the instrument of his humiliationthen mrs bretton would have pronounced ginevra imbecile or perverted or both welli thought so too  that second evening passed as sweetly as the firstmore sweetly indeed we enjoyed a smoother interchange of thought old troubles were not reverted to acquaintance was better cemented i felt happier easier more at home that nightinstead of crying myself asleepi went down to dreamland by a pathway bordered with pleasant thoughts     chapter xviii  we quarrel   during the first days of my stay at the terrace graham never took a seat near me or in his frequent pacing of the room approached the quarter where i sat or looked preoccupied or more grave than usual but i thought of miss fanshawe and expected her name to leap from his lips i kept my ear and mind in perpetual readiness for the tender theme my patience was ordered to be permanently under arms and my sympathy desired to keep its cornucopia replenished and ready for outpouring at last and after a little inward struggle which i saw and respected he one day launched into the topic it was introduced delicately anonymously as it were  your friend is spending her vacation in travelling i hear  friend forsooth thought i to myself but it would not do to contradict he must have his own way i must own the soft impeachment friend let it be still by way of experiment i could not help asking whom he meant  he had taken a seat at my worktable he now laid hands on a reel of thread which he proceeded recklessly to unwind  ginevramiss fanshawe has accompanied the cholmondeleys on a tour through the south of france  she has  do you and she correspond  it will astonish you to hear that i never once thought of making application for that privilege  you have seen letters of her writing  yes several to her uncle  they will not be deficient in wit and naïveté there is so much sparkle and so little art in her soul  she writes comprehensively enough when she writes to m de bassompierre he who runs may read in fact ginevras epistles to her wealthy kinsman were commonly business documents unequivocal applications for cash  and her handwriting it must be pretty light ladylike i should think  it was and i said so  i verily believe that all she does is well done said dr john and as i seemed in no hurry to chime in with this remark he added you who know her could you name a point in which she is deficient  she does several things very well flirtation amongst the rest subjoined i in thought  when do you suppose she will return to town he soon inquired  pardon me dr john i must explain you honour me too much in ascribing to me a degree of intimacy with miss fanshawe i have not the felicity to enjoy i have never been the depositary of her plans and secrets you will find her particular friends in another sphere than mine amongst the cholmondeleys for instance  he actually thought i was stung with a kind of jealous pain similar to his own  excuse her he said judge her indulgently the glitter of fashion misleads her but she will soon find out that these people are hollow and will return to you with augmented attachment and confirmed trust i know something of the cholmondeleys superficial showy selfish people depend on it at heart ginevra values you beyond a score of such  you are very kind i said briefly  a disclaimer of the sentiments attributed to me burned on my lips but i extinguished the flame i submitted to be looked upon as the humiliated castoff and now pining confidante of the distinguished miss fanshawe but reader it was a hard submission  yet you see continued graham while i comfort you i cannot take the same consolation to myself i cannot hope she will do me justice de hamal is most worthless yet i fear he pleases her wretched delusion  my patience really gave way and without notice all at once i suppose illness and weakness had worn it and made it brittle  dr bretton i broke out there is no delusion like your own on all points but one you are a man frank healthful rightthinking clearsighted on this exceptional point you are but a slave i declare where miss fanshawe is concerned you merit no respect nor have you mine  i got up and left the room very much excited  this little scene took place in the morning i had to meet him again in the evening and then i saw i had done mischief he was not made of common clay not put together out of vulgar materials while the outlines of his nature had been shaped with breadth and vigour the details embraced workmanship of almost feminine delicacy finer much finer than you could be prepared to meet with than you could believe inherent in him even after years of acquaintance indeed till some oversharp contact with his nerves had betrayed by its effects their acute sensibility this elaborate construction must be ignored and the more especially because the sympathetic faculty was not prominent in him to feel and to seize quickly anothers feelings are separate properties a few constructions possess both some neither dr john had the one in exquisite perfection and because i have admitted that he was not endowed with the other in equal degree the reader will considerately refrain from passing to an extreme and pronouncing him unsympathizing unfeeling on the contrary he was a kind generous man make your need known his hand was open put your grief into words he turned no deaf ear expect refinements of perception miracles of intuition and realize disappointment this night when dr john entered the room and met the evening lamp i saw well and at one glance his whole mechanism  to one who had named him slave and on any point banned him from respect he must now have peculiar feelings that the epithet was well applied and the ban just might be he put forth no denial that it was so his mind even candidly revolved that unmanning possibility he sought in this accusation the cause of that illsuccess which had got so galling a hold on his mental peace amid the worry of a selfcondemnatory soliloquy his demeanour seemed grave perhaps cold both to me and his mother and yet there was no bad feeling no malice no rancour no littleness in his countenance beautiful with a mans best beauty even in its depression when i placed his chair at the table which i hastened to do anticipating the servant and when i handed him his tea which i did with trembling care he said thank you lucy in as kindly a tone of his full pleasant voice as ever my ear welcomed  for my part there was only one plan to be pursued i must expiate my culpable vehemence or i must not sleep that night this would not do at all i could not stand it i made no pretence of capacity to wage war on this footing school solitude conventual silence and stagnation anything seemed preferable to living embroiled with dr john as to ginevra she might take the silver wings of a dove or any other fowl that flies and mount straight up to the highest place among the highest stars where her lovers highest flight of fancy chose to fix the constellation of her charms never more be it mine to dispute the arrangement long i tried to catch his eye again and again that eye just met mine but having nothing to say it withdrew and i was baffled after tea he sat sad and quiet reading a book i wished i could have dared to go and sit near him but it seemed that if i ventured to take that step he would infallibly evince hostility and indignation i longed to speak out and i dared not whisper his mother left the room then moved by insupportable regret i just murmured the words dr bretton  he looked up from his book his eyes were not cold or malevolent his mouth was not cynical he was ready and willing to hear what i might have to say his spirit was of vintage too mellow and generous to sour in one thunderclap  dr bretton forgive my hasty words do do forgive them  he smiled that moment i spoke perhaps i deserved them lucy if you dont respect me i am sure it is because i am not respectable i fear i am an awkward fool i must manage badly in some way for where i wish to please it seems i dont please  of that you cannot be sure and even if such be the case is it the fault of your character or of anothers perceptions but now let me unsay what i said in anger in one thing and in all things i deeply respect you if you think scarcely enough of yourself and too much of others what is that but an excellence  can i think too much of ginevra  i believe you may you believe you cant let us agree to differ let me be pardoned that is what i ask  do you think i cherish illwill for one warm word  i see you do not and cannot but just say lucy i forgive you say that to ease me of the heartache  put away your heartache as i will put away mine for you wounded me a little lucy now when the pain is gone i more than forgive i feel grateful as to a sincere wellwisher  i am your sincere wellwisher you are right  thus our quarrel ended  reader if in the course of this work you find that my opinion of dr john undergoes modification excuse the seeming inconsistency i give the feeling as at the time i felt it i describe the view of character as it appeared when discovered  he showed the fineness of his nature by being kinder to me after that misunderstanding than before nay the very incident which by my theory must in some degree estrange me and him changed indeed somewhat our relations but not in the sense i painfully anticipated an invisible but a cold something very slight very transparent but very chill a sort of screen of ice had hitherto all through our two lives glazed the medium through which we exchanged intercourse those few warm words though only warm with anger breathed on that frail frostwork of reserve about this time it gave note of dissolution i think from that day so long as we continued friends he never in discourse stood on topics of ceremony with me he seemed to know that if he would but talk about himself and about that in which he was most interested my expectation would always be answered my wish always satisfied it follows as a matter of course that i continued to hear much of ginevra  ginevra he thought her so fair so good he spoke so lovingly of her charms her sweetness her innocence that in spite of my plain prose knowledge of the reality a kind of reflected glow began to settle on her idea even for me still reader i am free to confess that he often talked nonsense but i strove to be unfailingly patient with him i had had my lesson i had learned how severe for me was the pain of crossing or grieving or disappointing him in a strange and new sense i grew most selfish and quite powerless to deny myself the delight of indulging his mood and being pliant to his will he still seemed to me most absurd when he obstinately doubted and desponded about his power to win in the end miss fanshawes preference the fancy became rooted in my own mind more stubbornly than ever that she was only coquetting to goad him and that at heart she coveted everyone of his words and looks sometimes he harassed me in spite of my resolution to bear and hear in the midst of the indescribable gallhoney pleasure of thus bearing and hearing he struck so on the flint of what firmness i owned that it emitted fire once and again i chanced to assert one day with a view to stilling his impatience that in my own mind i felt positive miss fanshawe must intend eventually to accept him  positive it was easy to say so but had i any grounds for such assurance  the best grounds  now lucy do tell me what  you know them as well as i and knowing them dr john it really amazes me that you should not repose the frankest confidence in her fidelity to doubt under the circumstances is almost to insult  now you are beginning to speak fast and to breathe short but speak a little faster and breathe a little shorter till you have given an explanationa full explanation i must have it  you shall dr john in some cases you are a lavish generous man you are a worshipper ever ready with the votive offering should père silas ever convert you you will give him abundance of alms for his poor you will supply his altar with tapers and the shrine of your favourite saint you will do your best to enrich ginevra dr john  hush said he dont go on  hush i will not and go on i will ginevra has had her hands filled from your hands more times than i can count you have sought for her the costliest flowers you have busied your brain in devising gifts the most delicate such one would have thought as only a woman could have imagined and in addition miss fanshawe owns a set of ornaments to purchase which your generosity must have verged on extravagance  the modesty ginevra herself had never evinced in this matter now flushed all over the face of her admirer  nonsense he said destructively snipping a skein of silk with my scissors i offered them to please myself i felt she did me a favour in accepting them  she did more than a favour dr john she pledged her very honour that she would make you some return and if she cannot pay you in affection she ought to hand out a businesslike equivalent in the shape of some rouleaux of gold pieces  but you dont understand her she is far too disinterested to care for my gifts and too simpleminded to know their value  i laughed out i had heard her adjudge to every jewel its price and well i knew moneyembarrassment moneyschemes moneys worth and endeavours to realise supplies had young as she was furnished the most frequent and the favourite stimulus of her thoughts for years  he pursued you should have seen her whenever i have laid on her lap some trifle so cool so unmoved no eagerness to take not even pleasure in contemplating just from amiable reluctance to grieve me she would permit the bouquet to lie beside her and perhaps consent to bear it away or if i achieved the fastening of a bracelet on her ivory arm however pretty the trinket might be and i always carefully chose what seemed to me pretty and what of course was not valueless the glitter never dazzled her bright eyes she would hardly cast one look on my gift  then of course not valuing it she would unloose and return it to you  no for such a repulse she was too goodnatured she would consent to seem to forget what i had done and retain the offering with ladylike quiet and easy oblivion under such circumstances how can a man build on acceptance of his presents as a favourable symptom for my part were i to offer her all i have and she to take it such is her incapacity to be swayed by sordid considerations i should not venture to believe the transaction advanced me one step  dr john i began love is blind but just then a blue subtle ray sped sideways from dr johns eye it reminded me of old days it reminded me of his picture it half led me to think that part at least of his professed persuasion of miss fanshawes naïveté was assumed it led me dubiously to conjecture that perhaps in spite of his passion for her beauty his appreciation of her foibles might possibly be less mistaken more clearsighted than from his general language was presumable after all it might be only a chance look or at best the token of a merely momentary impression chance or intentional real or imaginary it closed the conversation     chapter xix  the cleopatra   my stay at la terrasse was prolonged a fortnight beyond the close of the vacation mrs brettons kind management procured me this respite her son having one day delivered the dictum that lucy was not yet strong enough to go back to that den of a pensionnat she at once drove over to the rue fossette had an interview with the directress and procured the indulgence on the plea of prolonged rest and change being necessary to perfect recovery hereupon however followed an attention i could very well have dispensed with viza polite call from madame beck  that ladyone fine dayactually came out in a fiacre as far as the château i suppose she had resolved within herself to see what manner of place dr john inhabited apparently the pleasant site and neat interior surpassed her expectations she eulogized all she saw pronounced the blue salon une pièce magnifique profusely congratulated me on the acquisition of friends tellement dignes aimables et respectables turned also a neat compliment in my favour and upon dr john coming in ran up to him with the utmost buoyancy opening at the same time such a fire of rapid language all sparkling with felicitations and protestations about his châteaumadame sa mère la digne châtelaine also his looks which indeed were very flourishing and at the moment additionally embellished by the goodnatured but amused smile with which he always listened to madames fluent and florid french in short madame shone in her very best phase that day and came in and went out quite a living catherinewheel of compliments delight and affability half purposely and half to ask some question about schoolbusiness i followed her to the carriage and looked in after she was seated and the door closed in that brief fraction of time what a change had been wrought an instant ago all sparkles and jests she now sat sterner than a judge and graver than a sage strange little woman  i went back and teased dr john about madames devotion to him how he laughed what fun shone in his eyes as he recalled some of her fine speeches and repeated them imitating her voluble delivery he had an acute sense of humour and was the finest company in the worldwhen he could forget miss fanshawe                                       to sit in sunshine calm and sweet is said to be excellent for weak people it gives them vital force when little georgette beck was recovering from her illness i used to take her in my arms and walk with her in the garden by the hour together beneath a certain wall hung with grapes which the southern sun was ripening that sun cherished her little pale frame quite as effectually as it mellowed and swelled the clustering fruit  there are human tempers bland glowing and genial within whose influence it is as good for the poor in spirit to live as it is for the feeble in frame to bask in the glow of noon of the number of these choice natures were certainly both dr brettons and his mothers they liked to communicate happiness as some like to occasion misery they did it instinctively without fuss and apparently with little consciousness the means to give pleasure rose spontaneously in their minds every day while i stayed with them some little plan was proposed which resulted in beneficial enjoyment fully occupied as was dr johns time he still made it in his way to accompany us in each brief excursion i can hardly tell how he managed his engagements they were numerous yet by dint of system he classed them in an order which left him a daily period of liberty i often saw him hardworked yet seldom overdriven and never irritated confused or oppressed what he did was accomplished with the ease and grace of allsufficing strength with the bountiful cheerfulness of high and unbroken energies under his guidance i saw in that one happy fortnight more of villette its environs and its inhabitants than i had seen in the whole eight months of my previous residence he took me to places of interest in the town of whose names i had not before so much as heard with willingness and spirit he communicates much noteworthy information he never seemed to think it a trouble to talk to me and i am sure it was never a task to me to listen it was not his way to treat subjects coldly and vaguely he rarely generalized never prosed he seemed to like nice details almost as much as i liked them myself he seemed observant of character and not superficially observant either these points gave the quality of interest to his discourse and the fact of his speaking direct from his own resources and not borrowing or stealing from bookshere a dry fact and there a trite phrase and elsewhere a hackneyed opinionensured a freshness as welcome as it was rare before my eyes too his disposition seemed to unfold another phase to pass to a fresh day to rise in new and nobler dawn  his mother possessed a good development of benevolence but he owned a better and larger i found on accompanying him to the bassevillethe poor and crowded quarter of the citythat his errands there were as much those of the philanthropist as the physician i understood presently that cheerfully habitually and in singleminded unconsciousness of any special merit distinguishing his deedshe was achieving amongst a very wretched population a world of active good the lower orders liked him well his poor patients in the hospitals welcomed him with a sort of enthusiasm  but stopi must not from the faithful narrator degenerate into the partial eulogist well full well do i know that dr john was not perfect anymore than i am perfect human fallibility leavened him throughout there was no hour and scarcely a moment of the time i spent with him that in act or speech or look he did not betray something that was not of a god a god could not have the cruel vanity of dr john nor his sometime levity no immortal could have resembled him in his occasional temporary oblivion of all but the presentin his passing passion for that present shown not coarsely by devoting it to material indulgence but selfishly by extracting from it whatever it could yield of nutriment to his masculine selflove his delight was to feed that ravenous sentiment without thought of the price of provender or care for the cost of keeping it sleek and highpampered  the reader is requested to note a seeming contradiction in the two views which have been given of graham brettonthe public and privatethe outdoor and the indoor view in the first the public he is shown oblivious of self as modest in the display of his energies as earnest in their exercise in the second the fireside picture there is expressed consciousness of what he has and what he is pleasure in homage some recklessness in exciting some vanity in receiving the same both portraits are correct  it was hardly possible to oblige dr john quietly and in secret when you thought that the fabrication of some trifle dedicated to his use had been achieved unnoticed and that like other men he would use it when placed ready for his use and never ask whence it came he amazed you by a smilinglyuttered observation or two proving that his eye had been on the work from commencement to close that he had noted the design traced its progress and marked its completion it pleased him to be thus served and he let his pleasure beam in his eye and play about his mouth  this would have been all very well if he had not added to such kindly and unobtrusive evidence a certain wilfulness in discharging what he called debts when his mother worked for him he paid her by showering about her his bright animal spirits with even more affluence than his gay taunting teasing loving wont if lucy snowe were discovered to have put her hand to such work he planned in recompence some pleasant recreation  i often felt amazed at his perfect knowledge of villette a knowledge not merely confined to its open streets but penetrating to all its galleries salles and cabinets of every door which shut in an object worth seeing of every museum of every hall sacred to art or science he seemed to possess the open sesame i never had a head for science but an ignorant blind fond instinct inclined me to art i liked to visit the picturegalleries and i dearly liked to be left there alone in company a wretched idiosyncracy forbade me to see much or to feel anything in unfamiliar company where it was necessary to maintain a flow of talk on the subjects in presence half an hour would knock me up with a combined pressure of physical lassitude and entire mental incapacity i never yet saw the wellreared child much less the educated adult who could not put me to shame by the sustained intelligence of its demeanour under the ordeal of a conversable sociable visitation of pictures historical sights or buildings or any lions of public interest dr bretton was a cicerone after my own heart he would take me betimes ere the galleries were filled leave me there for two or three hours and call for me when his own engagements were discharged meantime i was happy happy not always in admiring but in examining questioning and forming conclusions in the commencement of these visits there was some misunderstanding and consequent struggle between will and power the former faculty exacted approbation of that which it was considered orthodox to admire the latter groaned forth its utter inability to pay the tax it was then selfsneered at spurred up goaded on to refine its taste and whet its zest the more it was chidden however the more it wouldnt praise discovering gradually that a wonderful sense of fatigue resulted from these conscientious efforts i began to reflect whether i might not dispense with that great labour and concluded eventually that i might and so sank supine into a luxury of calm before ninetynine out of a hundred of the exhibited frames  it seemed to me that an original and good picture was just as scarce as an original and good book nor did i in the end tremble to say to myself standing before certain chefdoeuvres bearing great names these are not a whit like nature natures daylight never had that colour never was made so turbid either by storm or cloud as it is laid out there under a sky of indigo and that indigo is not ether and those dark weeds plastered upon it are not trees several very well executed and complacentlooking fat women struck me as by no means the goddesses they appeared to consider themselves many scores of marvellouslyfinished little flemish pictures and also of sketches excellent for fashionbooks displaying varied costumes in the handsomest materials gave evidence of laudable industry whimsically applied and yet there were fragments of truth here and there which satisfied the conscience and gleams of light that cheered the vision natures power here broke through in a mountain snowstorm and there her glory in a sunny southern day an expression in this portrait proved clear insight into character a face in that historical painting by its vivid filial likeness startlingly reminded you that genius gave it birth these exceptions i loved they grew dear as friends  one day at a quiet early hour i found myself nearly alone in a certain gallery wherein one particular picture of portentous size set up in the best light having a cordon of protection stretched before it and a cushioned bench duly set in front for the accommodation of worshipping connoisseurs who having gazed themselves off their feet might be fain to complete the business sitting this picture i say seemed to consider itself the queen of the collection  it represented a woman considerably larger i thought than the life i calculated that this lady put into a scale of magnitude suitable for the reception of a commodity of bulk would infallibly turn from fourteen to sixteen stone she was indeed extremely well fed very much butchers meatto say nothing of bread vegetables and liquidsmust she have consumed to attain that breadth and height that wealth of muscle that affluence of flesh she lay halfreclined on a couch why it would be difficult to say broad daylight blazed round her she appeared in hearty health strong enough to do the work of two plain cooks she could not plead a weak spine she ought to have been standing or at least sitting bolt upright she had no business to lounge away the noon on a sofa she ought likewise to have worn decent garments a gown covering her properly which was not the case out of abundance of materialsevenandtwenty yards i should say of draperyshe managed to make inefficient raiment then for the wretched untidiness surrounding her there could be no excuse pots and pansperhaps i ought to say vases and gobletswere rolled here and there on the foreground a perfect rubbish of flowers was mixed amongst them and an absurd and disorderly mass of curtain upholstery smothered the couch and cumbered the floor on referring to the catalogue i found that this notable production bore the name cleopatra  well i was sitting wondering at it as the bench was there i thought i might as well take advantage of its accommodation and thinking that while some of the detailsas roses gold cups jewels c were very prettily painted it was on the whole an enormous piece of claptrap the room almost vacant when i entered began to fill scarcely noticing this circumstance as indeed it did not matter to me i retained my seat rather to rest myself than with a view to studying this huge darkcomplexioned gipsyqueen of whom indeed i soon tired and betook myself for refreshment to the contemplation of some exquisite little pictures of still life wildflowers wildfruit mossy woodnests casketing eggs that looked like pearls seen through clear green seawater all hung modestly beneath that coarse and preposterous canvas  suddenly a light tap visited my shoulder starting turning i met a face bent to encounter mine a frowning almost a shocked face it was  que faitesvous ici said a voice  mais monsieur je mamuse  vous vous amusez et à quoi sil vous plait mais dabord faitesmoi le plaisir de vous lever prenez mon bras et allons de lautre côté  i did precisely as i was bid m paul emanuel it was he returned from rome and now a travelled man was not likely to be less tolerant of insubordination now than before this added distinction laurelled his temples  permit me to conduct you to your party said he as we crossed the room  i have no party  you are not alone  yes monsieur  did you come here unaccompanied  no monsieur dr bretton brought me here  dr bretton and madame his mother of course  no only dr bretton  and he told you to look at that picture  by no means i found it out for myself  m pauls hair was shorn close as raven down or i think it would have bristled on his head beginning now to perceive his drift i had a certain pleasure in keeping cool and working him up  astounding insular audacity cried the professor singulières femmes que ces anglaises  what is the matter monsieur  matter how dare you a young person sit coolly down with the selfpossession of a garçon and look at that picture  it is a very ugly picture but i cannot at all see why i should not look at it  bon bon speak no more of it but you ought not to be here alone  if however i have no societyno party as you say and then what does it signify whether i am alone or accompanied nobody meddles with me  taisezvous et asseyezvous làlàsetting down a chair with emphasis in a particularly dull corner before a series of most specially dreary cadres  mais monsieur  mais mademoiselle asseyezvous et ne bougez pasentendezvousjusquà ce quon vienne vous chercher ou que je vous donne la permission  quel triste coin cried i et quelles laids tableaux  and laids indeed they were being a set of four denominated in the catalogue la vie dune femme they were painted rather in a remarkable styleflat dead pale and formal the first represented a jeune fille coming out of a churchdoor a missal in her hand her dress very prim her eyes cast down her mouth pursed upthe image of a most villanous little precocious shehypocrite the second a mariée with a long white veil kneeling at a priedieu in her chamber holding her hands plastered together finger to finger and showing the whites of her eyes in a most exasperating manner the third a jeune mère hanging disconsolate over a clayey and puffy baby with a face like an unwholesome full moon the fourth a veuve being a black woman holding by the hand a black little girl and the twain studiously surveying an elegant french monument set up in a corner of some père la chaise all these four anges were grim and grey as burglars and cold and vapid as ghosts what women to live with insincere illhumoured bloodless brainless nonentities as bad in their way as the indolent gipsygiantess the cleopatra in hers  it was impossible to keep ones attention long confined to these masterpieces and so by degrees i veered round and surveyed the gallery  a perfect crowd of spectators was by this time gathered round the lioness from whose vicinage i had been banished nearly half this crowd were ladies but m paul afterwards told me these were des dames and it was quite proper for them to contemplate what no demoiselle ought to glance at i assured him plainly i could not agree in this doctrine and did not see the sense of it whereupon with his usual absolutism he merely requested my silence and also in the same breath denounced my mingled rashness and ignorance a more despotic little man than m paul never filled a professors chair i noticed by the way that he looked at the picture himself quite at his ease and for a very long while he did not however neglect to glance from time to time my way in order i suppose to make sure that i was obeying orders and not breaking bounds byandby he again accosted me  had i not been ill he wished to know he understood i had  yes but i was now quite well  where had i spent the vacation  chiefly in the rue fossette partly with madame bretton  he had heard that i was left alone in the rue fossette was that so  not quite alone marie broc the crétin was with me  he shrugged his shoulders varied and contradictory expressions played rapidly over his countenance marie broc was well known to m paul he never gave a lesson in the third division containing the least advanced pupils that she did not occasion in him a sharp conflict between antagonistic impressions her personal appearance her repulsive manners her often unmanageable disposition irritated his temper and inspired him with strong antipathy a feeling he was too apt to conceive when his taste was offended or his will thwarted on the other hand her misfortunes constituted a strong claim on his forbearance and compassionsuch a claim as it was not in his nature to deny hence resulted almost daily drawn battles between impatience and disgust on the one hand pity and a sense of justice on the other in which to his credit be it said it was very seldom that the former feelings prevailed when they did however m paul showed a phase of character which had its terrors his passions were strong his aversions and attachments alike vivid the force he exerted in holding both in check by no means mitigated an observers sense of their vehemence with such tendencies it may well be supposed he often excited in ordinary minds fear and dislike yet it was an error to fear him nothing drove him so nearly frantic as the tremor of an apprehensive and distrustful spirit nothing soothed him like confidence tempered with gentleness to evince these sentiments however required a thorough comprehension of his nature and his nature was of an order rarely comprehended  how did you get on with marie broc he asked after some minutes silence  monsieur i did my best but it was terrible to be alone with her  you have then a weak heart you lack courage and perhaps charity yours are not the qualities which might constitute a sister of mercy  he was a religious little man in his way the selfdenying and selfsacrificing part of the catholic religion commanded the homage of his soul  i dont know indeed i took as good care of her as i could but when her aunt came to fetch her away it was a great relief  ah you are an egotist there are women who have nursed hospitalsfull of similar unfortunates you could not do that  could monsieur do it himself  women who are worthy the name ought infinitely to surpass our coarse fallible selfindulgent sex in the power to perform such duties  i washed her i kept her clean i fed her i tried to amuse her but she made mouths at me instead of speaking  you think you did great things  no but as great as i could do  then limited are your powers for in tending one idiot you fell sick  not with that monsieur i had a nervous fever my mind was ill  vraiment vous valez peu de chose you are not cast in an heroic mould your courage will not avail to sustain you in solitude it merely gives you the temerity to gaze with sangfroid at pictures of cleopatra  it would have been easy to show anger at the teasing hostile tone of the little man i had never been angry with him yet however and had no present disposition to begin  cleopatra i repeated quietly monsieur too has been looking at cleopatra what does he think of her  cela ne vaut rien he responded une femme superbeune taille dimpératrice des formes de junon mais une personne dont je ne voudrais ni pour femme ni pour fille ni pour soeur aussi vous ne jeterez plus un seul coup doeil de sa côté  but i have looked at her a great many times while monsieur has been talking i can see her quite well from this corner  turn to the wall and study your four pictures of a womans life  excuse me m paul they are too hideous but if you admire them allow me to vacate my seat and leave you to their contemplation  mademoiselle he said grimacing a halfsmile or what he intended for a smile though it was but a grim and hurried manifestation you nurslings of protestantism astonish me you unguarded englishwomen walk calmly amidst redhot ploughshares and escape burning i believe if some of you were thrown into nebuchadnezzars hottest furnace you would issue forth untraversed by the smell of fire  will monsieur have the goodness to move an inch to one side  how at what are you gazing now you are not recognising an acquaintance amongst that group of jeunes gens  i think soyes i see there a person i know  in fact i had caught a glimpse of a head too pretty to belong to any other than the redoubted colonel de hamal what a very finished highly polished little pate it was what a figure so trim and natty what womanish feet and hands how daintily he held a glass to one of his optics with what admiration he gazed upon the cleopatra and then how engagingly he tittered and whispered a friend at his elbow oh the man of sense oh the refined gentleman of superior taste and tact i observed him for about ten minutes and perceived that he was exceedingly taken with this dusk and portly venus of the nile so much was i interested in his bearing so absorbed in divining his character by his looks and movements i temporarily forgot m paul in the interim a group came between that gentleman and me or possibly his scruples might have received another and worse shock from my present abstraction causing him to withdraw voluntarily at any rate when i again looked round he was gone  my eye pursuant of the search met not him but another and dissimilar figure well seen amidst the crowd for the height as well as the port lent each its distinction this way came dr john in visage in shape in hue as unlike the dark acerb and caustic little professor as the fruit of the hesperides might be unlike the sloe in the wild thicket as the highcouraged but tractable arabian is unlike the rude and stubborn sheltie he was looking for me but had not yet explored the corner where the schoolmaster had just put me i remained quiet yet another minute i would watch  he approached de hamal he paused near him i thought he had a pleasure in looking over his head dr bretton too gazed on the cleopatra i doubt if it were to his taste he did not simper like the little count his mouth looked fastidious his eye cool without demonstration he stepped aside leaving room for others to approach i saw now that he was waiting and rising i joined him  we took one turn round the gallery with graham it was very pleasant to take such a turn i always liked dearly to hear what he had to say about either pictures or books because without pretending to be a connoisseur he always spoke his thought and that was sure to be fresh very often it was also just and pithy it was pleasant also to tell him some things he did not knowhe listened so kindly so teachably unformalized by scruples lest so to bend his bright handsome head to gather a womans rather obscure and stammering explanation should imperil the dignity of his manhood and when he communicated information in return it was with a lucid intelligence that left all his words clear graven on the memory no explanation of his giving no fact of his narrating did i ever forget  as we left the gallery i asked him what he thought of the cleopatra after making him laugh by telling him how professor emanuel had sent me to the right about and taking him to see the sweet series of pictures recommended to my attention  pooh said he my mother is a betterlooking woman i heard some french fops yonder designating her as le type du voluptueux if so i can only say le voluptueux is little to my liking compare that mulatto with ginevra     chapter xx  the concert   one morning mrs bretton coming promptly into my room desired me to open my drawers and show her my dresses which i did without a word  that will do said she when she had turned them over you must have a new one  she went out she returned presently with a dressmaker she had me measured i mean said she to follow my own taste and to have my own way in this little matter  two days after came homea pink dress  that is not for me i said hurriedly feeling that i would almost as soon clothe myself in the costume of a chinese lady of rank  we shall see whether it is for you or not rejoined my godmother adding with her resistless decision mark my words you will wear it this very evening  i thought i should not i thought no human force should avail to put me into it a pink dress i knew it not it knew not me i had not proved it  my godmother went on to decree that i was to go with her and graham to a concert that same night which concert she explained was a grand affair to be held in the large salle or hall of the principal musical society the most advanced of the pupils of the conservatoire were to perform it was to be followed by a lottery au bénéfice des pauvres and to crown all the king queen and prince of labassecour were to be present graham in sending tickets had enjoined attention to costume as a compliment due to royalty he also recommended punctual readiness by seven oclock  about six i was ushered upstairs without any force at all i found myself led and influenced by anothers will unconsulted unpersuaded quietly overruled in short the pink dress went on softened by some drapery of black lace i was pronounced to be en grande tenue and requested to look in the glass i did so with some fear and trembling with more fear and trembling i turned away seven oclock struck dr bretton was come my godmother and i went down she was clad in brown velvet as i walked in her shadow how i envied her those folds of grave dark majesty graham stood in the drawingroom doorway  i do hope he will not think i have been decking myself out to draw attention was my uneasy aspiration  here lucy are some flowers said he giving me a bouquet he took no further notice of my dress than was conveyed in a kind smile and satisfied nod which calmed at once my sense of shame and fear of ridicule for the rest the dress was made with extreme simplicity guiltless of flounce or furbelow it was but the light fabric and bright tint which scared me and since graham found in it nothing absurd my own eye consented soon to become reconciled  i suppose people who go every night to places of public amusement can hardly enter into the fresh gala feeling with which an opera or a concert is enjoyed by those for whom it is a rarity i am not sure that i expected great pleasure from the concert having but a very vague notion of its nature but i liked the drive there well the snug comfort of the close carriage on a cold though fine night the pleasure of setting out with companions so cheerful and friendly the sight of the stars glinting fitfully through the trees as we rolled along the avenue then the freer burst of the nightsky when we issued forth to the open chaussée the passage through the city gates the lights there burning the guards there posted the pretence of inspection to which we there submitted and which amused us so muchall these small matters had for me in their novelty a peculiarly exhilarating charm how much of it lay in the atmosphere of friendship diffused about me i know not dr john and his mother were both in their finest mood contending animatedly with each other the whole way and as frankly kind to me as if i had been of their kin  our way lay through some of the best streets of villette streets brightly lit and far more lively now than at high noon how brilliant seemed the shops how glad gay and abundant flowed the tide of life along the broad pavement while i looked the thought of the rue fossette came across meof the walledin garden and schoolhouse and of the dark vast classes where as at this very hour it was my wont to wander all solitary gazing at the stars through the high blindless windows and listening to the distant voice of the reader in the refectory monotonously exercised upon the lecture pieuse thus must i soon again listen and wander and this shadow of the future stole with timely sobriety across the radiant present  by this time we had got into a current of carriages all tending in one direction and soon the front of a great illuminated building blazed before us of what i should see within this building i had as before intimated but an imperfect idea for no place of public entertainment had it ever been my lot to enter yet  we alighted under a portico where there was a great bustle and a great crowd but i do not distinctly remember further details until i found myself mounting a majestic staircase wide and easy of ascent deeply and softly carpeted with crimson leading up to great doors closed solemnly and whose panels were also crimsonclothed  i hardly noticed by what magic these doors were made to roll backdr john managed these points roll back they did however and within was disclosed a hallgrand wide and high whose sweeping circular walls and domed hollow ceiling seemed to me all dead gold thus with nice art was it stained relieved by cornicing fluting and garlandry either bright like gold burnished or snowwhite like alabaster or white and gold mingled in wreaths of gilded leaves and spotless lilies wherever drapery hung wherever carpets were spread or cushions placed the sole colour employed was deep crimson pendent from the dome flamed a mass that dazzled mea mass i thought of rockcrystal sparkling with facets streaming with drops ablaze with stars and gorgeously tinged with dews of gems dissolved or fragments of rainbows shivered it was only the chandelier reader but for me it seemed the work of eastern genii i almost looked to see if a huge dark cloudy handthat of the slave of the lampwere not hovering in the lustrous and perfumed atmosphere of the cupola guarding its wondrous treasure  we moved oni was not at all conscious whitherbut at some turn we suddenly encountered another party approaching from the opposite direction i just now see that group as it flashedupon me for one moment a handsome middleaged lady in dark velvet a gentleman who might be her sonthe best face the finest figure i thought i had ever seen a third person in a pink dress and black lace mantle  i noted them allthe third person as well as the other twoand for the fraction of a moment believed them all strangers thus receiving an impartial impression of their appearance but the impression was hardly felt and not fixed before the consciousness that i faced a great mirror filling a compartment between two pillars dispelled it the party was our own party thus for the first and perhaps only time in my life i enjoyed the giftie of seeing myself as others see me no need to dwell on the result it brought a jar of discord a pang of regret it was not flattering yet after all i ought to be thankful it might have been worse  at last we were seated in places commanding a good general view of that vast and dazzling but warm and cheerful hall already it was filled and filled with a splendid assemblage i do not know that the women were very beautiful but their dresses were so perfect and foreigners even such as are ungraceful in domestic privacy seem to posses the art of appearing graceful in public however blunt and boisterous those everyday and home movements connected with peignoir and papillotes there is a slide a bend a carriage of the head and arms a mien of the mouth and eyes kept nicely in reserve for gala usealways brought out with the grande toilette and duly put on with the parure  some fine forms there were here and there models of a peculiar style of beauty a style i think never seen in england a solid firmset sculptural style these shapes have no angles a caryatid in marble is almost as flexible a phidian goddess is not more perfect in a certain still and stately sort they have such features as the dutch painters give to their madonnas lowcountry classic features regular but round straight but stolid and for their depth of expressionless calm of passionless peace a polar snowfield could alone offer a type women of this order need no ornament and they seldom wear any the smooth hair closely braided supplies a sufficient contrast to the smoother cheek and brow the dress cannot be too simple the rounded arm and perfect neck require neither bracelet nor chain  with one of these beauties i once had the honour and rapture to be perfectly acquainted the inert force of the deep settled love she bore herself was wonderful it could only be surpassed by her proud impotency to care for any other living thing of blood her cool veins conducted no flow placid lymph filled and almost obstructed her arteries  such a juno as i have described sat full in our viewa sort of mark for all eyes and quite conscious that so she was but proof to the magnetic influence of gaze or glance cold rounded blonde and beauteous as the white column capitalled with gilding which rose at her side  observing that dr johns attention was much drawn towards her i entreated him in a low voice for the love of heaven to shield well his heart you need not fall in love with that lady i said because i tell you beforehand you might die at her feet and she would not love you again  very well said he and how do you know that the spectacle of her grand insensibility might not with me be the strongest stimulus to homage the sting of desperation is i think a wonderful irritant to my emotions but shrugging his shoulders you know nothing about these things ill address myself to my mother mamma im in a dangerous way  as if that interested me said mrs bretton  alas the cruelty of my lot responded her son never man had a more unsentimental mother than mine she never seems to think that such a calamity can befall her as a daughterinlaw  if i dont it is not for want of having that same calamity held over my head you have threatened me with it for the last ten years mamma i am going to be married soon was the cry before you were well out of jackets  but mother one of these days it will be realized all of a sudden when you think you are most secure i shall go forth like jacob or esau or any other patriarch and take me a wife perhaps of these which are of the daughters of the land  at your peril john graham that is all  this mother of mine means me to be an old bachelor what a jealous old lady it is but now just look at that splendid creature in the pale blue satin dress and hair of paler brown with reflets satinés as those of her robe would you not feel proud mamma if i were to bring that goddess home some day and introduce her to you as mrs bretton junior  you will bring no goddess to la terrasse that little château will not contain two mistresses especially if the second be of the height bulk and circumference of that mighty doll in wood and wax and kid and satin  mamma she would fill your blue chair so admirably  fill my chair i defy the foreign usurper a rueful chair should it be for her but hush john graham hold your tongue and use your eyes  during the above skirmish the hall which i had thought seemed full at the entrance continued to admit party after party until the semicircle before the stage presented one dense mass of heads sloping from floor to ceiling the stage too or rather the wide temporary platform larger than any stage desert half an hour since was now overflowing with life round two grand pianos placed about the centre a white flock of young girls the pupils of the conservatoire had noiselessly poured i had noticed their gathering while graham and his mother were engaged in discussing the belle in blue satin and had watched with interest the process of arraying and marshalling them two gentlemen in each of whom i recognised an acquaintance officered this virgin troop one an artisticlooking man bearded and with long hair was a noted pianiste and also the first musicteacher in villette he attended twice a week at madame becks pensionnat to give lessons to the few pupils whose parents were rich enough to allow their daughters the privilege of his instructions his name was m josef emanuel and he was halfbrother to m paul which potent personage was now visible in the person of the second gentleman  m paul amused me i smiled to myself as i watched him he seemed so thoroughly in his elementstanding conspicuous in presence of a wide and grand assemblage arranging restraining overaweing about one hundred young ladies he was too so perfectly in earnestso energetic so intent and above all so absolute and yet what business had he there what had he to do with music or the conservatoirehe who could hardly distinguish one note from another i knew that it was his love of display and authority which had brought him therea love not offensive only because so naive it presently became obvious that his brother m josef was as much under his control as were the girls themselves never was such a little hawk of a man as that m paul ere long some noted singers and musicians dawned upon the platform as these stars rose the cometlike professor set insufferable to him were all notorieties and celebrities where he could not outshine he fled  and now all was prepared but one compartment of the hall waited to be filleda compartment covered with crimson like the grand staircase and doors furnished with stuffed and cushioned benches ranged on each side of two regal chairs placed solemnly under a canopy  a signal was given the doors rolled back the assembly stood up the orchestra burst out and to the welcome of a choral burst enter the king the queen the court of labassecour  till then i had never set eyes on living king or queen it may consequently be conjectured how i strained my powers of vision to take in these specimens of european royalty by whomsoever majesty is beheld for the first time there will always be experienced a vague surprise bordering on disappointment that the same does not appear seated en permanence on a throne bonneted with a crown and furnished as to the hand with a sceptre looking out for a king and queen and seeing only a middleaged soldier and a rather young lady i felt half cheated half pleased  well do i recall that kinga man of fifty a little bowed a little grey there was no face in all that assembly which resembled his i had never read never been told anything of his nature or his habits and at first the strong hieroglyphics graven as with iron stylet on his brow round his eyes beside his mouth puzzled and baffled instinct ere long however if i did not know at least i felt the meaning of those characters written without hand there sat a silent sufferera nervous melancholy man those eyes had looked on the visits of a certain ghosthad long waited the comings and goings of that strangest spectre hypochondria perhaps he saw her now on that stage over against him amidst all that brilliant throng hypochondria has that wont to rise in the midst of thousandsdark as doom pale as malady and wellnigh strong as death her comrade and victim thinks to be happy one momentnot so says she i come and she freezes the blood in his heart and beclouds the light in his eye  some might say it was the foreign crown pressing the kings brows which bent them to that peculiar and painful fold some might quote the effects of early bereavement something there might be of both these but these are embittered by that darkest foe of humanityconstitutional melancholy the queen his wife knew this it seemed to me the reflection of her husbands grief lay a subduing shadow on her own benignant face a mild thoughtful graceful woman that princess seemed not beautiful not at all like the women of solid charms and marble feelings described a page or two since hers was a somewhat slender shape her features though distinguished enough were too suggestive of reigning dynasties and royal lines to give unqualified pleasure the expression clothing that profile was agreeable in the present instance but you could not avoid connecting it with remembered effigies where similar lines appeared under phase ignoble feeble or sensual or cunning as the case might be the queens eye however was her own and pity goodness sweet sympathy blessed it with divinest light she moved no sovereign but a ladykind loving elegant her little son the prince of labassecour and young duc de dindonneau accompanied her he leaned on his mothers knee and ever and anon in the course of that evening i saw her observant of the monarch at her side conscious of his beclouded abstraction and desirous to rouse him from it by drawing his attention to their son she often bent her head to listen to the boys remarks and would then smilingly repeat them to his sire the moody king started listened smiled but invariably relapsed as soon as his good angel ceased speaking full mournful and significant was that spectacle not the less so because both for the aristocracy and the honest bourgeoisie of labassecour its peculiarity seemed to be wholly invisible i could not discover that one soul present was either struck or touched  with the king and queen had entered their court comprising two or three foreign ambassadors and with them came the elite of the foreigners then resident in villette these took possession of the crimson benches the ladies were seated most of the men remained standing their sable rank lining the background looked like a dark foil to the splendour displayed in front nor was this splendour without varying light and shade and gradation the middle distance was filled with matrons in velvets and satins in plumes and gems the benches in the foreground to the queens right hand seemed devoted exclusively to young girls the flowerperhaps i should rather say the budof villette aristocracy here were no jewels no headdresses no velvet pile or silken sheen purity simplicity and aërial grace reigned in that virgin band young heads simply braided and fair forms i was going to write sylph forms but that would have been quite untrue several of these jeunes filles who had not numbered more than sixteen or seventeen years boasted contours as robust and solid as those of a stout englishwoman of fiveandtwentyfair forms robed in white or pale rose or placid blue suggested thoughts of heaven and angels i knew a couple at least of these rose et blanche specimens of humanity here was a pair of madame becks late pupilsmesdemoiselles mathilde and angélique pupils who during their last year at school ought to have been in the first class but whose brains never got them beyond the second division in english they had been under my own charge and hard work it was to get them to translate rationally a page of the vicar of wakefield also during three months i had one of them for my visàvis at table and the quantity of household bread butter and stewed fruit she would habitually consume at second déjeuner was a real worlds wonderto be exceeded only by the fact of her actually pocketing slices she could not eat here be truthswholesome truths too  i knew another of these seraphsthe prettiest or at any rate the least demure and hypocritical looking of the lot she was seated by the daughter of an english peer also an honest though haughtylooking girl both had entered in the suite of the british embassy she ie my acquaintance had a slight pliant figure not at all like the forms of the foreign damsels her hair too was not closebraided like a shell or a skullcap of satin it looked like hair and waved from her head long curled and flowing she chatted away volubly and seemed full of a lightheaded sort of satisfaction with herself and her position i did not look at dr bretton but i knew that he too saw ginevra fanshawe he had become so quiet he answered so briefly his mothers remarks he so often suppressed a sigh why should he sigh he had confessed a taste for the pursuit of love under difficulties here was full gratification for that taste his ladylove beamed upon him from a sphere above his own he could not come near her he was not certain that he could win from her a look i watched to see if she would so far favour him our seat was not far from the crimson benches we must inevitably be seen thence by eyes so quick and roving as miss fanshawes and very soon those optics of hers were upon us at least upon dr and mrs bretton i kept rather in the shade and out of sight not wishing to be immediately recognised she looked quite steadily at dr john and then she raised a glass to examine his mother a minute or two afterwards she laughingly whispered her neighbour upon the performance commencing her rambling attention was attracted to the platform  on the concert i need not dwell the reader would not care to have my impressions thereanent and indeed it would not be worth while to record them as they were the impressions of an ignorance crasse the young ladies of the conservatoire being very much frightened made rather a tremulous exhibition on the two grand pianos m josef emanuel stood by them while they played but he had not the tact or influence of his kinsman who under similar circumstances would certainly have compelled pupils of his to demean themselves with heroism and selfpossession m paul would have placed the hysteric débutantes between two firesterror of the audience and terror of himselfand would have inspired them with the courage of desperation by making the latter terror incomparably the greater m josef could not do this  following the white muslin pianistes came a fine fullgrown sulky lady in white satin she sang her singing just affected me like the tricks of a conjuror i wondered how she did ithow she made her voice run up and down and cut such marvellous capers but a simple scotch melody played by a rude street minstrel has often moved me more deeply  afterwards stepped forth a gentleman who bending his body a good deal in the direction of the king and queen and frequently approaching his whitegloved hand to the region of his heart vented a bitter outcry against a certain fausse isabelle i thought he seemed especially to solicit the queens sympathy but unless i am egregiously mistaken her majesty lent her attention rather with the calm of courtesy than the earnestness of interest this gentlemans state of mind was very harrowing and i was glad when he wound up his musical exposition of the same  some rousing choruses struck me as the best part of the evenings entertainment there were present deputies from all the best provincial choral societies genuine barrelshaped native labassecouriens these worthies gave voice without mincing the matter their hearty exertions had at least this good resultthe ear drank thence a satisfying sense of power  through the whole performancetimid instrumental duets conceited vocal solos sonorous brasslunged chorusesmy attention gave but one eye and one ear to the stage the other being permanently retained in the service of dr bretton i could not forget him nor cease to question how he was feeling what he was thinking whether he was amused or the contrary at last he spoke  and how do you like it all lucy you are very quiet he said in his own cheerful tone  i am quiet i said because i am so very very much interested not merely with the music but with everything about me  he then proceeded to make some further remarks with so much equanimity and composure that i began to think he had really not seen what i had seen and i whisperedmiss fanshawe is here have you noticed her  oh yes and i observed that you noticed her too  is she come with mrs cholmondeley do you think  mrs cholmondeley is there with a very grand party yes ginevra was in her train and mrs cholmondeley was in lady s train who was in the queens train if this were not one of the compact little minor european courts whose very formalities are little more imposing than familiarities and whose gala grandeur is but homeliness in sunday array it would sound all very fine  ginevra saw you i think  so do i think so i have had my eye on her several times since you withdrew yours and i have had the honour of witnessing a little spectacle which you were spared  i did not ask what i waited voluntary information which was presently given  miss fanshawe he said has a companion with hera lady of rank i happen to know lady sara by sight her noble mother has called me in professionally she is a proud girl but not in the least insolent and i doubt whether ginevra will have gained ground in her estimation by making a butt of her neighbours  what neighbours  merely myself and my mother as to me it is all very natural nothing i suppose can be fairer game than the young bourgeois doctor but my mother i never saw her ridiculed before do you know the curling lip and sarcastically levelled glass thus directed gave me a most curious sensation  think nothing of it dr john it is not worth while if ginevra were in a giddy mood as she is eminently tonight she would make no scruple of laughing at that mild pensive queen or that melancholy king she is not actuated by malevolence but sheer heedless folly to a featherbrained schoolgirl nothing is sacred  but you forget i have not been accustomed to look on miss fanshawe in the light of a featherbrained schoolgirl was she not my divinitythe angel of my career  hem there was your mistake  to speak the honest truth without any false rant or assumed romance there actually was a moment six months ago when i thought her divine do you remember our conversation about the presents i was not quite open with you in discussing that subject the warmth with which you took it up amused me by way of having the full benefit of your lights i allowed you to think me more in the dark than i really was it was that test of the presents which first proved ginevra mortal still her beauty retained its fascination three daysthree hours ago i was very much her slave as she passed me tonight triumphant in beauty my emotions did her homage but for one luckless sneer i should yet be the humblest of her servants she might have scoffed at me and while wounding she would not soon have alienated me through myself she could not in ten years have done what in a moment she has done through my mother  he held his peace awhile never before had i seen so much fire and so little sunshine in dr johns blue eye as just now  lucy he recommenced look well at my mother and say without fear or favour in what light she now appears to you  as she always doesan english middleclass gentlewoman well though gravely dressed habitually independent of pretence constitutionally composed and cheerful  so she seems to mebless her the merry may laugh with mamma but the weak only will laugh at her she shall not be ridiculed with my consent at least nor without mymy scornmy antipathymy  he stopped and it was timefor he was getting excitedmore it seemed than the occasion warranted i did not then know that he had witnessed double cause for dissatisfaction with miss fanshawe the glow of his complexion the expansion of his nostril the bold curve which disdain gave his wellcut under lip showed him in a new and striking phase yet the rare passion of the constitutionally suave and serene is not a pleasant spectacle nor did i like the sort of vindictive thrill which passed through his strong young frame  do i frighten you lucy he asked  i cannot tell why you are so very angry  for this reason he muttered in my ear ginevra is neither a pure angel nor a pureminded woman  nonsense you exaggerate she has no great harm in her  too much for me i can see where you are blind now dismiss the subject let me amuse myself by teasing mamma i will assert that she is flagging mamma pray rouse yourself  john i will certainly rouse you if you are not better conducted will you and lucy be silent that i may hear the singing  they were then thundering in a chorus under cover of which all the previous dialogue had taken place  you hear the singing mamma now i will wager my studs which are genuine against your paste brooch  my paste brooch graham profane boy you know that it is a stone of value  oh that is one of your superstitions you were cheated in the business  i am cheated in fewer things than you imagine how do you happen to be acquainted with young ladies of the court john i have observed two of them pay you no small attention during the last halfhour  i wish you would not observe them  why not because one of them satirically levels her eyeglass at me she is a pretty silly girl but are you apprehensive that her titter will discomfit the old lady  the sensible admirable old lady mother you are better to me than ten wives yet  dont be demonstrative john or i shall faint and you will have to carry me out and if that burden were laid upon you you would reverse your last speech and exclaim mother ten wives could hardly be worse to me than you are                                       the concert over the lottery au bénéfice des pauvres came next the interval between was one of general relaxation and the pleasantest imaginable stir and commotion the white flock was cleared from the platform a busy throng of gentlemen crowded it instead making arrangements for the drawing and amongst thesethe busiest of allreappeared that certain wellknown form not tall but active alive with the energy and movement of three tall men how m paul did work how he issued directions and at the same time set his own shoulder to the wheel halfadozen assistants were at his beck to remove the pianos c no matter he must add to their strength his own the redundancy of his alertness was halfvexing halfludicrous in my mind i both disapproved and derided most of this fuss yet in the midst of prejudice and annoyance i could not while watching avoid perceiving a certain not disagreeable naïveté in all he did and said nor could i be blind to certain vigorous characteristics of his physiognomy rendered conspicuous now by the contrast with a throng of tamer faces the deep intent keenness of his eye the power of his forehead pale broad and fullthe mobility of his most flexible mouth he lacked the calm of force but its movement and its fire he signally possessed  meantime the whole hall was in a stir most people rose and remained standing for a change some walked about all talked and laughed the crimson compartment presented a peculiarly animated scene the long cloud of gentlemen breaking into fragments mixed with the rainbow line of ladies two or three officerlike men approached the king and conversed with him the queen leaving her chair glided along the rank of young ladies who all stood up as she passed and to each in turn i saw her vouchsafe some token of kindnessa gracious word look or smile to the two pretty english girls lady sara and ginevra fanshawe she addressed several sentences as she left them both and especially the latter seemed to glow all over with gratification they were afterwards accosted by several ladies and a little circle of gentlemen gathered round them amongst thesethe nearest to ginevrastood the count de hamal  this room is stiflingly hot said dr bretton rising with sudden impatience lucymotherwill you come a moment to the fresh air  go with him lucy said mrs bretton i would rather keep my seat  willingly would i have kept mine also but grahams desire must take precedence of my own i accompanied him  we found the nightair keen or at least i did he did not seem to feel it but it was very still and the starsown sky spread cloudless i was wrapped in a fur shawl we took some turns on the pavement in passing under a lamp graham encountered my eye  you look pensive lucy is it on my account  i was only fearing that you were grieved  not at all so be of good cheeras i am whenever i die lucy my persuasion is that it will not be of heartcomplaint i may be stung i may seem to droop for a time but no pain or malady of sentiment has yet gone through my whole system you have always seen me cheerful at home  generally  i am glad she laughed at my mother i would not give the old lady for a dozen beauties that sneer did me all the good in the world thank you miss fanshawe and he lifted his hat from his waved locks and made a mock reverence  yes he said i thank her she has made me feel that nine parts in ten of my heart have always been sound as a bell and the tenth bled from a mere puncture a lancetprick that will heal in a trice  you are angry just now heated and indignant you will think and feel differently tomorrow  i heated and indignant you dont know me on the contrary the heat is gone i am as cool as the nightwhich by the way may be too cool for you we will go back  dr john this is a sudden change  not it or if it be there are good reasons for ittwo good reasons i have told you one but now let us reenter  we did not easily regain our seats the lottery was begun and all was excited confusion crowds blocked the sort of corridor along which we had to pass it was necessary to pause for a time happening to glance roundindeed i half fancied i heard my name pronouncedi saw quite near the ubiquitous the inevitable m paul he was looking at me gravely and intently at me or rather at my pink dresssardonic comment on which gleamed in his eye now it was his habit to indulge in strictures on the dress both of the teachers and pupils at madame becksa habit which the former at least held to be an offensive impertinence as yet i had not suffered from itmy sombre daily attire not being calculated to attract notice i was in no mood to permit any new encroachment tonight rather than accept his banter i would ignore his presence and accordingly steadily turned my face to the sleeve of dr johns coat finding in that same black sleeve a prospect more redolent of pleasure and comfort more genial more friendly i thought than was offered by the dark little professors unlovely visage dr john seemed unconsciously to sanction the preference by looking down and saying in his kind voice ay keep close to my side lucy these crowding burghers are no respecters of persons  i could not however be true to myself yielding to some influence mesmeric or otherwisean influence unwelcome displeasing but effectivei again glanced round to see if m paul was gone no there he stood on the same spot looking still but with a changed eye he had penetrated my thought and read my wish to shun him the mocking but not illhumoured gaze was turned to a swarthy frown and when i bowed with a view to conciliation i got only the stiffest and sternest of nods in return  whom have you made angry lucy whispered dr bretton smiling who is that savagelooking friend of yours  one of the professors at madame becks a very cross little man  he looks mighty cross just now what have you done to him what is it all about ah lucy lucy tell me the meaning of this  no mystery i assure you m emanuel is very exigeant and because i looked at your coatsleeve instead of curtseying and dipping to him he thinks i have failed in respect  the little began dr john i know not what more he would have added for at that moment i was nearly thrown down amongst the feet of the crowd m paul had rudely pushed past and was elbowing his way with such utter disregard to the convenience and security of all around that a very uncomfortable pressure was the consequence  i think he is what he himself would call méchant said dr bretton i thought so too  slowly and with difficulty we made our way along the passage and at last regained our seats the drawing of the lottery lasted nearly an hour it was an animating and amusing scene and as we each held tickets we shared in the alternations of hope and fear raised by each turn of the wheel two little girls of five and six years old drew the numbers and the prizes were duly proclaimed from the platform these prizes were numerous though of small value it so fell out that dr john and i each gained one mine was a cigarcase his a ladys headdressa most airy sort of blue and silver turban with a streamer of plumage on one side like a snowy cloud he was excessively anxious to make an exchange but i could not be brought to hear reason and to this day i keep my cigarcase it serves when i look at it to remind me of old times and one happy evening  dr john for his part held his turban at arms length between his finger and thumb and looked at it with a mixture of reverence and embarrassment highly provocative of laughter the contemplation over he was about coolly to deposit the delicate fabric on the ground between his feet he seemed to have no shadow of an idea of the treatment or stowage it ought to receive if his mother had not come to the rescue i think he would finally have crushed it under his arm like an operahat she restored it to the bandbox whence it had issued  graham was quite cheerful all the evening and his cheerfulness seemed natural and unforced his demeanour his look is not easily described there was something in it peculiar and in its way original i read in it no common mastery of the passions and a fund of deep and healthy strength which without any exhausting effort bore down disappointment and extracted her fang his manner now reminded me of qualities i had noticed in him when professionally engaged amongst the poor the guilty and the suffering in the basseville he looked at once determined enduring and sweettempered who could help liking him he betrayed no weakness which harassed all your feelings with considerations as to how its faltering must be propped from him broke no irritability which startled calm and quenched mirth his lips let fall no caustic that burned to the bone his eye shot no morose shafts that went cold and rusty and venomed through your heart beside him was rest and refugearound him fostering sunshine  and yet he had neither forgiven nor forgotten miss fanshawe once angered i doubt if dr bretton were to be soon propitiatedonce alienated whether he were ever to be reclaimed he looked at her more than once not stealthily or humbly but with a movement of hardy open observation de hamal was now a fixture beside her mrs cholmondeley sat near and they and she were wholly absorbed in the discourse mirth and excitement with which the crimson seats were as much astir as any plebeian part of the hall in the course of some apparently animated discussion ginevra once or twice lifted her hand and arm a handsome bracelet gleamed upon the latter i saw that its gleam flickered in dr johns eyequickening therein a derisive ireful sparkle he laughed  i think he said i will lay my turban on my wonted altar of offerings there at any rate it would be certain to find favour no grisette has a more facile faculty of acceptance strange for after all i know she is a girl of family  but you dont know her education dr john said i tossed about all her life from one foreign school to another she may justly proffer the plea of ignorance in extenuation of most of her faults and then from what she says i believe her father and mother were brought up much as she has been brought up  i always understood she had no fortune and once i had pleasure in the thought said he  she tells me i answered that they are poor at home she always speaks quite candidly on such points you never find her lying as these foreigners will often lie her parents have a large family they occupy such a station and possess such connections as in their opinion demand display stringent necessity of circumstances and inherent thoughtlessness of disposition combined have engendered reckless unscrupulousness as to how they obtain the means of sustaining a good appearance this is the state of things and the only state of things she has seen from childhood upwards  i believe itand i thought to mould her to something better but lucy to speak the plain truth i have felt a new thing tonight in looking at her and de hamal i felt it before noticing the impertinence directed at my mother i saw a look interchanged between them immediately after their entrance which threw a most unwelcome light on my mind  how do you mean you have been long aware of the flirtation they keep up  ay flirtation that might be an innocent girlish wile to lure on the true lover but what i refer to was not flirtation it was a look marking mutual and secret understandingit was neither girlish nor innocent no woman were she as beautiful as aphrodite who could give or receive such a glance shall ever be sought in marriage by me i would rather wed a paysanne in a short petticoat and high capand be sure that she was honest  i could not help smiling i felt sure he now exaggerated the case ginevra i was certain was honest enough with all her giddiness i told him so he shook his head and said he would not be the man to trust her with his honour  the only thing said i with which you may safely trust her she would unscrupulously damage a husbands purse and property recklessly try his patience and temper i dont think she would breathe or let another breathe on his honour  you are becoming her advocate said he do you wish me to resume my old chains  no i am glad to see you free and trust that free you will long remain yet be at the same time just  i am so just as rhadamanthus lucy when once i am thoroughly estranged i cannot help being severe but look the king and queen are rising i like that queen she has a sweet countenance mamma too is excessively tired we shall never get the old lady home if we stay longer  i tired john cried mrs bretton looking at least as animated and as wideawake as her son i would undertake to sit you out yet leave us both here till morning and we should see which would look the most jaded by sunrise  i should not like to try the experiment for in truth mamma you are the most unfading of evergreens and the freshest of matrons it must then be on the plea of your sons delicate nerves and fragile constitution that i found a petition for our speedy adjournment  indolent young man you wish you were in bed no doubt and i suppose you must be humoured there is lucy too looking quite done up for shame lucy at your age a week of eveningsout would not have made me a shade paler come away both of you and you may laugh at the old lady as much as you please but for my part i shall take charge of the bandbox and turban  which she did accordingly i offered to relieve her but was shaken off with kindly contempt my godmother opined that i had enough to do to take care of myself not standing on ceremony now in the midst of the gay confusion worse confounded succeeding to the king and queens departure mrs bretton preceded us and promptly made us a lane through the crowd graham followed apostrophizing his mother as the most flourishing grisette it had ever been his good fortune to see charged with carriage of a bandbox he also desired me to mark her affection for the skyblue turban and announced his conviction that she intended one day to wear it  the night was now very cold and very dark but with little delay we found the carriage soon we were packed in it as warm and as snug as at a fireside and the drive home was i think still pleasanter than the drive to the concert pleasant it was even though the coachmanhaving spent in the shop of a marchand de vin a portion of the time we passed at the concertdrove us along the dark and solitary chaussée far past the turn leading down to la terrasse we who were occupied in talking and laughing not noticing the aberration till at last mrs bretton intimated that though she had always thought the château a retired spot she did not know it was situated at the worlds end as she declared seemed now to be the case for she believed we had been an hour and a half en route and had not yet taken the turn down the avenue  then graham looked out and perceiving only dimspread fields with unfamiliar rows of pollards and limes ranged along their else invisible sunkfences began to conjecture how matters were and calling a halt and descending he mounted the box and took the reins himself thanks to him we arrived safe at home about an hour and a half beyond our time  martha had not forgotten us a cheerful fire was burning and a neat supper spread in the diningroom we were glad of both the winter dawn was actually breaking before we gained our chambers i took off my pink dress and lace mantle with happier feelings than i had experienced in putting them on not all perhaps who had shone brightly arrayed at that concert could say the same for not all had been satisfied with friendshipwith its calm comfort and modest hope     chapter xxi  reaction   yet three days and then i must go back to the pensionnat i almost numbered the moments of these days upon the clock fain would i have retarded their flight but they glided by while i watched them they were already gone while i yet feared their departure  lucy will not leave us today said mrs bretton coaxingly at breakfast she knows we can procure a second respite  i would not ask for one if i might have it for a word said i i long to get the goodby over and to be settled in the rue fossette again i must go this morning i must go directly my trunk is packed and corded  it appeared however that my going depended upon graham he had said he would accompany me and it so fell out that he was engaged all day and only returned home at dusk then ensued a little combat of words mrs bretton and her son pressed me to remain one night more i could have cried so irritated and eager was i to be gone i longed to leave them as the criminal on the scaffold longs for the axe to descend that is i wished the pang over how much i wished it they could not tell on these points mine was a state of mind out of their experience  it was dark when dr john handed me from the carriage at madame becks door the lamp above was lit it rained a november drizzle as it had rained all day the lamplight gleamed on the wet pavement just such a night was it as that on which not a year ago i had first stopped at this very threshold just similar was the scene i remembered the very shapes of the pavingstones which i had noted with idle eye while with a thickbeating heart i waited the unclosing of that door at which i stooda solitary and a suppliant on that night too i had briefly met him who now stood with me had i ever reminded him of that rencontre or explained it i had not nor ever felt the inclination to do so it was a pleasant thought laid by in my own mind and best kept there  graham rung the bell the door was instantly opened for it was just that period of the evening when the halfboarders took their departureconsequently rosine was on the alert  dont come in said i to him but he stepped a moment into the welllighted vestibule i had not wished him to see that the water stood in my eyes for his was too kind a nature ever to be needlessly shown such signs of sorrow he always wished to healto relievewhen physician as he was neither cure nor alleviation were perhaps in his power  keep up your courage lucy think of my mother and myself as true friends we will not forget you  nor will i forget you dr john  my trunk was now brought in we had shaken hands he had turned to go but he was not satisfied he had not done or said enough to content his generous impulses  lucystepping after meshall you feel very solitary here  at first i shall  well my mother will soon call to see you and meantime ill tell you what ill do ill writejust any cheerful nonsense that comes into my headshall i  good gallant heart thought i to myself but i shook my head smiling and said never think of it impose on yourself no such task you write to meyoull not have time  oh i will find or make time goodby  he was gone the heavy door crashed to the axe had fallenthe pang was experienced  allowing myself no time to think or feelswallowing tears as if they had been winei passed to madames sittingroom to pay the necessary visit of ceremony and respect she received me with perfectly wellacted cordialitywas even demonstrative though brief in her welcome in ten minutes i was dismissed from the salleàmanger i proceeded to the refectory where pupils and teachers were now assembled for evening study again i had a welcome and one not i think quite hollow that over i was free to repair to the dormitory  and will graham really write i questioned as i sank tired on the edge of the bed  reason coming stealthily up to me through the twilight of that long dim chamber whispered sedatelyhe may write once so kind is his nature it may stimulate him for once to make the effort but it cannot be continuedit may not be repeated great were that folly which should build on such a promiseinsane that credulity which should mistake the transitory rainpool holding in its hollow one draught for the perennial spring yielding the supply of seasons  i bent my head i sat thinking an hour longer reason still whispered me laying on my shoulder a withered hand and frostily touching my ear with the chill blue lips of eld  if muttered she if he should write what then do you meditate pleasure in replying ah fool i warn you brief be your answer hope no delight of heartno indulgence of intellect grant no expansion to feelinggive holiday to no single faculty dally with no friendly exchange foster no genial intercommunion  but i have talked to graham and you did not chide i pleaded  no said she i needed not talk for you is good discipline you converse imperfectly while you speak there can be no oblivion of inferiorityno encouragement to delusion pain privation penury stamp your language  but i again broke in where the bodily presence is weak and the speech contemptible surely there cannot be error in making written language the medium of better utterance than faltering lips can achieve  reason only answered at your peril you cherish that idea or suffer its influence to animate any writing of yours  but if i feel may i never express  never declared reason  i groaned under her bitter sternness neverneveroh hard word this hag this reason would not let me look up or smile or hope she could not rest unless i were altogether crushed cowed brokenin and brokendown according to her i was born only to work for a piece of bread to await the pains of death and steadily through all life to despond reason might be right yet no wonder we are glad at times to defy her to rush from under her rod and give a truant hour to imaginationher soft bright foe our sweet help our divine hope we shall and must break bounds at intervals despite the terrible revenge that awaits our return reason is vindictive as a devil for me she was always envenomed as a stepmother if i have obeyed her it has chiefly been with the obedience of fear not of love long ago i should have died of her illusage her stint her chill her barren board her icy bed her savage ceaseless blows but for that kinder power who holds my secret and sworn allegiance often has reason turned me out by night in midwinter on cold snow flinging for sustenance the gnawed bone dogs had forsaken sternly has she vowed her stores held nothing more for meharshly denied my right to ask better things then looking up have i seen in the sky a head amidst circling stars of which the midmost and the brightest lent a ray sympathetic and attent a spirit softer and better than human reason has descended with quiet flight to the wastebringing all round her a sphere of air borrowed of eternal summer bringing perfume of flowers which cannot fadefragrance of trees whose fruit is life bringing breezes pure from a world whose day needs no sun to lighten it my hunger has this good angel appeased with food sweet and strange gathered amongst gleaning angels garnering their dewwhite harvest in the first fresh hour of a heavenly day tenderly has she assuaged the insufferable fears which weep away life itselfkindly given rest to deadly wearinessgenerously lent hope and impulse to paralyzed despair divine compassionate succourable influence when i bend the knee to other than god it shall be at thy white and winged feet beautiful on mountain or on plain temples have been reared to the sunaltars dedicated to the moon oh greater glory to thee neither hands build nor lips consecrate but hearts through ages are faithful to thy worship a dwelling thou hast too wide for walls too high for domea temple whose floors are spacerites whose mysteries transpire in presence to the kindling the harmony of worlds  sovereign complete thou hadst for endurance thy great army of martyrs for achievement thy chosen band of worthies deity unquestioned thine essence foils decay  this daughter of heaven remembered me tonight she saw me weep and she came with comfort sleep she said sleep sweetlyi gild thy dreams  she kept her word and watched me through a nights rest but at dawn reason relieved the guard i awoke with a sort of start the rain was dashing against the panes and the wind uttering a peevish cry at intervals the nightlamp was dying on the black circular stand in the middle of the dormitory day had already broken how i pity those whom mental pain stuns instead of rousing this morning the pang of waking snatched me out of bed like a hand with a giants gripe how quickly i dressed in the cold of the raw dawn how deeply i drank of the icecold water in my carafe this was always my cordial to which like other dramdrinkers i had eager recourse when unsettled by chagrin  ere long the bell rang its réveillée to the whole school being dressed i descended alone to the refectory where the stove was lit and the air was warm through the rest of the house it was cold with the nipping severity of a continental winter though now but the beginning of november a north wind had thus early brought a wintry blight over europe i remember the black stoves pleased me little when i first came but now i began to associate with them a sense of comfort and liked them as in england we like a fireside  sitting down before this dark comforter i presently fell into a deep argument with myself on life and its chances on destiny and her decrees my mind calmer and stronger now than last night made for itself some imperious rules prohibiting under deadly penalties all weak retrospect of happiness past commanding a patient journeying through the wilderness of the present enjoining a reliance on faitha watching of the cloud and pillar which subdue while they guide and awe while they illuminehushing the impulse to fond idolatry checking the longing outlook for a faroff promised land whose rivers are perhaps never to be reached save in dying dreams whose sweet pastures are to be viewed but from the desolate and sepulchral summit of a nebo  by degrees a composite feeling of blended strength and pain wound itself wirily round my heart sustained or at least restrained its throbbings and made me fit for the days work i lifted my head  as i said before i was sitting near the stove let into the wall beneath the refectory and the carré and thus sufficing to heat both apartments piercing the same wall and close beside the stove was a window looking also into the carré as i looked up a captassel a brow two eyes filled a pane of that window the fixed gaze of those two eyes hit right against my own glance they were watching me i had not till that moment known that tears were on my cheek but i felt them now  this was a strange house where no corner was sacred from intrusion where not a tear could be shed nor a thought pondered but a spy was at hand to note and to divine and this new this outdoor this male spy what business had brought him to the premises at this unwonted hour what possible right had he to intrude on me thus no other professor would have dared to cross the carré before the classbell rang m emanuel took no account of hours nor of claims there was some book of reference in the firstclass library which he had occasion to consult he had come to seek it on his way he passed the refectory it was very much his habit to wear eyes before behind and on each side of him he had seen me through the little windowhe now opened the refectory door and there he stood  mademoiselle vous êtes triste  monsieur jen ai bien le droit  vous êtes malade de coeur et dhumeur he pursued you are at once mournful and mutinous i see on your cheek two tears which i know are hot as two sparks and salt as two crystals of the sea while i speak you eye me strangely shall i tell you of what i am reminded while watching you  monsieur i shall be called away to prayers shortly my time for conversation is very scant and brief at this hourexcuse  i excuse everything he interrupted my mood is so meek neither rebuff nor perhaps insult could ruffle it you remind me then of a young she wild creature new caught untamed viewing with a mixture of fire and fear the first entrance of the breakerin  unwarrantable accostrash and rude if addressed to a pupil to a teacher inadmissible he thought to provoke a warm reply i had seen him vex the passionate to explosion before now in me his malice should find no gratification i sat silent  you look said he like one who would snatch at a draught of sweet poison and spurn wholesome bitters with disgust  indeed i never liked bitters nor do i believe them wholesome and to whatever is sweet be it poison or food you cannot at least deny its own delicious qualitysweetness better perhaps to die quickly a pleasant death than drag on long a charmless life  yet said he you should take your bitter dose duly and daily if i had the power to administer it and as to the wellbeloved poison i would perhaps break the very cup which held it  i sharply turned my head away partly because his presence utterly displeased me and partly because i wished to shun questions lest in my present mood the effort of answering should overmaster selfcommand  come said he more softly tell me the truthyou grieve at being parted from friendsis it not so  the insinuating softness was not more acceptable than the inquisitorial curiosity i was silent he came into the room sat down on the bench about two yards from me and persevered long and for him patiently in attempts to draw me into conversationattempts necessarily unavailing because i could not talk at last i entreated to be let alone in uttering the request my voice faltered my head sank on my arms and the table i wept bitterly though quietly he sat a while longer i did not look up nor speak till the closing door and his retreating step told me that he was gone these tears proved a relief  i had time to bathe my eyes before breakfast and i suppose i appeared at that meal as serene as any other person not however quite as jocundlooking as the young lady who placed herself in the seat opposite mine fixed on me a pair of somewhat small eyes twinkling gleefully and frankly stretched across the table a white hand to be shaken miss fanshawes travels gaieties and flirtations agreed with her mightily she had become quite plump her cheeks looked as round as apples i had seen her last in elegant evening attire i dont know that she looked less charming now in her schooldress a kind of careless peignoir of a darkblue material dimly and dingily plaided with black i even think this dusky wrapper gave her charms a triumph enhancing by contrast the fairness of her skin the freshness of her bloom the golden beauty of her tresses  i am glad you are come back timon said she timon was one of her dozen names for me you dont know how often i have wanted you in this dismal hole  oh have you then of course if you wanted me you have something for me to do stockings to mend perhaps i never gave ginevra a minutes or a farthings credit for disinterestedness  crabbed and crusty as ever said she i expected as much it would not be you if you did not snub one but now come grandmother i hope you like coffee as much and pistolets as little as ever are you disposed to barter  take your own way  this way consisted in a habit she had of making me convenient she did not like the morning cup of coffee its school brewage not being strong or sweet enough to suit her palate and she had an excellent appetite like any other healthy schoolgirl for the morning pistolets or rolls which were newbaked and very good and of which a certain allowance was served to each this allowance being more than i needed i gave half to ginevra never varying in my preference though many others used to covet the superfluity and she in return would sometimes give me a portion of her coffee this morning i was glad of the draught hunger i had none and with thirst i was parched i dont know why i chose to give my bread rather to ginevra than to another nor why if two had to share the convenience of one drinkingvessel as sometimes happenedfor instance when we took a long walk into the country and halted for refreshment at a farmi always contrived that she should be my convive and rather liked to let her take the lions share whether of the white beer the sweet wine or the new milk so it was however and she knew it and therefore while we wrangled daily we were never alienated  after breakfast my custom was to withdraw to the first classe and sit and read or think oftenest the latter there alone till the nineoclock bell threw open all doors admitted the gathered rush of externes and demipensionnaires and gave the signal for entrance on that bustle and business to which till five pm there was no relax  i was just seated this morning when a tap came to the door  pardon mademoiselle said a pensionnaire entering gently and having taken from her desk some necessary book or paper she withdrew on tiptoe murmuring as she passed me que mademoiselle est appliquée  appliquée indeed the means of application were spread before me but i was doing nothing and had done nothing and meant to do nothing thus does the world give us credit for merits we have not madame beck herself deemed me a regular basbleu and often and solemnly used to warn me not to study too much lest the blood should all go to my head indeed everybody in the rue fossette held a superstition that meess lucie was learned with the notable exception of m emanuel who by means peculiar to himself and quite inscrutable to me had obtained a not inaccurate inkling of my real qualifications and used to take quiet opportunities of chuckling in my ear his malign glee over their scant measure for my part i never troubled myself about this penury i dearly like to think my own thoughts i had great pleasure in reading a few books but not many preferring always those on whose style or sentiment the writers individual nature was plainly stamped flagging inevitably over characterless books however clever and meritorious perceiving well that as far as my own mind was concerned god had limited its powers and its actionthankful i trust for the gift bestowed but unambitious of higher endowments not restlessly eager after higher culture  the polite pupil was scarcely gone when unceremoniously without tap in burst a second intruder had i been blind i should have known who this was a constitutional reserve of manner had by this time told with wholesome and for me commodious effect on the manners of my coinmates rarely did i now suffer from rude or intrusive treatment when i first came it would happen once and again that a blunt german would clap me on the shoulder and ask me to run a race or a riotous labassecourienne seize me by the arm and drag me towards the playground urgent proposals to take a swing at the pas de géant or to join in a certain romping hideandseek game called un deux trois were formerly also of hourly occurrence but all these little attentions had ceased some time agoceased too without my finding it necessary to be at the trouble of pointblank cutting them short i had now no familiar demonstration to dread or endure save from one quarter and as that was english i could bear it ginevra fanshawe made no scruple ofat timescatching me as i was crossing the carré whirling me round in a compulsory waltz and heartily enjoying the mental and physical discomfiture her proceeding induced ginevra fanshawe it was who now broke in upon my learned leisure she carried a huge musicbook under her arm  go to your practising said i to her at once away with you to the little salon  not till i have had a talk with you chère amie i know where you have been spending your vacation and how you have commenced sacrificing to the graces and enjoying life like any other belle i saw you at the concert the other night dressed actually like anybody else who is your tailleuse  tittletattle how prettily it begins my tailleusea fiddlestick come sheer off ginevra i really dont want your company  but when i want yours so much ange farouche what does a little reluctance on your part signify dieu merci we know how to manoeuvre with our gifted compatriotethe learned ourse britannique and so ourson you know isidore  i know john bretton  oh hush putting her fingers in her ears you crack my tympanums with your rude anglicisms but how is our wellbeloved john do tell me about him the poor man must be in a sad way what did he say to my behaviour the other night wasnt i cruel  do you think i noticed you  it was a delightful evening oh that divine de hamal and then to watch the other sulking and dying in the distance and the old ladymy future mammainlaw but i am afraid i and lady sara were a little rude in quizzing her  lady sara never quizzed her at all and for what you did dont make yourself in the least uneasy mrs bretton will survive your sneer  she may old ladies are tough but that poor son of hers do tell me what he said i saw he was terribly cut up  he said you looked as if at heart you were already madame de hamal  did he she cried with delight he noticed that how charming i thought he would be mad with jealousy  ginevra have you seriously done with dr bretton do you want him to give you up  oh you know he cant do that but wasnt he mad  quite mad i assented as mad as a march hare  well and how ever did you get him home  how ever indeed have you no pity on his poor mother and me fancy us holding him tight down in the carriage and he raving between us fit to drive everybody delirious the very coachman went wrong somehow and we lost our way  you dont say so you are laughing at me now lucy snowe  i assure you it is factand fact also that dr bretton would not stay in the carriage he broke from us and would ride outside  and afterwards  afterwardswhen he did reach homethe scene transcends description  oh but describe ityou know it is such fun  fun for you miss fanshawe but with stern gravity you know the proverbwhat is sport to one may be death to another  go on theres a darling timon  conscientiously i cannot unless you assure me you have some heart  i havesuch an immensity you dont know  good in that case you will be able to conceive dr graham bretton rejecting his supper in the first instancethe chicken the sweetbread prepared for his refreshment left on the table untouched thenbut it is of no use dwelling at length on the harrowing details suffice it to say that never in the most stormy fits and moments of his infancy had his mother such work to tuck the sheets about him as she had that night  he wouldnt lie still  he wouldnt lie still there it was the sheets might be tucked in but the thing was to keep them tucked in  and what did he say  say cant you imagine him demanding his divine ginevra anathematizing that demon de hamalraving about golden locks blue eyes white arms glittering bracelets  no did he he saw the bracelet  saw the bracelet yes as plain as i saw it and perhaps for the first time he saw also the brandmark with which its pressure has encircled your arm ginevra rising and changing my tone come we will have an end of this go away to your practising  and i opened the door  but you have not told me all  you had better not wait until i do tell you all such extra communicativeness could give you no pleasure march  cross thing said she but she obeyed and indeed the first classe was my territory and she could not there legally resist a notice of quittance from me  yet to speak the truth never had i been less dissatisfied with her than i was then there was pleasure in thinking of the contrast between the reality and my descriptionto remember dr john enjoying the drive home eating his supper with relish and retiring to rest with christian composure it was only when i saw him really unhappy that i felt really vexed with the fair frail cause of his suffering                                       a fortnight passed i was getting once more inured to the harness of school and lapsing from the passionate pain of change to the palsy of custom one afternoon in crossing the carré on my way to the first classe where i was expected to assist at a lesson of style and literature i saw standing by one of the long and large windows rosine the portress her attitude as usual was quite nonchalante she always stood at ease one of her hands rested in her apronpocket the other at this moment held to her eyes a letter whereof mademoiselle coolly perused the address and deliberately studied the seal  a letter the shape of a letter similar to that had haunted my brain in its very core for seven days past i had dreamed of a letter last night strong magnetism drew me to that letter now yet whether i should have ventured to demand of rosine so much as a glance at that white envelope with the spot of red wax in the middle i know not no i think i should have sneaked past in terror of a rebuff from disappointment my heart throbbed now as if i already heard the tramp of her approach nervous mistake it was the rapid step of the professor of literature measuring the corridor i fled before him could i but be seated quietly at my desk before his arrival with the class under my orders all in disciplined readiness he would perhaps exempt me from notice but if caught lingering in the carré i should be sure to come in for a special harangue i had time to get seated to enforce perfect silence to take out my work and to commence it amidst the profoundest and best trained hush ere m emanuel entered with his vehement burst of latch and panel and his deep redundant bow prophetic of choler  as usual he broke upon us like a clap of thunder but instead of flashing lightningwise from the door to the estrade his career halted midway at my desk setting his face towards me and the window his back to the pupils and the room he gave me a looksuch a look as might have licensed me to stand straight up and demand what he meanta look of scowling distrust  voilà pour vous said he drawing his hand from his waistcoat and placing on my desk a letterthe very letter i had seen in rosines handthe letter whose face of enamelled white and single cyclopseye of vermilionred had printed themselves so clear and perfect on the retina of an inward vision i knew it i felt it to be the letter of my hope the fruition of my wish the release from my doubt the ransom from my terror this letter m paul with his unwarrantably interfering habits had taken from the portress and now delivered it himself  i might have been angry but had not a second for the sensation yes i held in my hand not a slight note but an envelope which must at least contain a sheet it felt not flimsy but firm substantial satisfying and here was the direction miss lucy snowe in a clean clear equal decided hand and here was the seal round full deftly dropped by untremulous fingers stamped with the wellcut impress of initials j g b i experienced a happy feelinga glad emotion which went warm to my heart and ran lively through all my veins for once a hope was realized i held in my hand a morsel of real solid joy not a dream not an image of the brain not one of those shadowy chances imagination pictures and on which humanity starves but cannot live not a mess of that manna i drearily eulogized awhile agowhich indeed at first melts on the lips with an unspeakable and preternatural sweetness but which in the end our souls full surely loathe longing deliriously for natural and earthgrown food wildly praying heavens spirits to reclaim their own spiritdew and essencean aliment divine but for mortals deadly it was neither sweet hail nor small corianderseedneither slight wafer nor luscious honey i had lighted on it was the wild savoury mess of the hunter nourishing and salubrious meat forestfed or desertreared fresh healthful and lifesustaining it was what the old dying patriarch demanded of his son esau promising in requital the blessing of his last breath it was a godsend and i inwardly thanked the god who had vouchsafed it outwardly i only thanked man crying thank you thank you monsieur  monsieur curled his lip gave me a vicious glance of the eye and strode to his estrade m paul was not at all a good little man though he had good points  did i read my letter there and then did i consume the venison at once and with haste as if esaus shaft flew every day  i knew better the cover with its addressthe seal with its three clear letterswas bounty and abundance for the present i stole from the room i procured the key of the great dormitory which was kept locked by day i went to my bureau with a sort of haste and trembling lest madame should creep upstairs and spy me i opened a drawer unlocked a box and took out a case andhaving feasted my eyes with one more look and approached the seal with a mixture of awe and shame and delight to my lipsi folded the untasted treasure yet all fair and inviolate in silver paper committed it to the case shut up box and drawer reclosed relocked the dormitory and returned to class feeling as if fairy tales were true and fairy gifts no dream strange sweet insanity and this letter the source of my joy i had not yet read did not yet know the number of its lines  when i reentered the schoolroom behold m paul raging like a pestilence some pupil had not spoken audibly or distinctly enough to suit his ear and taste and now she and others were weeping and he was raving from his estrade almost livid curious to mention as i appeared he fell on me  was i the mistress of these girls did i profess to teach them the conduct befitting ladiesand did i permit and he doubted not encourage them to strangle their mothertongue in their throats to mince and mash it between their teeth as if they had some base cause to be ashamed of the words they uttered was this modesty he knew better it was a vile pseudo sentimentthe offspring or the forerunner of evil rather than submit to this mopping and mowing this mincing and grimacing this grinding of a noble tongue this general affectation and sickening stubbornness of the pupils of the first class he would throw them up for a set of insupportable petites maîtresses and confine himself to teaching the abc to the babies of the third division  what could i say to all this really nothing and i hoped he would allow me to be silent the storm recommenced  every answer to his queries was then refused it seemed to be considered in that placethat conceited boudoir of a first classe with its pretentious bookcases its greenbaized desks its rubbish of flowerstands its trash of framed pictures and maps and its foreign surveillante forsoothit seemed to be the fashion to think there that the professor of literature was not worthy of a reply these were new ideas imported he did not doubt straight from la grande bretagne they savoured of island insolence and arrogance  lull the secondthe girls not one of whom was ever known to weep a tear for the rebukes of any other master now all melting like snowstatues before the intemperate heat of m emanuel i not yet much shaken sitting down and venturing to resume my work  somethingeither in my continued silence or in the movement of my hand stitchingtransported m emanuel beyond the last boundary of patience he actually sprang from his estrade the stove stood near my desk he attacked it the little iron door was nearly dashed from its hinges the fuel was made to fly  estce que vous avez lintention de minsulter said he to me in a low furious voice as he thus outraged under pretence of arranging the fire  it was time to soothe him a little if possible  mais monsieur said i i would not insult you for the world i remember too well that you once said we should be friends  i did not intend my voice to falter but it did more i think through the agitation of late delight than in any spasm of present fear still there certainly was something in m pauls angera kind of passion of emotionthat specially tended to draw tears i was not unhappy nor much afraid yet i wept  allons allons said he presently looking round and seeing the deluge universal decidedly i am a monster and a ruffian i have only one pockethandkerchief he added but if i had twenty i would offer you each one your teacher shall be your representative here miss lucy  and he took forth and held out to me a clean silk handkerchief now a person who did not know m paul who was unused to him and his impulses would naturally have bungled at this offerdeclined accepting the sameet cetera but i too plainly felt this would never do the slightest hesitation would have been fatal to the incipient treaty of peace i rose and met the handkerchief halfway received it with decorum wiped therewith my eyes and resuming my seat and retaining the flag of truce in my hand and on my lap took especial care during the remainder of the lesson to touch neither needle nor thimble scissors nor muslin many a jealous glance did m paul cast at these implements he hated them mortally considering sewing a source of distraction from the attention due to himself a very eloquent lesson he gave and very kind and friendly was he to the close ere he had done the clouds were dispersed and the sun shining outtears were exchanged for smiles  in quitting the room he paused once more at my desk  and your letter said he this time not quite fiercely  i have not yet read it monsieur  ah it is too good to read at once you save it as when i was a boy i used to save a peach whose bloom was very ripe  the guess came so near the truth i could not prevent a suddenlyrising warmth in my face from revealing as much  you promise yourself a pleasant moment said he in reading that letter you will open it when alonenestce pas ah a smile answers well well one should not be too harsh la jeunesse na quun temps  monsieur monsieur i cried or rather whispered after him as he turned to go do not leave me under a mistake this is merely a friends letter without reading it i can vouch for that  je conçois je conçois on sait ce que cest quun ami bonjour mademoiselle  but monsieur here is your handkerchief  keep it keep it till the letter is read then bring it me i shall read the billets tenor in your eyes  when he was gone the pupils having already poured out of the schoolroom into the berceau and thence into the garden and court to take their customary recreation before the fiveoclock dinner i stood a moment thinking and absently twisting the handkerchief round my arm for some reasongladdened i think by a sudden return of the golden glimmer of childhood roused by an unwonted renewal of its buoyancy made merry by the liberty of the closing hour and above all solaced at heart by the joyous consciousness of that treasure in the case box drawer upstairsi fell to playing with the handkerchief as if it were a ball casting it into the air and catching itas it fell the game was stopped by another hand than minea hand emerging from a paletôtsleeve and stretched over my shoulder it caught the extemporised plaything and bore it away with these sullen words  je vois bien que vous vous moquez de moi et de mes effets  really that little man was dreadful a mere sprite of caprice and ubiquity one never knew either his whim or his whereabout     chapter xxii  the letter   when all was still in the house when dinner was over and the noisy recreationhour past when darkness had set in and the quiet lamp of study was lit in the refectory when the externes were gone home the clashing door and clamorous bell hushed for the evening when madame was safely settled in the salleàmanger in company with her mother and some friends i then glided to the kitchen begged a bougie for one halfhour for a particular occasion found acceptance of my petition at the hands of my friend goton who answered mais certainement chouchou vous en aurez deux si vous voulez and light in hand i mounted noiseless to the dormitory  great was my chagrin to find in that apartment a pupil gone to bed indisposedgreater when i recognised amid the muslin nightcap borders the figure chiffonnée of mistress ginevra fanshawe supine at this moment it is truebut certain to wake and overwhelm me with chatter when the interruption would be least acceptable indeed as i watched her a slight twinkling of the eyelids warned me that the present appearance of repose might be but a ruse assumed to cover sly vigilance over timons movements she was not to be trusted and i had so wished to be alone just to read my precious letter in peace  well i must go to the classes having sought and found my prize in its casket i descended illluck pursued me the classes were undergoing sweeping and purification by candlelight according to hebdomadal custom benches were piled on desks the air was dim with dust damp coffeegrounds used by labassecourien housemaids instead of tealeaves darkened the floor all was hopeless confusion baffled but not beaten i withdrew bent as resolutely as ever on finding solitude somewhere  taking a key whereof i knew the repository i mounted three staircases in succession reached a dark narrow silent landing opened a wormeaten door and dived into the deep black cold garret here none would follow menone interruptnot madame herself i shut the garretdoor i placed my light on a doddered and mouldy chest of drawers i put on a shawl for the air was icecold i took my letter trembling with sweet impatience i broke its seal  will it be longwill it be short thought i passing my hand across my eyes to dissipate the silvery dimness of a suave southwind shower  it was long  will it be coolwill it be kind  it was kind  to my checked bridled disciplined expectation it seemed very kind to my longing and famished thought it seemed perhaps kinder than it was  so little had i hoped so much had i feared there was a fulness of delight in this taste of fruitionsuch perhaps as many a human being passes through life without ever knowing the poor english teacher in the frosty garret reading by a dim candle guttering in the wintry air a letter simply goodnaturednothing more though that goodnature then seemed to me godlikewas happier than most queens in palaces  of course happiness of such shallow origin could be but brief yet while it lasted it was genuine and exquisite a bubblebut a sweet bubbleof real honeydew dr john had written to me at length he had written to me with pleasure he had written with benignant mood dwelling with sunny satisfaction on scenes that had passed before his eyes and mineon places we had visited togetheron conversations we had heldon all the little subjectmatter in short of the last few halcyon weeks but the cordial core of the delight was a conviction the blithe genial language generously imparted that it had been poured out not merely to content mebut to gratify himself a gratification he might never more desire never more seekan hypothesis in every point of view approaching the certain but that concerned the future this present moment had no pain no blot no want full pure perfect it deeply blessed me a passing seraph seemed to have rested beside me leaned towards my heart and reposed on its throb a softening cooling healing hallowing wing dr john you pained me afterwards forgiven be every illfreely forgivenfor the sake of that one dear remembered good  are there wicked things not human which envy human bliss are there evil influences haunting the air and poisoning it for man what was near me  something in that vast solitary garret sounded strangely most surely and certainly i heard as it seemed a stealthy foot on that floor a sort of gliding out from the direction of the black recess haunted by the malefactor cloaks i turned my light was dim the room was longbut as i live i saw in the middle of that ghostly chamber a figure all black and white the skirts straight narrow black the head bandaged veiled white  say what you will readertell me i was nervous or mad affirm that i was unsettled by the excitement of that letter declare that i dreamed this i vowi saw therein that roomon that nightan image likea nun  i cried out i sickened had the shape approached me i might have swooned it receded i made for the door how i descended all the stairs i know not by instinct i shunned the refectory and shaped my course to madames sittingroom i burst in i said  there is something in the grenier i have been there i saw something go and look at it all of you  i said all of you for the room seemed to me full of people though in truth there were but four present madame beck her mother madame kint who was out of health and now staying with her on a visit her brother m victor kint and another gentleman who when i entered the room was conversing with the old lady and had his back towards the door  my mortal fear and faintness must have made me deadly pale i felt cold and shaking they all rose in consternation they surrounded me i urged them to go to the grenier the sight of the gentlemen did me good and gave me courage it seemed as if there were some help and hope with men at hand i turned to the door beckoning them to follow they wanted to stop me but i said they must come this way they must see what i had seensomething strange standing in the middle of the garret and now i remembered my letter left on the drawers with the light this precious letter flesh or spirit must be defied for its sake i flew upstairs hastening the faster as i knew i was followed they were obliged to come  lo when i reached the garretdoor all within was dark as a pit the light was out happily some onemadame i think with her usual calm sensehad brought a lamp from the room speedily therefore as they came up a ray pierced the opaque blackness there stood the bougie quenched on the drawers but where was the letter and i looked for that now and not for the nun  my letter my letter i panted and plained almost beside myself i groped on the floor wringing my hands wildly cruel cruel doom to have my bit of comfort preternaturally snatched from me ere i had well tasted its virtue  i dont know what the others were doing i could not watch them they asked me questions i did not answer they ransacked all corners they prattled about this and that disarrangement of cloaks a breach or crack in the skylighti know not what something or somebody has been here was sagely averred  oh they have taken my letter cried the grovelling groping monomaniac  what letter lucy my dear girl what letter asked a known voice in my ear could i believe that ear no and i looked up could i trust my eyes had i recognised the tone did i now look on the face of the writer of that very letter was this gentleman near me in this dim garret john grahamdr bretton himself  yes it was he had been called in that very evening to prescribe for some access of illness in old madame kint he was the second gentleman present in the salleàmanger when i entered  was it my letter lucy  your own yoursthe letter you wrote to me i had come here to read it quietly i could not find another spot where it was possible to have it to myself i had saved it all daynever opened it till this evening it was scarcely glanced over i cannot bear to lose it oh my letter  hush dont cry and distress yourself so cruelly what is it worth hush come out of this cold room they are going to send for the police now to examine further we need not stay herecome we will go down  a warm hand taking my cold fingers led me down to a room where there was a fire dr john and i sat before the stove he talked to me and soothed me with unutterable goodness promising me twenty letters for the one lost if there are words and wrongs like knives whose deepinflicted lacerations never healcutting injuries and insults of serrated and poisondripping edgeso too there are consolations of tone too fine for the ear not fondly and for ever to retain their echo caressing kindnessesloved lingered over through a whole life recalled with unfaded tenderness and answering the call with undimmed shine out of that raven cloud foreshadowing death himself i have been told since that dr bretton was not nearly so perfect as i thought him that his actual character lacked the depth height compass and endurance it possessed in my creed i dont know he was as good to me as the well is to the parched wayfareras the sun to the shivering jailbird i remember him heroic heroic at this moment will i hold him to be  he asked me smiling why i cared for his letter so very much i thought but did not say that i prized it like the blood in my veins i only answered that i had so few letters to care for  i am sure you did not read it said he or you would think nothing of it  i read it but only once i want to read it again i am sorry it is lost and i could not help weeping afresh  lucy lucy my poor little godsister if there be such a relationship herehere is your letter why is it not better worth such tears and such tenderly exaggerating faith  curious characteristic manoeuvre his quick eye had seen the letter on the floor where i sought it his hand as quick had snatched it up he had hidden it in his waistcoat pocket if my trouble had wrought with a whit less stress and reality i doubt whether he would ever have acknowledged or restored it tears of temperature one degree cooler than those i shed would only have amused dr john  pleasure at regaining made me forget merited reproach for the teasing torment my joy was great it could not be concealed yet i think it broke out more in countenance than language i said little  are you satisfied now asked dr john  i replied that i wassatisfied and happy  well then he proceeded how do you feel physically are you growing calmer not much for you tremble like a leaf still  it seemed to me however that i was sufficiently calm at least i felt no longer terrified i expressed myself composed  you are able consequently to tell me what you saw your account was quite vague do you know you looked white as the wall but you only spoke of something not defining what was it a man was it an animal what was it  i never will tell exactly what i saw said i unless some one else sees it too and then i will give corroborative testimony but otherwise i shall be discredited and accused of dreaming  tell me said dr bretton i will hear it in my professional character i look on you now from a professional point of view and i read perhaps all you would concealin your eye which is curiously vivid and restless in your cheek which the blood has forsaken in your hand which you cannot steady come lucy speak and tell me  you would laugh  if you dont tell me you shall have no more letters  you are laughing now  i will again take away that single epistle being mine i think i have a right to reclaim it  i felt raillery in his words it made me grave and quiet but i folded up the letter and covered it from sight  you may hide it but i can possess it any moment i choose you dont know my skill in sleight of hand i might practise as a conjuror if i liked mamma says sometimes too that i have a harmonizing property of tongue and eye but you never saw that in medid you lucy  indeedindeedwhen you were a mere boy i used to see both far more then than nowfor now you are strong and strength dispenses with subtlety but stilldr john you have what they call in this country un air fin that nobody can mistake madame beck saw it and  and liked it said he laughing because she has it herself but lucy give me that letteryou dont really care for it  to this provocative speech i made no answer graham in mirthful mood must not be humoured too far just now there was a new sort of smile playing about his lipsvery sweet but it grieved me somehowa new sort of light sparkling in his eyes not hostile but not reassuring i rose to goi bid him goodnight a little sadly  his sensitivenessthat peculiar apprehensive detective faculty of hisfelt in a moment the unspoken complaintthe scarcethought reproach he asked quietly if i was offended i shook my head as implying a negative  permit me then to speak a little seriously to you before you go you are in a highly nervous state i feel sure from what is apparent in your look and manner however well controlled that whilst alone this evening in that dismal perishing sepulchral garretthat dungeon under the leads smelling of damp and mould rank with phthisis and catarrh a place you never ought to enterthat you saw or thought you saw some appearance peculiarly calculated to impress the imagination i know that you are not nor ever were subject to material terrors fears of robbers ci am not so sure that a visitation bearing a spectral character would not shake your very mind be calm now this is all a matter of the nerves i see but just specify the vision  you will tell nobody  nobodymost certainly you may trust me as implicitly as you did père silas indeed the doctor is perhaps the safer confessor of the two though he has not grey hair  you will not laugh  perhaps i may to do you good but not in scorn lucy i feel as a friend towards you though your timid nature is slow to trust  he now looked like a friend that indescribable smile and sparkle were gone those formidable arched curves of lip nostril eyebrow were depressed repose marked his attitudeattention sobered his aspect won to confidence i told him exactly what i had seen ere now i had narrated to him the legend of the housewhiling away with that narrative an hour of a certain mild october afternoon when he and i rode through bois letang  he sat and thought and while he thought we heard them all coming downstairs  are they going to interrupt said he glancing at the door with an annoyed expression  they will not come here i answered for we were in the little salon where madame never sat in the evening and where it was by mere chance that heat was still lingering in the stove they passed the door and went on to the salleàmanger  now he pursued they will talk about thieves burglars and so on let them do somind you say nothing and keep your resolution of describing your nun to nobody she may appear to you again dont start  you think then i said with secret horror she came out of my brain and is now gone in there and may glide out again at an hour and a day when i look not for her  i think it a case of spectral illusion i fear following on and resulting from longcontinued mental conflict  oh doctor johni shudder at the thought of being liable to such an illusion it seemed so real is there no cureno preventive  happiness is the curea cheerful mind the preventive cultivate both  no mockery in this world ever sounds to me so hollow as that of being told to cultivate happiness what does such advice mean happiness is not a potato to be planted in mould and tilled with manure happiness is a glory shining far down upon us out of heaven she is a divine dew which the soul on certain of its summer mornings feels dropping upon it from the amaranth bloom and golden fruitage of paradise  cultivate happiness i said briefly to the doctor do you cultivate happiness how do you manage  i am a cheerful fellow by nature and then illluck has never dogged me adversity gave me and my mother one passing scowl and brush but we defied her or rather laughed at her and she went by  there is no cultivation in all this  i do not give way to melancholy  yes i have seen you subdued by that feeling  about ginevra fanshaweeh  did she not sometimes make you miserable  pooh stuff nonsense you see i am better now  if a laughing eye with a lively light and a face bright with beaming and healthy energy could attest that he was better better he certainly was  you do not look much amiss or greatly out of condition i allowed  and why lucy cant you look and feel as i dobuoyant courageous and fit to defy all the nuns and flirts in christendom i would give gold on the spot just to see you snap your fingers try the manoeuvre  if i were to bring miss fanshawe into your presence just now  i vow lucy she should not move me or she should move me but by one thingtrue yes and passionate love i would accord forgiveness at no less a price  indeed a smile of hers would have been a fortune to you a while since  transformed lucy transformed remember you once called me a slave but i am a free man now  he stood up in the port of his head the carriage of his figure in his beaming eye and mien there revealed itself a liberty which was more than easea mood which was disdain of his past bondage  miss fanshawe he pursued has led me through a phase of feeling which is over i have entered another condition and am now much disposed to exact love for lovepassion for passionand good measure of it too  ah doctor doctor you said it was your nature to pursue love under difficultiesto be charmed by a proud insensibility  he laughed and answered my nature varies the mood of one hour is sometimes the mockery of the next well lucy drawing on his gloves will the nun come again tonight think you  i dont think she will  give her my compliments if she doesdr johns complimentsand entreat her to have the goodness to wait a visit from him lucy was she a pretty nun had she a pretty face you have not told me that yet and that is the really important point  she had a white cloth over her face said i but her eyes glittered  confusion to her goblin trappings cried he irreverently but at least she had handsome eyesbright and soft  cold and fixed was the reply  no no well none of her she shall not haunt you lucy give her that shake of the hand if she comes again will she stand that do you think  i thought it too kind and cordial for a ghost to stand and so was the smile which matched it and accompanied his goodnight                                       and had there been anything in the garret what did they discover i believe on the closest examination their discoveries amounted to very little they talked at first of the cloaks being disturbed but madame beck told me afterwards she thought they hung much as usual and as for the broken pane in the skylight she affirmed that aperture was rarely without one or more panes broken or cracked and besides a heavy hailstorm had fallen a few days ago madame questioned me very closely as to what i had seen but i only described an obscure figure clothed in black i took care not to breathe the word nun certain that this word would at once suggest to her mind an idea of romance and unreality she charged me to say nothing on the subject to any servant pupil or teacher and highly commended my discretion in coming to her private salleàmanger instead of carrying the tale of horror to the school refectory thus the subject dropped i was left secretly and sadly to wonder in my own mind whether that strange thing was of this world or of a realm beyond the grave or whether indeed it was only the child of malady and i of that malady the prey     chapter xxiii  vashti   to wonder sadly did i say no a new influence began to act upon my life and sadness for a certain space was held at bay conceive a dell deephollowed in forest secresy it lies in dimness and mist its turf is dank its herbage pale and humid a storm or an axe makes a wide gap amongst the oaktrees the breeze sweeps in the sun looks down the sad cold dell becomes a deep cup of lustre high summer pours her blue glory and her golden light out of that beauteous sky which till now the starved hollow never saw  a new creed became minea belief in happiness  it was three weeks since the adventure of the garret and i possessed in that case box drawer upstairs casketed with that first letter four companions like to it traced by the same firm pen sealed with the same clear seal full of the same vital comfort vital comfort it seemed to me then i read them in after years they were kind letters enoughpleasing letters because composed by one well pleased in the two last there were three or four closing lines halfgay halftender by feeling touched but not subdued time dear reader mellowed them to a beverage of this mild quality but when i first tasted their elixir fresh from the fount so honoured it seemed juice of a divine vintage a draught which hebe might fill and the very gods approve  does the reader remembering what was said some pages back care to ask how i answered these letters whether under the dry stinting check of reason or according to the full liberal impulse of feeling  to speak truth i compromised matters i served two masters i bowed down in the houses of rimmon and lifted the heart at another shrine i wrote to these letters two answersone for my own relief the other for grahams perusal  to begin with feeling and i turned reason out of doors drew against her bar and bolt then we sat down spread our paper dipped in the ink an eager pen and with deep enjoyment poured out our sincere heart when we had donewhen two sheets were covered with the language of a stronglyadherent affection a rooted and active gratitudeonce for all in this parenthesis i disclaim with the utmost scorn every sneaking suspicion of what are called warmer feelings women do not entertain these warmer feelings where from the commencement through the whole progress of an acquaintance they have never once been cheated of the conviction that to do so would be to commit a mortal absurdity nobody ever launches into love unless he has seen or dreamed the rising of hopes star over loves troubled waterswhen then i had given expression to a closelyclinging and deeplyhonouring attachmentan attachment that wanted to attract to itself and take to its own lot all that was painful in the destiny of its object that would if it could have absorbed and conducted away all storms and lightnings from an existence viewed with a passion of solicitudethen just at that moment the doors of my heart would shake bolt and bar would yield reason would leap in vigorous and revengeful snatch the full sheets read sneer erase tear up rewrite fold seal direct and send a terse curt missive of a page she did right  i did not live on letters only i was visited i was looked after once a week i was taken out to la terrasse always i was made much of dr bretton failed not to tell me why he was so kind to keep away the nun he said he was determined to dispute with her her prey he had taken he declared a thorough dislike to her chiefly on account of that white facecloth and those cold grey eyes the moment he heard of those odious particulars he affirmed consummate disgust had incited him to oppose her he was determined to try whether he or she was the cleverest and he only wished she would once more look in upon me when he was present but that she never did in short he regarded me scientifically in the light of a patient and at once exercised his professional skill and gratified his natural benevolence by a course of cordial and attentive treatment  one evening the first in december i was walking by myself in the carré it was six oclock the classedoors were closed but within the pupils rampant in the licence of evening recreation were counterfeiting a miniature chaos the carré was quite dark except a red light shining under and about the stove the wide glassdoors and the long windows were frosted over a crystal sparkle of starlight here and there spangling this blanched winter veil and breaking with scattered brilliance the paleness of its embroidery proved it a clear night though moonless that i should dare to remain thus alone in darkness showed that my nerves were regaining a healthy tone i thought of the nun but hardly feared her though the staircase was behind me leading up through blind black night from landing to landing to the haunted grenier yet i own my heart quaked my pulse leaped when i suddenly heard breathing and rustling and turning saw in the deep shadow of the steps a deeper shadow stilla shape that moved and descended it paused a while at the classedoor and then it glided before me simultaneously came a clangor of the distant doorbell lifelike sounds bring lifelike feelings this shape was too round and low for my gaunt nun it was only madame beck on duty  mademoiselle lucy cried rosine bursting in lamp in hand from the corridor on est là pour vous au salon  madame saw me i saw madame rosine saw us both there was no mutual recognition i made straight for the salon there i found what i own i anticipated i should finddr bretton but he was in eveningdress  the carriage is at the door said he my mother has sent it to take you to the theatre she was going herself but an arrival has prevented her she immediately said take lucy in my place will you go  just now i am not dressed cried i glancing despairingly at my dark merino  you have half an hour to dress i should have given you notice but i only determined on going since five oclock when i heard there was to be a genuine regale in the presence of a great actress  and he mentioned a name that thrilled mea name that in those days could thrill europe it is hushed now its once restless echoes are all still she who bore it went years ago to her rest night and oblivion long since closed above her but then her daya day of siriusstood at its full height light and fervour  ill go i will be ready in ten minutes i vowed and away i flew never once checked reader by the thought which perhaps at this moment checks you namely that to go anywhere with graham and without mrs bretton could be objectionable i could not have conceived much less have expressed to graham such thoughtsuch scruplewithout risk of exciting a tyrannous selfcontempt of kindling an inward fire of shame so quenchless and so devouring that i think it would soon have licked up the very life in my veins besides my godmother knowing her son and knowing me would as soon have thought of chaperoning a sister with a brother as of keeping anxious guard over our incomings and outgoings  the present was no occasion for showy array my dun mist crape would suffice and i sought the same in the great oakwardrobe in the dormitory where hung no less than forty dresses but there had been changes and reforms and some innovating hand had pruned this same crowded wardrobe and carried divers garments to the greniermy crape amongst the rest i must fetch it i got the key and went aloft fearless almost thoughtless i unlocked the door i plunged in the reader may believe it or not but when i thus suddenly entered that garret was not wholly dark as it should have been from one point there shone a solemn light like a star but broader so plainly it shone that it revealed the deep alcove with a portion of the tarnished scarlet curtain drawn over it instantly silently before my eyes it vanished so did the curtain and alcove all that end of the garret became black as night i ventured no research i had not time nor will snatching my dress which hung on the wall happily near the door i rushed out relocked the door with convulsed haste and darted downwards to the dormitory  but i trembled too much to dress myself impossible to arrange hair or fasten hooksandeyes with such fingers so i called rosine and bribed her to help me rosine liked a bribe so she did her best smoothed and plaited my hair as well as a coiffeur would have done placed the lace collar mathematically straight tied the neckribbon accuratelyin short did her work like the neathanded phillis she could be when she those having given me my handkerchief and gloves she took the candle and lighted me downstairs after all i had forgotten my shawl she ran back to fetch it and i stood with dr john in the vestibule waiting  what is this lucy said he looking down at me narrowly here is the old excitement ha the nun again  but i utterly denied the charge i was vexed to be suspected of a second illusion he was sceptical  she has been as sure as i live said he her figure crossing your eyes leaves on them a peculiar gleam and expression not to be mistaken  she has not been i persisted for indeed i could deny her apparition with truth  the old symptoms are there he affirmed a particular pale and what the scotch call a raised look  he was so obstinate i thought it better to tell him what i really had seen of course with him it was held to be another effect of the same cause it was all optical illusionnervous malady and so on not one bit did i believe him but i dared not contradict doctors are so selfopinionated so immovable in their dry materialist views  rosine brought the shawl and i was bundled into the carriage                                       the theatre was fullcrammed to its roof royal and noble were there palace and hotel had emptied their inmates into those tiers so thronged and so hushed deeply did i feel myself privileged in having a place before that stage i longed to see a being of whose powers i had heard reports which made me conceive peculiar anticipations i wondered if she would justify her renown with strange curiosity with feelings severe and austere yet of riveted interest i waited she was a study of such nature as had not encountered my eyes yet a great and new planet she was but in what shape i waited her rising  she rose at nine that december night above the horizon i saw her come she could shine yet with pale grandeur and steady might but that star verged already on its judgmentday seen near it was a chaoshollow halfconsumed an orb perished or perishinghalf lava half glow  i had heard this woman termed plain and i expected bony harshness and grimnesssomething large angular sallow what i saw was the shadow of a royal vashti a queen fair as the day once turned pale now like twilight and wasted like wax in flame  for awhilea long whilei thought it was only a woman though an unique woman who moved in might and grace before this multitude byandby i recognised my mistake behold i found upon her something neither of woman nor of man in each of her eyes sat a devil these evil forces bore her through the tragedy kept up her feeble strengthfor she was but a frail creature and as the action rose and the stir deepened how wildly they shook her with their passions of the pit they wrote hell on her straight haughty brow they tuned her voice to the note of torment they writhed her regal face to a demoniac mask hate and murder and madness incarnate she stood  it was a marvellous sight a mighty revelation  it was a spectacle low horrible immoral  swordsmen thrust through and dying in their blood on the arena sand bulls goring horses disembowelled made a meeker vision for the publica milder condiment for a peoples palatethan vashti torn by seven devils devils which cried sore and rent the tenement they haunted but still refused to be exorcised  suffering had struck that stage empress and she stood before her audience neither yielding to nor enduring nor in finite measure resenting it she stood locked in struggle rigid in resistance she stood not dressed but draped in pale antique folds long and regular like sculpture a background and entourage and flooring of deepest crimson threw her out white like alabasterlike silver rather be it said like death  where was the artist of the cleopatra let him come and sit down and study this different vision let him seek here the mighty brawn the muscle the abounding blood the fullfed flesh he worshipped let all materialists draw nigh and look on  i have said that she does not resent her grief no the weakness of that word would make it a lie to her what hurts becomes immediately embodied she looks on it as a thing that can be attacked worried down torn in shreds scarcely a substance herself she grapples to conflict with abstractions before calamity she is a tigress she rends her woes shivers them in convulsed abhorrence pain for her has no result in good tears water no harvest of wisdom on sickness on death itself she looks with the eye of a rebel wicked perhaps she is but also she is strong and her strength has conquered beauty has overcome grace and bound both at her side captives peerlessly fair and docile as fair even in the uttermost frenzy of energy is each maenad movement royally imperially incedingly upborne her hair flying loose in revel or war is still an angels hair and glorious under a halo fallen insurgent banished she remembers the heaven where she rebelled heavens light following her exile pierces its confines and discloses their forlorn remoteness  place now the cleopatra or any other slug before her as an obstacle and see her cut through the pulpy mass as the scimitar of saladin clove the down cushion let paul peter rubens wake from the dead let him rise out of his cerements and bring into this presence all the army of his fat women the magian power or prophetvirtue gifting that slight rod of moses could at one waft release and remingle a sea spellparted whelming the heavy host with the downrush of overthrown searamparts  vashti was not good i was told and i have said she did not look good though a spirit she was a spirit out of tophet well if so much of unholy force can arise from below may not an equal efflux of sacred essence descend one day from above  what thought dr graham of this being  for long intervals i forgot to look how he demeaned himself or to question what he thought the strong magnetism of genius drew my heart out of its wonted orbit the sunflower turned from the south to a fierce light not solara rushing red cometary lighthot on vision and to sensation i had seen acting before but never anything like this never anything which astonished hope and hushed desire which outstripped impulse and paled conception which instead of merely irritating imagination with the thought of what might be done at the same time fevering the nerves because it was not done disclosed power like a deep swollen winter river thundering in cataract and bearing the soul like a leaf on the steep and steelly sweep of its descent  miss fanshawe with her usual ripeness of judgment pronounced dr bretton a serious impassioned man too grave and too impressible not in such light did i ever see him no such faults could i lay to his charge his natural attitude was not the meditative nor his natural mood the sentimental impressionable he was as dimpling water but almost as water unimpressible the breeze the sun moved himmetal could not grave nor fire brand  dr john could think and think well but he was rather a man of action than of thought he could feel and feel vividly in his way but his heart had no chord for enthusiasm to bright soft sweet influences his eyes and lips gave bright soft sweet welcome beautiful to see as dyes of rose and silver pearl and purple imbuing summer clouds for what belonged to storm what was wild and intense dangerous sudden and flaming he had no sympathy and held with it no communion when i took time and regained inclination to glance at him it amused and enlightened me to discover that he was watching that sinister and sovereign vashti not with wonder nor worship nor yet dismay but simply with intense curiosity her agony did not pain him her wild moanworse than a shriekdid not much move him her fury revolted him somewhat but not to the point of horror cool young briton the pale cliffs of his own england do not look down on the tides of the channel more calmly than he watched the pythian inspiration of that night  looking at his face i longed to know his exact opinions and at last i put a question tending to elicit them at the sound of my voice he awoke as if out of a dream for he had been thinking and very intently thinking his own thoughts after his own manner how did he like vashti i wished to know  hmmm was the first scarce articulate but expressive answer and then such a strange smile went wandering round his lips a smile so critical so almost callous i suppose that for natures of that order his sympathies were callous in a few terse phrases he told me his opinion of and feeling towards the actress he judged her as a woman not an artist it was a branding judgment  that night was already marked in my book of life not with white but with a deepred cross but i had not done with it yet and other memoranda were destined to be set down in characters of tint indelible  towards midnight when the deepening tragedy blackened to the deathscene and all held their breath and even graham bit his underlip and knit his brow and sat still and struckwhen the whole theatre was hushed when the vision of all eyes centred in one point when all ears listened towards one quarternothing being seen but the white form sunk on a seat quivering in conflict with her last her worsthated her visiblyconquering foenothing heard but her throes her gaspings breathing yet of mutiny panting still defiance when as it seemed an inordinate will convulsing a perishing mortal frame bent it to battle with doom and death fought every inch of ground sold every drop of blood resisted to the latest the rape of every faculty would see would hear would breathe would live up to within wellnigh beyond the moment when death says to all sense and all beingthus far and no farther  just then a stir pregnant with omen rustled behind the scenesfeet ran voices spoke what was it demanded the whole house a flame a smell of smoke replied  fire rang through the gallery fire was repeated reechoed yelled forth and then and faster than pen can set it down came panic rushing crushinga blind selfish cruel chaos  and dr john reader i see him yet with his look of comely courage and cordial calm  lucy will sit still i know said he glancing down at me with the same serene goodness the same repose of firmness that i have seen in him when sitting at his side amid the secure peace of his mothers hearth yes thus adjured i think i would have sat still under a rocking crag but indeed to sit still in actual circumstances was my instinct and at the price of my very life i would not have moved to give him trouble thwart his will or make demands on his attention we were in the stalls and for a few minutes there was a most terrible ruthless pressure about us  how terrified are the women said he but if the men were not almost equally so order might be maintained this is a sorry scene i see fifty selfish brutes at this moment each of whom if i were near i could conscientiously knock down i see some women braver than some men there is one yondergood god  while graham was speaking a young girl who had been very quietly and steadily clinging to a gentleman before us was suddenly struck from her protectors arms by a big butcherly intruder and hurled under the feet of the crowd scarce two seconds lasted her disappearance graham rushed forwards he and the gentleman a powerful man though greyhaired united their strength to thrust back the throng her head and long hair fell back over his shoulder she seemed unconscious  trust her with me i am a medical man said dr john  if you have no lady with you be it so was the answer hold her and i will force a passage we must get her to the air  i have a lady said graham but she will be neither hindrance nor incumbrance  he summoned me with his eye we were separated resolute however to rejoin him i penetrated the living barrier creeping under where i could not get between or over  fasten on me and dont leave go he said and i obeyed him  our pioneer proved strong and adroit he opened the dense mass like a wedge with patience and toil he at last bored through the fleshandblood rockso solid hot and suffocatingand brought us to the fresh freezing night  you are an englishman said he turning shortly on dr bretton when we got into the street  an englishman and i speak to a countryman was the reply  right be good enough to stand here two minutes whilst i find my carriage  papa i am not hurt said a girlish voice am i with papa  you are with a friend and your father is close at hand  tell him i am not hurt except just in my shoulder oh my shoulder they trod just here  dislocation perhaps muttered the doctor let us hope there is no worse injury done lucy lend a hand one instant  and i assisted while he made some arrangement of drapery and position for the ease of his suffering burden she suppressed a moan and lay in his arms quietly and patiently  she is very light said graham like a child and he asked in my ear is she a child lucy did you notice her age  i am not a childi am a person of seventeen responded the patient demurely and with dignity then directly after tell papa to come i get anxious  the carriage drove up her father relieved graham but in the exchange from one bearer to another she was hurt and moaned again  my darling said the father tenderly then turning to graham you said sir you are a medical man  i am dr bretton of la terrasse  good will you step into my carriage  my own carriage is here i will seek it and accompany you  be pleased then to follow us and he named his address the hôtel crécy in the rue crécy  we followed the carriage drove fast myself and graham were silent this seemed like an adventure  some little time being lost in seeking our own equipage we reached the hotel perhaps about ten minutes after these strangers it was an hotel in the foreign sense a collection of dwellinghouses not an inna vast lofty pile with a huge arch to its streetdoor leading through a vaulted covered way into a square all built round  we alighted passed up a wide handsome public staircase and stopped at numéro 2 on the second landing the first floor comprising the abode of i know not what prince russe as graham informed me on ringing the bell at a second great door we were admitted to a suite of very handsome apartments announced by a servant in livery we entered a drawingroom whose hearth glowed with an english fire and whose walls gleamed with foreign mirrors near the hearth appeared a little group a slight form sunk in a deep armchair one or two women busy about it the irongrey gentleman anxiously looking on  where is harriet i wish harriet would come to me said the girlish voice faintly  where is mrs hurst demanded the gentleman impatiently and somewhat sternly of the manservant who had admitted us  i am sorry to say she is gone out of town sir my young lady gave her leave till tomorrow  yesi didi did she is gone to see her sister i said she might go i remember now interposed the young lady but i am so sorry for manon and louison cannot understand a word i say and they hurt me without meaning to do so  dr john and the gentleman now interchanged greetings and while they passed a few minutes in consultation i approached the easychair and seeing what the faint and sinking girl wished to have done i did it for her  i was still occupied in the arrangement when graham drew near he was no less skilled in surgery than medicine and on examination found that no further advice than his own was necessary to the treatment of the present case he ordered her to be carried to her chamber and whispered to mego with the women lucy they seem but dull you can at least direct their movements and thus spare her some pain she must be touched very tenderly  the chamber was a room shadowy with paleblue hangings vaporous with curtainings and veilings of muslin the bed seemed to me like snowdrift and mistspotless soft and gauzy making the women stand apart i undressed their mistress without their wellmeaning but clumsy aid i was not in a sufficiently collected mood to note with separate distinctness every detail of the attire i removed but i received a general impression of refinement delicacy and perfect personal cultivation which in a period of afterthought offered in my reflections a singular contrast to notes retained of miss ginevra fanshawes appointments  the girl was herself a small delicate creature but made like a model as i folded back her plentiful yet fine hair so shining and soft and so exquisitely tended i had under my observation a young pale weary but highbred face the brow was smooth and clear the eyebrows were distinct but soft and melting to a mere trace at the temples the eyes were a rich gift of naturefine and full large deep seeming to hold dominion over the slighter subordinate featurescapable probably of much significance at another hour and under other circumstances than the present but now languid and suffering her skin was perfectly fair the neck and hands veined finely like the petals of a flower a thin glazing of the ice of pride polished this delicate exterior and her lip wore a curli doubt not inherent and unconscious but which if i had seen it first with the accompaniments of health and state would have struck me as unwarranted and proving in the little lady a quite mistaken view of life and her own consequence  her demeanour under the doctors hands at first excited a smile it was not puerilerather on the whole patient and firmbut yet once or twice she addressed him with suddenness and sharpness saying that he hurt her and must contrive to give her less pain i saw her large eyes too settle on his face like the solemn eyes of some pretty wondering child i know not whether graham felt this examination if he did he was cautious not to check or discomfort it by any retaliatory look i think he performed his work with extreme care and gentleness sparing her what pain he could and she acknowledged as much when he had done by the wordsthank you doctor and goodnight very gratefully pronounced as she uttered them however it was with a repetition of the serious direct gaze i thought peculiar in its gravity and intentness  the injuries it seems were not dangerous an assurance which her father received with a smile that almost made one his friendit was so glad and gratified he now expressed his obligations to graham with as much earnestness as was befitting an englishman addressing one who has served him but is yet a stranger he also begged him to call the next day  papa said a voice from the veiled couch thank the lady too is she there  i opened the curtain with a smile and looked in at her she lay now at comparative ease she looked pretty though pale her face was delicately designed and if at first sight it appeared proud i believe custom might prove it to be soft  i thank the lady very sincerely said her father i fancy she has been very good to my child i think we scarcely dare tell mrs hurst who has been her substitute and done her work she will feel at once ashamed and jealous  and thus in the most friendly spirit parting greetings were interchanged and refreshment having been hospitably offered but by us as it was late refused we withdrew from the hôtel crécy  on our way back we repassed the theatre all was silence and darkness the roaring rushing crowd all vanished and gonethe damps as well as the incipient fire extinct and forgotten next mornings papers explained that it was but some loose drapery on which a spark had fallen and which had blazed up and been quenched in a moment     chapter xxiv  m de bassompierre   those who live in retirement whose lives have fallen amid the seclusion of schools or of other walledin and guarded dwellings are liable to be suddenly and for a long while dropped out of the memory of their friends the denizens of a freer world unaccountably perhaps and close upon some space of unusually frequent intercoursesome congeries of rather exciting little circumstances whose natural sequel would rather seem to be the quickening than the suspension of communicationthere falls a stilly pause a wordless silence a long blank of oblivion unbroken always is this blank alike entire and unexplained the letter the message once frequent are cut off the visit formerly periodical ceases to occur the book paper or other token that indicated remembrance comes no more  always there are excellent reasons for these lapses if the hermit but knew them though he is stagnant in his cell his connections without are whirling in the very vortex of life that void interval which passes for him so slowly that the very clocks seem at a stand and the wingless hours plod by in the likeness of tired tramps prone to rest at milestonesthat same interval perhaps teems with events and pants with hurry for his friends  the hermitif he be a sensible hermitwill swallow his own thoughts and lock up his own emotions during these weeks of inward winter he will know that destiny designed him to imitate on occasion the dormouse and he will be conformable make a tidy ball of himself creep into a hole of lifes wall and submit decently to the drift which blows in and soon blocks him up preserving him in ice for the season  let him say it is quite right it ought to be so since so it is and perhaps one day his snowsepulchre will open springs softness will return the sun and southwind will reach him the budding of hedges and carolling of birds and singing of liberated streams will call him to kindly resurrection perhaps this may be the case perhaps not the frost may get into his heart and never thaw more when spring comes a crow or a pie may pick out of the wall only his dormousebones well even in that case all will be right it is to be supposed he knew from the first he was mortal and must one day go the way of all flesh as well soon as syne  following that eventful evening at the theatre came for me seven weeks as bare as seven sheets of blank paper no word was written on one of them not a visit not a token  about the middle of that time i entertained fancies that something had happened to my friends at la terrasse the midblank is always a beclouded point for the solitary his nerves ache with the strain of long expectancy the doubts hitherto repelled gather now to a mass andstrong in accumulationroll back upon him with a force which savours of vindictiveness night too becomes an unkindly time and sleep and his nature cannot agree strange starts and struggles harass his couch the sinister band of bad dreams with horror of calamity and sick dread of entire desertion at their head join the league against him poor wretch he does his best to bear up but he is a poor pallid wasting wretch despite that best  towards the last of these long seven weeks i admitted what through the other six i had jealously excludedthe conviction that these blanks were inevitable the result of circumstances the fiat of fate a part of my lifes lot andabove alla matter about whose origin no question must ever be asked for whose painful sequence no murmur ever uttered of course i did not blame myself for suffering i thank god i had a truer sense of justice than to fall into any imbecile extravagance of selfaccusation and as to blaming others for silence in my reason i well knew them blameless and in my heart acknowledged them so but it was a rough and heavy road to travel and i longed for better days  i tried different expedients to sustain and fill existence i commenced an elaborate piece of lacework i studied german pretty hard i undertook a course of regular reading of the driest and thickest books in the library in all my efforts i was as orthodox as i knew how to be was there error somewhere very likely i only know the result was as if i had gnawed a file to satisfy hunger or drank brine to quench thirst  my hour of torment was the posthour unfortunately i knew it too well and tried as vainly as assiduously to cheat myself of that knowledge dreading the rack of expectation and the sick collapse of disappointment which daily preceded and followed upon that wellrecognised ring  i suppose animals kept in cages and so scantily fed as to be always upon the verge of famine await their food as i awaited a letter ohto speak truth and drop that tone of a false calm which long to sustain outwears natures endurancei underwent in those seven weeks bitter fears and pains strange inward trials miserable defections of hope intolerable encroachments of despair this last came so near me sometimes that her breath went right through me i used to feel it like a baleful air or sigh penetrate deep and make motion pause at my heart or proceed only under unspeakable oppression the letterthe wellbeloved letterwould not come and it was all of sweetness in life i had to look for  in the very extremity of want i had recourse again and yet again to the little packet in the casethe five letters how splendid that month seemed whose skies had beheld the rising of these five stars it was always at night i visited them and not daring to ask every evening for a candle in the kitchen i bought a wax taper and matches to light it and at the studyhour stole up to the dormitory and feasted on my crust from the barmecides loaf it did not nourish me i pined on it and got as thin as a shadow otherwise i was not ill  reading there somewhat late one evening and feeling that the power to read was leaving mefor the letters from incessant perusal were losing all sap and significance my gold was withering to leaves before my eyes and i was sorrowing over the disillusionsuddenly a quick tripping foot ran up the stairs i knew ginevra fanshawes step she had dined in town that afternoon she was now returned and would come here to replace her shawl c in the wardrobe  yes in she came dressed in bright silk with her shawl falling from her shoulders and her curls halfuncurled in the damp of night drooping careless and heavy upon her neck i had hardly time to recasket my treasures and lock them up when she was at my side her humour seemed none of the best  it has been a stupid evening they are stupid people she began  who mrs cholmondeley i thought you always found her house charming  i have not been to mrs cholmondeleys  indeed have you made new acquaintance  my uncle de bassompierre is come  your uncle de bassompierre are you not gladi thought he was a favourite  you thought wrong the man is odious i hate him  because he is a foreigner or for what other reason of equal weight  he is not a foreigner the man is english enough goodness knows and had an english name till three or four years ago but his mother was a foreigner a de bassompierre and some of her family are dead and have left him estates a title and this name he is quite a great man now  do you hate him for that reason  dont i know what mamma says about him he is not my own uncle but married mammas sister mamma detests him she says he killed aunt ginevra with unkindness he looks like a bear such a dismal evening she went on ill go no more to his big hotel fancy me walking into a room alone and a great man fifty years old coming forwards and after a few minutes conversation actually turning his back upon me and then abruptly going out of the room such odd ways i daresay his conscience smote him for they all say at home i am the picture of aunt ginevra mamma often declares the likeness is quite ridiculous  were you the only visitor  the only visitor yes then there was missy my cousin little spoiled pampered thing  m de bassompierre has a daughter  yes yes dont tease one with questions oh dear i am so tired  she yawned throwing herself without ceremony on my bed she added it seems mademoiselle was nearly crushed to a jelly in a hubbub at the theatre some weeks ago  ah indeed and they live at a large hotel in the rue crécy  justement how do you know  i have been there  oh you have really you go everywhere in these days i suppose mother bretton took you she and esculapius have the entrée of the de bassompierre apartments it seems my son john attended missy on the occasion of her accidentaccident bah all affectation i dont think she was squeezed more than she richly deserves for her airs and now there is quite an intimacy struck up i heard something about auld lang syne and what not oh how stupid they all were  all you said you were the only visitor  did i you see one forgets to particularize an old woman and her boy  dr and mrs bretton were at m de bassompierres this evening  ay ay as large as life and missy played the hostess what a conceited doll it is  soured and listless miss fanshawe was beginning to disclose the causes of her prostrate condition there had been a retrenchment of incense a diversion or a total withholding of homage and attention coquetry had failed of effect vanity had undergone mortification she lay fuming in the vapours  is miss de bassompierre quite well now i asked  as well as you or i no doubt but she is an affected little thing and gave herself invalid airs to attract medical notice and to see the old dowager making her recline on a couch and my son john prohibiting excitement etceterafaugh the scene was quite sickening  it would not have been so if the object of attention had been changed if you had taken miss de bassompierres place  indeed i hate my son john  my son johnwhom do you indicate by that name dr brettons mother never calls him so  then she ought a clownish bearish john he is  you violate the truth in saying so and as the whole of my patience is now spun off the distaff i peremptorily desire you to rise from that bed and vacate this room  passionate thing your face is the colour of a coquelicot i wonder what always makes you so mighty testy à lendroit du gros jean john anderson my joe john oh the distinguished name  thrilling with exasperation to which it would have been sheer folly to have given ventfor there was no contending with that unsubstantial feather that mealywinged mothi extinguished my taper locked my bureau and left her since she would not leave me smallbeer as she was she had turned insufferably acid  the morrow was thursday and a halfholiday breakfast was over i had withdrawn to the first classe the dreaded hour the posthour was nearing and i sat waiting it much as a ghostseer might wait his spectre less than ever was a letter probable still strive as i would i could not forget that it was possible as the moments lessened a restlessness and fear almost beyond the average assailed me it was a day of winter east wind and i had now for some time entered into that dreary fellowship with the winds and their changes so little known so incomprehensible to the healthy the north and east owned a terrific influence making all pain more poignant all sorrow sadder the south could calm the west sometimes cheer unless indeed they brought on their wings the burden of thunderclouds under the weight and warmth of which all energy died  bitter and dark as was this january day i remember leaving the classe and running down without bonnet to the bottom of the long garden and then lingering amongst the stripped shrubs in the forlorn hope that the postmans ring might occur while i was out of hearing and i might thus be spared the thrill which some particular nerve or nerves almost gnawed through with the unremitting tooth of a fixed idea were becoming wholly unfit to support i lingered as long as i dared without fear of attracting attention by my absence i muffled my head in my apron and stopped my ears in terror of the torturing clang sure to be followed by such blank silence such barren vacuum for me at last i ventured to reenter the first classe where as it was not yet nine oclock no pupils had been admitted the first thing seen was a white object on my black desk a white flat object the post had indeed arrived by me unheard rosine had visited my cell and like some angel had left behind her a bright token of her presence that shining thing on the desk was indeed a letter a real letter i saw so much at the distance of three yards and as i had but one correspondent on earth from that one it must come he remembered me yet how deep a pulse of gratitude sent new life through my heart  drawing near bending and looking on the letter in trembling but almost certain hope of seeing a known hand it was my lot to find on the contrary an autograph for the moment deemed unknowna pale female scrawl instead of a firm masculine character i then thought fate was too hard for me and i said audibly this is cruel  but i got over that pain also life is still life whatever its pangs our eyes and ears and their use remain with us though the prospect of what pleases be wholly withdrawn and the sound of what consoles be quite silenced  i opened the billet by this time i had recognised its handwriting as perfectly familiar it was dated la terrasse and it ran thus  dear lucyit occurs to me to inquire what you have been doing with yourself for the last month or two not that i suspect you would have the least difficulty in giving an account of your proceedings i daresay you have been just as busy and as happy as ourselves at la terrasse as to graham his professional connection extends daily he is so much sought after so much engaged that i tell him he will grow quite conceited like a right good mother as i am i do my best to keep him down no flattery does he get from me as you know and yet lucy he is a fine fellow his mothers heart dances at the sight of him after being hurried here and there the whole day and passing the ordeal of fifty sorts of tempers and combating a hundred caprices and sometimes witnessing cruel sufferingsperhaps occasionally as i tell him inflicting themat night he still comes home to me in such kindly pleasant mood that really i seem to live in a sort of moral antipodes and on these january evenings my day rises when other peoples night sets in  still he needs keeping in order and correcting and repressing and i do him that good service but the boy is so elastic there is no such thing as vexing him thoroughly when i think i have at last driven him to the sullens he turns on me with jokes for retaliation but you know him and all his iniquities and i am but an elderly simpleton to make him the subject of this epistle  as for me i have had my old bretton agent here on a visit and have been plunged overhead and ears in business matters i do so wish to regain for graham at least some part of what his father left him he laughs to scorn my anxiety on this point bidding me look and see how he can provide for himself and me too and asking what the old lady can possibly want that she has not hinting about skyblue turbans accusing me of an ambition to wear diamonds keep livery servants have an hotel and lead the fashion amongst the english clan in villette  talking of skyblue turbans i wish you had been with us the other evening he had come in really tired and after i had given him his tea he threw himself into my chair with his customary presumption to my great delight he dropped asleep you know how he teases me about being drowsy i who never by any chance close an eye by daylight while he slept i thought he looked very bonny lucy fool as i am to be so proud of him but who can help it show me his peer look where i will i see nothing like him in villette well i took it into my head to play him a trick so i brought out the skyblue turban and handling it with gingerly precaution i managed to invest his brows with this grand adornment i assure you it did not at all misbecome him he looked quite eastern except that he is so fair nobody however can accuse him of having red hair nowit is genuine chestnuta dark glossy chestnut and when i put my large cashmere about him there was as fine a young bey dey or pacha improvised as you would wish to see  it was good entertainment but only halfenjoyed since i was alone you should have been there  in due time my lord awoke the lookingglass above the fireplace soon intimated to him his plight as you may imagine i now live under threat and dread of vengeance  but to come to the gist of my letter i know thursday is a halfholiday in the rue fossette be ready then by five in the afternoon at which hour i will send the carriage to take you out to la terrasse be sure to come you may meet some old acquaintance goodby my wise dear grave little goddaughtervery truly yours  louisa bretton  now a letter like that sets one to rights i might still be sad after reading that letter but i was more composed not exactly cheered perhaps but relieved my friends at least were well and happy no accident had occurred to graham no illness had seized his mothercalamities that had so long been my dream and thought their feelings for me too wereas they had been yet how strange it was to look on mrs brettons seven weeks and contrast them with my seven weeks also how very wise it is in people placed in an exceptional position to hold their tongues and not rashly declare how such position galls them the world can understand well enough the process of perishing for want of food perhaps few persons can enter into or follow out that of going mad from solitary confinement they see the longburied prisoner disinterred a maniac or an idiothow his senses left himhow his nerves first inflamed underwent nameless agony and then sunk to palsyis a subject too intricate for examination too abstract for popular comprehension speak of it you might almost as well stand up in an european marketplace and propound dark sayings in that language and mood wherein nebuchadnezzar the imperial hypochondriac communed with his baffled chaldeans and long long may the minds to whom such themes are no mysteryby whom their bearings are sympathetically seizedbe few in number and rare of rencounter long may it be generally thought that physical privations alone merit compassion and that the rest is a figment when the world was younger and haler than now moral trials were a deeper mystery still perhaps in all the land of israel there was but one saulcertainly but one david to soothe or comprehend him  the keen still cold of the morning was succeeded later in the day by a sharp breathing from russian wastes the cold zone sighed over the temperate zone and froze it fast a heavy firmament dull and thick with snow sailed up from the north and settled over expectant europe towards afternoon began the descent i feared no carriage would come the white tempest raged so dense and wild but trust my godmother once having asked she would have her guest about six oclock i was lifted from the carriage over the already blockedup front steps of the château and put in at the door of la terrasse  running through the vestibule and upstairs to the drawingroom there i found mrs brettona summerday in her own person had i been twice as cold as i was her kind kiss and cordial clasp would have warmed me inured now for so long a time to rooms with bare boards black benches desks and stoves the blue saloon seemed to me gorgeous in its christmaslike fire alone there was a clear and crimson splendour which quite dazzled me  when my godmother had held my hand for a little while and chatted with me and scolded me for having become thinner than when she last saw me she professed to discover that the snowwind had disordered my hair and sent me upstairs to make it neat and remove my shawl  repairing to my own little seagreen room there also i found a bright fire and candles too were lit a tall waxlight stood on each side the great looking glass but between the candles and before the glass appeared something dressing itselfan airy fairy thingsmall slight whitea winter spirit  i declare for one moment i thought of graham and his spectral illusions with distrustful eye i noted the details of this new vision it wore white sprinkled slightly with drops of scarlet its girdle was red it had something in its hair leafy yet shininga little wreath with an evergreen gloss spectral or not here truly was nothing frightful and i advanced  turning quick upon me a large eye under long lashes flashed over me the intruder the lashes were as dark as long and they softened with their pencilling the orb they guarded  ah you are come she breathed out in a soft quiet voice and she smiled slowly and gazed intently  i knew her now having only once seen that sort of face with that cast of fine and delicate featuring i could not but know her  miss de bassompierre i pronounced  no was the reply not miss de bassompierre for you i did not inquire who then she might be but waited voluntary information  you are changed but still you are yourself she said approaching nearer i remember you wellyour countenance the colour of your hair the outline of your face  i had moved to the fire and she stood opposite and gazed into me and as she gazed her face became gradually more and more expressive of thought and feeling till at last a dimness quenched her clear vision  it makes me almost cry to look so far back said she but as to being sorry or sentimental dont think it on the contrary i am quite pleased and glad  interested yet altogether at fault i knew not what to say at last i stammered i think i never met you till that night some weeks ago when you were hurt  she smiled you have forgotten then that i have sat on your knee been lifted in your arms even shared your pillow you no longer remember the night when i came crying like a naughty little child as i was to your bedside and you took me in you have no memory for the comfort and protection by which you soothed an acute distress go back to bretton remember mr home  at last i saw it all and you are little polly  i am paulina mary home de bassompierre  how time can change little polly wore in her pale small features her fairy symmetry her varying expression a certain promise of interest and grace but paulina mary was become beautifulnot with the beauty that strikes the eye like a roseorbed ruddy and replete not with the plump and pink and flaxen attributes of her blond cousin ginevra but her seventeen years had brought her a refined and tender charm which did not lie in complexion though hers was fair and clear nor in outline though her features were sweet and her limbs perfectly turned but i think rather in a subdued glow from the soul outward this was not an opaque vase of material however costly but a lamp chastely lucent guarding from extinction yet not hiding from worship a flame vital and vestal in speaking of her attractions i would not exaggerate language but indeed they seemed to me very real and engaging what though all was on a small scale it was the perfume which gave this white violet distinction and made it superior to the broadest cameliathe fullest dahlia that ever bloomed  ah and you remember the old time at bretton  better said she better perhaps than you i remember it with minute distinctness not only the time but the days of the time and the hours of the days  you must have forgotten some things  very little i imagine  you were then a little creature of quick feelings you must long ere this have outgrown the impressions with which joy and grief affection and bereavement stamped your mind ten years ago  you think i have forgotten whom i liked and in what degree i liked them when a child  the sharpness must be gonethe point the poignancythe deep imprint must be softened away and effaced  i have a good memory for those days  she looked as if she had her eyes were the eyes of one who can remember one whose childhood does not fade like a dream nor whose youth vanish like a sunbeam she would not take life loosely and incoherently in parts and let one season slip as she entered on another she would retain and add often review from the commencement and so grow in harmony and consistency as she grew in years still i could not quite admit the conviction that all the pictures which now crowded upon me were vivid and visible to her her fond attachments her sports and contests with a wellloved playmate the patient true devotion of her childs heart her fears her delicate reserves her little trials the last piercing pain of separation i retraced these things and shook my head incredulous she persisted the child of seven years lives yet in the girl of seventeen said she  you used to be excessively fond of mrs bretton i remarked intending to test her she set me right at once  not excessively fond said she i liked her i respected her as i should do now she seems to me very little altered  she is not much changed i assented  we were silent a few minutes glancing round the room she said there are several things here that used to be at bretton i remember that pincushion and that lookingglass  evidently she was not deceived in her estimate of her own memory not at least so far  you think then you would have known mrs bretton i went on  i perfectly remembered her the turn of her features her olive complexion and black hair her height her walk her voice  dr bretton of course i pursued would be out of the question and indeed as i saw your first interview with him i am aware that he appeared to you as a stranger  that first night i was puzzled she answered  how did the recognition between him and your father come about  they exchanged cards the names graham bretton and home de bassompierre gave rise to questions and explanations that was on the second day but before then i was beginning to know something  howknow something  why she said how strange it is that most people seem so slow to feel the truthnot to see but feel when dr bretton had visited me a few times and sat near and talked to me when i had observed the look in his eyes the expression about his mouth the form of his chin the carriage of his head and all that we do observe in persons who approach ushow could i avoid being led by association to think of graham bretton graham was slighter than he and not grown so tall and had a smoother face and longer and lighter hair and spokenot so deeplymore like a girl but yet he is graham just as i am little polly or you are lucy snowe  i thought the same but i wondered to find my thoughts hers there are certain things in which we so rarely meet with our double that it seems a miracle when that chance befalls  you and graham were once playmates  and do you remember that she questioned in her turn  no doubt he will remember it also said i  i have not asked him few things would surprise me so much as to find that he did i suppose his disposition is still gay and careless  was it so formerly did it so strike you do you thus remember him  i scarcely remember him in any other light sometimes he was studious sometimes he was merry but whether busy with his books or disposed for play it was chiefly the books or game he thought of not much heeding those with whom he read or amused himself  yet to you he was partial  partial to me oh no he had other playmateshis schoolfellows i was of little consequence to him except on sundays yes he was kind on sundays i remember walking with him handinhand to st marys and his finding the places in my prayerbook and how good and still he was on sunday evenings so mild for such a proud lively boy so patient with all my blunders in reading and so wonderfully to be depended on for he never spent those evenings from home i had a constant fear that he would accept some invitation and forsake us but he never did nor seemed ever to wish to do it thus of course it can be no more i suppose sunday will now be dr brettons diningout day  children come down here called mrs bretton from below paulina would still have lingered but i inclined to descend we went down     chapter xxv  the little countess   cheerful as my godmother naturally was and entertaining as for our sakes she made a point of being there was no true enjoyment that evening at la terrasse till through the wild howl of the winternight were heard the signal sounds of arrival how often while women and girls sit warm at snug firesides their hearts and imaginations are doomed to divorce from the comfort surrounding their persons forced out by night to wander through dark ways to dare stress of weather to contend with the snowblast to wait at lonely gates and stiles in wildest storms watching and listening to see and hear the father the son the husband coming home  father and son came at last to the château for the count de bassompierre that night accompanied dr bretton i know not which of our trio heard the horses first the asperity the violence of the weather warranted our running down into the hall to meet and greet the two riders as they came in but they warned us to keep our distance both were whitetwo mountains of snow and indeed mrs bretton seeing their condition ordered them instantly to the kitchen prohibiting them at their peril from setting foot on her carpeted staircase till they had severally put off that mask of old christmas they now affected into the kitchen however we could not help following them it was a large old dutch kitchen picturesque and pleasant the little white countess danced in a circle about her equally white sire clapping her hands and crying papa papa you look like an enormous polar bear  the bear shook himself and the little sprite fled far from the frozen shower back she came however laughing and eager to aid in removing the arctic disguise the count at last issuing from his dreadnought threatened to overwhelm her with it as with an avalanche  come then said she bending to invite the fall and when it was playfully advanced above her head bounding out of reach like some little chamois  her movements had the supple softness the velvet grace of a kitten her laugh was clearer than the ring of silver and crystal as she took her sires cold hands and rubbed them and stood on tiptoe to reach his lips for a kiss there seemed to shine round her a halo of loving delight the grave and reverend seignor looked down on her as men do look on what is the apple of their eye  mrs bretton said he what am i to do with this daughter or daughterling of mine she neither grows in wisdom nor in stature dont you find her pretty nearly as much the child as she was ten years ago  she cannot be more the child than this great boy of mine said mrs bretton who was in conflict with her son about some change of dress she deemed advisable and which he resisted he stood leaning against the dutch dresser laughing and keeping her at arms length  come mamma said he by way of compromise and to secure for us inward as well as outward warmth let us have a christmas wassailcup and toast old england here on the hearth  so while the count stood by the fire and paulina mary still danced to and frohappy in the liberty of the wide halllike kitchenmrs bretton herself instructed martha to spice and heat the wassailbowl and pouring the draught into a bretton flagon it was served round reaming hot by means of a small silver vessel which i recognised as grahams christeningcup  heres to auld lang syne said the count holding the glancing cup on high then looking at mrs bretton    we twa ha paidlet i the burn       fra morning sun till dine   but seas between us braid ha roared       sin auld lane syne    and surely yell be your pintstoup       and surely ill be mine   and well taste a cup o kindness yet       for auld lang syne  scotch scotch cried paulina papa is talking scotch and scotch he is partly we are home and de bassompierre caledonian and gallic  and is that a scotch reel you are dancing you highland fairy asked her father mrs bretton there will be a green ring growing up in the middle of your kitchen shortly i would not answer for her being quite cannie she is a strange little mortal  tell lucy to dance with me papa there is lucy snowe  mr home there was still quite as much about him of plain mr home as of proud count de bassompierre held his hand out to me saying kindly he remembered me well and even had his own memory been less trustworthy my name was so often on his daughters lips and he had listened to so many long tales about me i should seem like an old acquaintance  every one now had tasted the wassailcup except paulina whose pas de fée ou de fantaisie nobody thought of interrupting to offer so profanatory a draught but she was not to be overlooked nor baulked of her mortal privileges  let me taste said she to graham as he was putting the cup on the shelf of the dresser out of her reach  mrs bretton and mr home were now engaged in conversation dr john had not been unobservant of the fairys dance he had watched it and he had liked it to say nothing of the softness and beauty of the movements eminently grateful to his graceloving eye that ease in his mothers house charmed him for it set him at ease again she seemed a child for himagain almost his playmate i wondered how he would speak to her i had not yet seen him address her his first words proved that the old days of little polly had been recalled to his mind by this evenings childlike lightheartedness  your ladyship wishes for the tankard  i think i said so i think i intimated as much  couldnt consent to a step of the kind on any account sorry for it but couldnt do it  why i am quite well now it cant break my collarbone again or dislocate my shoulder is it wine  no nor dew  i dont want dew i dont like dew but what is it  alestrong aleold october brewed perhaps when i was born  it must be curious is it good  excessively good  and he took it down administered to himself a second dose of this mighty elixir expressed in his mischievous eyes extreme contentment with the same and solemnly replaced the cup on the shelf  i should like a little said paulina looking up i never had any old october is it sweet  perilously sweet said graham  she continued to look up exactly with the countenance of a child that longs for some prohibited dainty at last the doctor relented took it down and indulged himself in the gratification of letting her taste from his hand his eyes always expressive in the revelation of pleasurable feelings luminously and smilingly avowed that it was a gratification and he prolonged it by so regulating the position of the cup that only a drop at a time could reach the rosy sipping lips by which its brim was courted  a little morea little more said she petulantly touching his hand with the forefinger to make him incline the cup more generously and yieldingly it smells of spice and sugar but i cant taste it your wrist is so stiff and you are so stingy  he indulged her whispering however with gravity dont tell my mother or lucy they wouldnt approve  nor do i said she passing into another tone and manner as soon as she had fairly assayed the beverage just as if it had acted upon her like some disenchanting draught undoing the work of a wizard i find it anything but sweet it is bitter and hot and takes away my breath your old october was only desirable while forbidden thank you no more  and with a slight bendcareless but as graceful as her danceshe glided from him and rejoined her father  i think she had spoken truth the child of seven was in the girl of seventeen  graham looked after her a little baffled a little puzzled his eye was on her a good deal during the rest of the evening but she did not seem to notice him  as we ascended to the drawingroom for tea she took her fathers arm her natural place seemed to be at his side her eyes and her ears were dedicated to him he and mrs bretton were the chief talkers of our little party and paulina was their best listener attending closely to all that was said prompting the repetition of this or that trait or adventure  and where were you at such a time papa and what did you say then and tell mrs bretton what happened on that occasion thus she drew him out  she did not again yield to any effervescence of glee the infantine sparkle was exhaled for the night she was soft thoughtful and docile it was pretty to see her bid goodnight her manner to graham was touched with dignity in her very slight smile and quiet bow spoke the countess and graham could not but look grave and bend responsive i saw he hardly knew how to blend together in his ideas the dancing fairy and delicate dame  next day when we were all assembled round the breakfasttable shivering and fresh from the mornings chill ablutions mrs bretton pronounced a decree that nobody who was not forced by dire necessity should quit her house that day  indeed egress seemed next to impossible the drift darkened the lower panes of the casement and on looking out one saw the sky and air vexed and dim the wind and snow in angry conflict there was no fall now but what had already descended was torn up from the earth whirled round by brief shrieking gusts and cast into a hundred fantastic forms  the countess seconded mrs bretton  papa shall not go out said she placing a seat for herself beside her fathers armchair i will look after him you wont go into town will you papa  ay and no was the answer if you and mrs bretton are very good to me pollykind you know and attentive if you pet me in a very nice manner and make much of me i may possibly be induced to wait an hour after breakfast and see whether this razoredged wind settles but you see you give me no breakfast you offer me nothing you let me starve  quick please mrs bretton and pour out the coffee entreated paulina whilst i take care of the count de bassompierre in other respects since he grew into a count he has needed so much attention  she separated and prepared a roll  there papa are your pistolets charged said she and there is some marmalade just the same sort of marmalade we used to have at bretton and which you said was as good as if it had been conserved in scotland  and which your little ladyship used to beg for my boydo you remember that interposed mrs bretton have you forgotten how you would come to my elbow and touch my sleeve with the whisper please maam something good for grahama little marmalade or honey or jam  no mamma broke in dr john laughing yet reddening it surely was not so i could not have cared for these things  did he or did he not paulina  he liked them asserted paulina  never blush for it john said mr home encouragingly i like them myself yet and always did and polly showed her sense in catering for a friends material comforts it was i who put her into the way of such good mannersnor do i let her forget them polly offer me a small slice of that tongue  there papa but remember you are only waited upon with this assiduity on condition of being persuadable and reconciling yourself to la terrasse for the day  mrs bretton said the count i want to get rid of my daughterto send her to school do you know of any good school  there is lucys placemadame becks  miss snowe is in a school  i am a teacher i said and was rather glad of the opportunity of saying this for a little while i had been feeling as if placed in a false position mrs bretton and son knew my circumstances but the count and his daughter did not they might choose to vary by some shades their hitherto cordial manner towards me when aware of my grade in society i spoke then readily but a swarm of thoughts i had not anticipated nor invoked rose dim at the words making me sigh involuntarily mr home did not lift his eyes from his breakfastplate for about two minutes nor did he speak perhaps he had not caught the wordsperhaps he thought that on a confession of that nature politeness would interdict comment the scotch are proverbially proud and homely as was mr home in look simple in habits and tastes i have all along intimated that he was not without his share of the national quality was his a pseudo pride was it real dignity i leave the question undecided in its wide sense where it concerned me individually i can only answer then and always he showed himself a truehearted gentleman  by nature he was a feeler and a thinker over his emotions and his reflections spread a mellowing of melancholy more than a mellowing in trouble and bereavement it became a cloud he did not know much about lucy snowe what he knew he did not very accurately comprehend indeed his misconceptions of my character often made me smile but he saw my walk in life lay rather on the shady side of the hill he gave me credit for doing my endeavour to keep the course honestly straight he would have helped me if he could having no opportunity of helping he still wished me well when he did look at me his eye was kind when he did speak his voice was benevolent  yours said he is an arduous calling i wish you health and strength to win in itsuccess  his fair little daughter did not take the information quite so composedly she fixed on me a pair of eyes wide with wonderalmost with dismay  are you a teacher cried she then having paused on the unpalatable idea well i never knew what you were nor ever thought of asking for me you were always lucy snowe  and what am i now i could not forbear inquiring  yourself of course but do you really teach here in villette  i really do  and do you like it  not always  and why do you go on with it  her father looked at and i feared was going to check her but he only said proceed polly proceed with that catechismprove yourself the little wiseacre you are if miss snowe were to blush and look confused i should have to bid you hold your tongue and you and i would sit out the present meal in some disgrace but she only smiles so push her hard multiply the crossquestions well miss snowe why do you go on with it  chiefly i fear for the sake of the money i get  not then from motives of pure philanthropy polly and i were clinging to that hypothesis as the most lenient way of accounting for your eccentricity  nono sir rather for the roof of shelter i am thus enabled to keep over my head and for the comfort of mind it gives me to think that while i can work for myself i am spared the pain of being a burden to anybody  papa say what you will i pity lucy  take up that pity miss de bassompierre take it up in both hands as you might a little callow gosling squattering out of bounds without leave put it back in the warm nest of a heart whence it issued and receive in your ear this whisper if my polly ever came to know by experience the uncertain nature of this worlds goods i should like her to act as lucy acts to work for herself that she might burden neither kith nor kin  yes papa said she pensively and tractably but poor lucy i thought she was a rich lady and had rich friends  you thought like a little simpleton i never thought so when i had time to consider lucys manner and aspect which was not often i saw she was one who had to guard and not be guarded to act and not be served and this lot has i imagine helped her to an experience for which if she live long enough to realize its full benefit she may yet bless providence but this school he pursued changing his tone from grave to gay would madame beck admit my polly do you think miss lucy  i said there needed but to try madame it would soon be seen she was fond of english pupils if you sir i added will but take miss de bassompierre in your carriage this very afternoon i think i can answer for it that rosine the portress will not be very slow in answering your ring and madame i am sure will put on her best pair of gloves to come into the salon to receive you  in that case responded mr home i see no sort of necessity there is for delay mrs hurst can send what she calls her young ladys things after her polly can settle down to her hornbook before night and you miss lucy i trust will not disdain to cast an occasional eye upon her and let me know from time to time how she gets on i hope you approve of the arrangement countess de bassompierre  the countess hemmed and hesitated i thought said she i thought i had finished my education  that only proves how much we may be mistaken in our thoughts i hold a far different opinion as most of these will who have been auditors of your profound knowledge of life this morning ah my little girl thou hast much to learn and papa ought to have taught thee more than he has done come there is nothing for it but to try madame beck and the weather seems settling and i have finished my breakfast  but papa  well  i see an obstacle  i dont at all  it is enormous papa it can never be got over it is as large as you in your greatcoat and the snowdrift on the top  and like that snowdrift capable of melting  no it is of tootoo solid flesh it is just your own self miss lucy warn madame beck not to listen to any overtures about taking me because in the end it would turn out that she would have to take papa too as he is so teasing i will just tell tales about him mrs bretton and all of you listen about five years ago when i was twelve years old he took it into his head that he was spoiling me that i was growing unfitted for the world and i dont know what and nothing would serve or satisfy him but i must go to school i cried and so on but m de bassompierre proved hardhearted quite firm and flinty and to school i went what was the result in the most admirable manner papa came to school likewise every other day he called to see me madame aigredoux grumbled but it was of no use and so at last papa and i were both in a manner expelled lucy can just tell madame beck this little trait it is only fair to let her know what she has to expect  mrs bretton asked mr home what he had to say in answer to this statement as he made no defence judgment was given against him and paulina triumphed  but she had other moods besides the arch and naïve after breakfast when the two elders withdrewi suppose to talk over certain of mrs brettons business mattersand the countess dr bretton and i were for a short time alone togetherall the child left her with us more nearly her companions in age she rose at once to the little lady her very face seemed to alter that play of feature and candour of look which when she spoke to her father made it quite dimpled and round yielded to an aspect more thoughtful and lines distincter and less mobile  no doubt graham noted the change as well as i he stood for some minutes near the window looking out at the snow presently he approached the hearth and entered into conversation but not quite with his usual ease fit topics did not seem to rise to his lips he chose them fastidiously hesitatingly and consequently infelicitously he spoke vaguely of villetteits inhabitants its notable sights and buildings he was answered by miss de bassompierre in quite womanly sort with intelligence with a manner not indeed wholly disindividualized a tone a glance a gesture here and there rather animated and quick than measured and stately still recalled little polly but yet there was so fine and even a polish so calm and courteous a grace gilding and sustaining these peculiarities that a less sensitive man than graham would not have ventured to seize upon them as vantage points leading to franker intimacy  yet while dr bretton continued subdued and for him sedate he was still observant not one of those petty impulses and natural breaks escaped him he did not miss one characteristic movement one hesitation in language or one lisp in utterance at times in speaking fast she still lisped but coloured whenever such lapse occurred and in a painstaking conscientious manner quite as amusing as the slight error repeated the word more distinctly  whenever she did this dr bretton smiled gradually as they conversed the restraint on each side slackened might the conference have but been prolonged i believe it would soon have become genial already to paulinas lip and cheek returned the wreathing dimpling smile she lisped once and forgot to correct herself and dr john i know not how he changed but change he did he did not grow gayerno raillery no levity sparkled across his aspectbut his position seemed to become one of more pleasure to himself and he spoke his augmented comfort in readier language in tones more suave ten years ago this pair had always found abundance to say to each other the intervening decade had not narrowed the experience or impoverished the intelligence of either besides there are certain natures of which the mutual influence is such that the more they say the more they have to say for these out of association grows adhesion and out of adhesion amalgamation  graham however must go his was a profession whose claims are neither to be ignored nor deferred he left the room but before he could leave the house there was a return i am sure he came backnot for the paper or card in his desk which formed his ostensible errandbut to assure himself by one more glance that paulinas aspect was really such as memory was bearing away that he had not been viewing her somehow by a partial artificial light and making a fond mistake no he found the impression truerather indeed he gained than lost by this return he took away with him a parting lookshy but very softas beautiful as innocent as any little fawn could lift out of its cover of fern or any lamb from its meadowbed  being left alone paulina and i kept silence for some time we both took out some work and plied a mute and diligent task the whitewood workbox of old days was now replaced by one inlaid with precious mosaic and furnished with implements of gold the tiny and trembling fingers that could scarce guide the needle though tiny still were now swift and skilful but there was the same busy knitting of the brow the same little dainty mannerisms the same quick turns and movementsnow to replace a stray tress and anon to shake from the silken skirt some imaginary atom of dustsome clinging fibre of thread  that morning i was disposed for silence the austere fury of the winterday had on me an awing hushing influence that passion of january so white and so bloodless was not yet spent the storm had raved itself hoarse but seemed no nearer exhaustion had ginevra fanshawe been my companion in that drawingroom she would not have suffered me to muse and listen undisturbed the presence just gone from us would have been her theme and how she would have rung the changes on one topic how she would have pursued and pestered me with questions and surmisesworried and oppressed me with comments and confidences i did not want and longed to avoid  paulina mary cast once or twice towards me a quiet but penetrating glance of her dark full eye her lips half opened as if to the impulse of coming utterance but she saw and delicately respected my inclination for silence  this will not hold long i thought to myself for i was not accustomed to find in women or girls any power of selfcontrol or strength of selfdenial as far as i knew them the chance of a gossip about their usually trivial secrets their often very washy and paltry feelings was a treat not to be readily foregone  the little countess promised an exception she sewed till she was tired of sewing and then she took a book  as chance would have it she had sought it in dr brettons own compartment of the bookcase and it proved to be an old bretton booksome illustrated work of natural history often had i seen her standing at grahams side resting that volume on his knee and reading to his tuition and when the lesson was over begging as a treat that he would tell her all about the pictures i watched her keenly here was a true test of that memory she had boasted would her recollections now be faithful  faithful it could not be doubted as she turned the leaves over her face passed gleam after gleam of expression the least intelligent of which was a full greeting to the past and then she turned to the titlepage and looked at the name written in the schoolboy hand she looked at it long nor was she satisfied with merely looking she gently passed over the characters the tips of her fingers accompanying the action with an unconscious but tender smile which converted the touch into a caress paulina loved the past but the peculiarity of this little scene was that she said nothing she could feel without pouring out her feelings in a flux of words  she now occupied herself at the bookcase for nearly an hour taking down volume after volume and renewing her acquaintance with each this done she seated herself on a low stool rested her cheek on her hand and thought and still was mute  the sound of the front door opened below a rush of cold wind and her fathers voice speaking to mrs bretton in the hall startled her at last she sprang up she was downstairs in one second  papa papa you are not going out  my pet i must go into town  but it is tootoo cold papa  and then i heard m de bassompierre showing to her how he was well provided against the weather and how he was going to have the carriage and to be quite snugly sheltered and in short proving that she need not fear for his comfort  but you will promise to come back here this evening before it is quite darkyou and dr bretton both in the carriage it is not fit to ride  well if i see the doctor i will tell him a lady has laid on him her commands to take care of his precious health and come home early under my escort  yes you must say a lady and he will think it is his mother and be obedient and papa mind to come soon for i shall watch and listen  the door closed and the carriage rolled softly through the snow and back returned the countess pensive and anxious  she did listen and watch when evening closed but it was in stillest sort walking the drawingroom with quite noiseless step she checked at intervals her velvet march inclined her ear and consulted the night sounds i should rather say the night silence for now at last the wind was fallen the sky relieved of its avalanche lay naked and pale through the barren boughs of the avenue we could see it well and note also the polar splendour of the newyear moonan orb white as a world of ice nor was it late when we saw also the return of the carriage  paulina had no dance of welcome for this evening it was with a sort of gravity that she took immediate possession of her father as he entered the room but she at once made him her entire property led him to the seat of her choice and while softly showering round him honeyed words of commendation for being so good and coming home so soon you would have thought it was entirely by the power of her little hands he was put into his chair and settled and arranged for the strong man seemed to take pleasure in wholly yielding himself to this dominionpotent only by love  graham did not appear till some minutes after the count paulina half turned when his step was heard they spoke but only a word or two their fingers met a moment but obviously with slight contact paulina remained beside her father graham threw himself into a seat on the other side of the room  it was well that mrs bretton and mr home had a great deal to say to each otheralmost an inexhaustible fund of discourse in old recollections otherwise i think our party would have been but a still one that evening  after tea paulinas quick needle and pretty golden thimble were busily plied by the lamplight but her tongue rested and her eyes seemed reluctant to raise often their lids so smooth and so fullfringed graham too must have been tired with his days work he listened dutifully to his elders and betters said very little himself and followed with his eye the gilded glance of paulinas thimble as if it had been some bright moth on the wing or the golden head of some darting little yellow serpent     chapter xxvi  a burial   from this date my life did not want variety i went out a good deal with the entire consent of madame beck who perfectly approved the grade of my acquaintance that worthy directress had never from the first treated me otherwise than with respect and when she found that i was liable to frequent invitations from a château and a great hotel respect improved into distinction  not that she was fulsome about it madame in all things worldly was in nothing weak there was measure and sense in her hottest pursuit of selfinterest calm and considerateness in her closest clutch of gain without then laying herself open to my contempt as a timeserver and a toadie she marked with tact that she was pleased people connected with her establishment should frequent such associates as must cultivate and elevate rather than those who might deteriorate and depress she never praised either me or my friends only once when she was sitting in the sun in the garden a cup of coffee at her elbow and the gazette in her hand looking very comfortable and i came up and asked leave of absence for the evening she delivered herself in this gracious sort  oui oui ma bonne amie je vous donne la permission de coeur et de gré votre travail dans ma maison a toujours été admirable rempli de zèle et de discrétion vous avez bien le droit de vous amuser sortez donc tant que vous voudrez quant à votre choix de connaissances jen suis contente cest sage digne laudable  she closed her lips and resumed the gazette  the reader will not too gravely regard the little circumstance that about this time the triplyenclosed packet of five letters temporarily disappeared from my bureau blank dismay was naturally my first sensation on making the discovery but in a moment i took heart of grace  patience whispered i to myself let me say nothing but wait peaceably they will come back again  and they did come back they had only been on a short visit to madames chamber having passed their examination they came back duly and truly i found them all right the next day  i wonder what she thought of my correspondence what estimate did she form of dr john brettons epistolary powers in what light did the often very pithy thoughts the generally sound and sometimes original opinions set without pretension in an easilyflowing spirited style appear to her how did she like that genial half humorous vein which to me gave such delight what did she think of the few kind words scattered here and therenot thickly as the diamonds were scattered in the valley of sindbad but sparely as those gems lie in unfabled beds oh madame beck how seemed these things to you  i think in madame becks eyes the five letters found a certain favour one day after she had borrowed them of me in speaking of so suave a little woman one ought to use suave terms i caught her examining me with a steady contemplative gaze a little puzzled but not at all malevolent it was during that brief space between lessons when the pupils turned out into the court for a quarter of an hours recreation she and i remained in the first classe alone when i met her eye her thoughts forced themselves partially through her lips  il y a said she quelquechose de bien remarquable dans le caractère anglais  how madame  she gave a little laugh repeating the word how in english  je ne saurais vous dire how mais enfin les anglais ont des idées à eux en amitié en amour en tout mais au moins il nest pas besoin de les surveiller she added getting up and trotting away like the compact little pony she was  then i hope murmured i to myself you will graciously let alone my letters for the future  alas something came rushing into my eyes dimming utterly their vision blotting from sight the schoolroom the garden the bright winter sun as i remembered that never more would letters such as she had read come to me i had seen the last of them that goodly river on whose banks i had sojourned of whose waves a few reviving drops had trickled to my lips was bending to another course it was leaving my little hut and field forlorn and sanddry pouring its wealth of waters far away the change was right just natural not a word could be said but i loved my rhine my nile i had almost worshipped my ganges and i grieved that the grand tide should roll estranged should vanish like a false mirage though stoical i was not quite a stoic drops streamed fast on my hands on my desk i wept one sultry shower heavy and brief  but soon i said to myself the hope i am bemoaning suffered and made me suffer much it did not die till it was full time following an agony so lingering death ought to be welcome  welcome i endeavoured to make it indeed long pain had made patience a habit in the end i closed the eyes of my dead covered its face and composed its limbs with great calm  the letters however must be put away out of sight people who have undergone bereavement always jealously gather together and lock away mementos it is not supportable to be stabbed to the heart each moment by sharp revival of regret  one vacant holiday afternoon the thursday going to my treasure with intent to consider its final disposal i perceivedand this time with a strong impulse of displeasurethat it had been again tampered with the packet was there indeed but the ribbon which secured it had been untied and retied and by other symptoms i knew that my drawer had been visited  this was a little too much madame beck herself was the soul of discretion besides having as strong a brain and sound a judgment as ever furnished a human head that she should know the contents of my casket was not pleasant but might be borne little jesuit inquisitress as she was she could see things in a true light and understand them in an unperverted sense but the idea that she had ventured to communicate information thus gained to others that she had perhaps amused herself with a companion over documents in my eyes most sacred shocked me cruelly yet that such was the case i now saw reason to fear i even guessed her confidant her kinsman m paul emanuel had spent yesterday evening with her she was much in the habit of consulting him and of discussing with him matters she broached to no one else this very morning in class that gentleman had favoured me with a glance which he seemed to have borrowed from vashti the actress i had not at the moment comprehended that blue yet lurid flash out of his angry eye but i read its meaning now he i believed was not apt to regard what concerned me from a fair point of view nor to judge me with tolerance and candour i had always found him severe and suspicious the thought that these letters mere friendly letters as they were had fallen once and might fall again into his hands jarred my very soul  what should i do to prevent this in what corner of this strange house was it possible to find security or secresy where could a key be a safeguard or a padlock a barrier  in the grenier no i did not like the grenier besides most of the boxes and drawers there were mouldering and did not lock rats too gnawed their way through the decayed wood and mice made nests amongst the litter of their contents my dear letters most dear still though ichabod was written on their covers might be consumed by vermin certainly the writing would soon become obliterated by damp no the grenier would not dobut where then  while pondering this problem i sat in the dormitory windowseat it was a fine frosty afternoon the winter sun already setting gleamed pale on the tops of the gardenshrubs in the allée défendue one great old peartreethe nuns peartreestood up a tall dryad skeleton grey gaunt and stripped a thought struck meone of those queer fantastic thoughts that will sometimes strike solitary people i put on my bonnet cloak and furs and went out into the city  bending my steps to the old historical quarter of the town whose hoax and overshadowed precincts i always sought by instinct in melancholy moods i wandered on from street to street till having crossed a half deserted place or square i found myself before a sort of brokers shop an ancient place full of ancient things what i wanted was a metal box which might be soldered or a thick glass jar or bottle which might be stoppered or sealed hermetically amongst miscellaneous heaps i found and purchased the latter article  i then made a little roll of my letters wrapped them in oiled silk bound them with twine and having put them in the bottle got the old jew broker to stopper seal and make it airtight while obeying my directions he glanced at me now and then suspiciously from under his frostwhite eyelashes i believe he thought there was some evil deed on hand in all this i had a dreary somethingnot pleasurebut a sad lonely satisfaction the impulse under which i acted the mood controlling me were similar to the impulse and the mood which had induced me to visit the confessional with quick walking i regained the pensionnat just at dark and in time for dinner  at seven oclock the moon rose at halfpast seven when the pupils and teachers were at study and madame beck was with her mother and children in the salleàmanger when the halfboarders were all gone home and rosine had left the vestibule and all was stilli shawled myself and taking the sealed jar stole out through the firstclasse door into the berceau and thence into the allée défendue  methusaleh the peartree stood at the further end of this walk near my seat he rose up dim and gray above the lower shrubs round him now methusaleh though so very old was of sound timber still only there was a hole or rather a deep hollow near his root i knew there was such a hollow hidden partly by ivy and creepers growing thick round and there i meditated hiding my treasure but i was not only going to hide a treasurei meant also to bury a grief that grief over which i had lately been weeping as i wrapped it in its windingsheet must be interred  well i cleared away the ivy and found the hole it was large enough to receive the jar and i thrust it deep in in a toolshed at the bottom of the garden lay the relics of buildingmaterials left by masons lately employed to repair a part of the premises i fetched thence a slate and some mortar put the slate on the hollow secured it with cement covered the hole with black mould and finally replaced the ivy this done i rested leaning against the tree lingering like any other mourner beside a newlysodded grave  the air of the night was very still but dim with a peculiar mist which changed the moonlight into a luminous haze in this air or this mist there was some qualityelectrical perhapswhich acted in strange sort upon me i felt then as i had felt a year ago in englandon a night when the aurora borealis was streaming and sweeping round heaven when belated in lonely fields i had paused to watch that mustering of an army with bannersthat quivering of serried lancesthat swift ascent of messengers from below the north star to the dark high keystone of heavens arch i felt not happy far otherwise but strong with reinforced strength  if life be a war it seemed my destiny to conduct it singlehanded i pondered now how to break up my winterquartersto leave an encampment where food and forage failed perhaps to effect this change another pitched battle must be fought with fortune if so i had a mind to the encounter too poor to lose god might destine me to gain but what road was openwhat plan available  on this question i was still pausing when the moon so dim hitherto seemed to shine out somewhat brighter a ray gleamed even white before me and a shadow became distinct and marked i looked more narrowly to make out the cause of this welldefined contrast appearing a little suddenly in the obscure alley whiter and blacker it grew on my eye it took shape with instantaneous transformation i stood about three yards from a tall sablerobed snowyveiled woman  five minutes passed i neither fled nor shrieked she was there still i spoke  who are you and why do you come to me  she stood mute she had no faceno features all below her brow was masked with a white cloth but she had eyes and they viewed me  i felt if not brave yet a little desperate and desperation will often suffice to fill the post and do the work of courage i advanced one step i stretched out my hand for i meant to touch her she seemed to recede i drew nearer her recession still silent became swift a mass of shrubs fullleaved evergreens laurel and dense yew intervened between me and what i followed having passed that obstacle i looked and saw nothing i waited i saidif you have any errand to men come back and deliver it nothing spoke or reappeared  this time there was no dr john to whom to have recourse there was no one to whom i dared whisper the words i have again seen the nun                                       paulina mary sought my frequent presence in the rue crécy in the old bretton days though she had never professed herself fond of me my society had soon become to her a sort of unconscious necessary i used to notice that if i withdrew to my room she would speedily come trotting after me and opening the door and peeping in say with her little peremptory accentcome down why do you sit here by yourself you must come into the parlour  in the same spirit she urged me nowleave the rue fossette she said and come and live with us papa would give you far more than madame beck gives you  mr home himself offered me a handsome sumthrice my present salaryif i would accept the office of companion to his daughter i declined i think i should have declined had i been poorer than i was and with scantier fund of resource more stinted narrowness of future prospect i had not that vocation i could teach i could give lessons but to be either a private governess or a companion was unnatural to me rather than fill the former post in any great house i would deliberately have taken a housemaids place bought a strong pair of gloves swept bedrooms and staircases and cleaned stoves and locks in peace and independence rather than be a companion i would have made shirts and starved  i was no bright ladys shadownot miss de bassompierres overcast enough it was my nature often to be of a subdued habit i was but the dimness and depression must both be voluntarysuch as kept me docile at my desk in the midst of my now wellaccustomed pupils in madame becks fist classe or alone at my own bedside in her dormitory or in the alley and seat which were called mine in her garden my qualifications were not convertible nor adaptable they could not be made the foil of any gem the adjunct of any beauty the appendage of any greatness in christendom madame beck and i without assimilating understood each other well i was not her companion nor her childrens governess she left me free she tied me to nothingnot to herselfnot even to her interests once when she had for a fortnight been called from home by a near relations illness and on her return all anxious and full of care about her establishment lest something in her absence should have gone wrong finding that matters had proceeded much as usual and that there was no evidence of glaring neglectshe made each of the teachers a present in acknowledgment of steadiness to my bedside she came at twelve oclock at night and told me she had no present for me i must make fidelity advantageous to the st pierre said she if i attempt to make it advantageous to you there will arise misunderstanding between usperhaps separation one thing however i can do to please youleave you alone with your liberty cestce que je ferai she kept her word every slight shackle she had ever laid on me she from that time with quiet hand removed thus i had pleasure in voluntarily respecting her rules gratification in devoting double time in taking double pains with the pupils she committed to my charge  as to mary de bassompierre i visited her with pleasure though i would not live with her my visits soon taught me that it was unlikely even my occasional and voluntary society would long be indispensable to her m de bassompierre for his part seemed impervious to this conjecture blind to this possibility unconscious as any child to the signs the likelihoods the fitful beginnings of what when it drew to an end he might not approve  whether or not he would cordially approve i used to speculate difficult to say he was much taken up with scientific interests keen intent and somewhat oppugnant in what concerned his favourite pursuits but unsuspicious and trustful in the ordinary affairs of life from all i could gather he seemed to regard his daughterling as still but a child and probably had not yet admitted the notion that others might look on her in a different light he would speak of what should be done when polly was a woman when she should be grown up and polly standing beside his chair would sometimes smile and take his honoured head between her little hands and kiss his irongrey locks and at other times she would pout and toss her curls but she never said papa i am grown up  she had different moods for different people with her father she really was still a child or childlike affectionate merry and playful with me she was serious and as womanly as thought and feeling could make her with mrs bretton she was docile and reliant but not expansive with graham she was shy at present very shy at moments she tried to be cold on occasion she endeavoured to shun him his step made her start his entrance hushed her when he spoke her answers failed of fluency when he took leave she remained selfvexed and disconcerted even her father noticed this demeanour in her  my little polly he said once you live too retired a life if you grow to be a woman with these shy manners you will hardly be fitted for society you really make quite a stranger of dr bretton how is this dont you remember that as a little girl you used to be rather partial to him  rather papa echoed she with her slightly dry yet gentle and simple tone  and you dont like him now what has he done  nothing yes i like him a little but we are grown strange to each other  then rub it off polly rub the rust and the strangeness off talk away when he is here and have no fear of him  he does not talk much is he afraid of me do you think papa  oh to be sure what man would not be afraid of such a little silent lady  then tell him some day not to mind my being silent say that it is my way and that i have no unfriendly intention  your way you little chatterbox so far from being your way it is only your whim  well ill improve papa  and very pretty was the grace with which the next day she tried to keep her word i saw her make the effort to converse affably with dr john on general topics the attention called into her guests face a pleasurable glow he met her with caution and replied to her in his softest tones as if there was a kind of gossamer happiness hanging in the air which he feared to disturb by drawing too deep a breath certainly in her timid yet earnest advance to friendship it could not be denied that there was a most exquisite and fairy charm  when the doctor was gone she approached her fathers chair  did i keep my word papa did i behave better  my polly behaved like a queen i shall become quite proud of her if this improvement continues byandby we shall see her receiving my guests with quite a calm grand manner miss lucy and i will have to look about us and polish up all our best airs and graces lest we should be thrown into the shade still polly there is a little flutter a little tendency to stammer now and then and even to lisp as you lisped when you were six years old  no papa interrupted she indignantly that cant be true  i appeal to miss lucy did she not in answering dr brettons question as to whether she had ever seen the palace of the prince of bois letang say yeth she had been there theveral times  papa you are satirical you are méchant i can pronounce all the letters of the alphabet as clearly as you can but tell me this you are very particular in making me be civil to dr bretton do you like him yourself  to be sure for old acquaintance sake i like him then he is a very good son to his mother besides being a kindhearted fellow and clever in his profession yes the callant is well enough  callant ah scotchman papa is it the edinburgh or the aberdeen accent you have  both my pet both and doubtless the glaswegian into the bargain it is that which enables me to speak french so well a gude scots tongue always succeeds well at the french  the french scotch again incorrigible papa you too need schooling  well polly you must persuade miss snowe to undertake both you and me to make you steady and womanly and me refined and classical  the light in which m de bassompierre evidently regarded miss snowe used to occasion me much inward edification what contradictory attributes of character we sometimes find ascribed to us according to the eye with which we are viewed madame beck esteemed me learned and blue miss fanshawe caustic ironic and cynical mr home a model teacher the essence of the sedate and discreet somewhat conventional perhaps too strict limited and scrupulous but still the pink and pattern of governesscorrectness whilst another person professor paul emanuel to wit never lost an opportunity of intimating his opinion that mine was rather a fiery and rash natureadventurous indocile and audacious i smiled at them all if any one knew me it was little paulina mary  as i would not be paulinas nominal and paid companion genial and harmonious as i began to find her intercourse she persuaded me to join her in some study as a regular and settled means of sustaining communication she proposed the german language which like myself she found difficult of mastery we agreed to take our lessons in the rue crécy of the same mistress this arrangement threw us together for some hours of every week m de bassompierre seemed quite pleased it perfectly met his approbation that madame minerva gravity should associate a portion of her leisure with that of his fair and dear child  that other selfelected judge of mine the professor in the rue fossette discovering by some surreptitious spying means that i was no longer so stationary as hitherto but went out regularly at certain hours of certain days took it upon himself to place me under surveillance people said m emanuel had been brought up amongst jesuits i should more readily have accredited this report had his manoeuvres been better masked as it was i doubted it never was a more undisguised schemer a franker looser intriguer he would analyze his own machinations elaborately contrive plots and forthwith indulge in explanatory boasts of their skill i know not whether i was more amused or provoked by his stepping up to me one morning and whispering solemnly that he had his eye on me he at least would discharge the duty of a friend and not leave me entirely to my own devices my proceedings seemed at present very unsettled he did not know what to make of them he thought his cousin beck very much to blame in suffering this sort of fluttering inconsistency in a teacher attached to her house what had a person devoted to a serious calling that of education to do with counts and countesses hotels and châteaux to him i seemed altogether en lair on his faith he believed i went out six days in the seven  i said monsieur exaggerated i certainly had enjoyed the advantage of a little change lately but not before it had become necessary and the privilege was by no means exercised in excess  necessary how was it necessary i was well enough he supposed change necessary he would recommend me to look at the catholic religieuses and study their lives they asked no change  i am no judge of what expression crossed my face when he thus spoke but it was one which provoked him he accused me of being reckless worldly and epicurean ambitious of greatness and feverishly athirst for the pomps and vanities of life it seems i had no dévouement no récueillement in my character no spirit of grace faith sacrifice or selfabasement feeling the inutility of answering these charges i mutely continued the correction of a pile of english exercises  he could see in me nothing christian like many other protestants i revelled in the pride and selfwill of paganism  i slightly turned from him nestling still closer under the wing of silence  a vague sound grumbled between his teeth it could not surely be a juron he was too religious for that but i am certain i heard the word sacré grievous to relate the same word was repeated with the unequivocal addition of mille something when i passed him about two hours afterwards in the corridor prepared to go and take my german lesson in the rue crécy never was a better little man in some points than m paul never in others a more waspish little despot                                       our german mistress fräulein anna braun was a worthy hearty woman of about fortyfive she ought perhaps to have lived in the days of queen elizabeth as she habitually consumed for her first and second breakfasts beer and beef also her direct and downright deutsch nature seemed to suffer a sensation of cruel restraint from what she called our english reserve though we thought we were very cordial with her but we did not slap her on the shoulder and if we consented to kiss her cheek it was done quietly and without any explosive smack these omissions oppressed and depressed her considerably still on the whole we got on very well accustomed to instruct foreign girls who hardly ever will think and study for themselveswho have no idea of grappling with a difficulty and overcoming it by dint of reflection or applicationour progress which in truth was very leisurely seemed to astound her in her eyes we were a pair of glacial prodigies cold proud and preternatural  the young countess was a little proud a little fastidious and perhaps with her native delicacy and beauty she had a right to these feelings but i think it was a total mistake to ascribe them to me i never evaded the morning salute which paulina would slip when she could nor was a certain little manner of still disdain a weapon known in my armoury of defence whereas paulina always kept it clear fine and bright and any rough german sally called forth at once its steelly glisten  honest anna braun in some measure felt this difference and while she halffeared halfworshipped paulina as a sort of dainty nymphan undineshe took refuge with me as a being all mortal and of easier mood  a book we liked well to read and translate was schillers ballads paulina soon learned to read them beautifully the fräulein would listen to her with a broad smile of pleasure and say her voice sounded like music she translated them too with a facile flow of language and in a strain of kindred and poetic fervour her cheek would flush her lips tremblingly smile her beauteous eyes kindle or melt as she went on she learnt the best by heart and would often recite them when we were alone together one she liked well was des mädchens klage that is she liked well to repeat the words she found plaintive melody in the sound the sense she would criticise she murmured as we sat over the fire one evening    du heilige rufe dein kind zurück   ich habe genossen das irdische glück     ich habe gelebt und geliebet  lived and loved said she is that the summit of earthly happiness the end of lifeto love i dont think it is it may be the extreme of mortal misery it may be sheer waste of time and fruitless torture of feeling if schiller had said to be loved he might have come nearer the truth is not that another thing lucy to be loved  i suppose it may be but why consider the subject what is love to you what do you know about it  she crimsoned half in irritation half in shame  now lucy she said i wont take that from you it may be well for papa to look on me as a baby i rather prefer that he should thus view me but you know and shall learn to acknowledge that i am verging on my nineteenth year  no matter if it were your twentyninth we will anticipate no feelings by discussion and conversation we will not talk about love  indeed indeed said sheall in hurry and heatyou may think to check and hold me in as much as you please but i have talked about it and heard about it too and a great deal and lately and disagreeably and detrimentally and in a way you wouldnt approve  and the vexed triumphant pretty naughty being laughed i could not discern what she meant and i would not ask her i was nonplussed seeing however the utmost innocence in her countenancecombined with some transient perverseness and petulancei said at last  who talks to you disagreeably and detrimentally on such matters who that has near access to you would dare to do it  lucy replied she more softly it is a person who makes me miserable sometimes and i wish she would keep awayi dont want her  but who paulina can it be you puzzle me much  it isit is my cousin ginevra every time she has leave to visit mrs cholmondeley she calls here and whenever she finds me alone she begins to talk about her admirers love indeed you should hear all she has to say about love  oh i have heard it said i quite coolly and on the whole perhaps it is as well you should have heard it too it is not to be regretted it is all right yet surely ginevras mind cannot influence yours you can look over both her head and her heart  she does influence me very much she has the art of disturbing my happiness and unsettling my opinions she hurts me through the feelings and people dearest to me  what does she say paulina give me some idea there may be counteraction of the damage done  the people i have longest and most esteemed are degraded by her she does not spare mrs brettonshe does not spare graham  no i daresay and how does she mix up these with her sentiment and herlove she does mix them i suppose  lucy she is insolent and i believe false you know dr bretton we both know him he may be careless and proud but when was he ever mean or slavish day after day she shows him to me kneeling at her feet pursuing her like her shadow sherepulsing him with insult and he imploring her with infatuation lucy is it true is any of it true  it may be true that he once thought her handsome does she give him out as still her suitor  she says she might marry him any day he only waits her consent  it is these tales which have caused that reserve in your manner towards graham which your father noticed  they have certainly made me all doubtful about his character as ginevra speaks they do not carry with them the sound of unmixed truth i believe she exaggeratesperhaps inventsbut i want to know how far  suppose we bring miss fanshawe to some proof give her an opportunity of displaying the power she boasts  i could do that tomorrow papa has asked some gentlemen to dinner all savants graham who papa is beginning to discover is a savant tooskilled they say in more than one branch of scienceis among the number now i should be miserable to sit at table unsupported amidst such a party i could not talk to messieurs a and z the parisian academicians all my new credit for manner would be put in peril you and mrs bretton must come for my sake ginevra at a word will join you  yes then i will carry a message of invitation and she shall have the chance of justifying her character for veracity     chapter xxvii  the hÔtel crÉcy   the morrow turned out a more lively and busy day than weor than i at leasthad anticipated it seems it was the birthday of one of the young princes of labassecourthe eldest i think the duc de dindonneau and a general holiday was given in his honour at the schools and especially at the principal athénée or college the youth of that institution had also concocted and were to present a loyal address for which purpose they were to be assembled in the public building where the yearly examinations were conducted and the prizes distributed after the ceremony of presentation an oration or discours was to follow from one of the professors  several of m de bassompierres friendsthe savantsbeing more or less connected with the athénée they were expected to attend on this occasion together with the worshipful municipality of villette m le chevalier staas the burgomaster and the parents and kinsfolk of the athenians in general m de bassompierre was engaged by his friends to accompany them his fair daughter would of course be of the party and she wrote a little note to ginevra and myself bidding us come early that we might join her  as miss fanshawe and i were dressing in the dormitory of the rue fossette she miss f suddenly burst into a laugh  what now i asked for she had suspended the operation of arranging her attire and was gazing at me  it seems so odd she replied with her usual halfhonest halfinsolent unreserve that you and i should now be so much on a level visiting in the same sphere having the same connections  why yes said i i had not much respect for the connections you chiefly frequented awhile ago mrs cholmondeley and co would never have suited me at all  who are you miss snowe she inquired in a tone of such undisguised and unsophisticated curiosity as made me laugh in my turn  you used to call yourself a nursery governess when you first came here you really had the care of the children in this house i have seen you carry little georgette in your arms like a bonnefew governesses would have condescended so farand now madame beck treats you with more courtesy than she treats the parisienne st pierre and that proud chit my cousin makes you her bosom friend  wonderful i agreed much amused at her mystification who am i indeed perhaps a personage in disguise pity i dont look the character  i wonder you are not more flattered by all this she went on you take it with strange composure if you really are the nobody i once thought you you must be a cool hand  the nobody you once thought me i repeated and my face grew a little hot but i would not be angry of what importance was a schoolgirls crude use of the terms nobody and somebody i confined myself therefore to the remark that i had merely met with civility and asked what she saw in civility to throw the recipient into a fever of confusion  one cant help wondering at some things she persisted  wondering at marvels of your own manufacture are you ready at last  yes let me take your arm  i would rather not we will walk side by side  when she took my arm she always leaned upon me her whole weight and as i was not a gentleman or her lover i did not like it  there again she cried i thought by offering to take your arm to intimate approbation of your dress and general appearance i meant it as a compliment  you did you meant in short to express that you are not ashamed to be seen in the street with me that if mrs cholmondeley should be fondling her lapdog at some window or colonel de hamal picking his teeth in a balcony and should catch a glimpse of us you would not quite blush for your companion  yes said she with that directness which was her best pointwhich gave an honest plainness to her very fibs when she told themwhich was in short the salt the sole preservative ingredient of a character otherwise not formed to keep  i delegated the trouble of commenting on this yes to my countenance or rather my underlip voluntarily anticipated my tongue of course reverence and solemnity were not the feelings expressed in the look i gave her  scornful sneering creature she went on as we crossed a great square and entered the quiet pleasant park our nearest way to the rue crécy nobody in this world was ever such a turk to me as you are  you bring it on yourself let me alone have the sense to be quiet i will let you alone  as if one could let you alone when you are so peculiar and so mysterious  the mystery and peculiarity being entirely the conception of your own brainmaggotsneither more nor less be so good as to keep them out of my sight  but are you anybody persevered she pushing her hand in spite of me under my arm and that arm pressed itself with inhospitable closeness against my side by way of keeping out the intruder  yes i said i am a rising character once an old ladys companion then a nurserygoverness now a schoolteacher  dodo tell me who you are ill not repeat it she urged adhering with ludicrous tenacity to the wise notion of an incognito she had got hold of and she squeezed the arm of which she had now obtained full possession and coaxed and conjured till i was obliged to pause in the park to laugh throughout our walk she rang the most fanciful changes on this theme proving by her obstinate credulity or incredulity her incapacity to conceive how any person not bolstered up by birth or wealth not supported by some consciousness of name or connection could maintain an attitude of reasonable integrity as for me it quite sufficed to my mental tranquillity that i was known where it imported that known i should be the rest sat on me easily pedigree social position and recondite intellectual acquisition occupied about the same space and place in my interests and thoughts they were my thirdclass lodgersto whom could be assigned only the small sittingroom and the little back bedroom even if the dining and drawingrooms stood empty i never confessed it to them as thinking minor accommodations better suited to their circumstances the world i soon learned held a different estimate and i make no doubt the world is very right in its view yet believe also that i am not quite wrong in mine  there are people whom a lowered position degrades morally to whom loss of connection costs loss of selfrespect are not these justified in placing the highest value on that station and association which is their safeguard from debasement if a man feels that he would become contemptible in his own eyes were it generally known that his ancestry were simple and not gentle poor and not rich workers and not capitalists would it be right severely to blame him for keeping these fatal facts out of sightfor starting trembling quailing at the chance which threatens exposure the longer we live the more out experience widens the less prone are we to judge our neighbours conduct to question the worlds wisdom wherever an accumulation of small defences is found whether surrounding the prudes virtue or the man of the worlds respectability there be sure it is needed  we reached the hôtel crécy paulina was ready mrs bretton was with her and under her escort and that of m de bassompierre we were soon conducted to the place of assembly and seated in good seats at a convenient distance from the tribune the youth of the athénée were marshalled before us the municipality and their bourgmestre were in places of honour the young princes with their tutors occupied a conspicuous position and the body of the building was crowded with the aristocracy and first burghers of the town  concerning the identity of the professor by whom the discours was to be delivered i had as yet entertained neither care nor question some vague expectation i had that a savant would stand up and deliver a formal speech half dogmatism to the athenians half flattery to the princes  the tribune was yet empty when we entered but in ten minutes after it was filled suddenly in a second of time a head chest and arms grew above the crimson desk this head i knew its colour shape port expression were familiar both to me and miss fanshawe the blackness and closeness of cranium the amplitude and paleness of brow the blueness and fire of glance were details so domesticated in the memory and so knit with many a whimsical association as almost by this their sudden apparition to tickle fancy to a laugh indeed i confess for my part i did laugh till i was warm but then i bent my head and made my handkerchief and a lowered veil the sole confidants of my mirth  i think i was glad to see m paul i think it was rather pleasant than otherwise to behold him set up there fierce and frank dark and candid testy and fearless as when regnant on his estrade in class his presence was such a surprise i had not once thought of expecting him though i knew he filled the chair of belles lettres in the college with him in that tribune i felt sure that neither formalism nor flattery would be our doom but for what was vouchsafed us for what was poured suddenly rapidly continuously on our headsi own i was not prepared  he spoke to the princes the nobles the magistrates and the burghers with just the same ease with almost the same pointed choleric earnestness with which he was wont to harangue the three divisions of the rue fossette the collegians he addressed not as schoolboys but as future citizens and embryo patriots the times which have since come on europe had not been foretold yet and m emanuels spirit seemed new to me who would have thought the flat and fat soil of labassecour could yield political convictions and national feelings such as were now strongly expressed of the bearing of his opinions i need here give no special indication yet it may be permitted me to say that i believed the little man not more earnest than right in what he said with all his fire he was severe and sensible he trampled utopian theories under his heel he rejected wild dreams with scornbut when he looked in the face of tyrannyoh then there opened a light in his eye worth seeing and when he spoke of injustice his voice gave no uncertain sound but reminded me rather of the bandtrumpet ringing at twilight from the park  i do not think his audience were generally susceptible of sharing his flame in its purity but some of the college youth caught fire as he eloquently told them what should be their path and endeavour in their countrys and in europes future they gave him a long loud ringing cheer as he concluded with all his fierceness he was their favourite professor  as our party left the hall he stood at the entrance he saw and knew me and lifted his hat he offered his hand in passing and uttered the words quen dites vousquestion eminently characteristic and reminding me even in this his moment of triumph of that inquisitive restlessness that absence of what i considered desirable selfcontrol which were amongst his faults he should not have cared just then to ask what i thought or what anybody thought but he did care and he was too natural to conceal too impulsive to repress his wish well if i blamed his overeagerness i liked his naiveté i would have praised him i had plenty of praise in my heart but alas no words on my lips who has words at the right moment i stammered some lame expressions but was truly glad when other people coming up with profuse congratulations covered my deficiency by their redundancy  a gentleman introduced him to m de bassompierre and the count who had likewise been highly gratified asked him to join his friends for the most part m emanuels likewise and to dine with them at the hôtel crécy he declined dinner for he was a man always somewhat shy at meeting the advances of the wealthy there was a strength of sturdy independence in the stringing of his sinewsnot obtrusive but pleasant enough to discover as one advanced in knowledge of his character he promised however to step in with his friend m a a french academician in the course of the evening  at dinner that day ginevra and paulina each looked in her own way very beautiful the former perhaps boasted the advantage in material charms but the latter shone preeminent for attractions more subtle and spiritual for light and eloquence of eye for grace of mien for winning variety of expression ginevras dress of deep crimson relieved well her light curls and harmonized with her roselike bloom paulinas attirein fashion close though faultlessly neat but in texture clear and whitemade the eye grateful for the delicate life of her complexion for the soft animation of her countenance for the tender depth of her eyes for the brown shadow and bounteous flow of her hairdarker than that of her saxon cousin as were also her eyebrows her eyelashes her full irids and large mobile pupils nature having traced all these details slightly and with a careless hand in miss fanshawes case and in miss de bassompierres wrought them to a high and delicate finish  paulina was awed by the savants but not quite to mutism she conversed modestly diffidently not without effort but with so true a sweetness so fine and penetrating a sense that her father more than once suspended his own discourse to listen and fixed on her an eye of proud delight it was a polite frenchman m z a very learned but quite a courtly man who had drawn her into discourse i was charmed with her french it was faultlessthe structure correct the idioms true the accent pure ginevra who had lived half her life on the continent could do nothing like it not that words ever failed miss fanshawe but real accuracy and purity she neither possessed nor in any number of years would acquire here too m de bassompierre was gratified for on the point of language he was critical  another listener and observer there was one who detained by some exigency of his profession had come in late to dinner both ladies were quietly scanned by dr bretton at the moment of taking his seat at the table and that guarded survey was more than once renewed his arrival roused miss fanshawe who had hitherto appeared listless she now became smiling and complacent talkedthough what she said was rarely to the purposeor rather was of a purpose somewhat mortifyingly below the standard of the occasion her light disconnected prattle might have gratified graham once perhaps it pleased him still perhaps it was only fancy which suggested the thought that while his eye was filled and his ear fed his taste his keen zest his lively intelligence were not equally consulted and regaled it is certain that restless and exacting as seemed the demand on his attention he yielded courteously all that was required his manner showed neither pique nor coolness ginevra was his neighbour and to her during dinner he almost exclusively confined his notice she appeared satisfied and passed to the drawingroom in very good spirits  yet no sooner had we reached that place of refuge than she again became flat and listless throwing herself on a couch she denounced both the discours and the dinner as stupid affairs and inquired of her cousin how she could hear such a set of prosaic grosbonnets as her father gathered about him the moment the gentlemen were heard to move her railings ceased she started up flew to the piano and dashed at it with spirit dr bretton entering one of the first took up his station beside her i thought he would not long maintain that post there was a position near the hearth to which i expected to see him attracted this position he only scanned with his eye while he looked others drew in the grace and mind of paulina charmed these thoughtful frenchmen the fineness of her beauty the soft courtesy of her manner her immature but real and inbred tact pleased their national taste they clustered about her not indeed to talk science which would have rendered her dumb but to touch on many subjects in letters in arts in actual life on which it soon appeared that she had both read and reflected i listened i am sure that though graham stood aloof he listened too his hearing as well as his vision was very fine quick discriminating i knew he gathered the conversation i felt that the mode in which it was sustained suited him exquisitelypleased him almost to pain  in paulina there was more force both of feeling and character than most people thoughtthan graham himself imaginedthan she would ever show to those who did not wish to see it to speak truth reader there is no excellent beauty no accomplished grace no reliable refinement without strength as excellent as complete as trustworthy as well might you look for good fruit and blossom on a rootless and sapless tree as for charms that will endure in a feeble and relaxed nature for a little while the blooming semblance of beauty may flourish round weakness but it cannot bear a blast it soon fades even in serenest sunshine graham would have started had any suggestive spirit whispered of the sinew and the stamina sustaining that delicate nature but i who had known her as a child knew or guessed by what a good and strong root her graces held to the firm soil of reality  while dr bretton listened and waited an opening in the magic circle his glance restlessly sweeping the room at intervals lighted by chance on me where i sat in a quiet nook not far from my godmother and m de bassompierre who as usual were engaged in what mr home called a twohanded crack what the count would have interpreted as a têteàtête graham smiled recognition crossed the room asked me how i was told me i looked pale i also had my own smile at my own thought it was now about three months since dr john had spoken to mea lapse of which he was not even conscious he sat down and became silent his wish was rather to look than converse ginevra and paulina were now opposite to him he could gaze his fill he surveyed both formsstudied both faces  several new guests ladies as well as gentlemen had entered the room since dinner dropping in for the evening conversation and amongst the gentlemen i may incidentally observe i had already noticed by glimpses a severe dark professorial outline hovering aloof in an inner saloon seen only in vista m emanuel knew many of the gentlemen present but i think was a stranger to most of the ladies excepting myself in looking towards the hearth he could not but see me and naturally made a movement to approach seeing however dr bretton also he changed his mind and held back if that had been all there would have been no cause for quarrel but not satisfied with holding back he puckered up his eyebrows protruded his lip and looked so ugly that i averted my eyes from the displeasing spectacle m joseph emanuel had arrived as well as his austere brother and at this very moment was relieving ginevra at the piano what a mastertouch succeeded her schoolgirl jingle in what grand grateful tones the instrument acknowledged the hand of the true artist  lucy began dr bretton breaking silence and smiling as ginevra glided before him casting a glance as she passed by miss fanshawe is certainly a fine girl  of course i assented  is there he pursued another in the room as lovely  i think there is not another as handsome  i agree with you lucy you and i do often agree in opinion in taste i think or at least in judgment  do we i said somewhat doubtfully  i believe if you had been a boy lucy instead of a girlmy mothers godson instead of her goddaughter we should have been good friends our opinions would have melted into each other  he had assumed a bantering air a light halfcaressing halfironic shone aslant in his eye ah graham i have given more than one solitary moment to thoughts and calculations of your estimate of lucy snowe was it always kind or just had lucy been intrinsically the same but possessing the additional advantages of wealth and station would your manner to her your value for her have been quite what they actually were and yet by these questions i would not seriously infer blame no you might sadden and trouble me sometimes but then mine was a soondepressed an easilyderanged temperamentit fell if a cloud crossed the sun perhaps before the eye of severe equity i should stand more at fault than you  trying then to keep down the unreasonable pain which thrilled my heart on thus being made to feel that while graham could devote to others the most grave and earnest the manliest interest he had no more than light raillery for lucy the friend of lang syne i inquired calmlyon what points are we so closely in accordance  we each have an observant faculty you perhaps dont give me credit for the possession yet i have it  but you were speaking of tastes we may see the same objects yet estimate them differently  let us bring it to the test of course you cannot but render homage to the merits of miss fanshawe now what do you think of others in the roommy mother for instance or the lions yonder messieurs a and z or let us say that pale little lady miss de bassompierre  you know what i think of your mother i have not thought of messieurs a and z  and the other  i think she is as you say a pale little ladypale certainly just now when she is fatigued with overexcitement  you dont remember her as a child  i wonder sometimes whether you do  i had forgotten her but it is noticeable that circumstances persons even words and looks that had slipped your memory may under certain conditions certain aspects of your own or anothers mind revive  that is possible enough  yet he continued the revival is imperfectneeds confirmation partakes so much of the dim character of a dream or of the airy one of a fancy that the testimony of a witness becomes necessary for corroboration were you not a guest at bretton ten years ago when mr home brought his little girl whom we then called little polly to stay with mamma  i was there the night she came and also the morning she went away  rather a peculiar child was she not i wonder how i treated her was i fond of children in those days was there anything gracious or kindly about megreat reckless schoolboy as i was but you dont recollect me of course  you have seen your own picture at la terrasse it is like you personally in manner you were almost the same yesterday as today  but lucy how is that such an oracle really whets my curiosity what am i today what was i the yesterday of ten years back  gracious to whatever pleased youunkindly or cruel to nothing  there you are wrong i think i was almost a brute to you for instance  a brute no graham i should never have patiently endured brutality  this however i do remember quiet lucy snowe tasted nothing of my grace  as little of your cruelty  why had i been nero himself i could not have tormented a being inoffensive as a shadow  i smiled but i also hushed a groan ohi just wished he would let me alonecease allusion to me these epithetsthese attributes i put from me his quiet lucy snowe his inoffensive shadow i gave him back not with scorn but with extreme weariness theirs was the coldness and the pressure of lead let him whelm me with no such weight happily he was soon on another theme  on what terms were little polly and i unless my recollections deceive me we were not foes  you speak very vaguely do you think little pollys memory not more definite  oh we dont talk of little polly now pray say miss de bassompierre and of course such a stately personage remembers nothing of bretton look at her large eyes lucy can they read a word in the page of memory are they the same which i used to direct to a hornbook she does not know that i partly taught her to read  in the bible on sunday nights  she has a calm delicate rather fine profile now once what a little restless anxious countenance was hers what a thing is a childs preferencewhat a bubble would you believe it that lady was fond of me  i think she was in some measure fond of you said i moderately  you dont remember then i had forgotten but i remember now she liked me the best of whatever there was at bretton  you thought so  i quite well recall it i wish i could tell her all i recall or rather i wish some one you for instance would go behind and whisper it all in her ear and i could have the delighthere as i sitof watching her look under the intelligence could you manage that think you lucy and make me ever grateful  could i manage to make you ever grateful said i no i could not and i felt my fingers work and my hands interlock i felt too an inward courage warm and resistant in this matter i was not disposed to gratify dr john not at all with now welcome force i realized his entire misapprehension of my character and nature he wanted always to give me a role not mine nature and i opposed him he did not at all guess what i felt he did not read my eyes or face or gestures though i doubt not all spoke leaning towards me coaxingly he said softly do content me lucy  and i would have contented or at least i would clearly have enlightened him and taught him well never again to expect of me the part of officious soubrette in a love drama when following his soft eager murmur meeting almost his pleading mellowdo content me lucy a sharp hiss pierced my ear on the other side  petite chatte doucerette coquette sibillated the sudden boaconstrictor vous avez lair bien triste soumis rêveur mais vous ne lêtes pas cest moi qui vous le dis sauvage la flamme à lâme léclair aux yeux  oui jai la flamme à lâme et je dois lavoir retorted i turning in just wrath but professor emanuel had hissed his insult and was gone  the worst of the matter was that dr bretton whose ears as i have said were quick and fine caught every word of this apostrophe he put his handkerchief to his face and laughed till he shook  well done lucy cried he capital petite chatte petite coquette oh i must tell my mother is it true lucy or halftrue i believe it is you redden to the colour of miss fanshawes gown and really by my word now i examine him that is the same little man who was so savage with you at the concert the very same and in his soul he is frantic at this moment because he sees me laughing oh i must tease him  and graham yielding to his bent for mischief laughed jested and whispered on till i could bear no more and my eyes filled  suddenly he was sobered a vacant space appeared near miss de bassompierre the circle surrounding her seemed about to dissolve this movement was instantly caught by grahams eyeevervigilant even while laughing he rose took his courage in both hands crossed the room and made the advantage his own dr john throughout his whole life was a man of lucka man of success and why because he had the eye to see his opportunity the heart to prompt to welltimed action the nerve to consummate a perfect work and no tyrantpassion dragged him back no enthusiasms no foibles encumbered his way how well he looked at this very moment when paulina looked up as he reached her side her glance mingled at once with an encountering glance animated yet modest his colour as he spoke to her became half a blush half a glow he stood in her presence brave and bashful subdued and unobtrusive yet decided in his purpose and devoted in his ardour i gathered all this by one view i did not prolong my observationtime failed me had inclination served the night wore late ginevra and i ought already to have been in the rue fossette i rose and bade goodnight to my godmother and m de bassompierre  i know not whether professor emanuel had noticed my reluctant acceptance of dr brettons badinage or whether he perceived that i was pained and that on the whole the evening had not been one flow of exultant enjoyment for the volatile pleasureloving mademoiselle lucie but as i was leaving the room he stepped up and inquired whether i had any one to attend me to the rue fossette the professor now spoke politely and even deferentially and he looked apologetic and repentant but i could not recognise his civility at a word nor meet his contrition with crude premature oblivion never hitherto had i felt seriously disposed to resent his brusqueries or freeze before his fierceness what he had said tonight however i considered unwarranted my extreme disapprobation of the proceeding must be marked however slightly i merely saidi am provided with attendance  which was true as ginevra and i were to be sent home in the carriage and i passed him with the sliding obeisance with which he was wont to be saluted in classe by pupils crossing his estrade  having sought my shawl i returned to the vestibule m emanuel stood there as if waiting he observed that the night was fine  is it i said with a tone and manner whose consummate chariness and frostiness i could not but applaud it was so seldom i could properly act out my own resolution to be reserved and cool where i had been grieved or hurt that i felt almost proud of this one successful effort that is it sounded just like the manner of other people i had heard hundreds of such little minced docked dry phrases from the pursedup coral lips of a score of selfpossessed selfsufficing misses and mesdemoiselles that m paul would not stand any prolonged experience of this sort of dialogue i knew but he certainly merited a sample of the curt and arid i believe he thought so himself for he took the dose quietly he looked at my shawl and objected to its lightness i decidedly told him it was as heavy as i wished receding aloof and standing apart i leaned on the banister of the stairs folded my shawl about me and fixed my eyes on a dreary religious painting darkening the wall  ginevra was long in coming tedious seemed her loitering m paul was still there my ear expected from his lips an angry tone he came nearer now for another hiss thought i had not the action been too uncivil i could have stopped my ears with my fingers in terror of the thrill nothing happens as we expect listen for a coo or a murmur it is then you will hear a cry of prey or pain await a piercing shriek an angry threat and welcome an amicable greeting a low kind whisper m paul spoke gentlyfriends said he do not quarrel for a word tell me was it i or ce grand fat danglais so he profanely denominated dr bretton who made your eyes so humid and your cheeks so hot as they are even now  i am not conscious of you monsieur or of any other having excited such emotion as you indicate was my answer and in giving it i again surpassed my usual self and achieved a neat frosty falsehood  but what did i say he pursued tell me i was angry i have forgotten my words what were they  such as it is best to forget said i still quite calm and chill  then it was my words which wounded you consider them unsaid permit my retractation accord my pardon  i am not angry monsieur  then you are worse than angrygrieved forgive me miss lucy  m emanuel i do forgive you  let me hear you say in the voice natural to you and not in that alien tone mon ami je vous pardonne  he made me smile who could help smiling at his wistfulness his simplicity his earnestness  bon he cried voilà que le jour va poindre dites donc mon ami  monsieur paul je vous pardonne  i will have no monsieur speak the other word or i shall not believe you sincere another effortmon ami or else in englishmy friend  now my friend had rather another sound and significancy than mon ami it did not breathe the same sense of domestic and intimate affection mon ami i could not say to m paul my friend i could and did say without difficulty this distinction existed not for him however and he was quite satisfied with the english phrase he smiled you should have seen him smile reader and you should have marked the difference between his countenance now and that he wore half an hour ago i cannot affirm that i had ever witnessed the smile of pleasure or content or kindness round m pauls lips or in his eyes before the ironic the sarcastic the disdainful the passionately exultant i had hundreds of times seen him express by what he called a smile but any illuminated sign of milder or warmer feelings struck me as wholly new in his visage it changed it as from a mask to a face the deep lines left his features the very complexion seemed clearer and fresher that swart sallow southern darkness which spoke his spanish blood became displaced by a lighter hue i know not that i have ever seen in any other human face an equal metamorphosis from a similar cause he now took me to the carriage at the same moment m de bassompierre came out with his niece  in a pretty humour was mistress fanshawe she had found the evening a grand failure completely upset as to temper she gave way to the most uncontrolled moroseness as soon as we were seated and the carriagedoor closed her invectives against dr bretton had something venomous in them having found herself impotent either to charm or sting him hatred was her only resource and this hatred she expressed in terms so unmeasured and proportion so monstrous that after listening for a while with assumed stoicism my outraged sense of justice at last and suddenly caught fire an explosion ensued for i could be passionate too especially with my present fair but faulty associate who never failed to stir the worst dregs of me it was well that the carriagewheels made a tremendous rattle over the flinty choseville pavement for i can assure the reader there was neither dead silence nor calm discussion within the vehicle half in earnest half in seeming i made it my business to storm down ginevra she had set out rampant from the rue crécy it was necessary to tame her before we reached the rue fossette to this end it was indispensable to show up her sterling value and high deserts and this must be done in language of which the fidelity and homeliness might challenge comparison with the compliments of a john knox to a mary stuart this was the right discipline for ginevra it suited her i am quite sure she went to bed that night all the better and more settled in mind and mood and slept all the more sweetly for having undergone a sound moral drubbing     chapter xxviii  the watchguard   m paul emanuel owned an acute sensitiveness to the annoyance of interruption from whatsoever cause occurring during his lessons to pass through the classe under such circumstances was considered by the teachers and pupils of the school individually and collectively to be as much as a womans or girls life was worth  madame beck herself if forced to the enterprise would skurry through retrenching her skirts and carefully coasting the formidable estrade like a ship dreading breakers as to rosine the portresson whom every halfhour devolved the fearful duty of fetching pupils out of the very heart of one or other of the divisions to take their musiclessons in the oratory the great or little saloon the salleàmanger or some other pianostationshe would upon her second or third attempt frequently become almost tonguetied from excess of consternationa sentiment inspired by the unspeakable looks levelled at her through a pair of dartdealing spectacles  one morning i was sitting in the carré at work upon a piece of embroidery which one of the pupils had commenced but delayed to finish and while my fingers wrought at the frame my ears regaled themselves with listening to the crescendos and cadences of a voice haranguing in the neighbouring classe in tones that waxed momentarily more unquiet more ominously varied there was a good strong partitionwall between me and the gathering storm as well as a facile means of flight through the glassdoor to the court in case it swept this way so i am afraid i derived more amusement than alarm from these thickening symptoms poor rosine was not safe four times that blessed morning had she made the passage of peril and now for the fifth time it became her dangerous duty to snatch as it were a brand from the burninga pupil from under m pauls nose  mon dieu mon dieu cried she que vaisje devenir monsieur va me tuer je suis sûre car il est dune colère  nerved by the courage of desperation she opened the door  mademoiselle la malle au piano was her cry  ere she could make good her retreat or quite close the door this voice uttered itself  dès ce momentla classe est défendue la première qui ouvrira cette porte ou passera par cette division sera penduefutce madame beck ellemême  ten minutes had not succeeded the promulgation of this decree when rosines french pantoufles were again heard shuffling along the corridor  mademoiselle said she i would not for a fivefranc piece go into that classe again just now monsieurs lunettes are really terrible and here is a commissionaire come with a message from the athénée i have told madame beck i dare not deliver it and she says i am to charge you with it  me no that is rather too bad it is not in my line of duty come come rosine bear your own burden be bravecharge once more  i mademoiselleimpossible five times i have crossed him this day madame must really hire a gendarme for this service ouf je nen puis plus  bah you are only a coward what is the message  precisely of the kind with which monsieur least likes to be pestered an urgent summons to go directly to the athénée as there is an official visitorinspectori know not whatarrived and monsieur must meet him you know how he hates a must  yes i knew well enough the restive little man detested spur or curb against whatever was urgent or obligatory he was sure to revolt however i accepted the responsibilitynot certainly without fear but fear blent with other sentiments curiosity amongst them i opened the door i entered i closed it behind me as quickly and quietly as a rather unsteady hand would permit for to be slow or bustling to rattle a latch or leave a door gaping wide were aggravations of crime often more disastrous in result than the main crime itself there i stood then and there he sat his humour was visibly badalmost at its worst he had been giving a lesson in arithmeticfor he gave lessons on any and every subject that struck his fancyand arithmetic being a dry subject invariably disagreed with him not a pupil but trembled when he spoke of figures he sat bent above his desk to look up at the sound of an entrance at the occurrence of a direct breach of his will and law was an effort he could not for the moment bring himself to make it was quite as well i thus gained time to walk up the long classe and it suited my idiosyncracy far better to encounter the near burst of anger like his than to bear its menace at a distance  at his estrade i paused just in front of course i was not worthy of immediate attention he proceeded with his lesson disdain would not do he must hear and he must answer my message  not being quite tall enough to lift my head over his desk elevated upon the estrade and thus suffering eclipse in my present position i ventured to peep round with the design at first of merely getting a better view of his face which had struck me when i entered as bearing a close and picturesque resemblance to that of a black and sallow tiger twice did i enjoy this sideview with impunity advancing and receding unseen the third time my eye had scarce dawned beyond the obscuration of the desk when it was caught and transfixed through its very pupiltransfixed by the lunettes rosine was right these utensils had in them a blank and immutable terror beyond the mobile wrath of the wearers own unglazed eyes  i now found the advantage of proximity these shortsighted lunettes were useless for the inspection of a criminal under monsieurs nose accordingly he doffed them and he and i stood on more equal terms  i am glad i was not really much afraid of himthat indeed close in his presence i felt no terror at all for upon his demanding cord and gibbet to execute the sentence recently pronounced i was able to furnish him with a needleful of embroidering thread with such accommodating civility as could not but allay some portion at least of his surplus irritation of course i did not parade this courtesy before public view i merely handed the thread round the angle of the desk and attached it ready noosed to the barred back of the professors chair  que me voulezvous said he in a growl of which the music was wholly confined to his chest and throat for he kept his teeth clenched and seemed registering to himself an inward vow that nothing earthly should wring from him a smile  my answer commenced uncompromisingly monsieur i said je veux limpossible des choses inouïes and thinking it best not to mince matters but to administer the douche with decision in a low but quick voice i delivered the athenian message floridly exaggerating its urgency  of course he would not hear a word of it he would not go he would not leave his present class let all the officials of villette send for him he would not put himself an inch out of his way at the bidding of king cabinet and chambers together  i knew however that he must go that talk as he would both his duty and interest commanded an immediate and literal compliance with the summons i stood therefore waiting in silence as if he had not yet spoken he asked what more i wanted  only monsieurs answer to deliver to the commissionaire  he waved an impatient negative  i ventured to stretch my hand to the bonnetgrec which lay in grim repose on the windowsill he followed this daring movement with his eye no doubt in mixed pity and amazement at its presumption  ah he muttered if it came to thatif miss lucy meddled with his bonnetgrecshe might just put it on herself turn garçon for the occasion and benevolently go to the athénée in his stead  with great respect i laid the bonnet on the desk where its tassel seemed to give me an awful nod  ill write a note of apologythat will do said he still bent on evasion  knowing well it would not do i gently pushed the bonnet towards his hand thus impelled it slid down the polished slope of the varnished and unbaized desk carried before it the light steelframed lunettes and fearful to relate they fell to the estrade a score of times ere now had i seen them fall and receive no damagethis time as lucy snowes hapless luck would have it they so fell that each clear pebble became a shivered and shapeless star  now indeed dismay seized medismay and regret i knew the value of these lunettes m pauls sight was peculiar not easily fitted and these glasses suited him i had heard him call them his treasures as i picked them up cracked and worthless my hand trembled frightened through all my nerves i was to see the mischief i had done but i think i was even more sorry than afraid for some seconds i dared not look the bereaved professor in the face he was the first to speak  là said he me voilà veuf de mes lunettes i think mademoiselle lucy will now confess that the cord and gallows are amply earned she trembles in anticipation of her doom ah traitress traitress you are resolved to have me quite blind and helpless in your hands  i lifted my eyes his face instead of being irate lowering and furrowed was overflowing with the smile coloured with the bloom i had seen brightening it that evening at the hotel crécy he was not angrynot even grieved for the real injury he showed himself full of clemency under the real provocation patient as a saint this event which seemed so untowardwhich i thought had ruined at once my chance of successful persuasionproved my best help difficult of management so long as i had done him no harm he became graciously pliant as soon as i stood in his presence a conscious and contrite offender  still gently railing at me as une forte femmeune anglaise terribleune petite cassetouthe declared that he dared not but obey one who had given such an instance of her dangerous prowess it was absolutely like the grand empereur smashing the vase to inspire dismay so at last crowning himself with his bonnetgrec and taking his ruined lunettes from my hand with a clasp of kind pardon and encouragement he made his bow and went off to the athénée in firstrate humour and spirits                                       after all this amiability the reader will be sorry for my sake to hear that i was quarrelling with m paul again before night yet so it was and i could not help it  it was his occasional customand a very laudable acceptable custom tooto arrive of an evening always à limproviste unannounced burst in on the silent hour of study establish a sudden despotism over us and our occupations cause books to be put away workbags to be brought out and drawing forth a single thick volume or a handful of pamphlets substitute for the besotted lecture pieuse drawled by a sleepy pupil some tragedy made grand by grand reading ardent by fiery actionsome drama whereof for my part i rarely studied the intrinsic merit for m emanuel made it a vessel for an outpouring and filled it with his native verve and passion like a cup with a vital brewage or else he would flash through our conventual darkness a reflex of a brighter world show us a glimpse of the current literature of the day read us passages from some enchanting tale or the last witty feuilleton which had awakened laughter in the saloons of paris taking care always to expunge with the severest hand whether from tragedy melodrama tale or essay whatever passage phrase or word could be deemed unsuited to an audience of jeunes filles i noticed more than once that where retrenchment without substitute would have left unmeaning vacancy or introduced weakness he could and did improvise whole paragraphs no less vigorous than irreproachable the dialoguethe descriptionhe engrafted was often far better than that he pruned away  well on the evening in question we were sitting silent as nuns in a retreat the pupils studying the teachers working i remember my work it was a slight matter of fancy and it rather interested me it had a purpose i was not doing it merely to kill time i meant it when finished as a gift and the occasion of presentation being near haste was requisite and my fingers were busy  we heard the sharp bellpeal which we all knew then the rapid step familiar to each ear the words voilà monsieur had scarcely broken simultaneously from every lip when the twoleaved door split as split it always did for his admissionsuch a slow word as open is inefficient to describe his movements and he stood in the midst of us  there were two study tables both long and flanked with benches over the centre of each hung a lamp beneath this lamp on either side the table sat a teacher the girls were arranged to the right hand and the left the eldest and most studious nearest the lamps or tropics the idlers and little ones towards the north and south poles monsieurs habit was politely to hand a chair to some teacher generally zélie st pierre the senior mistress then to take her vacated seat and thus avail himself of the full beam of cancer or capricorn which owing to his near sight he needed  as usual zélie rose with alacrity smiling to the whole extent of her mouth and the full display of her upper and under rows of teeththat strange smile which passes from ear to ear and is marked only by a sharp thin curve which fails to spread over the countenance and neither dimples the cheek nor lights the eye i suppose monsieur did not see her or he had taken a whim that he would not notice her for he was as capricious as women are said to be then his lunettes he had got another pair served him as an excuse for all sorts of little oversights and shortcomings whatever might be his reason he passed by zélie came to the other side of the table and before i could start up to clear the way whispered ne bougez pas and established himself between me and miss fanshawe who always would be my neighbour and have her elbow in my side however often i declared to her ginevra i wish you were at jericho  it was easy to say ne bougez pas but how could i help it i must make him room and i must request the pupils to recede that i might recede it was very well for ginevra to be gummed to me keeping herself warm as she said on the winter evenings and harassing my very heart with her fidgetings and pokings obliging me indeed sometimes to put an artful pin in my girdle by way of protection against her elbow but i suppose m emanuel was not to be subjected to the same kind of treatment so i swept away my working materials to clear space for his book and withdrew myself to make room for his person not however leaving more than a yard of interval just what any reasonable man would have regarded as a convenient respectful allowance of bench but m emanuel never was reasonable flint and tinder that he was he struck and took fire directly  vous ne voulez pas de moi pour voisin he growled vous vous donnez des airs de caste vous me traitez en paria he scowled soit je vais arranger la chose and he set to work  levez vous toutes mesdemoiselles cried he  the girls rose he made them all file off to the other table he then placed me at one extremity of the long bench and having duly and carefully brought me my workbasket silk scissors all my implements he fixed himself quite at the other end  at this arrangement highly absurd as it was not a soul in the room dared to laugh luckless for the giggler would have been the giggle as for me i took it with entire coolness there i sat isolated and cut off from human intercourse i sat and minded my work and was quiet and not at all unhappy  est ce assez de distance he demanded  monsieur en est larbitre said i  vous savez bien que non cest vous qui avez crée ce vide immense moi je ny ai pas mis la main  and with this assertion he commenced the reading  for his misfortune he had chosen a french translation of what he called un drame de williams shackspire le faux dieu he further announced de ces sots païens les anglais how far otherwise he would have characterized him had his temper not been upset i scarcely need intimate  of course the translation being french was very inefficient nor did i make any particular effort to conceal the contempt which some of its forlorn lapses were calculated to excite not that it behoved or beseemed me to say anything but one can occasionally look the opinion it is forbidden to embody in words monsieurs lunettes being on the alert he gleaned up every stray look i dont think he lost one the consequence was his eyes soon discarded a screen that their blaze might sparkle free and he waxed hotter at the north pole to which he had voluntarily exiled himself than considering the general temperature of the room it would have been reasonable to become under the vertical ray of cancer itself  the reading over it appeared problematic whether he would depart with his anger unexpressed or whether he would give it vent suppression was not much in his habits but still what had been done to him definite enough to afford matter for overt reproof i had not uttered a sound and could not justly be deemed amenable to reprimand or penalty for having permitted a slightly freer action than usual to the muscles about my eyes and mouth  the supper consisting of bread and milk diluted with tepid water was brought in in respectful consideration of the professors presence the rolls and glasses were allowed to stand instead of being immediately handed round  take your supper ladies said he seeming to be occupied in making marginal notes to his williams shackspire they took it i also accepted a roll and glass but being now more than ever interested in my work i kept my seat of punishment and wrought while i munched my bread and sipped my beverage the whole with easy sangfroid with a certain snugness of composure indeed scarcely in my habits and pleasantly novel to my feelings it seemed as if the presence of a nature so restless chafing thorny as that of m paul absorbed all feverish and unsettling influences like a magnet and left me none but such as were placid and harmonious  he rose will he go away without saying another word yes he turned to the door  no he returned on his steps but only perhaps to take his pencilcase which had been left on the table  he took itshut the pencil in and out broke its point against the wood recut and pocketed it and    walked promptly up to me  the girls and teachers gathered round the other table were talking pretty freely they always talked at meals and from the constant habit of speaking fast and loud at such times did not now subdue their voices much  m paul came and stood behind me he asked at what i was working and i said i was making a watchguard  he asked for whom and i answered for a gentlemanone of my friends  m paul stooped down and proceededas novelwriters say and as was literally true in his caseto hiss into my ear some poignant words  he said that of all the women he knew i was the one who could make herself the most consummately unpleasant i was she with whom it was least possible to live on friendly terms i had a caractère intraitable and perverse to a miracle how i managed it or what possessed me he for his part did not know but with whatever pacific and amicable intentions a person accosted mecrac i turned concord to discord goodwill to enmity he was sure hem paulwished me well enough he had never done me any harm that he knew of he might at least he supposed claim a right to be regarded as a neutral acquaintance guiltless of hostile sentiments yet how i behaved to him with what pungent vivacitieswhat an impetus of mutinywhat a fougue of injustice  here i could not avoid opening my eyes somewhat wide and even slipping in a slight interjectional observation vivacities impetus fougue i didnt know  chut à linstant there there i wentvive comme la poudre he was sorryhe was very sorry for my sake he grieved over the hapless peculiarity this emportement this chaleurgenerous perhaps but excessivewould yet he feared do me a mischief it was a pity i was nothe believed in his soulwholly without good qualities and would i but hear reason and be more sedate more sober less en lair less coquette less taken by show less prone to set an undue value on outside excellenceto make much of the attentions of people remarkable chiefly for so many feet of stature des couleurs de poupée un nez plus ou moins bien fait and an enormous amount of fatuityi might yet prove an useful perhaps an exemplary character but as it wasand here the little mans voice was for a minute choked  i would have looked up at him or held out my hand or said a soothing word but i was afraid if i stirred i should either laugh or cry so odd in all this was the mixture of the touching and the absurd  i thought he had nearly done but no he sat down that he might go on at his ease  while he m paul was on these painful topics he would dare my anger for the sake of my good and would venture to refer to a change he had noticed in my dress he was free to confess that when he first knew meor rather was in the habit of catching a passing glimpse of me from time to timei satisfied him on this point the gravity the austere simplicity obvious in this particular were such as to inspire the highest hopes for my best interests what fatal influence had impelled me lately to introduce flowers under the brim of my bonnet to wear des cols brodés and even to appear on one occasion in a scarlet gownhe might indeed conjecture but for the present would not openly declare  again i interrupted and this time not without an accent at once indignant and horrorstruck  scarlet monsieur paul it was not scarlet it was pink and pale pink to and further subdued by black lace  pink or scarlet yellow or crimson peagreen or skyblue it was all one these were all flaunting giddy colours and as to the lace i talked of that was but a colifichet de plus and he sighed over my degeneracy he could not he was sorry to say be so particular on this theme as he could wish not possessing the exact names of these babioles he might run into small verbal errors which would not fail to lay him open to my sarcasm and excite my unhappily sudden and passionate disposition he would merely say in general termsand in these general terms he knew he was correctthat my costume had of late assumed des façons mondaines which it wounded him to see  what façons mondaines he discovered in my present winter merino and plain white collar i own it puzzled me to guess and when i asked him he said it was all made with too much attention to effectand besides had i not a bow of ribbon at my neck  and if you condemn a bow of ribbon for a lady monsieur you would necessarily disapprove of a thing like this for a gentlemanholding up my bright little chainlet of silk and gold his sole reply was a groani suppose over my levity  after sitting some minutes in silence and watching the progress of the chain at which i now wrought more assiduously than ever he inquired whether what he had just said would have the effect of making me entirely detest him  i hardly remember what answer i made or how it came about i dont think i spoke at all but i know we managed to bid goodnight on friendly terms and even after m paul had reached the door he turned back just to explain that he would not be understood to speak in entire condemnation of the scarlet dress pink pink i threw in that he had no intention to deny it the merit of looking rather well the fact was m emanuels taste in colours decidedly leaned to the brilliant only he wished to counsel me whenever i wore it to do so in the same spirit as if its material were bure and its hue gris de poussière  and the flowers under my bonnet monsieur i asked they are very little ones  keep them little then said he permit them not to become fullblown  and the bow monsieurthe bit of ribbon  va pour le ruban was the propitious answer  and so we settled it                                       well done lucy snowe cried i to myself you have come in for a pretty lecturebrought on yourself a rude savant and all through your wicked fondness for worldly vanities who would

ray     chapter xxix  monsieurs fÊte   i was up the next morning an hour before daybreak and finished my guard kneeling on the dormitory floor beside the centre stand for the benefit of such expiring glimmer as the nightlamp afforded in its last watch  all my materialsmy whole stock of beads and silkwere used up before the chain assumed the length and richness i wished i had wrought it double as i knew by the rule of contraries that to suit the particular taste whose gratification was in view an effective appearance was quite indispensable as a finish to the ornament a little gold clasp was needed fortunately i possessed it in the fastening of my sole necklace i duly detached and reattached it then coiled compactly the completed guard and enclosed it in a small box i had bought for its brilliancy made of some tropic shell of the colour called nacarat and decked with a little coronal of sparkling blue stones within the lid of the box i carefully graved with my scissors point certain initials                                       the reader will perhaps remember the description of madame becks fête nor will he have forgotten that at each anniversary a handsome present was subscribed for and offered by the school the observance of this day was a distinction accorded to none but madame and in a modified form to her kinsman and counsellor m emanuel in the latter case it was an honour spontaneously awarded not plotted and contrived beforehand and offered an additional proof amongst many others of the estimation in whichdespite his partialities prejudices and irritabilitiesthe professor of literature was held by his pupils no article of value was offered to him he distinctly gave it to be understood that he would accept neither plate nor jewellery yet he liked a slight tribute the cost the moneyvalue did not touch him a diamond ring a gold snuffbox presented with pomp would have pleased him less than a flower or a drawing offered simply and with sincere feelings such was his nature he was a man not wise in his generation yet could he claim a filial sympathy with the dayspring on high  m pauls fête fell on the first of march and a thursday it proved a fine sunny day and being likewise the morning on which it was customary to attend mass being also otherwise distinguished by the halfholiday which permitted the privilege of walking out shopping or paying visits in the afternoon these combined considerations induced a general smartness and freshness of dress clean collars were in vogue the ordinary dingy woollen classedress was exchanged for something lighter and clearer mademoiselle zélie st pierre on this particular thursday even assumed a robe de soie deemed in economical labassecour an article of hazardous splendour and luxury nay it was remarked that she sent for a coiffeur to dress her hair that morning there were pupils acute enough to discover that she had bedewed her handkerchief and her hands with a new and fashionable perfume poor zélie it was much her wont to declare about this time that she was tired to death of a life of seclusion and labour that she longed to have the means and leisure for relaxation to have some one to work for hera husband who would pay her debts she was woefully encumbered with debt supply her wardrobe and leave her at liberty as she said to goûter un peu les plaisirs it had long been rumoured that her eye was upon m emanuel monsieur emanuels eye was certainly often upon her he would sit and watch her perseveringly for minutes together i have seen him give her a quarterofanhours gaze while the class was silently composing and he sat throned on his estrade unoccupied conscious always of this basilisk attention she would writhe under it halfflattered halfpuzzled and monsieur would follow her sensations sometimes looking appallingly acute for in some cases he had the terrible unerring penetration of instinct and pierced in its hidingplace the last lurking thought of the heart and discerned under florid veilings the bare barren places of the spirit yes and its perverted tendencies and its hidden false curvesall that men and women would not have knownthe twisted spine the malformed limb that was born with them and far worse the stain or disfigurement they have perhaps brought on themselves no calamity so accursed but m emanuel could pity and forgive if it were acknowledged candidly but where his questioning eyes met dishonest denialwhere his ruthless researches found deceitful concealmentoh then he could be cruel and i thought wicked he would exultantly snatch the screen from poor shrinking wretches passionately hurry them to the summit of the mount of exposure and there show them all naked all falsepoor living liesthe spawn of that horrid truth which cannot be looked on unveiled he thought he did justice for my part i doubt whether man has a right to do such justice on man more than once in these his visitations i have felt compelled to give tears to his victims and not spared ire and keen reproach to himself he deserved it but it was difficult to shake him in his firm conviction that the work was righteous and needed  breakfast being over and mass attended the schoolbell rang and the rooms filled a very pretty spectacle was presented in classe pupils and teachers sat neatly arrayed orderly and expectant each bearing in her hand the bouquet of felicitationthe prettiest springflowers all fresh and filling the air with their fragrance i only had no bouquet i like to see flowers growing but when they are gathered they cease to please i look on them as things rootless and perishable their likeness to life makes me sad i never offer flowers to those i love i never wish to receive them from hands dear to me mademoiselle st pierre marked my empty handsshe could not believe i had been so remiss with avidity her eye roved over and round me surely i must have some solitary symbolic flower somewhere some small knot of violets something to win myself praise for taste commendation for ingenuity the unimaginative anglaise proved better than the parisiennes fears she sat literally unprovided as bare of bloom or leaf as the winter tree this ascertained zélie smiled well pleased  how wisely you have acted to keep your money miss lucie she said silly i have gone and thrown away two francs on a bouquet of hothouse flowers  and she showed with pride her splendid nosegay  but hush a step the step it came prompt as usual but with a promptitude we felt disposed to flatter ourselves inspired by other feelings than mere excitability of nerve and vehemence of intent we thought our professors footfall to speak romantically had in it a friendly promise this morning and so it had  he entered in a mood which made him as good as a new sunbeam to the already welllit first classe the morning light playing amongst our plants and laughing on our walls caught an added lustre from m pauls allbenignant salute like a true frenchman though i dont know why i should say so for he was of strain neither french nor labassecourien he had dressed for the situation and the occasion not by the vague folds sinister and conspiratorlike of his sootdark paletôt were the outlines of his person obscured on the contrary his figure such as it was i dont boast of it was well set off by a civilized coat and a silken vest quite pretty to behold the defiant and pagan bonnetgrec had vanished bareheaded he came upon us carrying a christian hat in his gloved hand the little man looked well very well there was a clearness of amity in his blue eye and a glow of good feeling on his dark complexion which passed perfectly in the place of beauty one really did not care to observe that his nose though far from small was of no particular shape his cheek thin his brow marked and square his mouth no rosebud one accepted him as he was and felt his presence the reverse of damping or insignificant  he passed to his desk he placed on the same his hat and gloves bon jour mes amies said he in a tone that somehow made amends to some amongst us for many a sharp snap and savage snarl not a jocund goodfellow tone still less an unctuous priestly accent but a voice he had belonging to himselfa voice used when his heart passed the words to his lips that same heart did speak sometimes though an irritable it was not an ossified organ in its core was a place tender beyond a mans tenderness a place that humbled him to little children that bound him to girls and women to whom rebel as he would he could not disown his affinity nor quite deny that on the whole he was better with them than with his own sex  we all wish monsieur a good day and present to him our congratulations on the anniversary of his fête said mademoiselle zélie constituting herself spokeswoman of the assembly and advancing with no more twists of affectation than were with her indispensable to the achievement of motion she laid her costly bouquet before him he bowed over it  the long train of offerings followed all the pupils sweeping past with the gliding step foreigners practise left their tributes as they went by each girl so dexterously adjusted her separate gift that when the last bouquet was laid on the desk it formed the apex to a blooming pyramida pyramid blooming spreading and towering with such exuberance as in the end to eclipse the hero behind it this ceremony over seats were resumed and we sat in dead silence expectant of a speech  i suppose five minutes might have elapsed and the hush remained unbroken tenand there was no sound  many present began doubtless to wonder for what monsieur waited as well they might voiceless and viewless stirless and wordless he kept his station behind the pile of flowers  at last there issued forth a voice rather deep as if it spoke out of a hollow  estce là tout  mademoiselle zélie looked round  you have all presented your bouquets inquired she of the pupils  yes they had all given their nosegays from the eldest to the youngest from the tallest to the most diminutive the senior mistress signified as much  estce là tout was reiterated in an intonation which deep before had now descended some notes lower  monsieur said mademoiselle st pierre rising and this time speaking with her own sweet smile i have the honour to tell you that with a single exception every person in classe has offered her bouquet for meess lucie monsieur will kindly make allowance as a foreigner she probably did not know our customs or did not appreciate their significance meess lucie has regarded this ceremony as too frivolous to be honoured by her observance  famous i muttered between my teeth you are no bad speaker zélie when you begin  the answer vouchsafed to mademoiselle st pierre from the estrade was given in the gesticulation of a hand from behind the pyramid this manual action seemed to deprecate words to enjoin silence  a form ere long followed the hand monsieur emerged from his eclipse and producing himself on the front of his estrade and gazing straight and fixedly before him at a vast mappemonde covering the wall opposite he demanded a third time and now in really tragic tones  estce là tout  i might yet have made all right by stepping forwards and slipping into his hand the ruddy little shellbox i at that moment held tight in my own it was what i had fully purposed to do but first the comic side of monsieurs behaviour had tempted me to delay and now mademoiselle st pierres affected interference provoked contumacity the reader not having hitherto had any cause to ascribe to miss snowes character the most distant pretensions to perfection will be scarcely surprised to learn that she felt too perverse to defend herself from any imputation the parisienne might choose to insinuate and besides m paul was so tragic and took my defection so seriously he deserved to be vexed i kept then both my box and my countenance and sat insensate as any stone  it is well dropped at length from the lips of m paul and having uttered this phrase the shadow of some great paroxysmthe swell of wrath scorn resolvepassed over his brow rippled his lips and lined his cheeks gulping down all further comment he launched into his customary discours  i cant at all remember what this discours was i did not listen to it the gulpingdown process the abrupt dismissal of his mortification or vexation had given me a sensation which halfcounteracted the ludicrous effect of the reiterated estce là tout  towards the close of the speech there came a pleasing diversion my attention was again amusingly arrested  owing to some little accidental movementi think i dropped my thimble on the floor and in stooping to regain it hit the crown of my head against the sharp corner of my desk which casualties exasperating to me by rights if to anybody naturally made a slight bustlem paul became irritated and dismissing his forced equanimity and casting to the winds that dignity and selfcontrol with which he never cared long to encumber himself he broke forth into the strain best calculated to give him ease  i dont know how in the progress of his discours he had contrived to cross the channel and land on british ground but there i found him when i began to listen  casting a quick cynical glance round the rooma glance which scathed or was intended to scathe as it crossed mehe fell with fury upon les anglaises  never have i heard english women handled as m paul that morning handled them he spared nothingneither their minds morals manners nor personal appearance i specially remember his abuse of their tall stature their long necks their thin arms their slovenly dress their pedantic education their impious scepticism their insufferable pride their pretentious virtue over which he ground his teeth malignantly and looked as if had he dared he would have said singular things oh he was spiteful acrid savage and as a natural consequence detestably ugly  little wicked venomous man thought i am i going to harass myself with fears of displeasing you or hurting your feelings no indeed you shall be indifferent to me as the shabbiest bouquet in your pyramid  i grieve to say i could not quite carry out this resolution for some time the abuse of england and the english found and left me stolid i bore it some fifteen minutes stoically enough but this hissing cockatrice was determined to sting and he said such things at lastfastening not only upon our women but upon our greatest names and best men sullying the shield of britannia and dabbling the union jack in mudthat i was stung with vicious relish he brought up the most spicy current continental historical falsehoodsthan which nothing can be conceived more offensive zélie and the whole class became one grin of vindictive delight for it is curious to discover how these clowns of labassecour secretly hate england at last i struck a sharp stroke on my desk opened my lips and let loose this cry  vive langleterre lhistoire et les héros a bas la france la fiction et les faquins  the class was struck of a heap i suppose they thought me mad the professor put up his handkerchief and fiendishly smiled into its folds little monster of malice he now thought he had got the victory since he had made me angry in a second he became goodhumoured with great blandness he resumed the subject of his flowers talked poetically and symbolically of their sweetness perfume purity etcetera made frenchified comparisons between the jeunes filles and the sweet blossoms before him paid mademoiselle st pierre a very fullblown compliment on the superiority of her bouquet and ended by announcing that the first really fine mild and balmy morning in spring he intended to take the whole class out to breakfast in the country such of the class at least he added with emphasis as he could count amongst the number of his friends  donc je ny serai pas declared i involuntarily  soit was his response and gathering his flowers in his arms he flashed out of classe while i consigning my work scissors thimble and the neglected little box to my desk swept upstairs i dont know whether he felt hot and angry but i am free to confess that i did  yet with a strange evanescent anger i had not sat an hour on the edge of my bed picturing and repicturing his look manner words ere i smiled at the whole scene a little pang of regret i underwent that the box had not been offered i had meant to gratify him fate would not have it so  in the course of the afternoon remembering that desks in classe were by no means inviolate repositories and thinking that it was as well to secure the box on account of the initials in the lid p c d e for paul carl or carlos david emanuelsuch was his full namethese foreigners must always have a string of baptismalsi descended to the schoolroom  it slept in holiday repose the day pupils were all gone home the boarders were out walking the teachers except the surveillante of the week were in town visiting or shopping the suite of divisions was vacant so was the grande salle with its huge solemn globe hanging in the midst its pair of manybranched chandeliers and its horizontal grand piano closed silent enjoying its midweek sabbath i rather wondered to find the first classe door ajar this room being usually locked when empty and being then inaccessible to any save madame beck and myself who possessed a duplicate key i wondered still more on approaching to hear a vague movement as of lifea step a chair stirred a sound like the opening of a desk  it is only madame beck doing inspection duty was the conclusion following a moments reflection the partiallyopened door gave opportunity for assurance on this point i looked behold not the inspecting garb of madame beckthe shawl and the clean capbut the coat and the closeshorn dark head of a man this person occupied my chair his olive hand held my desk open his nose was lost to view amongst my papers his back was towards me but there could not be a moments question about identity already was the attire of ceremony discarded the cherished and inkstained paletôt was resumed the perverse bonnetgrec lay on the floor as if just dropped from the hand culpably busy  now i knew and i had long known that that hand of m emanuels was on the most intimate terms with my desk that it raised and lowered the lid ransacked and arranged the contents almost as familiarly as my own the fact was not dubious nor did he wish it to be so he left signs of each visit palpable and unmistakable hitherto however i had never caught him in the act watch as i would i could not detect the hours and moments of his coming i saw the brownies work in exercises left overnight full of faults and found next morning carefully corrected i profited by his capricious goodwill in loans full welcome and refreshing between a sallow dictionary and wornout grammar would magically grow a fresh interesting new work or a classic mellow and sweet in its ripe age out of my workbasket would laughingly peep a romance under it would lurk the pamphlet the magazine whence last evenings reading had been extracted impossible to doubt the source whence these treasures flowed had there been no other indication one condemning and traitor peculiarity common to them all settled the questionthey smelt of cigars this was very shocking of course i thought so at first and used to open the window with some bustle to air my desk and with fastidious finger and thumb to hold the peccant brochures forth to the purifying breeze i was cured of that formality suddenly monsieur caught me at it one day understood the inference instantly relieved my hand of its burden and in another moment would have thrust the same into the glowing stove it chanced to be a book on the perusal of which i was bent so for once i proved as decided and quicker than himself recaptured the spoil andhaving saved this volumenever hazarded a second with all this i had never yet been able to arrest in his visits the freakish friendly cigarloving phantom  but now at last i had him there he wasthe very brownie himself and there curling from his lips was the pale blue breath of his indian darling he was smoking into my desk it might well betray him provoked at this particular and yet pleased to surprise himpleased that is with the mixed feeling of the housewife who discovers at last her strange elfin ally busy in the dairy at the untimely churni softly stole forward stood behind him bent with precaution over his shoulder  my heart smote me to see thatafter this mornings hostility after my seeming remissness after the puncture experienced by his feelings and the ruffling undergone by his temperhe all willing to forget and forgive had brought me a couple of handsome volumes of which the title and authorship were guarantees for interest now as he sat bending above the desk he was stirring up its contents but with gentle and careful hand disarranging indeed but not harming my heart smote me as i bent over him as he sat unconscious doing me what good he could and i daresay not feeling towards me unkindly my mornings anger quite melted i did not dislike professor emanuel  i think he heard me breathe he turned suddenly his temperament was nervous yet he never started and seldom changed colour there was something hardy about him  i thought you were gone into town with the other teachers said he taking a grim gripe of his selfpossession which halfescaped himit is as well you are not do you think i care for being caught not i i often visit your desk  monsieur i know it  you find a brochure or tome now and then but you dont read them because they have passed under thistouching his cigar  they have and are no better for the process but i read them  without pleasure  monsieur must not be contradicted  do you like them or any of themare they acceptable monsieur has seen me reading them a hundred times and knows i have not so many recreations as to undervalue those he provides  i mean well and if you see that i mean well and derive some little amusement from my efforts why can we not be friends  a fatalist would saybecause we cannot  this morning he continued i awoke in a bright mood and came into classe happy you spoiled my day  no monsieur only an hour or two of it and that unintentionally  unintentionally no it was my fêteday everybody wished me happiness but you the little children of the third division gave each her knot of violets lisped each her congratulationyounothing not a bud leaf whispernot a glance was this unintentional  i meant no harm  then you really did not know our custom you were unprepared you would willingly have laid out a few centimes on a flower to give me pleasure had you been aware that it was expected say so and all is forgotten and the pain soothed  i did know that it was expected i was prepared yet i laid out no centimes on flowers  it is wellyou do right to be honest i should almost have hated you had you flattered and lied better declare at once paul carl emanuelje te déteste mon garçonthan smile an interest look an affection and be false and cold at heart false and cold i dont think you are but you have made a great mistake in life that i believe i think your judgment is warpedthat you are indifferent where you ought to be gratefuland perhaps devoted and infatuated where you ought to be cool as your name dont suppose that i wish you to have a passion for me mademoiselle dieu vous en garde what do you start for because i said passion well i say it again there is such a word and there is such a thingthough not within these walls thank heaven you are no child that one should not speak of what exists but i only uttered the wordthe thing i assure you is alien to my whole life and views it died in the pastin the present it lies buriedits grave is deepdug wellheaped and many winters old in the future there will be a resurrection as i believe to my souls consolation but all will then be changedform and feeling the mortal will have put on immortalityit will rise not for earth but heaven all i say to you miss lucy snowe isthat you ought to treat professor paul emanuel decently  i could not and did not contradict such a sentiment  tell me he pursued when it is your fêteday and i will not grudge a few centimes for a small offering  you will be like me monsieur this cost more than a few centimes and i did not grudge its price  and taking from the open desk the little box i put it into his hand  it lay ready in my lap this morning i continued and if monsieur had been rather more patient and mademoiselle st pierre less interferingperhaps i should say too if i had been calmer and wiseri should have given it then  he looked at the box i saw its clear warm tint and bright azure circlet pleased his eyes i told him to open it  my initials said he indicating the letters in the lid who told you i was called carl david  a little bird monsieur  does it fly from me to you then one can tie a message under its wing when needful  he took out the chaina trifle indeed as to value but glossy with silk and sparkling with beads he liked that tooadmired it artlessly like a child  for me  yes for you  this is the thing you were working at last night  the same  you finished it this morning  i did  you commenced it with the intention that it should be mine  undoubtedly  and offered on my fêteday  yes  this purpose continued as you wove it  again i assented  then it is not necessary that i should cut out any portionsaying this part is not mine it was plaited under the idea and for the adornment of another  by no means it is neither necessary nor would it be just  this object is all mine  that object is yours entirely  straightway monsieur opened his paletôt arranged the guard splendidly across his chest displaying as much and suppressing as little as he could for he had no notion of concealing what he admired and thought decorative as to the box he pronounced it a superb bonbonnièrehe was fond of bonbons by the wayand as he always liked to share with others what pleased himself he would give his dragées as freely as he lent his books amongst the kind brownies gifts left in my desk i forgot to enumerate many a paper of chocolate comfits his tastes in these matters were southern and what we think infantine his simple lunch consisted frequently of a brioche which as often as not to shared with some child of the third division  a présent cest un fait accompli said he readjusting his paletôt and we had no more words on the subject after looking over the two volumes he had brought and cutting away some pages with his penknife he generally pruned before lending his books especially if they were novels and sometimes i was a little provoked at the severity of his censorship the retrenchments interrupting the narrative he rose politely touched his bonnetgrec and bade me a civil goodday  we are friends now thought i till the next time we quarrel  we might have quarrelled again that very same evening but wonderful to relate failed for once to make the most of our opportunity  contrary to all expectation m paul arrived at the studyhour having seen so much of him in the morning we did not look for his presence at night no sooner were we seated at lessons however than he appeared i own i was glad to see him so glad that i could not help greeting his arrival with a smile and when he made his way to the same seat about which so serious a misunderstanding had formerly arisen i took good care not to make too much room for him he watched with a jealous sidelong look to see whether i shrank away but i did not though the bench was a little crowded i was losing the early impulse to recoil from m paul habituated to the paletôt and bonnetgrec the neighbourhood of these garments seemed no longer uncomfortable or very formidable i did not now sit restrained asphyxiée as he used to say at his side i stirred when i wished to stir coughed when it was necessary even yawned when i was tireddid in short what i pleased blindly reliant upon his indulgence nor did my temerity this evening at least meet the punishment it perhaps merited he was both indulgent and goodnatured not a cross glance shot from his eyes not a hasty word left his lips till the very close of the evening he did not indeed address me at all yet i felt somehow that he was full of friendliness silence is of different kinds and breathes different meanings no words could inspire a pleasanter content than did m pauls worldless presence when the tray came in and the bustle of supper commenced he just said as he retired that he wished me a good night and sweet dreams and a good night and sweet dreams i had     chapter xxx  m paul   yet the reader is advised not to be in any hurry with his kindly conclusions or to suppose with an overhasty charity that from that day m paul became a changed charactereasy to live with and no longer apt to flash danger and discomfort round him  no he was naturally a little man of unreasonable moods when overwrought which he often was he became acutely irritable and besides his veins were dark with a livid belladonna tincture the essence of jealousy i do not mean merely the tender jealousy of the heart but that sterner narrower sentiment whose seat is in the head  i used to think as i sat looking at m paul while he was knitting his brow or protruding his lip over some exercise of mine which had not as many faults as he wished for he liked me to commit faults a knot of blunders was sweet to him as a cluster of nuts that he had points of resemblance to napoleon bonaparte i think so still  in a shameless disregard of magnanimity he resembled the great emperor m paul would have quarrelled with twenty learned women would have unblushingly carried on a system of petty bickering and recrimination with a whole capital of coteries never troubling himself about loss or lack of dignity he would have exiled fifty madame de staëls if they had annoyed offended outrivalled or opposed him  i well remember a hot episode of his with a certain madame panachea lady temporarily employed by madame beck to give lessons in history she was cleverthat is she knew a good deal and besides thoroughly possessed the art of making the most of what she knew of words and confidence she held unlimited command her personal appearance was far from destitute of advantages i believe many people would have pronounced her a fine woman and yet there were points in her robust and ample attractions as well as in her bustling and demonstrative presence which it appeared the nice and capricious tastes of m paul could not away with the sound of her voice echoing through the carré would put him into a strange taking her long free stepalmost stridealong the corridor would often make him snatch up his papers and decamp on the instant  with malicious intent he bethought himself one day to intrude on her class as quick as lightning he gathered her method of instruction it differed from a pet plan of his own with little ceremony and less courtesy he pointed out what he termed her errors whether he expected submission and attention i know not he met an acrid opposition accompanied by a round reprimand for his certainly unjustifiable interference  instead of withdrawing with dignity as he might still have done he threw down the gauntlet of defiance madame panache bellicose as a penthesilea picked it up in a minute she snapped her fingers in the intermeddlers face she rushed upon him with a storm of words m emanuel was eloquent but madame panache was voluble a system of fierce antagonism ensued instead of laughing in his sleeve at his fair foe with all her sore amourpropre and loud selfassertion m paul detested her with intense seriousness he honoured her with his earnest fury he pursued her vindictively and implacably refusing to rest peaceably in his bed to derive due benefit from his meals or even serenely to relish his cigar till she was fairly rooted out of the establishment the professor conquered but i cannot say that the laurels of this victory shadowed gracefully his temples once i ventured to hint as much to my great surprise he allowed that i might be right but averred that when brought into contact with either men or women of the coarse selfcomplacent quality whereof madame panache was a specimen he had no control over his own passions an unspeakable and active aversion impelled him to a war of extermination  three months afterwards hearing that his vanquished foe had met with reverses and was likely to be really distressed for want of employment he forgot his hatred and alike active in good and evil he moved heaven and earth till he found her a place upon her coming to make up former differences and thank him for his recent kindness the old voicea little loudthe old mannera little forwardso acted upon him that in ten minutes he started up and bowed her or rather himself out of the room in a transport of nervous irritation  to pursue a somewhat audacious parallel in a love of power in an eager grasp after supremacy m emanuel was like bonaparte he was a man not always to be submitted to sometimes it was needful to resist it was right to stand still to look up into his eyes and tell him that his requirements went beyond reasonthat his absolutism verged on tyranny  the dawnings the first developments of peculiar talent appearing within his range and under his rule curiously excited even disturbed him he watched its struggle into life with a scowl he held back his handperhaps said come on if you have strength but would not aid the birth  when the pang and peril of the first conflict were over when the breath of life was drawn when he saw the lungs expand and contract when he felt the heart beat and discovered life in the eye he did not yet offer to foster  prove yourself true ere i cherish you was his ordinance and how difficult he made that proof what thorns and briers what flints he strewed in the path of feet not inured to rough travel he watched tearlesslyordeals that he exacted should be passed throughfearlessly he followed footprints that as they approached the bourne were sometimes marked in bloodfollowed them grimly holding the austerest policewatch over the painpressed pilgrim and when at last he allowed a rest before slumber might close the eyelids he opened those same lids wide with pitiless finger and thumb and gazed deep through the pupil and the irids into the brain into the heart to search if vanity or pride or falsehood in any of its subtlest forms was discoverable in the furthest recess of existence if at last he let the neophyte sleep it was but a moment he woke him suddenly up to apply new tests he sent him on irksome errands when he was staggering with weariness he tried the temper the sense and the health and it was only when every severest test had been applied and endured when the most corrosive aquafortis had been used and failed to tarnish the ore that he admitted it genuine and still in clouded silence stamped it with his deep brand of approval  i speak not ignorant of these evils  till the date at which the last chapter closes m paul had not been my professorhe had not given me lessons but about that time accidentally hearing me one day acknowledge an ignorance of some branch of education i think it was arithmetic which would have disgraced a charityschool boy as he very truly remarked he took me in hand examined me first found me i need not say abundantly deficient gave me some books and appointed me some tasks  he did this at first with pleasure indeed with unconcealed exultation condescending to say that he believed i was bonne et pas trop faible ie well enough disposed and not wholly destitute of parts but owing he supposed to adverse circumstances as yet in a state of wretchedly imperfect mental development  the beginning of all effort has indeed with me been marked by a preternatural imbecility i never could even in forming a common acquaintance assert or prove a claim to average quickness a depressing and difficult passage has prefaced every new page i have turned in life  so long as this passage lasted m paul was very kind very good very forbearing he saw the sharp pain inflicted and felt the weighty humiliation imposed by my own sense of incapacity and words can hardly do justice to his tenderness and helpfulness his own eyes would moisten when tears of shame and effort clouded mine burdened as he was with work he would steal half his brief space of recreation to give to me  but strange grief when that heavy and overcast dawn began at last to yield to day when my faculties began to struggle themselves free and my time of energy and fulfilment came when i voluntarily doubled trebled quadrupled the tasks he set to please him as i thought his kindness became sternness the light changed in his eyes from a beam to a spark he fretted he opposed he curbed me imperiously the more i did the harder i worked the less he seemed content sarcasms of which the severity amazed and puzzled me harassed my ears then flowed out the bitterest inuendoes against the pride of intellect i was vaguely threatened with i know not what doom if i ever trespassed the limits proper to my sex and conceived a contraband appetite for unfeminine knowledge alas i had no such appetite what i loved it joyed me by any effort to content but the noble hunger for science in the abstractthe godlike thirst after discoverythese feelings were known to me but by briefest flashes  yet when m paul sneered at me i wanted to possess them more fully his injustice stirred in me ambitious wishesit imparted a strong stimulusit gave wings to aspiration  in the beginning before i had penetrated to motives that uncomprehended sneer of his made my heart ache but byandby it only warmed the blood in my veins and sent added action to my pulses whatever my powersfeminine or the contrarygod had given them and i felt resolute to be ashamed of no faculty of his bestowal  the combat was very sharp for a time i seemed to have lost m pauls affection he treated me strangely in his most unjust moments he would insinuate that i had deceived him when i appeared what he called faiblethat is incompetent he said i had feigned a false incapacity again he would turn suddenly round and accuse me of the most farfetched imitations and impossible plagiarisms asserting that i had extracted the pith out of books i had not so much as heard ofand over the perusal of which i should infallibly have fallen down in a sleep as deep as that of eutychus  once upon his preferring such an accusation i turned upon himi rose against him gathering an armful of his books out of my desk i filled my apron and poured them in a heap upon his estrade at his feet  take them away m paul i said and teach me no more i never asked to be made learned and you compel me to feel very profoundly that learning is not happiness  and returning to my desk i laid my head on my arms nor would i speak to him for two days afterwards he pained and chagrined me his affection had been very sweet and deara pleasure new and incomparable now that this seemed withdrawn i cared not for his lessons  the books however were not taken away they were all restored with careful hand to their places and he came as usual to teach me he made his peace somehowtoo readily perhaps i ought to have stood out longer but when he looked kind and good and held out his hand with amity memory refused to reproduce with due force his oppressive moments and then reconcilement is always sweet  on a certain morning a message came from my godmother inviting me to attend some notable lecture to be delivered in the same public rooms before described dr john had brought the message himself and delivered it verbally to rosine who had not scrupled to follow the steps of m emanuel then passing to the first classe and in his presence stand carrément before my desk hand in apronpocket and rehearse the same saucily and aloud concluding with the words quil est vraiment beau mademoiselle ce jeune docteur quels yeuxquel regard tenez jen ai le coeur tout ému  when she was gone my professor demanded of me why i suffered cette fille effrontée cette créature sans pudeur to address me in such terms  i had no pacifying answer to give the terms were precisely such as rosinea young lady in whose skull the organs of reverence and reserve were not largely developedwas in the constant habit of using besides what she said about the young doctor was true enough graham was handsome he had fine eyes and a thrilling glance an observation to that effect actually formed itself into sound on my lips  elle ne dit que la vérité i said  ah vous trouvez  mais sans doute  the lesson to which we had that day to submit was such as to make us very glad when it terminated at its close the released pupils rushed out halftrembling halfexultant i too was going a mandate to remain arrested me i muttered that i wanted some fresh air sadlythe stove was in a glow the classe overheated an inexorable voice merely recommended silence and this salamanderfor whom no room ever seemed too hotsitting down between my desk and the stovea situation in which he ought to have felt broiled but did notproceeded to confront me witha greek quotation  in m emanuels soul rankled a chronic suspicion that i knew both greek and latin as monkeys are said to have the power of speech if they would but use it and are reported to conceal this faculty in fear of its being turned to their detriment so to me was ascribed a fund of knowledge which i was supposed criminally and craftily to conceal the privileges of a classical education it was insinuated had been mine on flowers of hymettus i had revelled a golden store hived in memory now silently sustained my efforts and privily nurtured my wits  a hundred expedients did m paul employ to surprise my secretto wheedle to threaten to startle it out of me sometimes he placed greek and latin books in my way and then watched me as joan of arcs jailors tempted her with the warriors accoutrements and lay in wait for the issue again he quoted i know not what authors and passages and while rolling out their sweet and sounding lines the classic tones fell musically from his lipsfor he had a good voiceremarkable for compass modulation and matchless expression he would fix on me a vigilant piercing and often malicious eye it was evident he sometimes expected great demonstrations they never occurred however not comprehending of course i could neither be charmed nor annoyed  baffledalmost angryhe still clung to his fixed idea my susceptibilities were pronounced marblemy face a mask it appeared as if he could not be brought to accept the homely truth and take me for what i was men and women too must have delusion of some sort if not made ready to their hand they will invent exaggeration for themselves  at moments i did wish that his suspicions had been better founded there were times when i would have given my right hand to possess the treasures he ascribed to me he deserved condign punishment for his testy crotchets i could have gloried in bringing home to him his worst apprehensions astoundingly realized i could have exulted to burst on his vision confront and confound his lunettes one blaze of acquirements oh why did nobody undertake to make me clever while i was young enough to learn that i might by one grand sudden inhuman revelationone cold cruel overwhelming triumphhave for ever crushed the mocking spirit out of paul carl david emanuel  alas no such feat was in my power today as usual his quotations fell ineffectual he soon shifted his ground  women of intellect was his next theme here he was at home a woman of intellect it appeared was a sort of lusus naturae a luckless accident a thing for which there was neither place nor use in creation wanted neither as wife nor worker beauty anticipated her in the first office he believed in his soul that lovely placid and passive feminine mediocrity was the only pillow on which manly thought and sense could find rest for its aching temples and as to work male mind alone could work to any good practical resulthein  this hein was a note of interrogation intended to draw from me contradiction or objection however i only saidcela ne me regarde pas je ne men soucie pas and presently addedmay i go monsieur they have rung the bell for the second déjeuner ie luncheon  what of that you are not hungry  indeed i was i said i had had nothing since breakfast at seven and should have nothing till dinner at five if i missed this bell  well he was in the same plight but i might share with him  and he broke in two the brioche intended for his own refreshment and gave me half truly his bark was worse than his bite but the really formidable attack was yet to come while eating his cake i could not forbear expressing my secret wish that i really knew all of which he accused me  did i sincerely feel myself to be an ignoramus he asked in a softened tone  if i had replied meekly by an unqualified affirmative i believe he would have stretched out his hand and we should have been friends on the spot but i answered  not exactly i am ignorant monsieur in the knowledge you ascribe to me but i sometimes not always feel a knowledge of my own  what did i mean he inquired sharply  unable to answer this question in a breath i evaded it by change of subject he had now finished his half of the brioche feeling sure that on so trifling a fragment he could not have satisfied his appetite as indeed i had not appeased mine and inhaling the fragrance of baked apples afar from the refectory i ventured to inquire whether he did not also perceive that agreeable odour he confessed that he did i said if he would let me out by the gardendoor and permit me just to run across the court i would fetch him a plateful and added that i believed they were excellent as goton had a very good method of baking or rather stewing fruit putting in a little spice sugar and a glass or two of vin blancmight i go  petite gourmande said he smiling i have not forgotten how pleased you were with the pâté â la crême i once gave you and you know very well at this moment that to fetch the apples for me will be the same as getting them for yourself go then but come back quickly  and at last he liberated me on parole my own plan was to go and return with speed and good faith to put the plate in at the door and then to vanish incontinent leaving all consequences for future settlement  that intolerably keen instinct of his seemed to have anticipated my scheme he met me at the threshold hurried me into the room and fixed me in a minute in my former seat taking the plate of fruit from my hand he divided the portion intended only for himself and ordered me to eat my share i complied with no good grace and vexed i suppose by my reluctance he opened a masked and dangerous battery all he had yet said i could count as mere sound and fury signifying nothing not so of the present attack  it consisted in an unreasonable proposition with which he had before afflicted me namely that on the next public examinationday i should engageforeigner as i wasto take my place on the first form of firstclass pupils and with them improvise a composition in french on any subject any spectator might dictate without benefit of grammar or lexicon  i knew what the result of such an experiment would be i to whom nature had denied the impromptu faculty who in public was by nature a cypher whose time of mental activity even when alone was not under the meridian sun who needed the fresh silence of morning or the recluse peace of evening to win from the creative impulse one evidence of his presence one proof of his force i with whom that impulse was the most intractable the most capricious the most maddening of masters him before me always excepteda deity which sometimes under circumstancesapparently propitious would not speak when questioned would not hear when appealed to would not when sought be found but would stand all cold all indurated all granite a dark baal with carven lips and blank eyeballs and breast like the stone face of a tomb and again suddenly at some turn some sound some longtrembling sob of the wind at some rushing past of an unseen stream of electricity the irrational demon would wake unsolicited would stir strangely alive would rush from its pedestal like a perturbed dagon calling to its votary for a sacrifice whatever the hourto its victim for some blood or some breath whatever the circumstance or scenerousing its priest treacherously promising vaticination perhaps filling its temple with a strange hum of oracles but sure to give half the significance to fateful winds and grudging to the desperate listener even a miserable remnantyielding it sordidly as though each word had been a drop of the deathless ichor of its own dark veins and this tyrant i was to compel into bondage and make it improvise a theme on a school estrade between a mathilde and a coralie under the eye of a madame beck for the pleasure and to the inspiration of a bourgeois of labassecour  upon this argument m paul and i did battle more than oncestrong battle with confused noise of demand and rejection exaction and repulse  on this particular day i was soundly rated the obstinacy of my whole sex it seems was concentrated in me i had an orgueil de diable i feared to fail forsooth what did it matter whether i failed or not who was i that i should not fail like my betters it would do me good to fail he wanted to see me worsted i knew he did and one minute he paused to take breath  would i speak now and be tractable  never would i be tractable in this matter law itself should not compel me i would pay a fine or undergo an imprisonment rather than write for a show and to order perched up on a platform  could softer motives influence me would i yield for friendships sake  not a whit not a hairbreadth no form of friendship under the sun had a right to exact such a concession no true friendship would harass me thus  he supposed then with a sneerm paul could sneer supremely curling his lip opening his nostrils contracting his eyelidshe supposed there was but one form of appeal to which i would listen and of that form it was not for him to make use  under certain persuasions from certain quarters je vous vois dici said he eagerly subscribing to the sacrifice passionately arming for the effort  making a simpleton a warning and an example of myself before a hundred and fifty of the papas and mammas of villette  and here losing patience i broke out afresh with a cry that i wanted to be liberatedto get out into the airi was almost in a fever  chut said the inexorable this was a mere pretext to run away he was not hot with the stove close at his back how could i suffer thoroughly screened by his person  i did not understand his constitution i knew nothing of the natural history of salamanders for my own part i was a phlegmatic islander and sitting in an oven did not agree with me at least might i step to the well and get a glass of waterthe sweet apples had made me thirsty  if that was all he would do my errand  he went to fetch the water of course with a door only on the latch behind me i lost not my opportunity ere his return his halfworried prey had escaped     chapter xxxi  the dryad   the spring was advancing and the weather had turned suddenly warm this change of temperature brought with it for me as probably for many others temporary decrease of strength slight exertion at this time left me overcome with fatiguesleepless nights entailed languid days  one sunday afternoon having walked the distance of half a league to the protestant church i came back weary and exhausted and taking refuge in my solitary sanctuary the first classe i was glad to sit down and to make of my desk a pillow for my arms and head  awhile i listened to the lullaby of bees humming in the berceau and watched through the glass door and the tender lightlystrewn spring foliage madame beck and a gay party of friends whom she had entertained that day at dinner after morning mass walking in the centrealley under orchard boughs dressed at this season in blossom and wearing a colouring as pure and warm as mountainsnow at sunrise  my principal attraction towards this group of guests lay i remember in one figurethat of a handsome young girl whom i had seen before as a visitor at madame becks and of whom i had been vaguely told that she was a filleule or goddaughter of m emanuels and that between her mother or aunt or some other female relation of hers and the professor had existed of old a special friendship m paul was not of the holiday band today but i had seen this young girl with him ere now and as far as distant observation could enable me to judge she seemed to enjoy him with the frank ease of a ward with an indulgent guardian i had seen her run up to him put her arm through his and hang upon him once when she did so a curious sensation had struck through mea disagreeable anticipatory sensationone of the family of presentiments i supposebut i refused to analyze or dwell upon it while watching this girl mademoiselle sauveur by name and following the gleam of her bright silk robe she was always richly dressed for she was said to be wealthy through the flowers and the glancing leaves of tender emerald my eyes became dazzledthey closed my lassitude the warmth of the day the hum of bees and birds all lulled me and at last i slept  two hours stole over me ere i woke the sun had declined out of sight behind the towering houses the garden and the room were grey bees had gone homeward and the flowers were closing the party of guests too had vanished each alley was void  on waking i felt much at easenot chill as i ought to have been after sitting so still for at least two hours my cheek and arms were not benumbed by pressure against the hard desk no wonder instead of the bare wood on which i had laid them i found a thick shawl carefully folded substituted for support and another shawl both taken from the corridor where such things hung wrapped warmly round me  who had done this who was my friend which of the teachers which of the pupils none except st pierre was inimical to me but which of them had the art the thought the habit of benefiting thus tenderly which of them had a step so quiet a hand so gentle but i should have heard or felt her if she had approached or touched me in a daysleep  as to ginevra fanshawe that bright young creature was not gentle at all and would certainly have pulled me out of my chair if she had meddled in the matter i said at last it is madame becks doing she has come in seen me asleep and thought i might take cold she considers me a useful machine answering well the purpose for which it was hired so would not have me needlessly injured and now methought ill take a walk the evening is fresh and not very chill  so i opened the glass door and stepped into the berceau  i went to my own alley had it been dark or even dusk i should have hardly ventured there for i had not yet forgotten the curious illusion of vision if illusion it were experienced in that place some months ago but a ray of the setting sun burnished still the grey crown of jean baptiste nor had all the birds of the garden yet vanished into their nests amongst the tufted shrubs and thick wallivy i paced up and down thinking almost the same thoughts i had pondered that night when i buried my glass jarhow i should make some advance in life take another step towards an independent position for this train of reflection though not lately pursued had never by me been wholly abandoned and whenever a certain eye was averted from me and a certain countenance grew dark with unkindness and injustice into that track of speculation did i at once strike so that little by little i had laid half a plan  living costs little said i to myself in this economical town of villette where people are more sensible than i understand they are in dear old englandinfinitely less worried about appearance and less emulous of displaywhere nobody is in the least ashamed to be quite as homely and saving as he finds convenient houserent in a prudently chosen situation need not be high when i shall have saved one thousand francs i will take a tenement with one large room and two or three smaller ones furnish the first with a few benches and desks a black tableau an estrade for myself upon it a chair and table with a sponge and some white chalks begin with taking daypupils and so work my way upwards madame becks commencement wasas i have often heard her sayfrom no higher startingpoint and where is she now all these premises and this garden are hers bought with her money she has a competency already secured for old age and a flourishing establishment under her direction which will furnish a career for her children  courage

the darkest angel of gods hostwater when he has asked bloodwill he take it not a whole pale sea for one red drop i settled another account  pausing before methusalehthe giant and patriarch of the gardenand leaning my brow against his knotty trunk my foot rested on the stone sealing the small sepulchre at his root and i recalled the passage of feeling therein buried i recalled dr john my warm affection for him my faith in his excellence my delight in his grace what was become of that curious onesided friendship which was half marble and half life only on one hand truth and on the other perhaps a jest  was this feeling dead i do not know but it was buried sometimes i thought the tomb unquiet and dreamed strangely of disturbed earth and of hair still golden and living obtruded through coffinchinks  had i been too hasty i used to ask myself and this question would occur with a cruel sharpness after some brief chance interview with dr john he had still such kind looks such a warm hand his voice still kept so pleasant a tone for my name i never liked lucy so well as when he uttered it but i learned in time that this benignity this cordiality this music belonged in no shape to me it was a part of himself it was the honey of his temper it was the balm of his mellow mood he imparted it as the ripe fruit rewards with sweetness the rifling bee he diffused it about him as sweet plants shed their perfume does the nectarine love either the bee or bird it feeds is the sweetbriar enamoured of the air  goodnight dr john you are good you are beautiful but you are not mine goodnight and god bless you  thus i closed my musings goodnight left my lips in sound i heard the words spoken and then i heard an echoquite close  goodnight mademoiselle or rather goodeveningthe sun is scarce set i hope you slept well  i started but was only discomposed a moment i knew the voice and speaker  slept monsieur when where  you may well inquire whenwhere it seems you turn day into night and choose a desk for a pillow rather hard lodging  it was softened for me monsieur while i slept that unseen giftbringing thing which haunts my desk remembered me no matter how i fell asleep i awoke pillowed and covered  did the shawls keep you warm  very warm do you ask thanks for them  no you looked pale in your slumbers are you homesick  to be homesick one must have a home which i have not  then you have more need of a careful friend i scarcely know any one miss lucy who needs a friend more absolutely than you your very faults imperatively require it you want so much checking regulating and keeping down  this idea of keeping down never left m pauls head the most habitual subjugation would in my case have failed to relieve him of it no matter what did it signify i listened to him and did not trouble myself to be too submissive his occupation would have been gone had i left him nothing to keep down  you need watching and watching over he pursued and it is well for you that i see this and do my best to discharge both duties i watch you and others pretty closely pretty constantly nearer and oftener than you or they think do you see that window with a light in it  he pointed to a lattice in one of the college boardinghouses  that said he is a room i have hired nominally for a studyvirtually for a post of observation there i sit and read for hours together it is my waymy taste my book is this garden its contents are human naturefemale human nature i know you all by heart ah i know you wellst pierre the parisiennecette maîtressefemme my cousin beck herself  it is not right monsieur  comment it is not right by whose creed does some dogma of calvin or luther condemn it what is that to me i am no protestant my rich father for though i have known poverty and once starved for a year in a garret in romestarved wretchedly often on a meal a day and sometimes not thatyet i was born to wealthmy rich father was a good catholic and he gave me a priest and a jesuit for a tutor i retain his lessons and to what discoveries grand dieu have they not aided me  discoveries made by stealth seem to me dishonourable discoveries  puritaine i doubt it not yet see how my jesuits system works you know the st pierre  partially  he laughed you say rightpartially whereas i know her thoroughly there is the difference she played before me the amiable offered me patte de velours caressed flattered fawned on me now i am accessible to a womans flatteryaccessible against my reason though never pretty she waswhen i first knew heryoung or knew how to look young like all her countrywomen she had the art of dressingshe had a certain cool easy social assurance which spared me the pain of embarrassment  monsieur that must have been unnecessary i never saw you embarrassed in my life  mademoiselle you know little of me i can be embarrassed as a petite pensionnaire there is a fund of modesty and diffidence in my nature  monsieur i never saw it  mademoiselle it is there you ought to have seen it  monsieur i have observed you in publicon platforms in tribunes before titles and crowned headsand you were as easy as you are in the third division  mademoiselle neither titles nor crowned heads excite my modesty and publicity is very much my element i like it well and breathe in it quite freelybutbut in short here is the sentiment brought into action at this very moment however i disdain to be worsted by it if mademoiselle i were a marrying man which i am not and you may spare yourself the trouble of any sneer you may be contemplating at the thought and found it necessary to ask a lady whether she could look upon me in the light of a future husband then would it be proved that i am as i saymodest  i quite believed him now and in believing i honoured him with a sincerity of esteem which made my heart ache  as to the st pierre he went on recovering himself for his voice had altered a little she once intended to be madame emanuel and i dont know whither i might have been led but for yonder little lattice with the light ah magic lattice what miracles of discovery hast thou wrought yes he pursued i have seen her rancours her vanities her levitiesnot only here but elsewhere i have witnessed what bucklers me against all her arts i am safe from poor zélie  and my pupils he presently recommenced those blondes jeunes fillesso mild and meeki have seen the most reservedromp like boys the demurestsnatch grapes from the walls shake pears from the trees when the english teacher came i saw her marked her early preference for this alley noticed her taste for seclusion watched her well long before she and i came to speaking terms do you recollect my once coming silently and offering you a little knot of white violets when we were strangers  i recollect it i dried the violets kept them and have them still  it pleased me when you took them peacefully and promptly without pruderythat sentiment which i ever dread to excite and which when it is revealed in eye or gesture i vindictively detest to return not only did i watch you but oftenespecially at eventideanother guardian angel was noiselessly hovering near night after night my cousin beck has stolen down yonder steps and glidingly pursued your movements when you did not see her  but monsieur you could not from the distance of that window see what passed in this garden at night  by moonlight i possibly might with a glassi use a glassbut the garden itself is open to me in the shed at the bottom there is a door leading into a court which communicates with the college of that door i possess the key and thus come and go at pleasure this afternoon i came through it and found you asleep in classe again this evening i have availed myself of the same entrance  i could not help saying if you were a wicked designing man how terrible would all this be  his attention seemed incapable of being arrested by this view of the subject he lit his cigar and while he puffed it leaning against a tree and looking at me in a cool amused way he had when his humour was tranquil i thought proper to go on sermonizing him he often lectured me by the hour togetheri did not see why i should not speak my mind for once so i told him my impressions concerning his jesuitsystem  the knowledge it brings you is bought too dear monsieur this coming and going by stealth degrades your own dignity  my dignity he cried laughing when did you ever see me trouble my head about my dignity it is you miss lucy who are digne how often in your high insular presence have i taken a pleasure in trampling upon what you are pleased to call my dignity tearing it scattering it to the winds in those mad transports you witness with such hauteur and which i know you think very like the ravings of a thirdrate london actor  monsieur i tell you every glance you cast from that lattice is a wrong done to the best part of your own nature to study the human heart thus is to banquet secretly and sacrilegiously on eves apples i wish you were a protestant  indifferent to the wish he smoked on after a space of smiling yet thoughtful silence he said rather suddenlyi have seen other things  what other things  taking the weed from his lips he threw the remnant amongst the shrubs where for a moment it lay glowing in the gloom  look at it said he is not that spark like an eye watching you and me  he took a turn down the walk presently returning he went oni have seen miss lucy things to me unaccountable that have made me watch all night for a solution and i have not yet found it  the tone was peculiar my veins thrilled he saw me shiver  are you afraid whether is it of my words or that red jealous eye just winking itself out  i am cold the night grows dark and late and the air is changed it is time to go in  it is little past eight but you shall go in soon answer me only this question  yet he paused ere he put it the garden was truly growing dark dusk had come on with clouds and drops of rain began to patter through the trees i hoped he would feel this but for the moment he seemed too much absorbed to be sensible of the change  mademoiselle do you protestants believe in the supernatural  there is a difference of theory and belief on this point amongst protestants as amongst other sects i answered why monsieur do you ask such a question  why do you shrink and speak so faintly are you superstitious  i am constitutionally nervous i dislike the discussion of such subjects i dislike it the more because  you believe  no but it has happened to me to experience impressions  since you came here  yes not many months ago  herein this house  yes  bon i am glad of it i knew it somehow before you told me i was conscious of rapport between you and myself you are patient and i am choleric you are quiet and pale and i am tanned and fiery you are a strict protestant and i am a sort of lay jesuit but we are alikethere is affinity between us do you see it mademoiselle when you look in the glass do you observe that your forehead is shaped like minethat your eyes are cut like mine do you hear that you have some of my tones of voice do you know that you have many of my looks i perceive all this and believe that you were born under my star yes you were born under my star tremble for where that is the case with mortals the threads of their destinies are difficult to disentangle knottings and catchings occursudden breaks leave damage in the web but these impressions as you say with english caution i too have had my impressions  monsieur tell me them  i desire no better and intend no less you know the legend of this house and garden  i know it yes they say that hundreds of years ago a nun was buried here alive at the foot of this very tree beneath the ground which now bears us  and that in former days a nuns ghost used to come and go here  monsieur what if it comes and goes here still  something comes and goes here there is a shape frequenting this house by night different to any forms that show themselves by day i have indisputably seen a something more than once and to me its conventual weeds were a strange sight saying more than they can do to any other living being a nun  monsieur i too have seen it  i anticipated that whether this nun be flesh and blood or something that remains when blood is dried and flesh is wasted her business is as much with you as with me probably well i mean to make it out it has baffled me so far but i mean to follow up the mystery i mean  instead of telling what he meant he raised his head suddenly i made the same movement in the same instant we both looked to one pointthe high tree shadowing the great berceau and resting some of its boughs on the roof of the first classe there had been a strange and inexplicable sound from that quarter as if the arms of that tree had swayed of their own motion and its weight of foliage had rushed and crushed against the massive trunk yes there scarce stirred a breeze and that heavy tree was convulsed whilst the feathery shrubs stood still for some minutes amongst the wood and leafage a rending and heaving went on dark as it was it seemed to me that something more solid than either nightshadow or branchshadow blackened out of the boles at last the struggle ceased what birth succeeded this travail what dryad was born of these throes we watched fixedly a sudden bell rang in the housethe prayerbell instantly into our alley there came out of the berceau an apparition all black and white with a sort of angry rushclose close past our facesswept swiftly the very nun herself never had i seen her so clearly she looked tall of stature and fierce of gesture as she went the wind rose sobbing the rain poured wild and cold the whole night seemed to feel her     chapter xxxii  the first letter   where it becomes time to inquire was paulina mary how fared my intercourse with the sumptuous hôtel crécy that intercourse had for an interval been suspended by absence m and miss de bassompierre had been travelling dividing some weeks between the provinces and capital of france chance apprised me of their return very shortly after it took place  i was walking one mild afternoon on a quiet boulevard wandering slowly on enjoying the benign april sun and some thoughts not unpleasing when i saw before me a group of riders stopping as if they had just encountered and exchanging greetings in the midst of the broad smooth lindenbordered path on one side a middleaged gentleman and young lady on the othera young and handsome man very graceful was the ladys mien choice her appointments delicate and stately her whole aspect still as i looked i felt they were known to me and drawing a little nearer i fully recognised them all the count home de bassompierre his daughter and dr graham bretton  how animated was grahams face how true how warm yet how retiring the joy it expressed this was the state of things this the combination of circumstances at once to attract and enchain to subdue and excite dr john the pearl he admired was in itself of great price and truest purity but he was not the man who in appreciating the gem could forget its setting had he seen paulina with the same youth beauty and grace but on foot alone unguarded and in simple attire a dependent worker a demigrisette he would have thought her a pretty little creature and would have loved with his eye her movements and her mien but it required other than this to conquer him as he was now vanquished to bring him safe under dominion as now without loss and even with gain to his manly honour one saw that he was reduced there was about dr john all the man of the world to satisfy himself did not suffice society must approvethe world must admire what he did or he counted his measures false and futile in his victrix he required all that was here visiblethe imprint of high cultivation the consecration of a careful and authoritative protection the adjuncts that fashion decrees wealth purchases and taste adjusts for these conditions his spirit stipulated ere it surrendered they were here to the utmost fulfilled and now proud impassioned yet fearing he did homage to paulina as his sovereign as for her the smile of feeling rather than of conscious power slept soft in her eyes  they parted he passed me at speed hardly feeling the earth he skimmed and seeing nothing on either hand he looked very handsome mettle and purpose were roused in him fully  papa there is lucy cried a musical friendly voice lucy dear lucydo come here  i hastened to her she threw back her veil and stooped from her saddle to kiss me  i was coming to see you tomorrow said she but now tomorrow you will come and see me  she named the hour and i promised compliance  the morrows evening found me with hershe and i shut into her own room i had not seen her since that occasion when her claims were brought into comparison with those of ginevra fanshawe and had so signally prevailed she had much to tell me of her travels in the interval a most animated rapid speaker was she in such a têteàtête a most lively describer yet with her artless diction and clear soft voice she never seemed to speak too fast or to say too much my own attention i think would not soon have flagged but byandby she herself seemed to need some change of subject she hastened to wind up her narrative briefly yet why she terminated with so concise an abridgment did not immediately appear silence followeda restless silence not without symptoms of abstraction then turning to me in a diffident halfappealing voicelucy  well i am at your side  is my cousin ginevra still at madame becks  your cousin is still there you must be longing to see her  nonot much  you want to invite her to spend another evening  no i suppose she still talks about being married  not to any one you care for  but of course she still thinks of dr bretton she cannot have changed her mind on that point because it was so fixed two months ago  why you know it does not matter you saw the terms on which they stood  there was a little misunderstanding that evening certainly does she seem unhappy  not she to change the subject have you heard or seen nothing of or from graham during your absence  papa had letters from him once or twice about business i think he undertook the management of some affair which required attention while we were away dr bretton seems to respect papa and to have pleasure in obliging him  yes you met him yesterday on the boulevard you would be able to judge from his aspect that his friends need not be painfully anxious about his health  papa seems to have thought with you i could not help smiling he is not particularly observant you know because he is often thinking of other things than what pass before his eyes but he said as dr bretton rode away really it does a man good to see the spirit and energy of that boy he called dr bretton a boy i believe he almost thinks him so just as he thinks me a little girl he was not speaking to me but dropped that remark to himself lucy  again fell the appealing accent and at the same instant she left her chair and came and sat on the stool at my feet  i liked her it is not a declaration i have often made concerning my acquaintance in the course of this book the reader will bear with it for once intimate intercourse close inspection disclosed in paulina only what was delicate intelligent and sincere therefore my regard for her lay deep an admiration more superficial might have been more demonstrative mine however was quiet  what have you to ask of lucy said i be brave and speak out  but there was no courage in her eye as it met mine it fell and there was no coolness on her cheeknot a transient surfaceblush but a gathering inward excitement raised its tint and its temperature  lucy i do wish to know your thoughts of dr bretton do do give me your real opinion of his character his disposition  his character stands high and deservedly high  and his disposition tell me about his disposition she urged you know him well  i know him pretty well  you know his homeside you have seen him with his mother speak of him as a son  he is a finehearted son his mothers comfort and hope her pride and pleasure  she held my hand between hers and at each favourable word gave it a little caressing stroke  in what other way is he good lucy  dr bretton is benevolenthumanely disposed towards all his race dr bretton would have benignity for the lowest savage or the worst criminal  i heard some gentlemen some of papas friends who were talking about him say the same they say many of the poor patients at the hospitals who tremble before some pitiless and selfish surgeons welcome him  they are right i have witnessed as much he once took me over a hospital i saw how he was received your fathers friends are right  the softest gratitude animated her eye as she lifted it a moment she had yet more to say but seemed hesitating about time and place dusk was beginning to reign her parlour fire already glowed with twilight ruddiness but i thought she wished the room dimmer the hour later  how quiet and secluded we feel here i remarked to reassure her  do we yes it is a still evening and i shall not be called down to tea papa is dining out  still holding my hand she played with the fingers unconsciously dressed them now in her own rings and now circled them with a twine of her beautiful hair she patted the palm against her hot cheek and at last having cleared a voice that was naturally liquid as a larks she said  you must think it rather strange that i should talk so much about dr bretton ask so many questions take such an interest but  not at all strange perfectly natural you like him  and if i did said she with slight quickness is that a reason why i should talk i suppose you think me weak like my cousin ginevra  if i thought you one whit like madame ginevra i would not sit here waiting for your communications i would get up walk at my ease about the room and anticipate all you had to say by a round lecture go on  i mean to go on retorted she what else do you suppose i mean to do  and she looked and spokethe little polly of brettonpetulant sensitive  if said she emphatically if i liked dr john till i was fit to die for liking him that alone could not license me to be otherwise than dumbdumb as the gravedumb as you lucy snoweyou know itand you know you would despise me if i failed in selfcontrol and whined about some rickety liking that was all on my side  it is true i little respect women or girls who are loquacious either in boasting the triumphs or bemoaning the mortifications of feelings but as to you paulina speak for i earnestly wish to hear you tell me all it will give you pleasure or relief to tell i ask no more  do you care for me lucy  yes i do paulina  and i love you i had an odd content in being with you even when i was a little troublesome disobedient girl it was charming to me then to lavish on you my naughtiness and whims now you are acceptable to me and i like to talk with and trust you so listen lucy  and she settled herself resting against my armresting gently not with honest mistress fanshawes fatiguing and selfish weight  a few minutes since you asked whether we had not heard from graham during our absence and i said there were two letters for papa on business this was true but i did not tell you all  you evaded  i shuffled and equivocated you know however i am going to speak the truth now it is getting darker one can talk at ones ease papa often lets me open the letterbag and give him out the contents one morning about three weeks ago you dont know how surprised i was to find amongst a dozen letters for m de bassompierre a note addressed to miss de bassompierre i spied it at once amidst all the rest the handwriting was not strange it attracted me directly i was going to say papa here is another letter from dr bretton but the miss struck me mute i actually never received a letter from a gentleman before ought i to have shown it to papa and let him open it and read it first i could not for my life lucy i know so well papas ideas about me he forgets my age he thinks i am a mere schoolgirl he is not aware that other people see i am grown up as tall as i shall be so with a curious mixture of feelings some of them selfreproachful and some so fluttering and strong i cannot describe them i gave papa his twelve lettershis herd of possessionsand kept back my one my ewelamb it lay in my lap during breakfast looking up at me with an inexplicable meaning making me feel myself a thing doubleexistenta child to that dear papa but no more a child to myself after breakfast i carried my letter upstairs and having secured myself by turning the key in the door i began to study the outside of my treasure it was some minutes before i could get over the direction and penetrate the seal one does not take a strong place of this kind by instant stormone sits down awhile before it as beleaguers say grahams hand is like himself lucy and so is his sealall clear firm and roundedno slovenly splash of waxa full solid steady dropa distinct impress no pointed turns harshly pricking the optic nerve but a clean mellow pleasant manuscript that soothes you as you read it is like his facejust like the chiselling of his features do you know his autograph  i have seen it go on  the seal was too beautiful to be broken so i cut it round with my scissors on the point of reading the letter at last i once more drew back voluntarily it was too soon yet to drink that draughtthe sparkle in the cup was so beautifuli would watch it yet a minute then i remembered all at once that i had not said my prayers that morning having heard papa go down to breakfast a little earlier than usual i had been afraid of keeping him waiting and had hastened to join him as soon as dressed thinking no harm to put off prayers till afterwards some people would say i ought to have served god first and then man but i dont think heaven could be jealous of anything i might do for papa i believe i am superstitious a voice seemed now to say that another feeling than filial affection was in questionto urge me to pray before i dared to read what i so longed to readto deny myself yet a moment and remember first a great duty i have had these impulses ever since i can remember i put the letter down and said my prayers adding at the end a strong entreaty that whatever happened i might not be tempted or led to cause papa any sorrow and might never in caring for others neglect him the very thought of such a possibility so pierced my heart that it made me cry but still lucy i felt that in time papa would have to be taught the truth managed and induced to hear reason  i read the letter lucy life is said to be all disappointment i was not disappointed ere i read and while i read my heart did more than throbit trembled fastevery quiver seemed like the pant of an animal athirst laid down at a well and drinking and the well proved quite full gloriously clear it rose up munificently of its own impulse i saw the sun through its gush and not a mote lucy no moss no insect no atom in the thricerefined golden gurgle  life she went on is said to be full of pain to some i have read biographies where the wayfarer seemed to journey on from suffering to suffering where hope flew before him fast never alighting so near or lingering so long as to give his hand a chance of one realizing grasp i have read of those who sowed in tears and whose harvest so far from being reaped in joy perished by untimely blight or was borne off by sudden whirlwind and alas some of these met the winter with empty garners and died of utter want in the darkest and coldest of the year  was it their fault paulina that they of whom you speak thus died  not always their fault some of them were good endeavouring people i am not endeavouring nor actively good yet god has caused me to grow in sun due moisture and safe protection sheltered fostered taught by my dear father and nownowanother comes graham loves me  for some minutes we both paused on this climax  does your father know i inquired in a low voice  graham spoke with deep respect of papa but implied that he dared not approach that quarter as yet he must first prove his worth he added that he must have some light respecting myself and my own feelings ere he ventured to risk a step in the matter elsewhere  how did you reply  i replied briefly but i did not repulse him yet i almost trembled for fear of making the answer too cordial grahams tastes are so fastidious i wrote it three timeschastening and subduing the phrases at every rescript at last having confected it till it seemed to me to resemble a morsel of ice flavoured with ever so slight a zest of fruit or sugar i ventured to seal and despatch it  excellent paulina your instinct is fine you understand dr bretton  but how must i manage about papa there i am still in pain  do not manage at all wait now only maintain no further correspondence till your father knows all and gives his sanction  will he ever give it  time will show wait  dr bretton wrote one other letter deeply grateful for my calm brief note but i anticipated your advice by saying that while my sentiments continued the same i could not without my fathers knowledge write again  you acted as you ought to have done so dr bretton will feel it will increase his pride in you his love for you if either be capable of increase paulina that gentle hoarfrost of yours surrounding so much pure fine flame is a priceless privilege of nature  you see i feel grahams disposition said she i feel that no delicacy can be too exquisite for his treatment  it is perfectly proved that you comprehend him and thenwhatever dr brettons disposition were he one who expected to be more nearly metyou would still act truthfully openly tenderly with your father  lucy i trust i shall thus act always oh it will be pain to wake papa from his dream and tell him i am no more a little girl  be in no hurry to do so paulina leave the revelation to time and your kind fate i also have noticed the gentleness of her cares for you doubt not she will benignantly order the circumstances and fitly appoint the hour yes i have thought over your life just as you have yourself thought it over i have made comparisons like those to which you adverted we know not the future but the past has been propitious  as a child i feared for you nothing that has life was ever more susceptible than your nature in infancy under harshness or neglect neither your outward nor your inward self would have ripened to what they now are much pain much fear much struggle would have troubled the very lines of your features broken their regularity would have harassed your nerves into the fever of habitual irritation you would have lost in health and cheerfulness in grace and sweetness providence has protected and cultured you not only for your own sake but i believe for grahams his star too was fortunate to develop fully the best of his nature a companion like you was needed there you are ready you must be united i knew it the first day i saw you together at la terrasse in all that mutually concerns you and graham there seems to me promise plan harmony i do not think the sunny youth of either will prove the forerunner of stormy age i think it is deemed good that you two should live in peace and be happynot as angels but as few are happy amongst mortals some lives are thus blessed it is gods will it is the attesting trace and lingering evidence of eden other lives run from the first another course other travellers encounter weather fitful and gusty wild and variablebreast adverse winds are belated and overtaken by the early closing winter night neither can this happen without the sanction of god and i know that amidst his boundless works is somewhere stored the secret of this last fates justice i know that his treasures contain the proof as the promise of its mercy     chapter xxxiii  m paul keeps his promise   on the first of may we had allie the twenty boarders and the four teachersnotice to rise at five oclock of the morning to be dressed and ready by six to put ourselves under the command of m le professeur emanuel who was to head our march forth from villette for it was on this day he proposed to fulfil his promise of taking us to breakfast in the country i indeed as the reader may perhaps remember had not had the honour of an invitation when this excursion was first projectedrather the contrary but on my now making allusion to this fact and wishing to know how it was to be my ear received a pull of which i did not venture to challenge the repetition by raising further difficulties  je vous conseille de vous faire prier said m emanuel imperially menacing the other ear one napoleonic compliment however was enough so i made up my mind to be of the party  the morning broke calm as summer with singing of birds in the garden and a light dewmist that promised heat we all said it would be warm and we all felt pleasure in folding away heavy garments and in assuming the attire suiting a sunny season the clean fresh print dress and the light straw bonnet each made and trimmed as the french workwoman alone can make and trim so as to unite the utterly unpretending with the perfectly becoming was the rule of costume nobody flaunted in faded silk nobody wore a secondhand best article  at six the bell rang merrily and we poured down the staircase through the carré along the corridor into the vestibule there stood our professor wearing not his savagelooking paletôt and severe bonnetgrec but a younglooking belted blouse and cheerful straw hat he had for us all the kindest goodmorrow and most of us for him had a thanksgiving smile we were marshalled in order and soon started  the streets were yet quiet and the boulevards were fresh and peaceful as fields i believe we were very happy as we walked along this chief of ours had the secret of giving a certain impetus to happiness when he would just as in an opposite mood he could give a thrill to fear  he did not lead nor follow us but walked along the line giving a word to every one talking much to his favourites and not wholly neglecting even those he disliked it was rather my wish for a reason i had to keep slightly aloof from notice and being paired with ginevra fanshawe bearing on my arm the dear pressure of that angels not unsubstantial limbshe continued in excellent case and i can assure the reader it was no trifling business to bear the burden of her loveliness many a time in the course of that warm day i wished to goodness there had been less of the charming commodityhowever having her as i said i tried to make her useful by interposing her always between myself and m paul shifting my place according as i heard him coming up to the right hand or the left my private motive for this manoeuvre might be traced to the circumstance of the new print dress i wore being pink in coloura fact which under our present convoy made me feel something as i have felt when clad in a shawl with a red border necessitated to traverse a meadow where pastured a bull  for awhile the shifting system together with some modifications in the arrangement of a black silk scarf answered my purpose but byandby he found out that whether he came to this side or to that miss fanshawe was still his neighbour the course of acquaintance between ginevra and him had never run so smooth that his temper did not undergo a certain crisping process whenever he heard her english accent nothing in their dispositions fitted they jarred if they came in contact he held her empty and affected she deemed him bearish meddling repellent  at last when he had changed his place for about the sixth time finding still the same untoward result to the experimenthe thrust his head forward settled his eyes on mine and demanded with impatience questce que cest vous me jouez des tours  the words were hardly out of his mouth however ere with his customary quickness he seized the root of this proceeding in vain i shook out the long fringe and spread forth the broad end of my scarf ahh cest la robe rose broke from his lips affecting me very much like the sudden and irate low of some lord of the meadow  it is only cotton i alleged hurriedly and cheaper and washes better than any other colour  et mademoiselle lucy est coquette comme dix parisiennes he answered aton jamais vu une anglaise pareille regardez plutôt son chapeau et ses gants et ses brodequins these articles of dress were just like what my companions wore certainly not one whit smarterperhaps rather plainer than mostbut monsieur had now got hold of his text and i began to chafe under the expected sermon it went off however as mildly as the menace of a storm sometimes passes on a summer day i got but one flash of sheet lightning in the shape of a single bantering smile from his eyes and then he said courageà vrai dire je ne suis pas fâché peutêtre même suis je content quon sest fait si belle pour ma petite fête  mais ma robe nest pas belle monsieurelle nest que propre  jaime la propreté said he in short he was not to be dissatisfied the sun of good humour was to triumph on this auspicious morning it consumed scudding clouds ere they sullied its disk  and now we were in the country amongst what they called les bois et les petits sentiers these woods and lanes a month later would offer but a dusty and doubtful seclusion now however in their may greenness and morning repose they looked very pleasant  we reached a certain well planted round in the taste of labassecour with an orderly circle of limetrees here a halt was called on the green swell of ground surrounding this well we were ordered to be seated monsieur taking his place in our midst and suffering us to gather in a knot round him those who liked him more than they feared came close and these were chiefly little ones those who feared more than they liked kept somewhat aloof those in whom much affection had given even to what remained of fear a pleasurable zest observed the greatest distance  he began to tell us a story well could he narrate in such a diction as children love and learned men emulate a diction simple in its strength and strong in its simplicity there were beautiful touches in that little tale sweet glimpses of feeling and hues of description that while i listened sunk into my mind and since have never faded he tinted a twilight scenei hold it in memory stillsuch a picture i have never looked on from artists pencil  i have said that for myself i had no impromptu faculty and perhaps that very deficiency made me marvel the more at one who possessed it in perfection m emanuel was not a man to write books but i have heard him lavish with careless unconscious prodigality such mental wealth as books seldom boast his mind was indeed my library and whenever it was opened to me i entered bliss intellectually imperfect as i was i could read little there were few bound and printed volumes that did not weary mewhose perusal did not fag and blindbut his tomes of thought were collyrium to the spirits eyes over their contents inward sight grew clear and strong i used to think what a delight it would be for one who loved him better than he loved himself to gather and store up those handfuls of golddust so recklessly flung to heavens reckless winds  his story done he approached the little knoll where i and ginevra sat apart in his usual mode of demanding an opinion he had not reticence to wait till it was voluntarily offered he asked were you interested  according to my wonted undemonstrative fashion i simply answeredyes  was it good  very good  yet i could not write that down said he  why not monsieur  i hate the mechanical labour i hate to stoop and sit still i could dictate it though with pleasure to an amanuensis who suited me would mademoiselle lucy write for me if i asked her  monsieur would be too quick he would urge me and be angry if my pen did not keep pace with his lips  try some day let us see the monster i can make of myself under the circumstances but just now there is no question of dictation i mean to make you useful in another office do you see yonder farmhouse  surrounded with trees yes  there we are to breakfast and while the good fermière makes the café au lait in a caldron you and five others whom i shall select will spread with butter half a hundred rolls  having formed his troop into line once more he marched us straight on the farm which on seeing our force surrendered without capitulation  clean knives and plates and fresh butter being provided halfadozen of us chosen by our professor set to work under his directions to prepare for breakfast a huge basket of rolls with which the baker had been ordered to provision the farm in anticipation of our coming coffee and chocolate were already made hot cream and newlaid eggs were added to the treat and m emanuel always generous would have given a large order for jambon and confitures in addition but that some of us who presumed perhaps upon our influence insisted that it would be a most reckless waste of victual he railed at us for our pains terming us des ménagères avares but we let him talk and managed the economy of the repast our own way  with what a pleasant countenance he stood on the farmkitchen hearth looking on he was a man whom it made happy to see others happy he liked to have movement animation abundance and enjoyment round him we asked where he would sit he told us we knew well he was our slave and we his tyrants and that he dared not so much as choose a chair without our leave so we set him the farmers great chair at the head of the long table and put him into it  well might we like him with all his passions and hurricanes when he could be so benignant and docile at times as he was just now indeed at the worst it was only his nerves that were irritable not his temper that was radically bad soothe comprehend comfort him and he was a lamb he would not harm a fly only to the very stupid perverse or unsympathizing was he in the slightest degree dangerous  mindful always of his religion he made the youngest of the party say a little prayer before we began breakfast crossing himself as devotedly as a woman i had never seen him pray before or make that pious sign he did it so simply with such childlike faith i could not help smiling pleasurably as i watched his eyes met my smile he just stretched out his kind hand saying donnezmoi la main i see we worship the same god in the same spirit though by different rites  most of m emanuels brother professors were emancipated freethinkers infidels atheists and many of them men whose lives would not bear scrutiny he was more like a knight of old religious in his way and of spotless fame innocent childhood beautiful youth were safe at his side he had vivid passions keen feelings but his pure honour and his artless piety were the strong charm that kept the lions couchant  that breakfast was a merry meal and the merriment was not mere vacant clatter m paul originated led controlled and heightened it his social lively temper played unfettered and unclouded surrounded only by women and children there was nothing to cross and thwart him he had his own way and a pleasant way it was  the meal over the party were free to run and play in the meadows a few stayed to help the farmers wife to put away her earthenware m paul called me from among these to come out and sit near him under a treewhence he could view the troop gambolling over a wide pastureand read to him whilst he took his cigar he sat on a rustic bench and i at the treeroot while i read a pocketclassica corneillei did not like it but he did finding therein beauties i never could be brought to perceive he listened with a sweetness of calm the more impressive from the impetuosity of his general nature the deepest happiness filled his blue eye and smoothed his broad forehead i too was happyhappy with the bright day happier with his presence happiest with his kindness  he asked byandby if i would not rather run to my companions than sit there i said no i felt content to be where he was he asked whether if i were his sister i should always be content to stay with a brother such as he i said i believed i should and i felt it again he inquired whether if he were to leave villette and go far away i should be sorry and i dropped corneille and made no reply  petite soeur said he how long could you remember me if we were separated  that monsieur i can never tell because i do not know how long it will be before i shall cease to remember everything earthly  if i were to go beyond seas for twothreefive years should you welcome me on my return  monsieur how could i live in the interval  pourtant jai été pour vous bien dur bien exigeant  i hid my face with the book for it was covered with tears i asked him why he talked so and he said he would talk so no more and cheered me again with the kindest encouragement still the gentleness with which he treated me during the rest of the day went somehow to my heart it was too tender it was mournful i would rather he had been abrupt whimsical and irate as was his wont  when hot noon arrivedfor the day turned out as we had anticipated glowing as juneour shepherd collected his sheep from the pasture and proceeded to lead us all softly home but we had a whole league to walk thus far from villette was the farm where he had breakfasted the children especially were tired with their play the spirits of most flagged at the prospect of this midday walk over chaussées flinty glaring and dusty this state of things had been foreseen and provided for just beyond the boundary of the farm we met two spacious vehicles coming to fetch ussuch conveyances as are hired out purposely for the accommodation of schoolparties here with good management room was found for all and in another hour m paul made safe consignment of his charge at the rue fossette it had been a pleasant day it would have been perfect but for the breathing of melancholy which had dimmed its sunshine a moment  that tarnish was renewed the same evening  just about sunset i saw m emanuel come out of the frontdoor accompanied by madame beck they paced the centrealley for nearly an hour talking earnestly helooking grave yet restless shewearing an amazed expostulatory dissuasive air  i wondered what was under discussion and when madame beck reentered the house as it darkened leaving her kinsman paul yet lingering in the garden i said to myselfhe called me petite soeur this morning if he were really my brother how i should like to go to him just now and ask what it is that presses on his mind see how he leans against that tree with his arms crossed and his brow bent he wants consolation i know madame does not console she only remonstrates what now  starting from quiescence to action m paul came striding erect and quick down the garden the carré doors were yet open i thought he was probably going to water the orangetrees in the tubs after his occasional custom on reaching the court however he took an abrupt turn and made for the berceau and the firstclasse glass door there in that first classe i was thence i had been watching him but there i could not find courage to await his approach he had turned so suddenly he strode so fast he looked so strange the coward within me grew pale shrank andnot waiting to listen to reason and hearing the shrubs crush and the gravel crunch to his advanceshe was gone on the wings of panic  nor did i pause till i had taken sanctuary in the oratory now empty listening there with beating pulses and an unaccountable undefined apprehension i heard him pass through all the schoolrooms clashing the doors impatiently as he went i heard him invade the refectory which the lecture pieuse was now holding under hallowed constraint i heard him pronounce these wordsoù est mademoiselle lucie  and just as summoning my courage i was preparing to go down and do what after all i most wished to do in the worldviz meet himthe wiry voice of st pierre replied glibly and falsely elle est au lit and he passed with the stamp of vexation into the corridor there madame beck met captured chid convoyed to the streetdoor and finally dismissed him  as that streetdoor closed a sudden amazement at my own perverse proceeding struck like a blow upon me i felt from the first it was me he wantedme he was seekingand had not i wanted him too what then had carried me away what had rapt me beyond his reach he had something to tell he was going to tell me that something my ear strained its nerve to hear it and i had made the confidence impossible yearning to listen and console while i thought audience and solace beyond hopes reachno sooner did opportunity suddenly and fully arrive than i evaded it as i would have evaded the levelled shaft of mortality  well my insane inconsistency had its reward instead of the comfort the certain satisfaction i might have woncould i but have put choking panic down and stood firm two minuteshere was dead blank dark doubt and drear suspense  i took my wages to my pillow and passed the night counting them     chapter xxxiv  malevola   madame beck called me on thursday afternoon and asked whether i had any occupation to hinder me from going into town and executing some little commissions for her at the shops  being disengaged and placing myself at her service i was presently furnished with a list of the wools silks embroidering thread etcetera wanted in the pupils work and having equipped myself in a manner suiting the threatening aspect of a cloudy and sultry day i was just drawing the springbolt of the streetdoor in act to issue forth when madames voice again summoned me to the salleàmanger  pardon meess lucie cried she in the seeming haste of an impromptu thought i have just recollected one more errand for you if your goodnature will not deem itself overburdened  of course i confounded myself in asseverations to the contrary and madame running into the little salon brought thence a pretty basket filled with fine hothouse fruit rosy perfect and tempting reposing amongst the dark green waxlike leaves and pale yellow stars of i know not what exotic plant  there she said it is not heavy and will not shame your neat toilette as if it were a household servantlike detail do me the favour to leave this little basket at the house of madame walravens with my felicitations on her fête she lives down in the old town numéro 3 rue des mages i fear you will find the walk rather long but you have the whole afternoon before you and do not hurry if you are not back in time for dinner i will order a portion to be saved or goton with whom you are a favourite will have pleasure in tossing up some trifle for your especial benefit you shall not be forgotten ma bonne meess and oh please calling me back once more be sure to insist on seeing madame walravens herself and giving the basket into her own hands in order that there may be no mistake for she is rather a punctilious personage adieu au revoir  and at last i got away the shop commissions took some time to execute that choosing and matching of silks and wools being always a tedious business but at last i got through my list the patterns for the slippers the bellropes the cabas were selectedthe slides and tassels for the purses chosenthe whole tripotage in short was off my mind nothing but the fruit and the felicitations remained to be attended to  i rather liked the prospect of a long walk deep into the old and grim basseville and i liked it no worse because the evening sky over the city was settling into a mass of blackblue metal heated at the rim and inflaming slowly to a heavy red  i fear a high wind because storm demands that exertion of strength and use of action i always yield with pain but the sullen downfall the thick snowdescent or dark rush of rain ask only resignationthe quiet abandonment of garments and person to be drenched in return it sweeps a great capital clean before you it makes you a quiet path through broad grand streets it petrifies a living city as if by eastern enchantment it transforms a villette into a tadmor let then the rains fall and the floods descendonly i must first get rid of this basket of fruit  an unknown clock from an unknown tower jean baptistes voice was now too distant to be audible was tolling the third quarter past five when i reached that street and house whereof madame beck had given me the address it was no street at all it seemed rather to be part of a square it was quiet grass grew between the broad grey flags the houses were large and looked very oldbehind them rose the appearance of trees indicating gardens at the back antiquity brooded above this region business was banished thence rich men had once possessed this quarter and once grandeur had made her seat here that church whose dark halfruinous turrets overlooked the square was the venerable and formerly opulent shrine of the magi but wealth and greatness had long since stretched their gilded pinions and fled hence leaving these their ancient nests perhaps to house penury for a time or perhaps to stand cold and empty mouldering untenanted in the course of winters  as i crossed this deserted place on whose pavement drops almost as large as a fivefranc piece were now slowly darkening i saw in its whole expanse no symptom or evidence of life except what was given in the figure of an infirm old priest who went past bending and propped on a staffthe type of eld and decay  he had issued from the very house to which i was directed and when i paused before the door just closed after him and rang the bell he turned to look at me nor did he soon avert his gaze perhaps he thought me with my basket of summer fruit and my lack of the dignity age confers an incongruous figure in such a scene i know had a young ruddyfaced bonne opened the door to admit me i should have thought such a one little in harmony with her dwelling but when i found myself confronted by a very old woman wearing a very antique peasant costume a cap alike hideous and costly with long flaps of native lace a petticoat and jacket of cloth and sabots more like little boats than shoes it seemed all right and soothingly in character  the expression of her face was not quite so soothing as the cut of her costume anything more cantankerous i have seldom seen she would scarcely reply to my inquiry after madame walravens i believe she would have snatched the basket of fruit from my hand had not the old priest hobbling up checked her and himself lent an ear to the message with which i was charged  his apparent deafness rendered it a little difficult to make him fully understand that i must see madame walravens and consign the fruit into her own hands at last however he comprehended the fact that such were my orders and that duty enjoined their literal fulfilment addressing the aged bonne not in french but in the aboriginal tongue of labassecour he persuaded her at last to let me cross the inhospitable threshold and himself escorting me upstairs i was ushered into a sort of salon and there left  the room was large and had a fine old ceiling and almost churchlike windows of colouredglass but it was desolate and in the shadow of a coming storm looked strangely lowering withinopened a smaller room there however the blind of the single casement was closed through the deep gloom few details of furniture were apparent these few i amused myself by puzzling to make out and in particular i was attracted by the outline of a picture on the wall  byandby the picture seemed to give way to my bewilderment it shook it sunk it rolled back into nothing its vanishing left an opening arched leading into an arched passage with a mystic winding stair both passage and stair were of cold stone uncarpeted and unpainted down this donjon stair descended a tap tap like a stick soon there fell on the steps a shadow and last of all i was aware of a substance  yet was it actual substance this appearance approaching me this obstruction partially darkening the arch  it drew near and i saw it well i began to comprehend where i was well might this old square be named quarter of the magiwell might the three towers overlooking it own for godfathers three mystic sages of a dead and dark art hoar enchantment here prevailed a spell had opened for me elflandthat celllike room that vanishing picture that arch and passage and stair of stone were all parts of a fairy tale distincter even than these scenic details stood the chief figurecunegonde the sorceress malevola the evil fairy how was she  she might be three feet high but she had no shape her skinny hands rested upon each other and pressed the gold knob of a wandlike ivory staff her face was large set not upon her shoulders but before her breast she seemed to have no neck i should have said there were a hundred years in her features and more perhaps in her eyesher malign unfriendly eyes with thick grey brows above and livid lids all round how severely they viewed me with a sort of dull displeasure  this being wore a gown of brocade dyed bright blue fulltinted as the gentianella flower and covered with satin foliage in a large pattern over the gown a costly shawl gorgeously bordered and so large for her that its manycoloured fringe swept the floor but her chief points were her jewels she had long clear earrings blazing with a lustre which could not be borrowed or false she had rings on her skeleton hands with thick gold hoops and stonespurple green and bloodred hunchbacked dwarfish and doting she was adorned like a barbarian queen  que me voulezvous said she hoarsely with the voice rather of male than of female old age and indeed a silver beard bristled her chin  i delivered my basket and my message  is that all she demanded  it is all said i  truly it was well worth while she answered return to madame beck and tell her i can buy fruit when i want it et quant à ses félicitations je men moque and this courteous dame turned her back  just as she turned a peal of thunder broke and a flash of lightning blazed broad over salon and boudoir the tale of magic seemed to proceed with due accompaniment of the elements the wanderer decoyed into the enchanted castle heard rising outside the spellwakened tempest  what in all this was i to think of madame beck she owned strange acquaintance she offered messages and gifts at an unique shrine and inauspicious seemed the bearing of the uncouth thing she worshipped there went that sullen sidonia tottering and trembling like palsy incarnate tapping her ivory staff on the mosaic parquet and muttering venomously as she vanished  down washed the rain deep lowered the welkin the clouds ruddy a while ago had now through all their blackness turned deadly pale as if in terror notwithstanding my late boast about not fearing a shower i hardly liked to go out under this waterspout then the gleams of lightning were very fierce the thunder crashed very near this storm had gathered immediately above villette it seemed to have burst at the zenith it rushed down prone the forked slant bolts pierced athwart vertical torrents red zigzags interlaced a descent blanched as white metal and all broke from a sky heavily black in its swollen abundance  leaving madame walravens inhospitable salon i betook myself to her cold staircase there was a seat on the landingthere i waited somebody came gliding along the gallery just above it was the old priest  indeed mademoiselle shall not sit there said he it would displeasure our benefactor if he knew a stranger was so treated in this house  and he begged me so earnestly to return to the salon that without discourtesy i could not but comply the smaller room was better furnished and more habitable than the larger thither he introduced me partially withdrawing the blind he disclosed what seemed more like an oratory than a boudoir a very solemn little chamber looking as if it were a place rather dedicated to relics and remembrance than designed for present use and comfort  the good father sat down as if to keep me company but instead of conversing he took out a book fastened on the page his eyes and employed his lips in whisperingwhat sounded like a prayer or litany a yellow electric light from the sky gilded his bald head his figure remained in shadedeep and purple he sat still as sculpture he seemed to forget me for his prayers he only looked up when a fiercer bolt or a harsher closer rattle told of nearing danger even then it was not in fear but in seeming awe he raised his eyes i too was awestruck being however under no pressure of slavish terror my thoughts and observations were free  to speak truth i was beginning to fancy that the old priest resembled that père silas before whom i had kneeled in the church of the béguinage the idea was vague for i had seen my confessor only in dusk and in profile yet still i seemed to trace a likeness i thought also i recognized the voice while i watched him he betrayed by one lifted look that he felt my scrutiny i turned to note the room that too had its half mystic interest  beside a cross of curiously carved old ivory yellow with time and sloped above a darkred priedieu furnished duly with rich missal and ebon rosaryhung the picture whose dim outline had drawn my eyes beforethe picture which moved fell away with the wall and let in phantoms imperfectly seen i had taken it for a madonna revealed by clearer light it proved to be a womans portrait in a nuns dress the face though not beautiful was pleasing pale young and shaded with the dejection of grief or ill health i say again it was not beautiful it was not even intellectual its very amiability was the amiability of a weak frame inactive passions acquiescent habits yet i looked long at that picture and could not choose but look  the old priest who at first had seemed to me so deaf and infirm must yet have retained his faculties in tolerable preservation absorbed in his book as he appeared without once lifting his head or as far as i knew turning his eyes he perceived the point towards which my attention was drawn and in a slow distinct voice dropped concerning it these four observations  she was much beloved  she gave herself to god  she died young  she is still remembered still wept  by that aged lady madame walravens i inquired fancying that i had discovered in the incurable grief of bereavement a key to that same aged ladys desperate illhumour  the father shook his head with half a smile  no no said he a granddames affection for her childrens children may be great and her sorrow for their loss lively but it is only the affianced lover to whom fate faith and death have trebly denied the bliss of union who mourns what he has lost as justine marie is still mourned  i thought the father rather wished to be questioned and therefore i inquired who had lost and who still mourned justine marie i got in reply quite a little romantic narrative told not unimpressively with the accompaniment of the now subsiding storm i am bound to say it might have been made much more truly impressive if there had been less french rousseaulike sentimentalizing and wiredrawing and rather more healthful carelessness of effect but the worthy father was obviously a frenchman born and bred i became more and more persuaded of his resemblance to my confessorhe was a true son of rome when he did lift his eyes he looked at me out of their corners with more and sharper subtlety than one would have thought could survive the wear and tear of seventy years yet i believe he was a good old man  the hero of his tale was some former pupil of his whom he now called his benefactor and who it appears had loved this pale justine marie the daughter of rich parents at a time when his own worldly prospects were such as to justify his aspiring to a welldowered hand the pupils fatheronce a rich bankerhad failed died and left behind him only debts and destitution the son was then forbidden to think of marie especially that old witch of a granddame i had seen madame walravens opposed the match with all the violence of a temper which deformity made sometimes demoniac the mild marie had neither the treachery to be false nor the force to be quite staunch to her lover she gave up her first suitor but refusing to accept a second with a heavier purse withdrew to a convent and there died in her noviciate  lasting anguish it seems had taken possession of the faithful heart which worshipped her and the truth of that love and grief had been shown in a manner which touched even me as i listened  some years after justine maries death ruin had come on her house too her father by nominal calling a jeweller but who also dealt a good deal on the bourse had been concerned in some financial transactions which entailed exposure and ruinous fines he died of grief for the loss and shame for the infamy his old hunchbacked mother and his bereaved wife were left penniless and might have died too of want but their lost daughters oncedespised yet most truehearted suitor hearing of the condition of these ladies came with singular devotedness to the rescue he took on their insolent pride the revenge of the purest charityhousing caring for befriending them so as no son could have done it more tenderly and efficiently the motheron the whole a good womandied blessing him the strange godless loveless misanthrope grandmother lived still entirely supported by this selfsacrificing man her who had been the bane of his life blighting his hope and awarding him for love and domestic happiness long mourning and cheerless solitude he treated with the respect a good son might offer a kind mother he had brought her to this house and continued the priest while genuine tears rose to his eyes here too he shelters me his old tutor and agnes a superannuated servant of his fathers family to our sustenance and to other charities i know he devotes threeparts of his income keeping only the fourth to provide himself with bread and the most modest accommodations by this arrangement he has rendered it impossible to himself ever to marry he has given himself to god and to his angelbride as much as if he were a priest like me  the father had wiped away his tears before he uttered these last words and in pronouncing them he for one instant raised his eyes to mine i caught this glance despite its veiled character the momentary gleam shot a meaning which struck me  these romanists are strange beings such a one among themwhom you know no more than the last inca of peru or the first emperor of chinaknows you and all your concerns and has his reasons for saying to you so and so when you simply thought the communication sprang impromptu from the instants impulse his plan in bringing it about that you shall come on such a day to such a place under such and such circumstances when the whole arrangement seems to your crude apprehension the ordinance of chance or the sequel of exigency madame becks suddenlyrecollected message and present my artless embassy to the place of the magi the old priest accidentally descending the steps and crossing the square his interposition on my behalf with the bonne who would have sent me away his reappearance on the staircase my introduction to this room the portrait the narrative so affably volunteeredall these little incidents taken as they fell out seemed each independent of its successor a handful of loose beads but threaded through by that quickshot and crafty glance of a jesuiteye they dropped pendent in a long string like that rosary on the priedieu where lay the link of junction where the little clasp of this monastic necklace i saw or felt union but could not yet find the spot or detect the means of connection  perhaps the musingfit into which i had by this time fallen appeared somewhat suspicious in its abstraction he gently interrupted mademoiselle said he i trust you have not far to go through these inundated streets  more than half a league  you live  in the rue fossette  not with animation not at the pensionnat of madame beck  the same  donc clapping his hands donc vous devez connaître mon noble élève mon paul  monsieur paul emanuel professor of literature  he and none other  a brief silence fell the spring of junction seemed suddenly to have become palpable i felt it yield to pressure  was it of m paul you have been speaking i presently inquired was he your pupil and the benefactor of madame walravens  yes and of agnes the old servant and moreover with a certain emphasis he was and is the lover true constant and eternal of that saint in heavenjustine marie  and who father are you i continued and though i accentuated the question its utterance was well nigh superfluous i was ere this quite prepared for the answer which actually came  i daughter am père silas that unworthy son of holy church whom you once honoured with a noble and touching confidence showing me the core of a heart and the inner shrine of a mind whereof in solemn truth i coveted the direction in behalf of the only true faith nor have i for a day lost sight of you nor for an hour failed to take in you a rooted interest passed under the discipline of rome moulded by her high training inoculated with her salutary doctrines inspired by the zeal she alone givesi realize what then might be your spiritual rank your practical value and i envy heresy her prey  this struck me as a special state of thingsi halfrealized myself in that condition also passed under discipline moulded trained inoculated and so on not so thought i but i restrained deprecation and sat quietly enough  i suppose m paul does not live here i resumed pursuing a theme which i thought more to the purpose than any wild renegade dreams  no he only comes occasionally to worship his beloved saint to make his confession to me and to pay his respects to her he calls his mother his own lodging consists but of two rooms he has no servant and yet he will not suffer madame walravens to dispose of those splendid jewels with which you see her adorned and in which she takes a puerile pride as the ornaments of her youth and the last relics of her son the jewellers wealth  how often murmured i to myself has this man this m emanuel seemed to me to lack magnanimity in trifles yet how great he is in great things  i own i did not reckon amongst the proofs of his greatness either the act of confession or the saintworship  how long is it since that lady died i inquired looking at justine marie  twenty years she was somewhat older than m emanuel he was then very young for he is not much beyond forty  does he yet weep her  his heart will weep her always the essence of emanuels nature isconstancy  this was said with marked emphasis  and now the sun broke out pallid and waterish the rain yet fell but there was no more tempest that hot firmament had cloven and poured out its lightnings a longer delay would scarce leave daylight for my return so i rose thanked the father for his hospitality and his tale was benignantly answered by a pax vobiscum which i made kindly welcome because it seemed uttered with a true benevolence but i liked less the mystic phrase accompanying it  daughter you shall be what you shall be an oracle that made me shrug my shoulders as soon as i had got outside the door few of us know what we are to come to certainly but for all that had happened yet i had good hopes of living and dying a soberminded protestant there was a hollowness within and a flourish around holy church which tempted me but moderately i went on my way pondering many things whatever romanism may be there are good romanists this man emanuel seemed of the best touched with superstition influenced by priestcraft yet wondrous for fond faith for pious devotion for sacrifice of self for charity unbounded it remained to see how rome by her agents handled such qualities whether she cherished them for their own sake and for gods or put them out to usury and made booty of the interest  by the time i reached home it was sundown goton had kindly saved me a portion of dinner which indeed i needed she called me into the little cabinet to partake of it and there madame beck soon made her appearance bringing me a glass of wine  well began she chuckling and what sort of a reception did madame walravens give you elle est drôle nestce pas  i told her what had passed delivering verbatim the courteous message with which i had been charged  oh la singulière petite bossue laughed she et figurezvous quelle me déteste parcequelle me croit amoureuse de mon cousin paul ce petit dévot qui nose pas bouger à moins que son confesseur ne lui donne la permission au reste she went on if he wanted to marry ever so muchsoit moi soit une autrehe could not do it he has too large a family already on his hands mère walravens père silas dame agnes and a whole troop of nameless paupers there never was a man like him for laying on himself burdens greater than he can bear voluntarily incurring needless responsibilities besides he harbours a romantic idea about some palefaced marie justinepersonnage assez niaise à ce que je pense such was madames irreverent remark who has been an angel in heaven or elsewhere this score of years and to whom he means to go free from all earthly ties pure comme un lis à ce quil dit oh you would laugh could you but know half m emanuels crotchets and eccentricities but i hinder you from taking refreshment ma bonne meess which you must need eat your supper drink your wine oubliez les anges les bossues et surtout les professeurset bon soir     chapter xxxv  fraternity   oubliez les professeurs so said madame beck madame beck was a wise woman but she should not have uttered those words to do so was a mistake that night she should have left me calmnot excited indifferent not interested isolated in my own estimation and that of othersnot connected even in idea with this second person whom i was to forget  forget him ah they took a sage plan to make me forget himthe wiseheads they showed me how good he was they made of my dear little man a stainless little hero and then they had prated about his manner of loving what means had i before this day of being certain whether he could love at all or not  i had known him jealous suspicious i had seen about him certain tendernesses fitfulnessesa softness which came like a warm air and a ruth which passed like early dew dried in the heat of his irritabilities this was all i had seen and they père silas and modeste maria beck that these two wrought in concert i could not doubt opened up the adytum of his heartshowed me one grand love the child of this southern natures youth born so strong and perfect that it had laughed at death himself despised his mean rape of matter clung to immortal spirit and in victory and faith had watched beside a tomb twenty years  this had been donenot idly this was not a mere hollow indulgence of sentiment he had proven his fidelity by the consecration of his best energies to an unselfish purpose and attested it by limitless personal sacrifices for those once dear to her he prizedhe had laid down vengeance and taken up a cross  now as for justine marie i knew what she was as well as if i had seen her i knew she was well enough there were girls like her in madame becks schoolphlegmaticspale slow inert but kindnatured neutral of evil undistinguished for good  if she wore angels wings i knew whose poetfancy conferred them if her forehead shone luminous with the reflex of a halo i knew in the fire of whose irids that circlet of holy flame had generation  was i then to be frightened by justine marie was the picture of a pale dead nun to rise an eternal barrier and what of the charities which absorbed his worldly goods what of his heart sworn to virginity  madame beckpère silasyou should not have suggested these questions they were at once the deepest puzzle the strongest obstruction and the keenest stimulus i had ever felt for a week of nights and days i fell asleepi dreamt and i woke upon these two questions in the whole world there was no answer to them except where one dark little man stood sat walked lectured under the headpiece of a bandit bonnetgrec and within the girth of a sorry paletôt much beinked and no little adust  after that visit to the rue des mages i did want to see him again i felt as ifknowing what i now knewhis countenance would offer a page more lucid more interesting than ever i felt a longing to trace in it the imprint of that primitive devotedness the signs of that halfknightly halfsaintly chivalry which the priests narrative imputed to his nature he had become my christian hero under that character i wanted to view him  nor was opportunity slow to favour my new impressions underwent her test the next day yes i was granted an interview with my christian heroan interview not very heroic or sentimental or biblical but lively enough in its way  about three oclock of the afternoon the peace of the first classesafely established as it seemed under the serene sway of madame beck who in propriâ personâ was giving one of her orderly and useful lessonsthis peace i say suffered a sudden fracture by the wild inburst of a paletôt  nobody at the moment was quieter than myself eased of responsibility by madame becks presence soothed by her uniform tones pleased and edified with her clear exposition of the subject in hand for she taught well i sat bent over my desk drawingthat is copying an elaborate line engraving tediously working up my copy to the finish of the original for that was my practical notion of art and strange to say i took extreme pleasure in the labour and could even produce curiously finical chinese facsimiles of steel or mezzotint platesthings about as valuable as so many achievements in worstedwork but i thought pretty well of them in those days  what was the matter my drawing my pencils my precious copy gathered into one crushedup handful perished from before my sight i myself appeared to be shaken or emptied out of my chair as a solitary and withered nutmeg might be emptied out of a spicebox by an excited cook that chair and my desk seized by the wild paletôt one under each sleeve were borne afar in a second i followed the furniture in two minutes they and i were fixed in the centre of the grand sallea vast adjoining room seldom used save for dancing and choral singinglessonsfixed with an emphasis which seemed to prohibit the remotest hope of our ever being permitted to stir thence again  having partially collected my scared wits i found myself in the presence of two men gentlemen i suppose i should sayone dark the other lightone having a stiff halfmilitary air and wearing a braided surtout the other partaking in garb and bearing more of the careless aspect of the student or artist class both flourishing in full magnificence of moustaches whiskers and imperial m emanuel stood a little apart from these his countenance and eyes expressed strong choler he held forth his hand with his tribune gesture  mademoiselle said he your business is to prove to these gentlemen that i am no liar you will answer to the best of your ability such questions as they shall put you will also write on such theme as they shall select in their eyes it appears i hold the position of an unprincipled impostor i write essays and with deliberate forgery sign to them my pupils names and boast of them as their work you will disprove this charge  grand ciel here was the showtrial so long evaded come on me like a thunderclap these two fine braided mustachioed sneering personages were none other than dandy professors of the collegemessieurs boissec and rochemortea pair of coldblooded fops and pedants sceptics and scoffers it seems that m paul had been rashly exhibiting something i had writtensomething he had never once praised or even mentioned in my hearing and which i deemed forgotten the essay was not remarkable at all it only seemed remarkable compared with the average productions of foreign schoolgirls in an english establishment it would have passed scarce noticed messieurs boissec and rochemorte had thought proper to question its genuineness and insinuate a cheat i was now to bear my testimony to the truth and to be put to the torture of their examination  a memorable scene ensued  they began with classics a dead blank they went on to french history i hardly knew mérovée from pharamond they tried me in various ologies and still only got a shake of the head and an unchanging je nen sais rien  after an expressive pause they proceeded to matters of general information broaching one or two subjects which i knew pretty well and on which i had often reflected m emanuel who had hitherto stood looking on dark as the wintersolstice brightened up somewhat he thought i should now show myself at least no fool  he learned his error though answers to the questions surged up fast my mind filling like a rising well ideas were there but not words i either could not or would not speaki am not sure which partly i think my nerves had got wrong and partly my humour was crossed  i heard one of my examinershe of the braided surtoutwhisper to his coprofessor estelle donc idiote  yes i thought an idiot she is and always will be for such as you  but i sufferedsuffered cruelly i saw the damps gather on m pauls brow and his eye spoke a passionate yet sad reproach he would not believe in my total lack of popular cleverness he thought i could be prompt if i would  at last to relieve him the professors and myself i stammered out  gentlemen you had better let me go you will get no good of me as you say i am an idiot  i wish i could have spoken with calm and dignity or i wish my sense had sufficed to make me hold my tongue that traitor tongue tripped faltered beholding the judges cast on m emanuel a hard look of triumph and hearing the distressed tremor of my own voice out i burst in a fit of choking tears the emotion was far more of anger than grief had i been a man and strong i could have challenged that pair on the spotbut it was emotion and i would rather have been scourged than betrayed it  the incapables could they not see at once the crude hand of a novice in that composition they called a forgery the subject was classical when m paul dictated the trait on which the essay was to turn i heard it for the first time the matter was new to me and i had no material for its treatment but i got books read up the facts laboriously constructed a skeleton out of the dry bones of the real and then clothed them and tried to breathe into them life and in this last aim i had pleasure with me it was a difficult and anxious time till my facts were found selected and properly jointed nor could i rest from research and effort till i was satisfied of correct anatomy the strength of my inward repugnance to the idea of flaw or falsity sometimes enabled me to shun egregious blunders but the knowledge was not there in my head ready and mellow it had not been sown in spring grown in summer harvested in autumn and garnered through winter whatever i wanted i must go out and gather fresh glean of wild herbs my lapful and shred them green into the pot messieurs boissec and rochemorte did not perceive this they mistook my work for the work of a ripe scholar  they would not yet let me go i must sit down and write before them as i dipped my pen in the ink with a shaking hand and surveyed the white paper with eyes halfblinded and overflowing one of my judges began mincingly to apologize for the pain he caused  nous agissons dans lintérêt de la vérité nous ne voulons pas vous blesser said he  scorn gave me nerve i only answered  dictate monsieur  rochemorte named this theme human justice  human justice what was i to make of it blank cold abstraction unsuggestive to me of one inspiring idea and there stood m emanuel sad as saul and stern as joab and there triumphed his accusers  at these two i looked i was gathering my courage to tell them that i would neither write nor speak another word for their satisfaction that their theme did not suit nor their presence inspire me and that notwithstanding whoever threw the shadow of a doubt on m emanuels honour outraged that truth of which they had announced themselves thechampions i meant to utter all this i say when suddenly a light darted on memory  those two faces looking out of the forest of long hair moustache and whiskerthose two cold yet bold trustless yet presumptuous visageswere the same faces the very same that projected in full gaslight from behind the pillars of a portico had half frightened me to death on the night of my desolate arrival in villette these i felt morally certain were the very heroes who had driven a friendless foreigner beyond her reckoning and her strength chased her breathless over a whole quarter of the town  pious mentors thought i pure guides for youth if human justice were what she ought to be you two would scarce hold your present post or enjoy your present credit  an idea once seized i fell to work human justice rushed before me in novel guise a red random beldame with arms akimbo i saw her in her house the den of confusion servants called to her for orders or help which she did not give beggars stood at her door waiting and starving unnoticed a swarm of children sick and quarrelsome crawled round her feet and yelled in her ears appeals for notice sympathy cure redress the honest woman cared for none of these things she had a warm seat of her own by the fire she had her own solace in a short black pipe and a bottle of mrs sweenys soothing syrup she smoked and she sipped and she enjoyed her paradise and whenever a cry of the suffering souls about her pierced her ears too keenlymy jolly dame seized the poker or the hearthbrush if the offender was weak wronged and sickly she effectually settled him if he was strong lively and violent she only menaced then plunged her hand in her deep pouch and flung a liberal shower of sugarplums  such was the sketch of human justice scratched hurriedly on paper and placed at the service of messrs boissec and rochemorte m emanuel read it over my shoulder waiting no comment i curtsied to the trio and withdrew  after school that day m paul and i again met of course the meeting did not at first run smooth there was a crow to pluck with him that forced examination could not be immediately digested a crabbed dialogue terminated in my being called une petite moqueuse et sanscoeur and in monsieurs temporary departure  not wishing him to go quite away only desiring he should feel that such a transport as he had that day given way to could not be indulged with perfect impunity i was not sorry to see him soon after gardening in the berceau he approached the glass door i drew near also we spoke of some flowers growing round it byandby monsieur laid down his spade byandby he recommenced conversation passed to other subjects and at last touched a point of interest  conscious that his proceeding of that day was specially open to a charge of extravagance m paul half apologized he half regretted too the fitfulness of his moods at all times yet he hinted that some allowance ought to be made for him but said he i can hardly expect it at your hands miss lucy you know neither me nor my position nor my history  his history i took up the word at once i pursued the idea  no monsieur i rejoined of course as you say i know neither your history nor your position nor your sacrifices nor any of your sorrows or trials or affections or fidelities oh no i know nothing about you you are for me altogether a stranger  hein he murmured arching his brows in surprise  you know monsieur i only see you in classestern dogmatic hasty imperious i only hear of you in town as active and wilful quick to originate hasty to lead but slow to persuade and hard to bend a man like you without ties can have no attachments without dependants no duties all we with whom you come in contact are machines which you thrust here and there inconsiderate of their feelings you seek your recreations in public by the light of the evening chandelier this school and yonder college are your workshops where you fabricate the ware called pupils i dont so much as know where you live it is natural to take it for granted that you have no home and need none  i am judged said he your opinion of me is just what i thought it was for you i am neither a man nor a christian you see me void of affection and religion unattached by friend or family unpiloted by principle or faith it is well mademoiselle such is our reward in this life  you are a philosopher monsieur a cynic philosopher and i looked at his paletôt of which he straightway brushed the dim sleeve with his hand despising the foibles of humanityabove its luxuriesindependent of its comforts  et vous mademoiselle vous êtes proprette et douillette et affreusement insensible pardessus le marché  but in short monsieur now i think of it you must live somewhere do tell me where and what establishment of servants do you keep  with a fearful projection of the underlip implying an impetus of scorn the most decided he broke out  je vis dans un trou i inhabit a den missa cavern where you would not put your dainty nose once with base shame of speaking the whole truth i talked about my study in that college know now that this study is my whole abode my chamber is there and my drawingroom as for my establishment of servants mimicking my voice they number ten les voilà  and he grimly spread close under my eyes his ten fingers  i black my boots pursued he savagely i brush my paletôt  no monsieur it is too plain you never do that was my parenthesis  je fais mon lit et mon ménage i seek my dinner in a restaurant my supper takes care of itself i pass days laborious and loveless nights long and lonely i am ferocious and bearded and monkish and nothing now living in this world loves me except some old hearts worn like my own and some few beings impoverished suffering poor in purse and in spirit whom the kingdoms of this world own not but to whom a will and testament not to be disputed has bequeathed the kingdom of heaven  ah monsieur but i know  what do you know many things i verily believe yet not me lucy  i know that you have a pleasant old house in a pleasant old square of the bassevillewhy dont you go and live there  hein muttered he again  i liked it much monsieur with the steps ascending to the door the grey flags in front the nodding trees behindreal trees not shrubstrees dark high and of old growth and the boudoiroratoireyou should make that room your study it is so quiet and solemn  he eyed me closely he halfsmiled halfcoloured where did you pick up all that who told you he asked  nobody told me did i dream it monsieur do you think  can i enter into your visions can i guess a womans waking thoughts much less her sleeping fantasies  if i dreamt it i saw in my dream human beings as well as a house i saw a priest old bent and grey and a domesticold too and picturesque and a lady splendid but strange her head would scarce reach to my elbowher magnificence might ransom a duke she wore a gown bright as lapislazulia shawl worth a thousand francs she was decked with ornaments so brilliant i never saw any with such a beautiful sparkle but her figure looked as if it had been broken in two and bent double she seemed also to have outlived the common years of humanity and to have attained those which are only labour and sorrow she was become morosealmost malevolent yet somebody it appears cared for her in her infirmitiessomebody forgave her trespasses hoping to have his trespasses forgiven they lived together these three peoplethe mistress the chaplain the servantall old all feeble all sheltered under one kind wing  he covered with his hand the upper part of his face but did not conceal his mouth where i saw hovering an expression i liked  i see you have entered into my secrets said he but how was it done  so i told him howthe commission on which i had been sent the storm which had detained me the abruptness of the lady the kindness of the priest  as i sat waiting for the rain to cease père silas whiled away the time with a story i said  a story what story père silas is no romancist  shall i tell monsieur the tale  yes begin at the beginning let me hear some of miss lucys frenchher best or her worsti dont much care which let us have a good poignée of barbarisms and a bounteous dose of the insular accent  monsieur is not going to be gratified by a tale of ambitious proportions and the spectacle of the narrator sticking fast in the midst but i will tell him the titlethe priests pupil  bah said he the swarthy flush again dyeing his dark cheek the good old father could not have chosen a worse subject it is his weak point but what of the priests pupil  oh many things  you may as well define what things i mean to know  there was the pupils youth the pupils manhoodhis avarice his ingratitude his implacability his inconstancy such a bad pupil monsieurso thankless coldhearted unchivalrous unforgiving  et puis said he taking a cigar  et puis i pursued he underwent calamities which one did not pitybore them in a spirit one did not admireendured wrongs for which one felt no sympathy finally took the unchristian revenge of heaping coals of fire on his adversarys head  you have not told me all said he  nearly all i think i have indicated the heads of père silass chapters  you have forgotten onethat which touched on the pupils lack of affectionon his hard cold monkish heart  true i remember now père silas did say that his vocation was almost that of a priestthat his life was considered consecrated  by what bonds or duties  by the ties of the past and the charities of the present  you have then the whole situation  i have now told monsieur all that was told me  some meditative minutes passed  now mademoiselle lucy look at me and with that truth which i believe you never knowingly violate answer me one question raise your eyes rest them on mine have no hesitation fear not to trust mei am a man to be trusted  i raised my eyes  knowing me thoroughly nowall my antecedents all my responsibilitieshaving long known my faults can you and i still be friends  if monsieur wants a friend in me i shall be glad to have a friend in him  but a close friend i meanintimate and realkindred in all but blood will miss lucy be the sister of a very poor fettered burdened encumbered man  i could not answer him in words yet i suppose i did answer him he took my hand which found comfort in the shelter of his his friendship was not a doubtful wavering benefita cold distant hopea sentiment so brittle as not to bear the weight of a finger i at once felt or thought i felt its support like that of some rock  when i talk of friendship i mean true friendship he repeated emphatically and i could hardly believe that words so earnest had blessed my ear i hardly could credit the reality of that kind anxious look he gave if he really wished for my confidence and regard and really would give me hiswhy it seemed to me that life could offer nothing more or better in that case i was become strong and rich in a moment i was made substantially happy to ascertain the fact to fix and seal it i asked  is monsieur quite serious does he really think he needs me and can take an interest in me as a sister  surely surely said he a lonely man like me who has no sister must be but too glad to find in some womans heart a sisters pure affection  and dare i rely on monsieurs regard dare i speak to him when i am so inclined  my little sister must make her own experiments said he i will give no promises she must tease and try her wayward brother till she has drilled him into what she wishes after all he is no inductile material in some hands  while he spoke the tone of his voice the light of his now affectionate eye gave me such a pleasure as certainly i had never felt i envied no girl her lover no bride her bridegroom no wife her husband i was content with this my voluntary selfoffering friend if he would but prove reliable and he looked reliable what beyond his friendship could i ever covet but if all melted like a dream as once before had happened  questce donc what is it said he as this thought threw its weight on my heart its shadow on my countenance i told him and after a moments pause and a thoughtful smile he showed me how an equal fearlest i should weary of him a man of moods so difficult and fitfulhad haunted his mind for more than one day or one month  on hearing this a quiet courage cheered me i ventured a word of reassurance that word was not only tolerated its repetition was courted i grew quite happystrangely happyin making him secure content tranquil yesterday i could not have believed that earth held or life afforded moments like the few i was now passing countless times it had been my lot to watch apprehended sorrow close darkly in but to see unhopedfor happiness take form find place and grow more real as the seconds sped was indeed a new experience  lucy said m paul speaking low and still holding my hand did you see a picture in the boudoir of the old house  i did a picture painted on a panel  the portrait of a nun  yes  you heard her history  yes  you remember what we saw that night in the berceau  i shall never forget it  you did not connect the two ideas that would be folly  i thought of the apparition when i saw the portrait said i which was true enough  you did not nor will you fancy pursued he that a saint in heaven perturbs herself with rivalries of earth protestants are rarely superstitious these morbid fancies will not beset you  i know not what to think of this matter but i believe a perfectly natural solution of this seeming mystery will one day be arrived at  doubtless doubtless besides no goodliving womanmuch less a pure happy spiritwould trouble amity like ours nestil pas vrai  ere i could answer fifine beck burst in rosy and abrupt calling out that i was wanted her mother was going into town to call on some english family who had applied for a prospectus my services were needed as interpreter the interruption was not unseasonable sufficient for the day is always the evil for this hour its good sufficed yet i should have liked to ask m paul whether the morbid fancies against which he warned me wrought in his own brain     chapter xxxvi  the apple of discord   besides fifine becks mother another power had a word to say to m paul and me before that covenant of friendship could be ratified we were under the surveillance of a sleepless eye rome watched jealously her son through that mystic lattice at which i had knelt once and to which m emanuel drew nigh month by monththe sliding panel of the confessional  why were you so glad to be friends with m paul asks the reader had he not long been a friend to you had he not given proof on proof of a certain partiality in his feelings  yes he had but still i liked to hear him say so earnestlythat he was my close true friend i liked his modest doubts his tender deferencethat trust which longed to rest and was grateful when taught how he had called me sister it was well yes he might call me what he pleased so long as he confided in me i was willing to be his sister on condition that he did not invite me to fill that relation to some future wife of his and tacitly vowed as he was to celibacy of this dilemma there seemed little danger  through most of the succeeding night i pondered that evenings interview i wanted much the morning to break and then listened for the bell to ring and after rising and dressing i deemed prayers and breakfast slow and all the hours lingering till that arrived at last which brought me the lesson of literature my wish was to get a more thorough comprehension of this fraternal alliance to note with how much of the brother he would demean himself when we met again to prove how much of the sister was in my own feelings to discover whether i could summon a sisters courage and he a brothers frankness  he came life is so constructed that the event does not cannot will not match the expectation that whole day he never accosted me his lesson was given rather more quietly than usual more mildly and also more gravely he was fatherly to his pupils but he was not brotherly to me ere he left the classe i expected a smile if not a word i got neither to my portion fell one nodhurried shy  this distance i argued is accidentalit is involuntary patience and it will vanish it vanished not it continued for days it increased i suppressed my surprise and swallowed whatever other feelings began to surge  well might i ask when he offered fraternitydare i rely on you well might he doubtless knowing himself withhold all pledge true he had bid me make my own experimentstease and try him vain injunction privilege nominal and unavailable some women might use it nothing in my powers or instinct placed me amongst this brave band left alone i was passive repulsed i withdrew forgottenmy lips would not utter nor my eyes dart a reminder it seemed there had been an error somewhere in my calculations and i wanted for time to disclose it  but the day came when as usual he was to give me a lesson one evening in seven he had long generously bestowed on me devoting it to the examination of what had been done in various studies during the past week and to the preparation of work for the week in prospect on these occasions my schoolroom was anywhere wherever the pupils and the other teachers happened to be or in their close vicinage very often in the large second division where it was easy to choose a quiet nook when the crowding day pupils were absent and the few boarders gathered in a knot about the surveillantes estrade  on the customary evening hearing the customary hour strike i collected my books and papers my pen and ink and sought the large division  in classe there was no one and it lay all in cool deep shadow but through the open double doors was seen the carré filled with pupils and with light over hall and figures blushed the westering sun it blushed so ruddily and vividly that the hues of the walls and the variegated tints of the dresses seemed all fused in one warm glow the girls were seated working or studying in the midst of their circle stood m emanuel speaking goodhumouredly to a teacher his dark paletôt his jetty hair were tinged with many a reflex of crimson his spanish face when he turned it momentarily answered the suns animated kiss with an animated smile i took my place at a desk  the orangetrees and several plants full and bright with bloom basked also in the suns laughing bounty they had partaken it the whole day and now asked water m emanuel had a taste for gardening he liked to tend and foster plants i used to think that working amongst shrubs with a spade or a wateringpot soothed his nerves it was a recreation to which he often had recourse and now he looked to the orangetrees the geraniums the gorgeous cactuses and revived them all with the refreshment their drought needed his lips meantime sustained his precious cigar that for him first necessary and prime luxury of life its blue wreaths curled prettily enough amongst the flowers and in the evening light he spoke no more to the pupils nor to the mistresses but gave many an endearing word to a small spanieless if one may coin a word that nominally belonged to the house but virtually owned him as master being fonder of him than any inmate a delicate silky loving and lovable little doggie she was trotting at his side looking with expressive attached eyes into his face and whenever he dropped his bonnetgrec or his handkerchief which he occasionally did in play crouching beside it with the air of a miniature lion guarding a kingdoms flag  there were many plants and as the amateur gardener fetched all the water from the well in the court with his own active hands his work spun on to some length the great schoolclock ticked on another hour struck the carré and the youthful group lost the illusion of sunset day was drooping my lesson i perceived must tonight be very short but the orangetrees the cacti the camelias were all served now was it my turn  alas in the garden were more plants to be looked afterfavourite rosebushes certain choice flowers little sylvies glad bark and whine followed the receding paletôt down the alleys i put up some of my books i should not want them all i sat and thought and waited involuntarily deprecating the creeping invasion of twilight  sylvie gaily frisking emerged into view once more heralding the returning paletôt the wateringpot was deposited beside the well it had fulfilled its office how glad i was monsieur washed his hands in a little stone bowl there was no longer time for a lesson now ere long the prayerbell must ring but still we should meet he would speak a chance would be offered of reading in his eyes the riddle of his shyness his ablutions over he stood slowly rearranging his cuffs looking at the horn of a young moon set pale in the opal sky and glimmering faint on the oriel of jean baptiste sylvie watched the mood contemplative its stillness irked her she whined and jumped to break it he looked down  petite exigeante said he you must not be forgotten one moment it seems  he stopped lifted her in his arms sauntered across the court within a yard of the line of windows near one of which i sat he sauntered lingeringly fondling the spaniel in his bosom calling her tender names in a tender voice on the frontdoor steps he turned once again he looked at the moon at the grey cathedral over the remoter spires and houseroofs fading into a blue sea of nightmist he tasted the sweet breath of dusk and noted the folded bloom of the garden he suddenly looked round a keen beam out of his eye rased the white façade of the classes swept the long line of croisées i think he bowed if he did i had no time to return the courtesy in a moment he was gone the moonlit threshold lay pale and shadowless before the closed front door  gathering in my arms all that was spread on the desk before me i carried back the unused heap to its place in the third classe the prayerbell rang i obeyed its summons  the morrow would not restore him to the rue fossette that day being devoted entirely to his college i got through my teaching i got over the intermediate hours i saw evening approaching and armed myself for its heavy ennuis whether it was worse to stay with my coinmates or to sit alone i had not considered i naturally took up the latter alternative if there was a hope of comfort for any moment the heart or head of no human being in this house could yield it only under the lid of my desk could it harbour nestling between the leaves of some book gilding a pencilpoint the nib of a pen or tinging the black fluid in that inkglass with a heavy heart i opened my desklid with a weary hand i turned up its contents  one by one wellaccustomed books volumes sewn in familiar covers were taken out and put back hopeless they had no charm they could not comfort is this something new this pamphlet in lilac i had not seen it before and i rearranged my desk this very daythis very afternoon the tract must have been introduced within the last hour while we were at dinner  i opened it what was it what would it say to me  it was neither tale nor poem neither essay nor history it neither sung nor related not discussed it was a theological work it preached and it persuaded  i lent to it my ear very willingly for small as it was it possessed its own spell and bound my attention at once it preached romanism it persuaded to conversion the voice of that sly little book was a honeyed voice its accents were all unction and balm here roared no utterance of romes thunders no blasting of the breath of her displeasure the protestant was to turn papist not so much in fear of the heretics hell as on account of the comfort the indulgence the tenderness holy church offered far be it from her to threaten or to coerce her wish was to guide and win she persecute oh dear no not on any account  this meek volume was not addressed to the hardened and worldly it was not even strong meat for the strong it was milk for babes the mild effluence of a mothers love towards her tenderest and her youngest intended wholly and solely for those whose head is to be reached through the heart its appeal was not to intellect it sought to win the affectionate through their affections the sympathizing through their sympathies st vincent de paul gathering his orphans about him never spoke more sweetly  i remember one capital inducement to apostacy was held out in the fact that the catholic who had lost dear friends by death could enjoy the unspeakable solace of praying them out of purgatory the writer did not touch on the firmer peace of those whose belief dispenses with purgatory altogether but i thought of this and on the whole preferred the latter doctrine as the most consolatory the little book amused and did not painfully displease me it was a canting sentimental shallow little book yet something about it cheered my gloom and made me smile i was amused with the gambols of this unlicked wolfcub muffled in the fleece and mimicking the bleat of a guileless lamb portions of it reminded me of certain wesleyan methodist tracts i had once read when a child they were flavoured with about the same seasoning of excitation to fanaticism he that had written it was no bad man and while perpetually betraying the trained cunningthe cloven hoof of his systemi should pause before accusing himself of insincerity his judgment however wanted surgical props it was rickety  i smiled then over this dose of maternal tenderness coming from the ruddy old lady of the seven hills smiled too at my own disinclination not to say disability to meet these melting favours glancing at the titlepage i found the name of père silas a flyleaf bore in small but clear and wellknown pencil characters from p c d e to ly and when i saw this i laughed but not in my former spirit i was revived  a mortal bewilderment cleared suddenly from my head and vision the solution of the sphinxriddle was won the conjunction of those two names père silas and paul emanuel gave the key to all the penitent had been with his director permitted to withhold nothing suffered to keep no corner of his heart sacred to god and to himself the whole narrative of our late interview had been drawn from him he had avowed the covenant of fraternity and spoken of his adopted sister how could such a covenant such adoption be sanctioned by the church fraternal communion with a heretic i seemed to hear père silas annulling the unholy pact warning his penitent of its perils entreating enjoining reserve nay by the authority of his office and in the name and by the memory of all m emanuel held most dear and sacred commanding the enforcement of that new system whose frost had pierced to the marrow of my bones  these may not seem pleasant hypotheses yet by comparison they were welcome the vision of a ghostly troubler hovering in the background was as nothing matched with the fear of spontaneous change arising in m paul himself  at this distance of time i cannot be sure how far the above conjectures were selfsuggested or in what measure they owed their origin and confirmation to another quarter help was not wanting  this evening there was no bright sunset west and east were one cloud no summer nightmist blue yet rosetinged softened the distance a clammy fog from the marshes crept grey round villette tonight the wateringpot might rest in its niche by the well a small rain had been drizzling all the afternoon and still it fell fast and quietly this was no weather for rambling in the wet alleys under the dripping trees and i started to hear sylvies sudden bark in the gardenher bark of welcome surely she was not accompanied and yet this glad quick bark was never uttered save in homage to one presence  through the glass door and the arching berceau i commanded the deep vista of the allée défendue thither rushed sylvie glistening through its gloom like a white guelderrose she ran to and fro whining springing harassing little birds amongst the bushes i watched five minutes no fulfilment followed the omen i returned to my books sylvies sharp bark suddenly ceased again i looked up she was standing not many yards distant wagging her white feathery tail as fast as the muscle would work and intently watching the operations of a spade plied fast by an indefatigable hand there was m emanuel bent over the soil digging in the wet mould amongst the rainladen and streaming shrubs working as hard as if his days pittance were yet to earn by the literal sweat of his brow  in this sign i read a ruffled mood he would dig thus in frozen snow on the coldest winter day when urged inwardly by painful emotion whether of nervous excitation or sad thoughts of selfreproach he would dig by the hour with knit brow and set teeth nor once lift his head or open his lips  sylvie watched till she was tired again scampering devious bounding here rushing there snuffing and sniffing everywhere she at last discovered me in classe instantly she flew barking at the panes as if to urge me forth to share her pleasure or her masters toil she had seen me occasionally walking in that alley with m paul and i doubt not considered it my duty to join him now wet as it was  she made such a bustle that m paul at last looked up and of course perceived why and at whom she barked he whistled to call her off she only barked the louder she seemed quite bent upon having the glass door opened tired i suppose with her importunity he threw down his spade approached and pushed the door ajar sylvie burst in all impetuous sprang to my lap and with her paws at my neck and her little nose and tongue somewhat overpoweringly busy about my face mouth and eyes flourished her bushy tail over the desk and scattered books and papers far and wide  m emanuel advanced to still the clamour and repair the disarrangement having gathered up the books he captured sylvie and stowed her away under his paletôt where she nestled as quiet as a mouse her head just peeping forth she was very tiny and had the prettiest little innocent face the silkiest long ears the finest dark eyes in the world i never saw her but i thought of paulina de bassompierre forgive the association reader it would occur  m paul petted and patted her the endearments she received were not to be wondered at she invited affection by her beauty and her vivacious life  while caressing the spaniel his eye roved over the papers and books just replaced it settled on the religious tract his lips moved he half checked the impulse to speak what had he promised never to address me more if so his better nature pronounced the vow more honoured in the breach than in the observance for with a second effort he spokeyou have not yet read the brochure i presume it is not sufficiently inviting  i replied that i had read it  he waited as if wishing me to give an opinion upon it unasked unasked however i was in no mood to do or say anything if any concessions were to be madeif any advances were demandedthat was the affair of the very docile pupil of père silas not mine his eye settled upon me gently there was mildness at the moment in its blue raythere was solicitudea shade of pathos there were meanings composite and contrastedreproach melting into remorse at the moment probably he would have been glad to see something emotional in me i could not show it in another minute however i should have betrayed confusion had i not bethought myself to take some quillpens from my desk and begin soberly to mend them  i knew that action would give a turn to his mood he never liked to see me mend pens my knife was always dulledgedmy hand too was unskilful i hacked and chipped on this occasion i cut my own fingerhalf on purpose i wanted to restore him to his natural state to set him at his ease to get him to chide  maladroit he cried at last she will make mincemeat of her hands  he put sylvie down making her lie quiet beside his bonnetgrec and depriving me of the pens and penknife proceeded to slice nib and point with the accuracy and celerity of a machine  did i like the little book he now inquired  suppressing a yawn i said i hardly knew  had it moved me  i thought it had made me a little sleepy  after a pause allons donc it was of no use taking that tone with him bad as i wasand he should be sorry to have to name all my faults at a breathgod and nature had given me trop de sensibilité et de sympathie not to be profoundly affected by an appeal so touching  indeed i responded rousing myself quickly i was not affected at allnot a whit  and in proof i drew from my pocket a perfectly dry handkerchief still clean and in its folds  hereupon i was made the object of a string of strictures rather piquant than polite i listened with zest after those two days of unnatural silence it was better than music to hear m paul haranguing again just in his old fashion i listened and meantime solaced myself and sylvie with the contents of a bonbonnière which m emanuels gifts kept well supplied with chocolate comfits it pleased him to see even a small matter from his hand duly appreciated he looked at me and the spaniel while we shared the spoil he put up his penknife touching my hand with the bundle of newcut quills he saiddites donc petite soeurspeak franklywhat have you thought of me during the last two days  but of this question i would take no manner of notice its purport made my eyes fill i caressed sylvie assiduously m paul leaningover the desk bent towards mei called myself your brother he said i hardly know what i ambrotherfriendi cannot tell i know i think of youi feel i wish you wellbut i must check myself you are to be feared my best friends point out danger and whisper caution  you do right to listen to your friends by all means be cautious  it is your religionyour strange selfreliant invulnerable creed whose influence seems to clothe you in i know not what unblessed panoply you are goodpère silas calls you good and loves youbut your terrible proud earnest protestantism there is the danger it expresses itself by your eye at times and again it gives you certain tones and certain gestures that make my flesh creep you are not demonstrative and yet just nowwhen you handled that tractmy god i thought lucifer smiled  certainly i dont respect that tractwhat then  not respect that tract but it is the pure essence of faith love charity i thought it would touch you in its gentleness i trusted that it could not fail i laid it in your desk with a prayer i must indeed be a sinner heaven will not hear the petitions that come warmest from my heart you scorn my little offering oh cela me fait mal  monsieur i dont scorn itat least not as your gift monsieur sit down listen to me i am not a heathen i am not hardhearted i am not unchristian i am not dangerous as they tell you i would not trouble your faith you believe in god and christ and the bible and so do i  but do you believe in the bible do you receive revelation what limits are there to the wild careless daring of your country and sect père silas dropped dark hints  by dint of persuasion i made him halfdefine these hints they amounted to crafty jesuitslanders that night m paul and i talked seriously and closely he pleaded he argued i could not arguea fortunate incapacity it needed but triumphant logical opposition to effect all the director wished to be effected but i could talk in my own waythe way m paul was used toand of which he could follow the meanderings and fill the hiatus and pardon the strange stammerings strange to him no longer at ease with him i could defend my creed and faith in my own fashion in some degree i could lull his prejudices he was not satisfied when he went away hardly was he appeased but he was made thoroughly to feel that protestants were not necessarily the irreverent pagans his director had insinuated he was made to comprehend something of their mode of honouring the light the life the word he was enabled partly to perceive that while their veneration for things venerable was not quite like that cultivated in his church it had its own perhaps deeper powerits own more solemn awe  i found that père silas himself i must repeat not a bad man though the advocate of a bad cause had darkly stigmatized protestants in general and myself by inference with strange names had ascribed to us strange isms monsieur emanuel revealed all this in his frank fashion which knew not secretiveness looking at me as he spoke with a kind earnest fear almost trembling lest there should be truth in the charges père silas it seems had closely watched me had ascertained that i went by turns and indiscriminately to the three protestant chapels of villettethe french german and englishid est the presbyterian lutheran episcopalian such liberality argued in the fathers eyes profound indifferencewho tolerates all he reasoned can be attached to none now it happened that i had often secretly wondered at the minute and unimportant character of the differences between these three sectsat the unity and identity of their vital doctrines i saw nothing to hinder them from being one day fused into one grand holy alliance and i respected them all though i thought that in each there were faults of form incumbrances and trivialities just what i thought that did i tell m emanuel and explained to him that my own last appeal the guide to which i looked and the teacher which i owned must always be the bible itself rather than any sect of whatever name or nation  he left me soothed yet full of solicitude breathing a wish as strong as a prayer that if i were wrong heaven would lead me right i heard poured forth on the threshold some fervid murmurings to marie reine du ciel some deep aspiration that his hope might yet be mine  strange i had no such feverish wish to turn him from the faith of his fathers i thought romanism wrong a great mixed image of gold and clay but it seemed to me that this romanist held the purer elements of his creed with an innocency of heart which god must love  the preceding conversation passed between eight and nine oclock of the evening in a schoolroom of the quiet rue fossette opening on a sequestered garden probably about the same or a somewhat later hour of the succeeding evening its echoes collected by holy obedience were breathed verbatim in an attent ear at the panel of a confessional in the hoary church of the magi it ensued that père silas paid a visit to madame beck and stirred by i know not what mixture of motives persuaded her to let him undertake for a time the englishwomans spiritual direction  hereupon i was put through a course of readingthat is i just glanced at the books lent me they were too little in my way to be thoroughly read marked learned or inwardly digested and besides i had a book upstairs under my pillow whereof certain chapters satisfied my needs in the article of spiritual lore furnishing such precept and example as to my hearts core i was convinced could not be improved on  then père silas showed me the fair side of rome her good works and bade me judge the tree by its fruits  in answer i felt and i avowed that these works were not the fruits of rome they were but her abundant blossoming but the fair promise she showed the world that bloom when set savoured not of charity the apple full formed was ignorance abasement and bigotry out of mens afflictions and affections were forged the rivets of their servitude poverty was fed and clothed and sheltered to bind it by obligation to the church orphanage was reared and educated that it might grow up in the fold of the church sickness was tended that it might die after the formula and in the ordinance of the church and men were overwrought and women most murderously sacrificed and all laid down a world god made pleasant for his creatures good and took up a cross monstrous in its galling weight that they might serve rome prove her sanctity confirm her power and spread the reign of her tyrant church  for mans good was little done for gods glory less a thousand ways were opened with pain with bloodsweats with lavishing of life mountains were cloven through their breasts and rocks were split to their base and all for what that a priesthood might march straight on and straight upward to an alldominating eminence whence they might at last stretch the sceptre of their moloch church  it will not be god is not with rome and were human sorrows still for the son of god would he not mourn over her cruelties and ambitions as once he mourned over the crimes and woes of doomed jerusalem  oh lovers of power oh mitred aspirants for this worlds kingdoms an hour will come even to you when it will be well for your heartspausing faint at each broken beatthat there is a mercy beyond human compassions a love stronger than this strong death which even you must face and before it fall a charity more potent than any sin even yours a pity which redeems worldsnay absolves priests                                       my third temptation was held out in the pomp of romethe glory of her kingdom i was taken to the churches on solemn occasionsdays of fête and state i was shown the papal ritual and ceremonial i looked at it  many peoplemen and womenno doubt far my superiors in a thousand ways have felt this display impressive have declared that though their reason protested their imagination was subjugated i cannot say the same neither full procession nor high mass nor swarming tapers nor swinging censers nor ecclesiastical millinery nor celestial jewellery touched my imagination a whit what i saw struck me as tawdry not grand as grossly material not poetically spiritual  this i did not tell père silas he was old he looked venerable through every abortive experiment under every repeated disappointment he remained personally kind to me and i felt tender of hurting his feelings but on the evening of a certain day when from the balcony of a great house i had been made to witness a huge mingled procession of the church and the armypriests with relics and soldiers with weapons an obese and aged archbishop habited in cambric and lace looking strangely like a grey daw in birdofparadise plumage and a band of young girls fantastically robed and garlandedthen i spoke my mind to m paul  i did not like it i told him i did not respect such ceremonies i wished to see no more  and having relieved my conscience by this declaration i was able to go on and speaking more currently and clearly than my wont to show him that i had a mind to keep to my reformed creed the more i saw of popery the closer i clung to protestantism doubtless there were errors in every church but i now perceived by contrast how severely pure was my own compared with her whose painted and meretricious face had been unveiled for my admiration i told him how we kept fewer forms between us and god retaining indeed no more than perhaps the nature of mankind in the mass rendered necessary for due observance i told him i could not look on flowers and tinsel on waxlights and embroidery at such times and under such circumstances as should be devoted to lifting the secret vision to him whose home is infinity and his beingeternity that when i thought of sin and sorrow of earthly corruption mortal depravity weighty temporal woei could not care for chanting priests or mumming officials that when the pains of existence and the terrors of dissolution pressed before mewhen the mighty hope and measureless doubt of the future arose in viewthen even the scientific strain or the prayer in a language learned and dead harassed with hindrance a heart which only longed to crygod be merciful to me a sinner  when i had so spoken so declared my faith and so widely severed myself from him i addressedthen at last came a tone accordant an echo responsive one sweet chord of harmony in two conflicting spirits  whatever say priests or controversialists murmured m emanuel god is good and loves all the sincere believe then what you can believe it as you can one prayer at least we have in common i also cryo dieu sois appaisé envers moi qui suis pécheur  he leaned on the back of my chair after some thought he again spoke  how seem in the eyes of that god who made all firmaments from whose nostrils issued whatever of life is here or in the stars shining yonderhow seem the differences of man but as time is not for god nor space so neither is measure nor comparison we abase ourselves in our littleness and we do right yet it may be that the constancy of one heart the truth and faith of one mind according to the light he has appointed import as much to him as the just motion of satellites about their planets of planets about their suns of suns around that mighty unseen centre incomprehensible irrealizable with strange mental effort only divined  god guide us all god bless you lucy     chapter xxxvii  sunshine   it was very well for paulina to decline further correspondence with graham till her father had sanctioned the intercourse but dr bretton could not live within a league of the hôtel crécy and not contrive to visit there often both lovers meant at first i believe to be distant they kept their intention so far as demonstrative courtship went but in feeling they soon drew very near  all that was best in graham sought paulina whatever in him was noble awoke and grew in her presence with his past admiration of miss fanshawe i suppose his intellect had little to do but his whole intellect and his highest tastes came in question now these like all his faculties were active eager for nutriment and alive to gratification when it came  i cannot say that paulina designedly led him to talk of books or formally proposed to herself for a moment the task of winning him to reflection or planned the improvement of his mind or so much as fancied his mind could in any one respect be improved she thought him very perfect it was graham himself who at first by the merest chance mentioned some book he had been reading and when in her response sounded a welcome harmony of sympathies something pleasant to his soul he talked on more and better perhaps than he had ever talked before on such subjects she listened with delight and answered with animation in each successive answer graham heard a music waxing finer and finer to his sense in each he found a suggestive persuasive magic accent that opened a scarceknown treasurehouse within showed him unsuspected power in his own mind and what was better latent goodness in his heart each liked the way in which the other talked the voice the diction the expression pleased each keenly relished the flavour of the others wit they met each others meaning with strange quickness their thoughts often matched like carefullychosen pearls graham had wealth of mirth by nature paulina possessed no such inherent flow of animal spiritsunstimulated she inclined to be thoughtful and pensivebut now she seemed merry as a lark in her lovers genial presence she glanced like some soft glad light how beautiful she grew in her happiness i can hardly express but i wondered to see her as to that gentle ice of hersthat reserve on which she had depended where was it now ah graham would not long bear it he brought with him a generous influence that soon thawed the timid selfimposed restriction  now were the old bretton days talked over perhaps brokenly at first with a sort of smiling diffidence then with opening candour and still growing confidence graham had made for himself a better opportunity than that he had wished me to give he had earned independence of the collateral help that disobliging lucy had refused all his reminiscences of little polly found their proper expression in his own pleasant tones by his own kind and handsome lips how much better than if suggested by me  more than once when we were alone paulina would tell me how wonderful and curious it was to discover the richness and accuracy of his memory in this matter how while he was looking at her recollections would seem to be suddenly quickened in his mind he reminded her that she had once gathered his head in her arms caressed his leonine graces and cried out graham i do like you he told her how she would set a footstool beside him and climb by its aid to his knee at this day he said he could recall the sensation of her little hands smoothing his cheek or burying themselves in his thick mane he remembered the touch of her small forefinger placed half tremblingly half curiously in the cleft in his chin the lisp the look with which she would name it a pretty dimple then seek his eyes and question why they pierced so telling him he had a nice strange face far nicer far stranger than either his mamma or lucy snowe  child as i was remarked paulina i wonder how i dared be so venturous to me he seems now all sacred his locks are inaccessible and lucy i feel a sort of fear when i look at his firm marble chin at his straight greek features women are called beautiful lucy he is not like a woman therefore i suppose he is not beautiful but what is he then do other people see him with my eyes do you admire him  ill tell you what i do paulina was once my answer to her many questions i never see him i looked at him twice or thrice about a year ago before he recognised me and then i shut my eyes and if he were to cross their balls twelve times between each days sunset and sunrise except from memory i should hardly know what shape had gone by  lucy what do you mean said she under her breath  i mean that i value vision and dread being struck stone blind  it was best to answer her strongly at once and to silence for ever the tender passionate confidences which left her lips sweet honey and sometimes dropped in my earmolten lead to me she commented no more on her lovers beauty  yet speak of him she would sometimes shyly in quiet brief phrases sometimes with a tenderness of cadence and music of voice exquisite in itself but which chafed me at times miserably and then i know i gave her stern looks and words but cloudless happiness had dazzled her native clear sight and she only thought lucyfitful  spartan girl proud lucy she would say smiling at me graham says you are the most peculiar capricious little woman he knows but yet you are excellent we both think so  you both think you know not what said i have the goodness to make me as little the subject of your mutual talk and thoughts as possible i have my sort of life apart from yours  but ours lucy is a beautiful life or it will be and you shall share it  i shall share no mans or womans life in this world as you understand sharing i think i have one friend of my own but am not sure and till i am sure i live solitary  but solitude is sadness  yes it is sadness life however has worse than that deeper than melancholy lies heartbreak  lucy i wonder if anybody will ever comprehend you altogether  there is in lovers a certain infatuation of egotism they will have a witness of their happiness cost that witness what it may paulina had forbidden letters yet dr bretton wrote she had resolved against correspondence yet she answered were it only to chide she showed me these letters with something of the spoiled childs wilfulness and of the heiresss imperiousness she made me read them as i read grahams i scarce wondered at her exaction and understood her pride they were fine lettersmanly and fondmodest and gallant hers must have appeared to him beautiful they had not been written to show her talents still less i think to express her love on the contrary it appeared that she had proposed to herself the task of hiding that feeling and bridling her lovers ardour but how could such letters serve such a purpose graham was become dear as her life he drew her like a powerful magnet for her there was influence unspeakable in all he uttered wrote thought or looked with this unconfessed confession her letters glowed it kindled them from greeting to adieu  i wish papa knew i do wish papa knew began now to be her anxious murmur i wish and yet i fear i can hardly keep graham back from telling him there is nothing i long for more than to have this affair settledto speak out candidly and yet i dread the crisis i know i am certain papa will be angry at the first i fear he will dislike me almost it will seem to him an untoward business it will be a surprise a shock i can hardly foresee its whole effect on him  the fact washer father long calm was beginning to be a little stirred long blind on one point an importunate light was beginning to trespass on his eye  to her he said nothing but when she was not looking at or perhaps thinking of him i saw him gaze and meditate on her  one eveningpaulina was in her dressingroom writing i believe to graham she had left me in the library readingm de bassompierre came in he sat down i was about to withdraw he requested me to remaingently yet in a manner which showed he wished compliance he had taken his seat near the window at a distance from me he opened a desk he took from it what looked like a memorandumbook of this book he studied a certain entry for several minutes  miss snowe said he laying it down do you know my little girls age  about eighteen is it not sir  it seems so this old pocketbook tells me she was born on the 5th of may in the year 18 eighteen years ago it is strange i had lost the just reckoning of her age i thought of her as twelvefourteenan indefinite date but she seemed a child  she is about eighteen i repeated she is grown up she will be no taller  my little jewel said m de bassompierre in a tone which penetrated like some of his daughters accents  he sat very thoughtful  sir dont grieve i said for i knew his feelings utterly unspoken as they were  she is the only pearl i have he said and now others will find out that she is pure and of price they will covet her  i made no answer graham bretton had dined with us that day he had shone both in converse and looks i know not what pride of bloom embellished his aspect and mellowed his intercourse under the stimulus of a high hope something had unfolded in his whole manner which compelled attention i think he had purposed on that day to indicate the origin of his endeavours and the aim of his ambition m de bassompierre had found himself forced in a manner to descry the direction and catch the character of his homage slow in remarking he was logical in reasoning having once seized the thread it had guided him through a long labyrinth  where is she he asked  she is upstairs  what is she doing  she is writing  she writes does she does she receive letters  none but such as she can show me andsirshethey have long wanted to consult you  pshaw they dont think of mean old father i am in the way  ah m de bassompierrenot sothat cant be but paulina must speak for herself and dr bretton too must be his own advocate  it is a little late matters are advanced it seems  sir till you approve nothing is doneonly they love each other  only he echoed  invested by fate with the part of confidante and mediator i was obliged to go on hundreds of times has dr bretton been on the point of appealing to you sir but with all his high courage he fears you mortally  he may wellhe may well fear me he has touched the best thing i have had he but let her alone she would have remained a child for years yet so are they engaged  they could not become engaged without your permission  it is well for you miss snowe to talk and think with that propriety which always characterizes you but this matter is a grief to me my little girl was all i had i have no more daughters and no son bretton might as well have looked elsewhere there are scores of rich and pretty women who would not i daresay dislike him he has looks and conduct and connection would nothing serve him but my polly  if he had never seen your polly others might and would have pleased himyour niece miss fanshawe for instance  ah i would have given him ginevra with all my heart but pollyi cant let him have her noi cant he is not her equal he affirmed rather gruffly in what particular is he her match they talk of fortune i am not an avaricious or interested man but the world thinks of these thingsand polly will be rich  yes that is known said i all villette knows her as an heiress  do they talk of my little girl in that light  they do sir  he fell into deep thought i ventured to say would you sir think any one paulinas match would you prefer any other to dr bretton do you think higher rank or more wealth would make much difference in your feelings towards a future soninlaw  you touch me there said he  look at the aristocracy of villetteyou would not like them sir  i should notnever a duc baron or vicomte of the lot  i am told many of these persons think about her sir i went on gaining courage on finding that i met attention rather than repulse other suitors will come therefore if dr bretton is refused wherever you go i suppose aspirants will not be wanting independent of heiressship it appears to me that paulina charms most of those who see her  does she how my little girl is not thought a beauty  sir miss de bassompierre is very beautiful  nonsensebegging your pardon miss snowe but i think you are too partial i like polly i like all her ways and all her looksbut then i am her father and even i never thought about beauty she is amusing fairylike interesting to meyou must be mistaken in supposing her handsome  she attracts sir she would attract without the advantages of your wealth and position  my wealth and position are these any bait to graham if i thought so  dr bretton knows these points perfectly as you may be sure m de bassompierre and values them as any gentleman wouldas you would yourself under the same circumstancesbut they are not his baits he loves your daughter very much he feels her finest qualities and they influence him worthily  what has my little pet fine qualities  ah sir did you observe her that evening when so many men of eminence and learning dined here  i certainly was rather struck and surprised with her manner that day its womanliness made me smile  and did you see those accomplished frenchmen gather round her in the drawingroom  i did but i thought it was by way of relaxationas one might amuse ones self with a pretty infant  sir she demeaned herself with distinction and i heard the french gentlemen say she was pétrie desprit et de graces dr bretton thought the same  she is a good dear child that is certain and i do believe she has some character when i think of it i was once ill polly nursed me they thought i should die she i recollect grew at once stronger and tenderer as i grew worse in health and as i recovered what a sunbeam she was in my sickroom yes she played about my chair as noiselessly and as cheerful as light and now she is sought in marriage i dont want to part with her said he and he groaned  you have known dr and mrs bretton so long i suggested it would be less like separation to give her to him than to another  he reflected rather gloomily  true i have long known louisa bretton he murmured she and i are indeed old old friends a sweet kind girl she was when she was young you talk of beauty miss snowe she was handsome if you willtall straight and bloomingnot the mere child or elf my polly seems to me at eighteen louisa had a carriage and stature fit for a princess she is a comely and a good woman now the lad is like her i have always thought so and favoured and wished him well now he repays me by this robbery my little treasure used to love her old father dearly and truly it is all over now doubtlessi am an incumbrance  the door openedhis little treasure came in she was dressed so to speak in evening beauty that animation which sometimes comes with the close of day warmed her eye and cheek a tinge of summer crimson heightened her complexion her curls fell full and long on her lily neck her white dress suited the heat of june thinking me alone she had brought in her hand the letter just writtenbrought it folded but unsealed i was to read it when she saw her father her tripping step faltered a little paused a momentthe colour in her cheek flowed rosy over her whole face  polly said m de bassompierre in a low voice with a grave smile do you blush at seeing papa that is something new  i dont blushi never do blush affirmed she while another eddy from the heart sent up its scarlet but i thought you were in the diningroom and i wanted lucy  you thought i was with john graham bretton i suppose but he has just been called out he will be back soon polly he can post your letter for you it will save matthieu a course as he calls it  i dont post letters said she rather pettishly  what do you do with them thencome here and tell me  both her mind and gesture seemed to hesitate a secondto say shall i comebut she approached  how long is it since you became a letterwriter polly it only seems yesterday when you were at your pothooks labouring away absolutely with both hands at the pen  papa they are not letters to send to the post in your letterbag they are only notes which i give now and then into the persons hands just to satisfy  the person that means miss snowe i suppose  no papanot lucy  who then perhaps mrs bretton  no papanot mrs bretton  who then my little daughter tell papa the truth  oh papa she cried with earnestness i willi will tell you the truthall the truth i am glad to tell youglad though i tremble  she did tremble growing excitement kindling feeling and also gathering courage shook her  i hate to hide my actions from you papa i fear you and love you above everything but god read the letter look at the address  she laid it on his knee he took it up and read it through his hand shaking his eyes glistening meantime  he refolded it and viewed the writer with a strange tender mournful amaze  can she write sothe little thing that stood at my knee but yesterday can she feel so  papa is it wrong does it pain you  there is nothing wrong in it my innocent little mary but it pains me  but papa listen you shall not be pained by me i would give up everythingalmost correcting herself i would die rather than make you unhappy that would be too wicked  she shuddered  does the letter not please you must it not go must it be torn it shall for your sake if you order it  i order nothing  order something papa express your wish only dont hurt dont grieve graham i cannot cannot bear that i love you papa but i love graham toobecausebecauseit is impossible to help it  this splendid graham is a young scamp pollythat is my present notion of him it will surprise you to hear that for my part i do not love him one whit ah years ago i saw something in that lads eye i never quite fathomedsomething his mother has nota depth which warned a man not to wade into that stream too far now suddenly i find myself taken over the crown of the head  papa you dontyou have not fallen in you are safe on the bank you can do as you please your power is despotic you can shut me up in a convent and break grahams heart tomorrow if you choose to be so cruel now autocrat now czar will you do this  off with him to siberia red whiskers and all i say i dont like him polly and i wonder that you should  papa said she do you know you are very naughty i never saw you look so disagreeable so unjust so almost vindictive before there is an expression in your face which does not belong to you  off with him pursued mr home who certainly did look sorely crossed and annoyedeven a little bitter but i suppose if he went polly would pack a bundle and run after him her heart is fairly wonwon and weaned from her old father  papa i say it is naughty it is decidedly wrong to talk in that way i am not weaned from you and no human being and no mortal influence can wean me  be married polly espouse the red whiskers cease to be a daughter go and be a wife  red whiskers i wonder what you mean papa you should take care of prejudice you sometimes say to me that all the scotch your countrymen are the victims of prejudice it is proved now i think when no distinction is to be made between red and deep nutbrown  leave the prejudiced old scotchman go away  she stood looking at him a minute she wanted to show firmness superiority to taunts knowing her fathers character guessing his few foibles she had expected the sort of scene which was now transpiring it did not take her by surprise and she desired to let it pass with dignity reliant upon reaction her dignity stood her in no stead suddenly her soul melted in her eyes she fell on his necki wont leave you papa ill never leave you i wont pain you ill never pain you was her cry  my lamb my treasure murmured the loving though rugged sire he said no more for the moment indeed those two words were hoarse  the room was now darkening i heard a movement a step without thinking it might be a servant coming with candles i gently opened to prevent intrusion in the anteroom stood no servant a tall gentleman was placing his hat on the table drawing off his gloves slowlylingering waiting it seemed to me he called me neither by sign nor word yet his eye saidlucy come here and i went  over his face a smile flowed while he looked down on me no temper save his own would have expressed by a smile the sort of agitation which now fevered him  m de bassompierre is thereis he not he inquired pointing to the library  yes  he noticed me at dinner he understood me  yes graham  i am brought up for judgment then and so is she  mr home we now and always continued to term him mr home at times is talking to his daughter  ha these are sharp moments lucy  he was quite stirred up his young hand trembled a vital i was going to write mortal but such words ill apply to one all living like hima vital suspense now held now hurried his breath in all this trouble his smile never faded  is he very angry lucy  she is very faithful graham  what will be done unto me  graham your star must be fortunate  must it kind prophet so cheered i should be a faint heart indeed to quail i think i find all women faithful lucy i ought to love them and i do my mother is good she is divine and you are true as steel are you not  yes graham  then give me thy hand my little godsister it is a friendly little hand to me and always has been and now for the great venture god be with the right lucy say amen  he turned and waited till i said amenwhich i did to please him the old charm in doing as he bid me came back i wished him success and successful i knew he would be he was born victor as some are born vanquished  follow me he said and i followed him into mr homes presence  sir he asked what is my sentence  the father looked at him the daughter kept her face hid  well bretton said mr home you have given me the usual reward of hospitality i entertained you you have taken my best i was always glad to see you you were glad to see the one precious thing i had you spoke me fair and meantime i will not say you robbed me but i am bereaved and what i have lost you it seems have won  sir i cannot repent  repent not you you triumph no doubt john graham you descended partly from a highlander and a chief and there is a trace of the celt in all you look speak and think you have his cunning and his charm the redwell then polly the fair hair the tongue of guile and brain of wile are all come down by inheritance  sir i feel honest enough said graham and a genuine english blush covered his face with its warm witness of sincerity and yet he added i wont deny that in some respects you accuse me justly in your presence i have always had a thought which i dared not show you i did truly regard you as the possessor of the most valuable thing the world owns for me i wished for it i tried for it sir i ask for it now  john you ask much  very much sir it must come from your generosity as a gift from your justice as a reward i can never earn it  ay listen to the highland tongue said mr home look up polly answer this braw wooer send him away  she looked up she shyly glanced at her eager handsome suitor she gazed tenderly on her furrowed sire  papa i love you both said she i can take care of you both i need not send graham awayhe can live here he will be no inconvenience she alleged with that simplicity of phraseology which at times was wont to make both her father and graham smile they smiled now  he will be a prodigious inconvenience to me still persisted mr home i dont want him polly he is too tall he is in my way tell him to march  you will get used to him papa he seemed exceedingly tall to me at firstlike a tower when i looked up at him but on the whole i would rather not have him otherwise  i object to him altogether polly i can do without a soninlaw i should never have requested the best man in the land to stand to me in that relation dismiss this gentleman  but he has known you so long papa and suits you so well  suits me forsooth yes he has pretended to make my opinions and tastes his own he has humoured me for good reasons i think polly you and i will bid him goodby  till tomorrow only shake hands with graham papa  no i think not i am not friends with him dont think to coax me between you  indeed indeed you are friends graham stretch out your right hand papa put out yours now let them touch papa dont be stiff close your fingers be pliantthere but that is not a claspit is a grasp papa you grasp like a vice you crush grahams hand to the bone you hurt him  he must have hurt him for he wore a massive ring set round with brilliants of which the sharp facets cut into grahams flesh and drew blood but pain only made dr john laugh as anxiety had made him smile  come with me into my study at last said mr home to the doctor they went their intercourse was not long but i suppose it was conclusive the suitor had to undergo an interrogatory and a scrutiny on many things whether dr bretton was at times guileful in look and language or not there was a sound foundation below his answers i understood afterwards evinced both wisdom and integrity he had managed his affairs well he had struggled through entanglements his fortunes were in the way of retrieval he proved himself in a position to marry  once more the father and lover appeared in the library m de bassompierre shut the door he pointed to his daughter  take her he said take her john bretton and may god deal with you as you deal with her                                       not long after perhaps a fortnight i saw three persons count de bassompierre his daughter and dr graham bretton sitting on one seat under a lowspreading and umbrageous tree in the grounds of the palace at bois letang they had come thither to enjoy a summer evening outside the magnificent gates their carriage waited to take them home the green sweeps of turf spread round them quiet and dim the palace rose at a distance white as a crag on pentelicus the evening star shone above it a forest of flowering shrubs embalmed the climate of this spot the hour was still and sweet the scene but for this group was solitary  paulina sat between the two gentlemen while they conversed her little hands were busy at some work i thought at first she was binding a nosegay no with the tiny pair of scissors glittering in her lap she had severed spoils from each manly head beside her and was now occupied in plaiting together the grey lock and the golden wave the plait wovenno silkthread being at hand to bind ita tress of her own hair was made to serve that purpose she tied it like a knot prisoned it in a locket and laid it on her heart  now said she there is an amulet made which has virtue to keep you two always friends you can never quarrel so long as i wear this  an amulet was indeed made a spell framed which rendered enmity impossible she was become a bond to both an influence over each a mutual concord from them she drew her happiness and what she borrowed she with interest gave back  is there indeed such happiness on earth i asked as i watched the father the daughter the future husband now unitedall blessed and blessing  yes it is so without any colouring of romance or any exaggeration of fancy it is so some real lives dofor some certain days or yearsactually anticipate the happiness of heaven and i believe if such perfect happiness is once felt by good people to the wicked it never comes its sweet effect is never wholly lost whatever trials follow whatever pains of sickness or shades of death the glory precedent still shines through cheering the keen anguish and tinging the deep cloud  i will go farther i do believe there are some human beings so born so reared so guided from a soft cradle to a calm and late grave that no excessive suffering penetrates their lot and no tempestuous blackness overcasts their journey and often these are not pampered selfish beings but natures elect harmonious and benign men and women mild with charity kind agents of gods kind attributes  let me not delay the happy truth graham bretton and paulina de bassompierre were married and such an agent did dr bretton prove he did not with time degenerate his faults decayed his virtues ripened he rose in intellectual refinement he won in moral profit all dregs filtered away the clear wine settled bright and tranquil bright too was the destiny of his sweet wife she kept her husbands love she aided in his progressof his happiness she was the corner stone  this pair was blessed indeed for years brought them with great prosperity great goodness they imparted with open hand yet wisely doubtless they knew crosses disappointments difficulties but these were well borne more than once too they had to look on him whose face flesh scarce can see and live they had to pay their tribute to the king of terrors in the fulness of years m de bassompierre was taken in ripe old age departed louisa bretton once even there rose a cry in their halls of rachel weeping for her children but others sprang healthy and blooming to replace the lost dr bretton saw himself live again in a son who inherited his looks and his disposition he had stately daughters too like himself these children he reared with a suave yet a firm hand they grew up according to inheritance and nurture  in short i do but speak the truth when i say that these two lives of graham and paulina were blessed like that of jacobs favoured son with blessings of heaven above blessings of the deep that lies under it was so for god saw that it was good     chapter xxxviii  cloud   but it is not so for all what then his will be done as done it surely will be whether we humble ourselves to resignation or not the impulse of creation forwards it the strength of powers seen and unseen has its fulfilment in charge proof of a life to come must be given in fire and in

good soldiers let us finish our course and keep the faith reliant in the issue to come off more than conquerors art thou not from everlasting mine holy one we shall not die  on a thursday morning we were all assembled in classe waiting for the lesson of literature the hour was come we expected the master  the pupils of the first classe sat very still the cleanlywritten compositions prepared since the last lesson lay ready before them neatly tied with ribbon waiting to be gathered by the hand of the professor as he made his rapid round of the desks the month was july the morning fine the glassdoor stood ajar through it played a fresh breeze and plants growing at the lintel waved bent looked in seeming to whisper tidings  m emanuel was not always quite punctual we scarcely wondered at his being a little late but we wondered when the door at last opened and instead of him with his swiftness and his fire there came quietly upon us the cautious madame beck  she approached m pauls desk she stood before it she drew round her the light shawl covering her shoulders beginning to speak in low yet firm tones and with a fixed gaze she said this morning there will be no lesson of literature  the second paragraph of her address followed after about two minutes pause  it is probable the lessons will be suspended for a week i shall require at least that space of time to find an efficient substitute for m emanuel meanwhile it shall be our study to fill the blanks usefully  your professor ladies she went on intends if possible duly to take leave of you at the present moment he has not leisure for that ceremony he is preparing for a long voyage a very sudden and urgent summons of duty calls him to a great distance he has decided to leave europe for an indefinite time perhaps he may tell you more himself ladies instead of the usual lesson with m emanuel you will this morning read english with mademoiselle lucy  she bent her head courteously drew closer the folds of her shawl and passed from the classe  a great silence fell then a murmur went round the room i believe some pupils wept  some time elapsed the noise the whispering the occasional sobbing increased i became conscious of a relaxation of discipline a sort of growing disorder as if my girls felt that vigilance was withdrawn and that surveillance had virtually left the classe habit and the sense of duty enabled me to rally quickly to rise in my usual way to speak in my usual tone to enjoin and finally to establish quiet i made the english reading long and close i kept them at it the whole morning i remember feeling a sentiment of impatience towards the pupils who sobbed indeed their emotion was not of much value it was only an hysteric agitation i told them so unsparingly i half ridiculed them i was severe the truth was i could not do with their tears or that gasping sound i could not bear it a rather weakminded lowspirited pupil kept it up when the others had done relentless necessity obliged and assisted me so to accost her that she dared not carry on the demonstration that she was forced to conquer the convulsion  that girl would have had a right to hate me except that when school was over and her companions departing i ordered her to stay and when they were gone i did what i had never done to one among them beforepressed her to my heart and kissed her cheek but this impulse yielded to i speedily put her out of the classe for upon that poignant strain she wept more bitterly than ever  i filled with occupation every minute of that day and should have liked to sit up all night if i might have kept a candle burning the night however proved a bad time and left bad effects preparing me ill for the next days ordeal of insufferable gossip of course this news fell under general discussion some little reserve had accompanied the first surprise that soon wore off every mouth opened every tongue wagged teachers pupils the very servants mouthed the name of emanuel he whose connection with the school was contemporary with its commencement thus suddenly to withdraw all felt it strange  they talked so much so long so often that out of the very multitude of their words and rumours grew at last some intelligence about the third day i heard it said that he was to sail in a week thenthat he was bound for the west indies i looked at madame becks face and into her eyes for disproof or confirmation of this report i perused her all over for information but no part of her disclosed more than what was unperturbed and commonplace  this secession was an immense loss to her she alleged she did not know how she should fill up the vacancy she was so used to her kinsman he had become her right hand what should she do without him she had opposed the step but m paul had convinced her it was his duty  she said all this in public in classe at the dinnertable speaking audibly to zélie st pierre  why was it his duty i could have asked her that i had impulses to take hold of her suddenly as she calmly passed me in classe to stretch out my hand and grasp her fast and say stop let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter why is it his duty to go into banishment but madame always addressed some other teacher and never looked at me never seemed conscious i could have a care in the question  the week wore on nothing more was said about m emanuel coming to bid us goodby and none seemed anxious for his coming none questioned whether or not he would come none betrayed torment lest he should depart silent and unseen incessantly did they talk and never in all their talk touched on this vital point as to madame she of course could see him and say to him as much as she pleased what should she care whether or not he appeared in the schoolroom  the week consumed we were told that he was going on such a day that his destination was basseterre in guadaloupe the business which called him abroad related to a friends interests not his own i thought as much  basseterre in guadaloupe i had little sleep about this time but whenever i did slumber it followed infallibly that i was quickly roused with a start while the words basseterre guadaloupe seemed pronounced over my pillow or ran athwart the darkness round and before me in zigzag characters of red or violet light  for what i felt there was no help and how could i help feeling m emanuel had been very kind to me of late days he had been growing hourly better and kinder it was now a month since we had settled the theological difference and in all that time there had been no quarrel nor had our peace been the cold daughter of divorce we had not lived aloof he had come oftener he had talked with me more than before he had spent hours with me with temper soothed with eye content with manner homelike and mild kind subjects of conversation had grown between us he had inquired into my plans of life and i had communicated them the school project pleased him he made me repeat it more than once though he called it an alnaschar dream the jar was over the mutual understanding was settling and fixing feelings of union and hope made themselves profoundly felt in the heart affection and deep esteem and dawning trust had each fastened its bond  what quiet lessons i had about this time no more taunts on my intellect no more menaces of grating public shows how sweetly for the jealous gibe and the more jealous halfpassionate eulogy were substituted a mute indulgent help a fond guidance and a tender forbearance which forgave but never praised there were times when he would sit for many minutes and not speak at all and when dusk or duty brought separation he would leave with words like these il est doux le repos il est précieux le calme bonheur  one evening not ten short days since he joined me whilst walking in my alley he took my hand i looked up in his face i thought he meant to arrest my attention  bonne petite amie said he softly douce consolatrice but through his touch and with his words a new feeling and a strange thought found a course could it be that he was becoming more than friend or brother did his look speak a kindness beyond fraternity or amity  his eloquent look had more to say his hand drew me forward his interpreting lips stirred no not now here into the twilight alley broke an interruption it came dual and ominous we faced two bodeful formsa womans and a priestsmadame beck and père silas  the aspect of the latter i shall never forget on the first impulse it expressed a jeanjacques sensibility stirred by the signs of affection just surprised then immediately darkened over it the jaundice of ecclesiastical jealousy he spoke to me with unction he looked on his pupil with sternness as to madame beck she of course saw nothingnothing though her kinsman retained in her presence the hand of the heretic foreigner not suffering withdrawal but clasping it close and fast  following these incidents that sudden announcement of departure had struck me at first as incredible indeed it was only frequent repetition and the credence of the hundred and fifty minds round me which forced on me its full acceptance as to that week of suspense with its blank yet burning days which brought from him no word of explanationi remember but i cannot describe its passage  the last day broke now would he visit us now he would come and speak his farewell or he would vanish mute and be seen by us nevermore  this alternative seemed to be present in the mind of not a living creature in that school all rose at the usual hour all breakfasted as usual all without reference to or apparent thought of their late professor betook themselves with wonted phlegm to their ordinary duties  so oblivious was the house so tame so trained its proceedings so inexpectant its aspecti scarce knew how to breathe in an atmosphere thus stagnant thus smothering would no one lend me a voice had no one a wish no one a word no one a prayer to which i could sayamen  i had seen them unanimous in demand for the merest triflea treat a holiday a lessons remission they could not they would not now band to besiege madame beck and insist on a last interview with a master who had certainly been loved at least by someloved as they could lovebut oh what is the love of the multitude  i knew where he lived i knew where he was to be heard of or communicated with the distance was scarce a stonesthrow had it been in the next roomunsummoned i could make no use of my knowledge to follow to seek out to remind to recallfor these things i had no faculty  m emanuel might have passed within reach of my arm had he passed silent and unnoticing silent and stirless should i have suffered him to go by  morning wasted afternoon came and i thought all was over my heart trembled in its place my blood was troubled in its current i was quite sick and hardly knew how to keep at my postor do my work yet the little world round me plodded on indifferent all seemed jocund free of care or fear or thought the very pupils who seven days since had wept hysterically at a startling piece of news appeared quite to have forgotten the news its import and their emotion  a little before five oclock the hour of dismissal madame beck sent for me to her chamber to read over and translate some english letter she had received and to write for her the answer before settling to this work i observed that she softly closed the two doors of her chamber she even shut and fastened the casement though it was a hot day and free circulation of air was usually regarded by her as indispensable why this precaution a keen suspicion an almost fierce distrust suggested such question did she want to exclude sound what sound  i listened as i had never listened before i listened like the evening and winterwolf snuffing the snow scenting prey and hearing far off the travellers tramp yet i could both listen and write about the middle of the letter i heardwhat checked my pena tread in the vestibule no doorbell had rung rosineacting doubtless by ordershad anticipated such réveillée madame saw me halt she coughed made a bustle spoke louder the tread had passed on to the classes  proceed said madame but my hand was fettered my ear enchained my thoughts were carried off captive  the classes formed another building the hall parted them from the dwellinghouse despite distance and partition i heard the sudden stir of numbers a whole division rising at once  they are putting away work said madame  it was indeed the hour to put away work but why that sudden hushthat instant quell of the tumult  wait madamei will see what it is  and i put down my pen and left her left her no she would not be left powerless to detain me she rose and followed close as my shadow i turned on the last step of the stair  are you coming too i asked  yes said she meeting my glance with a peculiar aspecta look clouded yet resolute  we proceeded then not together but she walked in my steps  he was come entering the first classe i saw him there once more appeared the form most familiar i doubt not they had tried to keep him away but he was come  the girls stood in a semicircle he was passing round giving his farewells pressing each hand touching with his lips each cheek this last ceremony foreign custom permitted at such a partingso solemn to last so long  i felt it hard that madame beck should dog me thus following and watching me close my neck and shoulder shrunk in fever under her breath i became terribly goaded  he was approaching the semicircle was almost travelled round he came to the last pupil he turned but madame was before me she had stepped out suddenly she seemed to magnify her proportions and amplify her drapery she eclipsed me i was hid she knew my weakness and deficiency she could calculate the degree of moral paralysisthe total default of selfassertionwith which in a crisis i could be struck she hastened to her kinsman she broke upon him volubly she mastered his attention she hurried him to the doorthe glassdoor opening on the garden i think he looked round could i but have caught his eye courage i think would have rushed in to aid feeling and there would have been a charge and perhaps a rescue but already the room was all confusion the semicircle broken into groups my figure was lost among thirty more conspicuous madame had her will yes she got him away and he had not seen me he thought me absent five oclock struck the loud dismissalbell rang the school separated the room emptied  there seems to my memory an entire darkness and distraction in some certain minutes i then passed alonea grief inexpressible over a loss unendurable what should i do oh what should i do when all my lifes hope was thus torn by the roots out of my riven outraged heart  what i should have done i know not when a little childthe least child in the schoolbroke with its simplicity and its unconsciousness into the raging yet silent centre of that inward conflict  mademoiselle lisped the treble voice i am to give you that m paul said i was to seek you all over the house from the grenier to the cellar and when i found you to give you that  and the child delivered a note the little dove dropped on my knee its olive leaf plucked off i found neither address nor name only these words  it was not my intention to take leave of you when i said goodby to the rest but i hoped to see you in classe i was disappointed the interview is deferred be ready for me ere i sail i must see you at leisure and speak with you at length be ready my moments are numbered and just now monopolized besides i have a private business on hand which i will not share with any nor communicateeven to youpaul  be ready then it must be this evening was he not to go on the morrow yes of that point i was certain i had seen the date of his vessels departure advertised oh i would be ready but could that longedfor meeting really be achieved the time was so short the schemers seemed so watchful so active so hostile the way of access appeared strait as a gully deep as a chasmapollyon straddled across it breathing flames could my greatheart overcome could my guide reach me  who might tell yet i began to take some courage some comfort it seemed to me that i felt a pulse of his heart beating yet true to the whole throb of mine  i waited my champion apollyon came trailing his hell behind him i think if eternity held torment its form would not be fiery rack nor its nature despair i think that on a certain day amongst those days which never dawned and will not set an angel entered hadesstood shone smiled delivered a prophecy of conditional pardon kindled a doubtful hope of bliss to come not now but at a day and hour unlooked for revealed in his own glory and grandeur the height and compass of his promise spoke thusthen towering became a star and vanished into his own heaven his legacy was suspensea worse boon than despair  all that evening i waited trusting in the dovesent oliveleaf yet in the midst of my trust terribly fearing my fear pressed heavy cold and peculiar i knew it for the partner of a rarelybelied presentiment the first hours seemed long and slow in spirit i clung to the flying skirts of the last they passed like drift cloudlike the wrack scudding before a storm  they passed all the long hot summer day burned away like a yulelog the crimson of its close perished i was left bent among the cool blue shades over the pale and ashen gleams of its night  prayers were over it was bedtime my coinmates were all retired i still remained in the gloomy first classe forgetting or at least disregarding rules i had never forgotten or disregarded before  how long i paced that classe i cannot tell i must have been afoot many hours mechanically had i moved aside benches and desks and had made for myself a path down its length there i walked and there when certain that the whole household were abed and quite out of hearingthere i at last wept reliant on night confiding in solitude i kept my tears sealed my sobs chained no longer they heaved my heart they tore their way in this house what grief could be sacred  soon after eleven oclocka very late hour in the rue fossettethe door unclosed quietly but not stealthily a lamps flame invaded the moonlight madame beck entered with the same composed air as if coming on an ordinary occasion at an ordinary season instead of at once addressing me she went to her desk took her keys and seemed to seek something she loitered over this feigned search long too long she was calm too calm my mood scarce endured the pretence driven beyond common range two hours since i had left behind me wonted respects and fears led by a touch and ruled by a word under usual circumstances no yoke could now be borneno curb obeyed  it is more than time for retirement said madame the rule of the house has already been transgressed too long  madame met no answer i did not check my walk when she came in my way i put her out of it  let me persuade you to calm meess let me lead you to your chamber said she trying to speak softly  no i said neither you nor another shall persuade or lead me  your bed shall be warmed goton is sitting up still she shall make you comfortable she shall give you a sedative  madame i broke out you are a sensualist under all your serenity your peace and your decorum you are an undenied sensualist make your own bed warm and soft take sedatives and meats and drinks spiced and sweet as much as you will if you have any sorrow or disappointmentand perhaps you havenay i know you haveseek your own palliatives in your own chosen resources leave me however leave me i say  i must send another to watch you meess i must send goton  i forbid it let me alone keep your hand off me and my life and my troubles oh madame in your hand there is both chill and poison you envenom and you paralyze  what have i done meess you must not marry paul he cannot marry  dog in the manger i said for i knew she secretly wanted him and had always wanted him she called him insupportable she railed at him for a dévot she did not love but she wanted to marry that she might bind him to her interest deep into some of madames secrets i had enteredi know not how by an intuition or an inspiration which came to mei know not whence in the course of living with her too i had slowly learned that unless with an inferior she must ever be a rival she was my rival heart and soul though secretly under the smoothest bearing and utterly unknown to all save her and myself  two minutes i stood over madame feeling that the whole woman was in my power because in some moods such as the presentin some stimulated states of perception like that of this instanther habitual disguise her mask and her domino were to me a mere network reticulated with holes and i saw underneath a being heartless selfindulgent and ignoble she quietly retreated from me meek and selfpossessed though very uneasy she said if i would not be persuaded to take rest she must reluctantly leave me which she did incontinent perhaps even more glad to get away than i was to see her vanish  this was the sole flasheliciting truthextorting rencontre which ever occurred between me and madame beck this short nightscene was never repeated it did not one whit change her manner to me i do not know that she revenged it i do not know that she hated me the worse for my fell candour i think she bucklered herself with the secret philosophy of her strong mind and resolved to forget what it irked her to remember i know that to the end of our mutual lives there occurred no repetition of no allusion to that fiery passage  that night passed all nightseven the starless night before dissolutionmust wear away about six oclock the hour which called up the household i went out to the court and washed my face in its cold fresh wellwater entering by the carré a piece of mirrorglass set in an oaken cabinet repeated my image it said i was changed my cheeks and lips were sodden white my eyes were glassy and my eyelids swollen and purple  on rejoining my companions i knew they all looked at memy heart seemed discovered to them i believed myself selfbetrayed hideously certain did it seem that the very youngest of the school must guess why and for whom i despaired  isabelle the child whom i had once nursed in sickness approached me would she too mock me  que vous êtes pâle vous êtes donc bien malade mademoiselle said she putting her finger in her mouth and staring with a wistful stupidity which at the moment seemed to me more beautiful than the keenest intelligence  isabelle did not long stand alone in the recommendation of ignorance before the day was over i gathered cause of gratitude towards the whole blind household the multitude have something else to do than to read hearts and interpret dark sayings who wills may keep his own counselbe his own secrets sovereign in the course of that day proof met me on proof not only that the cause of my present sorrow was unguessed but that my whole inner life for the last six months was still mine only it was not knownit had not been notedthat i held in peculiar value one life among all lives gossip had passed me by curiosity had looked me over both subtle influences hovering always round had never become centred upon me a given organization may live in a full feverhospital and escape typhus m emanuel had come and gone i had been taught and sought in season and out of season he had called me and i had obeyed him m paul wants miss lucymiss lucy is with m paulsuch had been the perpetual bulletin and nobody commented far less condemned nobody hinted nobody jested madame beck read the riddle none else resolved it what i now suffered was called illnessa headache i accepted the baptism  but what bodily illness was ever like this pain this certainty that he was gone without a farewellthis cruel conviction that fate and pursuing furiesa womans envy and a priests bigotrywould suffer me to see him no more what wonder that the second evening found me like the firstuntamed tortured again pacing a solitary room in an unalterable passion of silent desolation  madame beck did not herself summon me to bed that nightshe did not come near me she sent ginevra fanshawea more efficient agent for the purpose she could not have employed ginevras first wordsis your headache very bad tonight for ginevra like the rest thought i had a headachean intolerable headache which made me frightfully white in the face and insanely restless in the foother first words i say inspired the impulse to flee anywhere so that it were only out of reach and soon what followedplaints about her own headachescompleted the business  i went upstairs presently i was in my bedmy miserable bedhaunted with quick scorpions i had not been laid down five minutes when another emissary arrived goton came bringing me something to drink i was consumed with thirsti drank eagerly the beverage was sweet but i tasted a drug  madame says it will make you sleep chouchou said goton as she received back the emptied cup  ah the sedative had been administered in fact they had given me a strong opiate i was to be held quiet for one night  the household came to bed the nightlight was lit the dormitory hushed sleep soon reigned over those pillows sleep won an easy supremacy contented sovereign over heads and hearts which did not achehe passed by the unquiet  the drug wrought i know not whether madame had overcharged or undercharged the dose its result was not that she intended instead of stupor came excitement i became alive to new thoughtto reverie peculiar in colouring a gathering call ran among the faculties their bugles sang their trumpets rang an untimely summons imagination was roused from her rest and she came forth impetuous and venturous with scorn she looked on matter her materise she said sluggard this night i will have my will nor shalt thou prevail  look forth and view the night was her cry and when i lifted the heavy blind from the casement close at handwith her own royal gesture she showed me a moon supreme in an element deep and splendid  to my gasping senses she made the glimmering gloom the narrow limits the oppressive heat of the dormitory intolerable she lured me to leave this den and follow her forth into dew coolness and glory  she brought upon me a strange vision of villette at midnight especially she showed the park the summerpark with its long alleys all silent lone and safe among these lay a huge stone basinthat basin i knew and beside which i had often stooddeepset in the treeshadows brimming with cool water clear with a green leafy rushy bed what of all this the parkgates were shut up locked sentinelled the place could not be entered  could it not a point worth considering and while revolving it i mechanically dressed utterly incapable of sleeping or lying stillexcited from head to footwhat could i do better than dress  the gates were locked soldiers set before them was there then no admission to the park  the other day in walking past i had seen without then attending to the circumstance a gap in the palingone stake broken down i now saw this gap again in recollectionsaw it very plainlythe narrow irregular aperture visible between the stems of the lindens planted orderly as a colonnade a man could not have made his way through that aperture nor could a stout woman perhaps not madame beck but i thought i might i fancied i should like to try and once within at this hour the whole park would be minethe moonlight midnight park  how soundly the dormitory slept what deep slumbers what quiet breathing how very still the whole large house what was the time i felt restless to know there stood a clock in the classe below what hindered me from venturing down to consult it by such a moon its large white face and jet black figures must be vividly distinct  as for hindrance to this step there offered not so much as a creaking hinge or a clicking latch on these hot july nights close air could not be tolerated and the chamberdoor stood wide open will the dormitoryplanks sustain my tread untraitorous yes i know wherever a board is loose and will avoid it the oak staircase creaks somewhat as i descend but not muchi am in the carré  the great classedoors are close shut they are bolted on the other hand the entrance to the corridor stands open the classes seem to my thought great dreary jails buried far back beyond thoroughfares and for me filled with spectral and intolerable memories laid miserable amongst their straw and their manacles the corridor offers a cheerful vista leading to the high vestibule which opens direct upon the street  hushthe clock strikes ghostly deep as is the stillness of this convent it is only eleven while my ear follows to silence the hum of the last stroke i catch faintly from the builtout capital a sound like bells or like a banda sound where sweetness where victory where mourning blend oh to approach this music nearer to listen to it alone by the rushy basin let me gooh let me go what hinders what does not aid freedom  there in the corridor hangs my gardencostume my large hat my shawl there is no lock on the huge heavy portecochère there is no key to seek it fastens with a sort of springbolt not to be opened from the outside but which from within may be noiselessly withdrawn can i manage it it yields to my hand yields with propitious facility i wonder as that portal seems almost spontaneously to unclosei wonder as i cross the threshold and step on the paved street wonder at the strange ease with which this prison has been forced it seems as if i had been pioneered invisibly as if some dissolving force had gone before me for myself i have scarce made an effort  quiet rue fossette i find on this pavement that wandererwooing summer night of which i mused i see its moon over me i feel its dew in the air but here i cannot stay i am still too near old haunts so close under the dungeon i can hear the prisoners moan this solemn peace is not what i seek it is not what i can bear to me the face of that sky bears the aspect of a worlds death the park also will be calmi know a mortal serenity prevails everywhereyet let me seek the park  i took a route well known and went up towards the palatial and royal hauteville thence the music i had heard certainly floated it was hushed now but it might rewaken i went on neither band nor bell music came to meet me another sound replaced it a sound like a strong tide a great flow deepening as i proceeded light broke movement gathered chimes pealedto what was i coming entering on the level of a grande place i found myself with the suddenness of magic plunged amidst a gay living joyous crowd  villette is one blaze one broad illumination the whole world seems abroad moonlight and heaven are banished the town by her own flambeaux beholds her own splendourgay dresses grand equipages fine horses and gallant riders throng the bright streets i see even scores of masks it is a strange scene stranger than dreams but where is the parki ought to be near it in the midst of this glare the park must be shadowy and calmthere at least are neither torches lamps nor crowd  i was asking this question when an open carriage passed me filled with known faces through the deep throng it could pass but slowly the spirited horses fretted in their curbed ardour i saw the occupants of that carriage well me they could not see or at least not know folded close in my large shawl screened with my straw hat in that motley crowd no dress was noticeably strange i saw the count de bassompierre i saw my godmother handsomely apparelled comely and cheerful i saw too paulina mary compassed with the triple halo of her beauty her youth and her happiness in looking on her countenance of joy and eyes of festal light one scarce remembered to note the gala elegance of what she wore i know only that the drapery floating about her was all white and light and bridal seated opposite to her i saw graham bretton it was in looking up at him her aspect had caught its lustrethe light repeated in her eyes beamed first out of his  it gave me strange pleasure to follow these friends viewlessly and i did follow them as i thought to the park i watched them alight carriages were inadmissible amidst new and unanticipated splendours lo the iron gateway between the stone columns was spanned by a flaming arch built of massed stars and following them cautiously beneath that arch where were they and where was i  in a land of enchantment a garden most gorgeous a plain sprinkled with coloured meteors a forest with sparks of purple and ruby and golden fire gemming the foliage a region not of trees and shadow but of strangest architectural wealthof altar and of temple of pyramid obelisk and sphinx incredible to say the wonders and the symbols of egypt teemed throughout the park of villette  no matter that in five minutes the secret was minethe key of the mystery picked up and its illusion unveiledno matter that i quickly recognised the material of these solemn fragmentsthe timber the paint and the pasteboardthese inevitable discoveries failed to quite destroy the charm or undermine the marvel of that night no matter that i now seized the explanation of the whole great fêtea fête of which the conventual rue fossette had not tasted though it had opened at dawn that morning and was still in full vigour near midnight  in past days there had been said history an awful crisis in the fate of labassecour involving i know not what peril to the rights and liberties of her gallant citizens rumours of wars there had been if not wars themselves a kind of struggling in the streetsa bustlea running to and fro some rearing of barricades some burgherrioting some calling out of troops much interchange of brickbats and even a little of shot tradition held that patriots had fallen in the old basseville was shown an enclosure solemnly built in and set apart holding it was said the sacred bones of martyrs be this as it may a certain day in the year was still kept as a festival in honour of the said patriots and martyrs of somewhat apocryphal memorythe morning being given to a solemn te deum in st jean baptiste the evening devoted to spectacles decorations and illuminations such as these i now saw  while looking up at the image of a white ibis fixed on a columnwhile fathoming the deep torchlit perspective of an avenue at the close of which was couched a sphinxi lost sight of the party which from the middle of the great square i had followedor rather they vanished like a group of apparitions on this whole scene was impressed a dreamlike character every shape was wavering every movement floating every voice echolikehalfmocking halfuncertain paulina and her friends being gone i scarce could avouch that i had really seen them nor did i miss them as guides through the chaos far less regret them as protectors amidst the night  that festal night would have been safe for a very child half the peasantry had come in from the outlying environs of villette and the decent burghers were all abroad and around dressed in their best my strawhat passed amidst cap and jacket short petticoat and long calico mantle without perhaps attracting a glance i only took the precaution to bind down the broad leaf gipsywise with a supplementary ribbonand then i felt safe as if masked  safe i passed down the avenuessafe i mixed with the crowd where it was deepest to be still was not in my power nor quietly to observe i took a revel of the scene i drank the elastic nightairthe swell of sound the dubious light now flashing now fading as to happiness or hope they and i had shaken hands but just nowi scorned despair  my vague aim as i went was to find the stonebasin with its clear depth and green lining of that coolness and verdure i thought with the passionate thirst of unconscious fever amidst the glare and hurry and throng and noise i still secretly and chiefly longed to come on that circular mirror of crystal and surprise the moon glassing therein her pearly front  i knew my route yet it seemed as if i was hindered from pursuing it direct now a sight and now a sound called me aside luring me down this alley and down that already i saw the thickplanted trees which framed this tremulous and rippled glass when choiring out of a glade to the right broke such a sound as i thought might be heard if heaven were to opensuch a sound perhaps as was heard above the plain of bethlehem on the night of glad tidings  the song the sweet music rose afar but rushing swiftly on faststrengthening pinionsthere swept through these shades so full a storm of harmonies that had no tree been near against which to lean i think i must have dropped voices were there it seemed to me unnumbered instruments varied and countlessbugle horn and trumpet i knew the effect was as a sea breaking into song with all its waves  the swaying tide swept this way and then it fell back and i followed its retreat it led me towards a byzantine buildinga sort of kiosk near the parks centre round about stood crowded thousands gathered to a grand concert in the open air what i had heard was i think a wild jäger chorus the night the space the scene and my own mood had but enhanced the sounds and their impression  here were assembled ladies looking by this light most beautiful some of their dresses were gauzy and some had the sheen of satin the flowers and the blond trembled and the veils waved about their decorated bonnets as that hostlike chorus with its greatlygathering sound sundered the air above them most of these ladies occupied the little light parkchairs and behind and beside them stood guardian gentlemen the outer ranks of the crowd were made up of citizens plebeians and police  in this outer rank i took my place i rather liked to find myself the silent unknown consequently unaccosted neighbour of the short petticoat and the sabot and only the distant gazer at the silk robe the velvet mantle and the plumed chapeau amidst so much life and joy too it suited me to be alonequite alone having neither wish nor power to force my way through a mass so closepacked my station was on the farthest confines where indeed i might hear but could see little  mademoiselle is not well placed said a voice at my elbow who dared accost me a being in a mood so little social i turned rather to repel than to reply i saw a mana burgheran entire stranger as i deemed him for one moment but the next recognised in him a certain tradesmana bookseller whose shop furnished the rue fossette with its books and stationery a man notorious in our pensionnat for the excessive brittleness of his temper and frequent snappishness of his manner even to us his principal customers but whom for my solitary self i had ever been disposed to like and had always found civil sometimes kind once in aiding me about some troublesome little exchange of foreign money he had done me a service he was an intelligent man under his asperity he was a goodhearted man the thought had sometimes crossed me that a part of his nature bore affinity to a part of m emanuels whom he knew well and whom i had often seen sitting on mirets counter turning over the current months publications and it was in this affinity i read the explanation of that conciliatory feeling with which i instinctively regarded him  strange to say this man knew me under my strawhat and closelyfolded shawl and though i deprecated the effort he insisted on making a way for me through the crowd and finding me a better situation he carried his disinterested civility further and from some quarter procured me a chair once and again i have found that the most crossgrained are by no means the worst of mankind nor the humblest in station the least polished in feeling this man in his courtesy seemed to find nothing strange in my being here alone only a reason for extending to me as far as he could a retiring yet efficient attention having secured me a place and a seat he withdrew without asking a question without obtruding a remark without adding a superfluous word no wonder that professor emanuel liked to take his cigar and his lounge and to read his feuilleton in m mirets shopthe two must have suited  i had not been seated five minutes ere i became aware that chance and my worthy burgher friend had brought me once more within view of a familiar and domestic group right before me sat the brettons and de bassompierres within reach of my handhad i chosen to extend itsat a figure like a fairyqueen whose array lilies and their leaves seemed to have suggested whatever was not spotless white being forestgreen my godmother too sat so near that had i leaned forward my breath might have stirred the ribbon of her bonnet they were too near having been just recognised by a comparative stranger i felt uneasy at this close vicinage of intimate acquaintance  it made me quite start when mrs bretton turning to mr home and speaking out of a kind impulse of memory saidi wonder what my steady little lucy would say to all this if she were here i wish we had brought her she would have enjoyed it much  so she would so she would in her grave sensible fashion it is a pity but we had asked her rejoined the kind gentleman and added i like to see her so quietly pleased so little moved yet so content  dear were they both to me dear are they to this day in their remembered benevolence little knew they the rack of pain which had driven lucy almost into fever and brought her out guideless and reckless urged and drugged to the brink of frenzy i had half a mind to bend over the elders shoulders and answer their goodness with the thanks of my eyes m de bassompierre did not well know me but i knew him and honoured and admired his nature with all its plain sincerity its warm affection and unconscious enthusiasm possibly i might have spoken but just then graham turned he turned with one of his stately firm movements so different from those of a sharptempered undersized man there was behind him a throng a hundred ranks deep there were thousands to meet his eye and divide its scrutinywhy then did he concentrate all on meoppressing me with the whole force of that full blue steadfast orb why if he would look did not one glance satisfy him why did he turn on his chair rest his elbow on its back and study me leisurely he could not see my face i held it down surely he could not recognise me i stooped i turned i would not be known he rose by some means he contrived to approach in two minutes he would have had my secret my identity would have been grasped between his never tyrannous but always powerful hands there was but one way to evade or to check him i implied by a sort of supplicatory gesture that it was my prayer to be let alone after that had he persisted he would perhaps have seen the spectacle of lucy incensed not all that was grand or good or kind in him and lucy felt the full amount should have kept her quite tame or absolutely inoffensive and shadowlike he looked but he desisted he shook his handsome head but he was mute he resumed his seat nor did he again turn or disturb me by a glance except indeed for one single instant when a look rather solicitous than curious stole my wayspeaking what somehow stilled my heart like the southwind quieting the earth grahams thoughts of me were not entirely those of a frozen indifference after all i believe in that goodly mansion his heart he kept one little place under the skylights where lucy might have entertainment if she chose to call it was not so handsome as the chambers where he lodged his male friends it was not like the hall where he accommodated his philanthropy or the library where he treasured his science still less did it resemble the pavilion where his marriage feast was splendidly spread yet gradually by long and equal kindness he proved to me that he kept one little closet over the door of which was written lucys room i kept a place for him tooa place of which i never took the measure either by rule or compass i think it was like the tent of peribanou all my life long i carried it folded in the hollow of my hand yet released from that hold and constriction i know not but its innate capacity for expanse might have magnified it into a tabernacle for a host  forbearing as he was tonight i could not stay in this proximity this dangerous place and seat must be given up i watched my opportunity rose and stole away he might think he might even believe that lucy was contained within that shawl and sheltered under that hat he never could be certain for he did not see my face  surely the spirit of restlessness was by this time appeased had i not had enough of adventure did i not begin to flag quail and wish for safety under a roof not so i still loathed my bed in the school dormitory more than words can express i clung to whatever could distract thought somehow i felt too that the nights drama was but begun that the prologue was scarce spoken throughout this woody and turfy theatre reigned a shadow of mystery actors and incidents unlookedfor waited behind the scenes i thought so foreboding told me as much  straying at random obeying the push of every chance elbow i was brought to a quarter where trees planted in clusters or towering singly broke up somewhat the dense packing of the crowd and gave it a more scattered character these confines were far from the music and somewhat aloof even from the lamps but there was sound enough to soothe and with that full high moon lamps were scarce needed here had chiefly settled familygroups burgherparents some of them late as was the hour actually surrounded by their children with whom it had not been thought advisable to venture into the closer throng  three fine tall trees growing close almost twined stem within stem lifted a thick canopy of shade above a green knoll crowned with a seata seat which might have held several yet it seemed abandoned to one the remaining members of the fortunate party in possession of this site standing dutifully round yet amongst this reverend circle was a lady holding by the hand a little girl  when i caught sight of this little girl she was twisting herself round on her heel swinging from her conductresss hand flinging herself from side to side with wanton and fantastic gyrations these perverse movements arrested my attention they struck me as of a character fearfully familiar on close inspection no less so appeared the childs equipment the lilac silk pelisse the small swansdown boa the white bonnetthe whole holiday toilette in short was the gala garb of a cherub but too well known of that tadpole désirée beckand désirée beck it wasshe or an imp in her likeness  i might have taken this discovery as a thunderclap but such hyperbole would have been premature discovery was destined to rise more than one degree ere it reached its climax  on whose hand could the amiable désirée swing thus selfishly whose glove could she tear thus recklessly whose arm thus strain with impunity or on the borders of whose dress thus turn and trample insolently if not the hand glove arm and robe of her ladymother and there in an indian shawl and a palegreen crape bonnetthere fresh portly blithe and pleasantthere stood madame beck  curious i had certainly deemed madame in her bed and désirée in her crib at this blessed minute sleeping both of them the sleep of the just within the sacred walls amidst the profound seclusion of the rue fossette most certainly also they did not picture meess lucie otherwise engaged and here we all three were taking our ébats in the fêteblazing park at midnight  the fact was madame was only acting according to her quite justifiable wont i remembered now i had heard it said among the teachersthough without at the time particularly noticing the gossipthat often when we thought madame in her chamber sleeping she was gone fulldressed to take her pleasure at operas or plays or balls madame had no sort of taste for a monastic life and took carelargely though discreetlyto season her existence with a relish of the world  half a dozen gentlemen of her friends stood about her amongst these i was not slow to recognise two or three there was her brother m victor kint there was another person moustached and with long haira calm taciturn man but whose traits bore a stamp and a semblance i could not mark unmoved amidst reserve and phlegm amidst contrasts of character and of countenance something there still was which recalled a facemobile fervent feelinga face changeable now clouded and now alighta face from my world taken away for my eyes lost but where my best springhours of life had alternated in shadow and in glow that face where i had often seen movements so near the signs of geniusthat why there did not shine fully out the undoubted fire the thing the spirit and the secret itselfi could never tell yesthis josef emanuelthis man of peacereminded me of his ardent brother  besides messieurs victor and josef i knew another of this party this third person stood behind and in the shade his attitude too was stooping yet his dress and bald white head made him the most conspicuous figure of the group he was an ecclesiastic he was père silas do not fancy reader that there was any inconsistency in the priests presence at this fête this was not considered a show of vanity fair but a commemoration of patriotic sacrifice the church patronised it even with ostentation there were troops of priests in the park that night  père silas stooped over the seat with its single occupant the rustic bench and that which sat upon it a strange mass it wasbearing no shape yet magnificent you saw indeed the outline of a face and features but these were so cadaverous and so strangely placed you could almost have fancied a head severed from its trunk and flung at random on a pile of rich merchandise the distant lamprays glanced on clear pendants on broad rings neither the chasteness of moonlight nor the distance of the torches could quite subdue the gorgeous dyes of the drapery hail madame walravens i think you looked more witchlike than ever and presently the good lady proved that she was indeed no corpse or ghost but a harsh and hardy old woman for upon some aggravation in the clamorous petition of désirée beck to her mother to go to the kiosk and take sweetmeats the hunchback suddenly fetched her a resounding rap with her goldknobbed cane  there then were madame walravens madame beck père silasthe whole conjuration the secret junta the sight of them thus assembled did me good i cannot say that i felt weak before them or abashed or dismayed they outnumbered me and i was worsted and under their feet but as yet i was not dead     chapter xxxix  old and new acquaintance   fascinated as by a basilisk with three heads i could not leave this clique the ground near them seemed to hold my feet the canopy of entwined trees held out shadow the night whispered a pledge of protection and an officious lamp flashed just one beam to show me an obscure safe seat and then vanished let me now briefly tell the reader all that during the past dark fortnight i have been silently gathering from rumour respecting the origin and the object of m emanuels departure the tale is short and not new its alpha is mammon and its omega interest  if madame walravens was hideous as a hindoo idol she seemed also to possess in the estimation of these her votaries an idols consequence the fact was she had been richvery rich and though for the present without the command of money she was likely one day to be rich again at basseterre in guadaloupe she possessed a large estate received in dowry on her marriage sixty years ago sequestered since her husbands failure but now it was supposed cleared of claim and if duly looked after by a competent agent of integrity considered capable of being made in a few years largely productive  père silas took an interest in this prospective improvement for the sake of religion and the church whereof magliore walravens was a devout daughter madame beck distantly related to the hunchback and knowing her to be without family of her own had long brooded over contingencies with a mothers calculating forethought and harshly treated as she was by madame walravens never ceased to court her for interests sake madame beck and the priest were thus for money reasons equally and sincerely interested in the nursing of the west indian estate  but the distance was great and the climate hazardous the competent and upright agent wanted must be a devoted man just such a man had madame walravens retained for twenty years in her service blighting his life and then living on him like an old fungus such a man had père silas trained taught and bound to him by the ties of gratitude habit and belief such a man madame beck knew and could in some measure influence my pupil said père silas if he remains in europe runs risk of apostacy for he has become entangled with a heretic madame beck made also her private comment and preferred in her own breast her secret reason for desiring expatriation the thing she could not obtain she desired not another to win rather would she destroy it as to madame walravens she wanted her money and her land and knew paul if he liked could make the best and faithfullest steward so the three selfseekers banded and beset the one unselfish they reasoned they appealed they implored on his mercy they cast themselves into his hands they confidingly thrust their interests they asked but two or three years of devotionafter that he should live for himself one of the number perhaps wished that in the meantime he might die  no living being ever humbly laid his advantage at m emanuels feet or confidingly put it into his hands that he spurned the trust or repulsed the repository what might be his private pain or inward reluctance to leave europewhat his calculations for his own futurenone asked or knew or reported all this was a blank to me his conferences with his confessor i might guess the part duty and religion were made to play in the persuasions used i might conjecture he was gone and had made no sign there my knowledge closed                                       with my head bent and my forehead resting on my hands i sat amidst grouped treestems and branching brushwood whatever talk passed amongst my neighbours i might hear if i would i was near enough but for some time there was scarce motive to attend they gossiped about the dresses the music the illuminations the fine night i listened to hear them say it is calm weather for his voyage the antigua his ship will sail prosperously no such remark fell neither the antigua nor her course nor her passenger were named  perhaps the light chat scarcely interested old madame walravens more than it did me she appeared restless turning her head now to this side now that looking through the trees and among the crowd as if expectant of an arrival and impatient of delay où sontils pourquoi ne viennentils i heard her mutter more than once and at last as if determined to have an answer to her questionwhich hitherto none seemed to mind she spoke aloud this phrasea phrase brief enough simple enough but it sent a shock through memessieurs et mesdames said she où donc est justine marie  justine marie what was this justine mariethe dead nunwhere was she why in her grave madame walravenswhat can you want with her you shall go to her but she shall not come to you  thus i should have answered had the response lain with me but nobody seemed to be of my mind nobody seemed surprised startled or at a loss the quietest commonplace answer met the strange the deaddisturbing the witchofendor query of the hunchback  justine marie said one is coming she is in the kiosk she will be here presently  out of this question and reply sprang a change in the chatchat it still remained easy desultory familiar gossip hint allusion comment went round the circle but all so broken so dependent on references to persons not named or circumstances not defined that listen as intently as i wouldand i did listen now with a fated interesti could make out no more than that some scheme was on foot in which this ghostly justine mariedead or alivewas concerned this familyjunta seemed grasping at her somehow for some reason there seemed question of a marriage of a fortunefor whom i could not quite make outperhaps for victor kint perhaps for josef emanuelboth were bachelors once i thought the hints and jests rained upon a young fairhaired foreigner of the party whom they called heinrich mühler amidst all the badinage madame walravens still obtruded from time to time hoarse crossgrained speeches her impatience being diverted only by an implacable surveillance of désirée who could not stir but the old woman menaced her with her staff  la voilà suddenly cried one of the gentlemen voilà justine marie qui arrive  this moment was for me peculiar i called up to memory the pictured nun on the panel present to my mind was the sad lovestory i saw in thought the vision of the garret the apparition of the alley the strange birth of the berceau i underwent a presentiment of discovery a strong conviction of coming disclosure ah when imagination once runs riot where do we stop what winter tree so bare and branchlesswhat wayside hedgemunching animal so humble that fancy a passing cloud and a struggling moonbeam will not clothe it in spirituality and make of it a phantom  with solemn force pressed on my heart the expectation of mystery breaking up hitherto i had seen this spectre only through a glass darkly now was i to behold it face to face i leaned forward i looked  she comes cried josef emanuel  the circle opened as if opening to admit a new and welcome member at this instant a torch chanced to be carried past its blaze aided the pale moon in doing justice to the crisis in lighting to perfection the dénouement pressing on surely those near me must have felt some little of the anxiety i felt in degree so unmeted of that group the coolest must have held his breath for a time as for me my life stood still  it is over the moment and the nun are come the crisis and the revelation are passed by  the flambeau glares still within a yard held up in a parkkeepers hand its long eager tongue of flame almost licks the figure of the expectedtherewhere she stands full in my sight what is she like what does she wear how does she look who is she  there are many masks in the park tonight and as the hour wears late so strange a feeling of revelry and mystery begins to spread abroad that scarce would you discredit me reader were i to say that she is like the nun of the attic that she wears black skirts and white headclothes that she looks the resurrection of the flesh and that she is a risen ghost  all falsitiesall figments we will not deal in this gear let us be honest and cut as heretofore from the homely web of truth  homely though is an illchosen word what i see is not precisely homely a girl of villette stands therea girl fresh from her pensionnat she is very comely with the beauty indigenous to this country she looks wellnourished fair and fat of flesh her cheeks are round her eyes good her hair is abundant she is handsomely dressed she is not alone her escort consists of three personstwo being elderly these she addresses as mon oncle and ma tante she laughs she chats goodhumoured buxom and blooming she looks at all points the bourgeoise belle  so much for justine marie so much for ghosts and mystery not that this last was solvedthis girl certainly is not my nun what i saw in the garret and garden must have been taller by a span  we have looked at the city belle we have cursorily glanced at the respectable old uncle and aunt have we a stray glance to give to the third member of this company can we spare him a moments notice we ought to distinguish him so far reader he has claims on us we do not now meet him for the first time i clasped my hands very hard and i drew my breath very deep i held in the cry i devoured the ejaculation i forbade the start i spoke and i stirred no more than a stone but i knew what i looked on through the dimness left in my eyes by many nights weeping i knew him they said he was to sail by the antigua madame beck said so she lied or she had uttered what was once truth and failed to contradict it when it became false the antigua was gone and there stood paul emanuel  was i glad a huge load left me was it a fact to warrant joy i know not ask first what were the circumstances attendant on this respite how far did this delay concern me were there not those whom it might touch more nearly  after all who may this young girl this justine marie be not a stranger reader she is known to me by sight she visits at the rue fossette she is often of madame becks sunday parties she is a relation of both the becks and walravens she derives her baptismal name from the sainted nun who would have been her aunt had she lived her patronymic is sauveur she is an heiress and an orphan and m emanuel is her guardian some say her godfather  the family junta wish this heiress to be married to one of their bandwhich is it vital questionwhich is it  i felt very glad now that the drug administered in the sweet draught had filled me with a possession which made bed and chamber intolerable i always through my whole life liked to penetrate to the real truth i like seeking the goddess in her temple and handling the veil and daring the dread glance o titaness among deities the covered outline of thine aspect sickens often through its uncertainty but define to us one trait show us one lineament clear in awful sincerity we may gasp in untold terror but with that gasp we drink in a breath of thy divinity our heart shakes and its currents sway like rivers lifted by earthquake but we have swallowed strength to see and know the worst is to take from fear her main advantage  the walravens party augmented in numbers now became very gay the gentlemen fetched refreshments from the kiosk all sat down on the turf under the trees they drank healths and sentiments they laughed they jested m emanuel underwent some raillery half goodhumoured half i thought malicious especially on madame becks part i soon gathered that his voyage had been temporarily deferred of his own will without the concurrence even against the advice of his friends he had let the antigua go and had taken his berth in the paul et virginie appointed to sail a fortnight later it was his reason for this resolve which they teased him to assign and which he would only vaguely indicate as the settlement of a little piece of business which he had set his heart upon what was this business nobody knew yes there was one who seemed partly at least in his confidence a meaning look passed between him and justine marie la petite va maidernestce pas said he the answer was prompt enough god knows  mais oui je vous aiderai de tout mon coeur vous ferez de moi tout ce que vous voudrez mon parrain  and this dear parrain took her hand and lifted it to his grateful lips upon which demonstration i saw the lightcomplexioned young teuton heinrich mühler grow restless as if he did not like it he even grumbled a few words whereat m emanuel actually laughed in his face and with the ruthless triumph of the assured conqueror he drew his ward nearer to him  m emanuel was indeed very joyous that night he seemed not one whit subdued by the change of scene and action impending he was the true life of the party a little despotic perhaps determined to be chief in mirth as well as in labour yet from moment to moment proving indisputably his right of leadership his was the wittiest word the pleasantest anecdote the frankest laugh restlessly active after his manner he multiplied himself to wait on all but oh i saw which was his favourite i saw at whose feet he lay on the turf i saw whom he folded carefully from the night air whom he tended watched and cherished as the apple of his eye  still hint and raillery flew thick and still i gathered that while m paul should be absent working for others these others not quite ungrateful would guard for him the treasure he left in europe let him bring them an indian fortune they would give him in return a young bride and a rich inheritance as for the saintly consecration the vow of constancy that was forgotten the blooming and charming present prevailed over the past and at length his nun was indeed buried  thus it must be the revelation was indeed come presentiment had not been mistaken in her impulse there is a kind of presentiment which never is mistaken it was i who had for a moment miscalculated not seeing the true bearing of the oracle i had thought she muttered of vision when in truth her prediction touched reality  i might have paused longer upon what i saw i might have deliberated ere i drew inferences some perhaps would have held the premises doubtful the proofs insufficient some slow sceptics would have incredulously examined ere they conclusively accepted the project of a marriage between a poor and unselfish man of forty and his wealthy ward of eighteen but far from me such shifts and palliatives far from me such temporary evasion of the actual such coward fleeing from the dread the swiftfooted the allovertaking fact such feeble suspense of submission to her the sole sovereign such paltering and faltering resistance to the power whose errand is to march conquering and to conquer such traitor defection from the truth  no i hastened to accept the whole plan i extended my grasp and took it all in i gathered it to me with a sort of rage of haste and folded it round me as the soldier struck on the field folds his colours about his breast i invoked conviction to nail upon me the certainty abhorred while embraced to fix it with the strongest spikes her strongest strokes could drive and when the iron had entered well my soul i stood up as i thought renovated  in my infatuation i said truth you are a good mistress to your faithful servants while a lie pressed me how i suffered even when the falsehood was still sweet still flattering to the fancy and warm to the feelings it wasted me with hourly torment the persuasion that affection was won could not be divorced from the dread that by another turn of the wheel it might be lost truth stripped away falsehood and flattery and expectancy and here i standfree  nothing remained now but to take my freedom to my chamber to carry it with me to my bed and see what i could make of it the play was not yet indeed quite played out i might have waited and watched longer that lovescene under the trees that sylvan courtship had there been nothing of love in the demonstration my fancy in this hour was so generous so creative she could have modelled for it the most salient lineaments and given it the deepest life and highest colour of passion but i would not look i had fixed my resolve but i would not violate my nature and thensomething tore me so cruelly under my shawl something so dug into my side a vulture so strong in beak and talon i must be alone to grapple with it i think i never felt jealousy till now this was not like enduring the endearments of dr john and paulina against which while i sealed my eyes and my ears while i withdrew thence my thoughts my sense of harmony still acknowledged in it a charm this was an outrage the love born of beauty was not mine i had nothing in common with it i could not dare to meddle with it but another love venturing diffidently into life after long acquaintance furnacetried by pain stamped by constancy consolidated by affections pure and durable alloy submitted by intellect to intellects own tests and finally wrought up by his own process to his own unflawed completeness this love that laughed at passion his fast frenzies and his hot and hurried extinction in this love i had a vested interest and whatever tended either to its culture or its destruction i could not view impassibly  i turned from the group of trees and the merrie companie in its shade midnight was long past the concert was over the crowds were thinning i followed the ebb leaving the radiant park and welllit hauteville still well lit this it seems was to be a nuit blanche in villette i sought the dim lower quarter  dim i should not say for the beauty of moonlightforgotten in the parkhere once more flowed in upon perception high she rode and calm and stainlessly she shone the music and the mirth of the fête the fire and bright hues of those lamps had outdone and outshone her for an hour but now again her glory and her silence triumphed the rival lamps were dying she held her course like a white fate drum trumpet bugle had uttered their clangour and were forgotten with pencilray she wrote on heaven and on earth records for archives everlasting she and those stars seemed to me at once the types and witnesses of truth all regnant the nightsky lit her reign like its slowwheeling progress advanced her victorythat onward movement which has been and is and will be from eternity to eternity  these oiltwinkling streets are very still i like them for their lowliness and peace homewardbound burghers pass me now and then but these companies are pedestrians make little noise and are soon gone so well do i love villette under her present aspect not willingly would i reenter under a roof but that i am bent on pursuing my strange adventure to a successful close and quietly regaining my bed in the great dormitory before madame beck comes home  only one street lies between me and the rue fossette as i enter it for the first time the sound of a carriage tears up the deep peace of this quarter it comes this waycomes very fast how loud sounds its rattle on the paved path the street is narrow and i keep carefully to the causeway the carriage thunders past but what do i see or fancy i see as it rushes by surely something white fluttered from that windowsurely a hand waved a handkerchief was that signal meant for me am i known who could recognise me that is not m de bassompierres carriage nor mrs brettons and besides neither the hôtel crécy nor the château of la terrasse lies in that direction well i have no time for conjecture i must hurry home  gaining the rue fossette reaching the pensionnat all there was still no fiacre had yet arrived with madame and désirée i had left the great door ajar should i find it thus perhaps the wind or some other accident may have thrown it to with sufficient force to start the springbolt in that case hopeless became admission my adventure must issue in catastrophe i lightly pushed the heavy leaf would it yield  yes as soundless as unresisting as if some propitious genius had waited on a sesamecharm in the vestibule within entering with bated breath quietly making all fast shoelessly mounting the staircase i sought the dormitory and reached my couch                                       ay i reached it and once more drew a free inspiration the next moment i almost shriekedalmost but not quite thank heaven  throughout the dormitory throughout the house there reigned at this hour the stillness of death all slept and in such hush it seemed that none dreamed stretched on the nineteen beds lay nineteen forms at fulllength and motionless on minethe twentieth couchnothing ought to have lain i had left it void and void should have found it what then do i see between the halfdrawn curtains what dark usurping shape supine long and strange is it a robber who has made his way through the open streetdoor and lies there in wait it looks very black i think it looksnot human can it be a wandering dog that has come in from the street and crept and nestled hither will it spring will it leap out if i approach approach i must courage one step  my head reeled for by the faint nightlamp i saw stretched on my bed the old phantomthe nun  a cry at this moment might have ruined me be the spectacle what it might i could afford neither consternation scream nor swoon besides i was not overcome tempered by late incidents my nerves disdained hysteria warm from illuminations and music and thronging thousands thoroughly lashed up by a new scourge i defied spectra in a moment without exclamation i had rushed on the haunted couch nothing leaped out or sprung or stirred all the movement was mine so was all the life the reality the substance the force as my instinct felt i tore her upthe incubus i held her on highthe goblin i shook her loosethe mystery and down she felldown all around medown in shreds and fragmentsand i trode upon her  here againbehold the branchless tree the unstabled rosinante the film of cloud the flicker of moonshine the long nun proved a long bolster dressed in a long black stole and artfully invested with a white veil the garments in very truth strange as it may seem were genuine nuns garments and by some hand they had been disposed with a view to illusion whence came these vestments who contrived this artifice these questions still remained to the headbandage was pinned a slip of paper it bore in pencil these mocking words  the nun of the attic bequeaths to lucy snowe her wardrobe she will be seen in the rue fossette no more  and what and who was she that had haunted me she i had actually seen three times not a woman of my acquaintance had the stature of that ghost she was not of a female height not to any man i knew could the machination for a moment be attributed  still mystified beyond expression but as thoroughly as suddenly relieved from all sense of the spectral and unearthly scorning also to wear out my brain with the fret of a trivial though insoluble riddle i just bundled together stole veil and bandages thrust them beneath my pillow lay down listened till i heard the wheels of madames homereturning fiacre then turned and worn out by many nights vigils conquered too perhaps by the now reacting narcotic i deeply slept     chapter xl  the happy pair   the day succeeding this remarkable midsummer night proved no common day i do not mean that it brought signs in heaven above or portents on the earth beneath nor do i allude to meteorological phenomena to storm flood or whirlwind on the contrary the sun rose jocund with a july face morning decked her beauty with rubies and so filled her lap with roses that they fell from her in showers making her path blush the hours woke fresh as nymphs and emptying on the early hills their dewvials they stepped out dismantled of vapour shadowless azure and glorious they led the suns steeds on a burning and unclouded course  in short it was as fine a day as the finest summer could boast but i doubt whether i was not the sole inhabitant of the rue fossette who cared or remembered to note this pleasant fact another thought busied all other heads a thought indeed which had its share in my meditations but this master consideration not possessing for me so entire a novelty so overwhelming a suddenness especially so dense a mystery as it offered to the majority of my cospeculators thereon left me somewhat more open than the rest to any collateral observation or impression  still while walking in the garden feeling the sunshine and marking the blooming and growing plants i pondered the same subject the whole house discussed  what subject  merely this when matins came to be said there was a place vacant in the first rank of boarders when breakfast was served there remained a coffeecup unclaimed when the housemaid made the beds she found in one a bolster laid lengthwise clad in a cap and nightgown and when ginevra fanshawes musicmistress came early as usual to give the morning lesson that accomplished and promising young person her pupil failed utterly to be forthcoming  high and low was miss fanshawe sought through length and breadth was the house ransacked vainly not a trace not an indication not so much as a scrap of a billet rewarded the search the nymph was vanished engulfed in the past night like a shooting star swallowed up by darkness  deep was the dismay of surveillante teachers deeper the horror of the defaulting directress never had i seen madame beck so pale or so appalled here was a blow struck at her tender part her weak side here was damage done to her interest how too had the untoward event happened by what outlet had the fugitive taken wing not a casement was found unfastened not a pane of glass broken all the doors were bolted secure never to this day has madame beck obtained satisfaction on this point nor indeed has anybody else concerned save and excepting one lucy snowe who could not forget how to facilitate a certain enterprise a certain great door had been drawn softly to its lintel closed indeed but neither bolted nor secure the thundering carriageandpair encountered were now likewise recalled as well as that puzzling signal the waved handkerchief  from these premises and one or two others inaccessible to any but myself i could draw but one inference it was a case of elopement morally certain on this head and seeing madame becks profound embarrassment i at last communicated my conviction having alluded to m de hamals suit i found as i expected that madame beck was perfectly au fait to that affair she had long since discussed it with mrs cholmondeley and laid her own responsibility in the business on that ladys shoulders to mrs cholmondeley and m de bassompierre she now had recourse  we found that the hôtel crécy was already alive to what had happened ginevra had written to her cousin paulina vaguely signifying hymeneal intentions communications had been received from the family of de hamal m de bassompierre was on the track of the fugitives he overtook them too late  in the course of the week the post brought me a note i may as well transcribe it it contains explanation on more than one point  dear old tim short for timon i am off you seegone like a shot alfred and i intended to be married in this way almost from the first we never meant to be spliced in the humdrum way of other people alfred has too much spirit for that and so have idieu merci do you know alfred who used to call you the dragon has seen so much of you during the last few months that he begins to feel quite friendly towards you he hopes you wont miss him now that he has gone he begs to apologize for any little trouble he may have given you he is afraid he rather inconvenienced you once when he came upon you in the grenier just as you were reading a letter seemingly of the most special interest but he could not resist the temptation to give you a start you appeared so wonderfully taken up with your correspondent en revanche he says you once frightened him by rushing in for a dress or a shawl or some other chiffon at the moment when he had struck a light and was going to take a quiet whiff of his cigar while waiting for me  do you begin to comprehend by this time that m le comte de hamal was the nun of the attic and that he came to see your humble servant i will tell you how he managed it you know he has the entrée of the athénée where two or three of his nephews the sons of his eldest sister madame de melcy are students you know the court of the athénée is on the other side of the high wall bounding your walk the allée défendue alfred can climb as well as he can dance or fence his amusement was to make the escalade of our pensionnat by mounting first the wall thenby the aid of that high tree overspreading the grand berceau and resting some of its boughs on the roof of the lower buildings of our premiseshe managed to scale the first classe and the grand salle one night by the way he fell out of this tree tore down some of the branches nearly broke his own neck and after all in running away got a terrible fright and was nearly caught by two people madame beck and m emanuel he thinks walking in the alley from the grande salle the ascent is not difficult to the highest block of building finishing in the great garret the skylight you know is day and night left half open for air by the skylight he entered nearly a year ago i chanced to tell him our legend of the nun that suggested his romantic idea of the spectral disguise which i think you must allow he has very cleverly carried out  but for the nuns black gown and white veil he would have been caught again and again both by you and that tigerjesuit m paul he thinks you both capital ghostseers and very brave what i wonder at is rather your secretiveness than your courage how could you endure the visitations of that long spectre time after time without crying out telling everybody and rousing the whole house and neighbourhood  oh and how did you like the nun as a bedfellow i dressed her up didnt i do it well did you shriek when you saw her i should have gone mad but then you have such nervesreal iron and bendleather i believe you feel nothing you havent the same sensitiveness that a person of my constitution has you seem to me insensible both to pain and fear and grief you are a real old diogenes  well dear grandmother and are you not mightily angry at my moonlight flitting and run away match i assure you it is excellent fun and i did it partly to spite that minx paulina and that bear dr john to show them that with all their airs i could get married as well as they m de bassompierre was at first in a strange fume with alfred he threatened a prosecution for détournement de mineur and i know not what he was so abominably in earnest that i found myself forced to do a little bit of the melodramaticgo down on my knees sob cry drench three pockethandkerchiefs of course mon oncle soon gave in indeed where was the use of making a fuss i am married and thats all about it he still says our marriage is not legal because i am not of age forsooth as if that made any difference i am just as much married as if i were a hundred however we are to be married again and i am to have a trousseau and mrs cholmondeley is going to superintend it and there are some hopes that m de bassompierre will give me a decent portion which will be very convenient as dear alfred has nothing but his nobility native and hereditary and his pay i only wish uncle would do things unconditionally in a generous gentlemanlike fashion he is so disagreeable as to make the dowry depend on alfreds giving his written promise that he will never touch cards or dice from the day it is paid down they accuse my angel of a tendency to play i dont know anything about that but i do know he is a dear adorable creature  i cannot sufficiently extol the genius with which de hamal managed our flight how clever in him to select the night of the fête when madame for he knows her habits as he said would infallibly be absent at the concert in the park i suppose you must have gone with her i watched you rise and leave the dormitory about eleven oclock how you returned alone and on foot i cannot conjecture that surely was you we met in the narrow old rue st jean did you see me wave my handkerchief from the carriage window  adieu rejoice in my good luck congratulate me on my supreme happiness and believe me dear cynic and misanthrope yours in the best of health and spirits  ginevra laura de hamal née fanshawe  psremember i am a countess now papa mamma and the girls at home will be delighted to hear that my daughter the countess my sister the countess bravo sounds rather better than mrs john bretton hein                                       in winding up mistress fanshawes memoirs the reader will no doubt expect to hear that she came finally to bitter expiation of her youthful levities of course a large share of suffering lies in reserve for her future  a few words will embody my farther knowledge respecting her  i saw her towards the close of her honeymoon she called on madame beck and sent for me into the salon she rushed into my arms laughing she looked very blooming and beautiful her curls were longer her cheeks rosier than ever her white bonnet and her flanders veil her orangeflowers and her brides dress became her mightily  i have got my portion she cried at once ginevra ever stuck to the substantial i always thought there was a good trading element in her composition much as she scorned the bourgeoise and uncle de bassompierre is quite reconciled i dont mind his calling alfred a nincompoopthats only his coarse scotch breeding and i believe paulina envies me and dr john is wild with jealousyfit to blow his brains outand im so happy i really think ive hardly anything left to wish forunless it be a carriage and an hotel and oh imust introduce you to mon mari alfred come here  and alfred appeared from the inner salon where he was talking to madame beck receiving the blended felicitations and reprimands of that lady i was presented under my various names the dragon diogenes and timon the young colonel was very polite he made me a prettilyturned neatlyworded apology about the ghostvisits c concluding with saying that the best excuse for all his iniquities stood there pointing to his bride  and then the bride sent him back to madame beck and she took me to herself and proceeded literally to suffocate me with her unrestrained spirits her girlish giddy wild nonsense she showed her ring exultingly she called herself madame la comtesse de hamal and asked how it sounded a score of times i said very little i gave her only the crust and rind of my nature no matter she expected of me nothing bettershe knew me too well to look for complimentsmy dry gibes pleased her well enough and the more impassible and prosaic my mien the more merrily she laughed  soon after his marriage m de hamal was persuaded to leave the army as the surest way of weaning him from certain unprofitable associates and habits a post of attaché was procured for him and he and his young wife went abroad i thought she would forget me now but she did not for many years she kept up a capricious fitful sort of correspondence during the first year or two it was only of herself and alfred she wrote then alfred faded in the background herself and a certain new comer prevailed one alfred fanshawe de bassompierre de hamal began to reign in his fathers stead there were great boastings about this personage extravagant amplifications upon miracles of precocity mixed with vehement objurgations against the phlegmatic incredulity with which i received them i didnt know what it was to be a mother unfeeling thing that i was the sensibilities of the maternal heart were greek and hebrew to me and so on in due course of nature this young gentleman took his degrees in teething measles hoopingcough that was a terrible time for methe mammas letters became a perfect shout of affliction never woman was so put upon by calamity never human being stood in such need of sympathy i was frightened at first and wrote back pathetically but i soon found out there was more cry than wool in the business and relapsed into my natural cruel insensibility as to the youthful sufferer he weathered each storm like a hero five times was that youth in articulo mortis and five times did he miraculously revive  in the course of years there arose ominous murmurings against alfred the first m de bassompierre had to be appealed to debts had to be paid some of them of that dismal and dingy order called debts of honour ignoble plaints and difficulties became frequent under every cloud no matter what its nature ginevra as of old called out lustily for sympathy and aid she had no notion of meeting any distress singlehanded in some shape from some quarter or other she was pretty sure to obtain her will and so she got onfighting the battle of life by proxy and on the whole suffering as little as any human being i have ever known     chapter xli  faubourg clotilde   must i ere i close render some account of that freedom and renovation which i won on the fêtenight must i tell how i and the two stalwart companions i brought home from the illuminated park bore the test of intimate acquaintance  i tried them the very next day they had boasted their strength loudly when they reclaimed me from love and its bondage but upon my demanding deeds not words some evidence of better comfort some experience of a relieved lifefreedom excused himself as for the present impoverished and disabled to assist and renovation never spoke he had died in the night suddenly  i had nothing left for it then but to trust secretly that conjecture might have hurried me too fast and too far to sustain the oppressive hour by reminders of the distorting and discolouring magic of jealousy after a short and vain struggle i found myself brought back captive to the old rack of suspense tied down and strained anew  shall i yet see him before he goes will he bear me in mind does he purpose to come will this daywill the next hour bring him or must i again assay that corroding pain of long attentthat rude agony of rupture at the close that mute mortal wrench which in at once uprooting hope and doubt shakes life while the hand that does the violence cannot be caressed to pity because absence interposes her barrier  it was the feast of the assumption no school was held the boarders and teachers after attending mass in the morning were gone a long walk into the country to take their goûter or afternoon meal at some farmhouse i did not go with them for now but two days remained ere the paul et virginie must sail and i was clinging to my last chance as the living waif of a wreck clings to his last raft or cable  there was some joiners work to do in the first classe some bench or desk to repair holidays were often turned to account for the performance of these operations which could not be executed when the rooms were filled with pupils as i sat solitary purposing to adjourn to the garden and leave the coast clear but too listless to fulfil my own intent i heard the workmen coming  foreign artisans and servants do everything by couples i believe it would take two labassecourien carpenters to drive a nail while tying on my bonnet which had hitherto hung by its ribbons from my idle hand i vaguely and momentarily wondered to hear the step of but one ouvrier i noted tooas captives in dungeons find sometimes dreary leisure to note the merest triflesthat this man wore shoes and not sabots i concluded that it must be the mastercarpenter coming to inspect before he sent his journeymen i threw round me my scarf he advanced he opened the door my back was towards it i felt a little thrilla curious sensation too quick and transient to be analyzed i turned i stood in the supposed masterartisans presence looking towards the doorway i saw it filled with a figure and my eyes printed upon my brain the picture of m paul  hundreds of the prayers with which we weary heaven bring to the suppliant no fulfilment once haply in life one golden gift falls prone in the lapone boon full and bright perfect from fruitions mint  m emanuel wore the dress in which he probably purposed to travela surtout guarded with velvet i thought him prepared for instant departure and yet i had understood that two days were yet to run before the ship sailed he looked well and cheerful he looked kind and benign he came in with eagerness he was close to me in one second he was all amity it might be his bridegroom mood which thus brightened him whatever the cause i could not meet his sunshine with cloud if this were my last moment with him i would not waste it in forced unnatural distance i loved him welltoo well not to smite out of my path even jealousy herself when she would have obstructed a kind farewell a cordial word from his lips or a gentle look from his eyes would do me good for all the span of life that remained to me it would be comfort in the last strait of loneliness i would take iti would taste the elixir and pride should not spill the cup  the interview would be short of course he would say to me just what he had said to each of the assembled pupils he would take and hold my hand two minutes he would touch my cheek with his lips for the first last only timeand thenno more then indeed the final parting then the wide separation the great gulf i could not pass to go to himacross which haply he would not glance to remember me  he took my hand in one of his with the other he put back my bonnet he looked into my face his luminous smile went out his lips expressed something almost like the wordless language of a mother who finds a child greatly and unexpectedly changed broken with illness or worn out by want a check supervened  paul paul said a womans hurried voice behind paul come into the salon i have yet a great many things to say to youconversation for the whole dayand so has victor and josef is here come paul come to your friends  madame beck brought to the spot by vigilance or an inscrutable instinct pressed so near she almost thrust herself between me and m emanuel  come paul she reiterated her eye grazing me with its hard ray like a steel stylet she pushed against her kinsman i thought he receded i thought he would go pierced deeper than i could endure made now to feel what defied suppression i cried  my heart will break  what i felt seemed literal heartbreak but the seal of another fountain yielded under the strain one breath from m paul the whisper trust me lifted a load opened an outlet with many a deep sob with thrilling with icy shiver with strong trembling and yet with reliefi wept  leave her to me it is a crisis i will give her a cordial and it will pass said the calm madame beck  to be left to her and her cordial seemed to me something like being left to the poisoner and her bowl when m paul answered deeply harshly and brieflylaissezmoi in the grim sound i felt a music strange strong but lifegiving  laissezmoi he repeated his nostrils opening and his facial muscles all quivering as he spoke  but this will never do said madame with sternness more sternly rejoined her kinsman  sortez dici  i will send for père silas on the spot i will send for him she threatened pertinaciously  femme cried the professor not now in his deep tones but in his highest and most excited key femme sortez à linstant  he was roused and i loved him in his wrath with a passion beyond what i had yet felt  what you do is wrong pursued madame it is an act characteristic of men of your unreliable imaginative temperament a step impulsive injudicious inconsistenta proceeding vexatious and not estimable in the view of persons of steadier and more resolute character  you know not what i have of steady and resolute in me said he but you shall see the event shall teach you modeste he continued less fiercely be gentle be pitying be a woman look at this poor face and relent you know i am your friend and the friend of your friends in spite of your taunts you well and deeply know i may be trusted of sacrificing myself i made no difficulty but my heart is pained by what i see it must have and give solace leave me  this time in the leave me there was an intonation so bitter and so imperative i wondered that even madame beck herself could for one moment delay obedience but she stood firm she gazed upon him dauntless she met his eye forbidding and fixed as stone she was opening her lips to retort i saw over all m pauls face a quick rising light and fire i can hardly tell how he managed the movement it did not seem violent it kept the form of courtesy he gave his hand it scarce touched her i thought she ran she whirled from the room she was gone and the door shut in one second  the flash of passion was all over very soon he smiled as he told me to wipe my eyes he waited quietly till i was calm dropping from time to time a stilling solacing word ere long i sat beside him once more myselfreassured not desperate nor yet desolate not friendless not hopeless not sick of life and seeking death  it made you very sad then to lose your friend said he  it kills me to be forgotten monsieur i said all these weary days i have not heard from you one word and i was crushed with the possibility growing to certainty that you would depart without saying farewell  must i tell you what i told modeste beckthat you do not know me must i show and teach you my character you will have proof that i can be a firm friend without clear proof this hand will not lie still in mine it will not trust my shoulder as a safe stay good the proof is ready i come to justify myself  say anything teach anything prove anything monsieur i can listen now  then in the first place you must go out with me a good distance into the town i came on purpose to fetch you  without questioning his meaning or sounding his plan or offering the semblance of an objection i retied my bonnet i was ready  the route he took was by the boulevards he several times made me sit down on the seats stationed under the limetrees he did not ask if i was tired but looked and drew his own conclusions  all these weary days said he repeating my words with a gentle kindly mimicry of my voice and foreign accent not new from his lips and of which the playful banter never wounded not even when coupled as it often was with the assertion that however i might write his language i spoke and always should speak it imperfectly and hesitatingly all these weary days i have not for one hour forgotten you faithful women err in this that they think themselves the sole faithful of gods creatures on a very fervent and living truth to myself i too till lately scarce dared count from any quarter butlook at me  i lifted my happy eyes they were happy now or they would have been no interpreters of my heart  well said he after some seconds scrutiny there is no denying that signature constancy wrote it her pen is of iron was the record painful  severely painful i said with truth withdraw her hand monsieur i can bear its inscribing force no more  elle est toute pâle said he speaking to himself cette figurelà me fait mal  ah i am not pleasant to look at  i could not help saying this the words came unbidden i never remember the time when i had not a haunting dread of what might be the degree of my outward deficiency this dread pressed me at the moment with special force  a great softness passed upon his countenance his violet eyes grew suffused and glistening under their deep spanish lashes he started up let us walk on  do i displease your eyes much i took courage to urge the point had its vital import for me  he stopped and gave me a short strong answer an answer which silenced subdued yet profoundly satisfied ever after that i knew what i was for him and what i might be for the rest of the world i ceased painfully to care was it weak to lay so much stress on an opinion about appearance i fear it might be i fear it was but in that case i must avow no light share of weakness i must own great fear of displeasinga strong wish moderately to please m paul  whither we rambled i scarce knew our walk was long yet seemed short the path was pleasant the day lovely m emanuel talked of his voyagehe thought of staying away three years on his return from guadaloupe he looked forward to release from liabilities and a clear course and what did i purpose doing in the interval of his absence he asked i had talked once he reminded me of trying to be independent and keeping a little school of my own had i dropped the idea  indeed i had not i was doing my best to save what would enable me to put it in practice  he did not like leaving me in the rue fossette he feared i should miss him there too muchi should feel desolatei should grow sad  this was certain but i promised to do my best to endure  still said he speaking low there is another objection to your present residence i should wish to write to you sometimes it would not be well to have any uncertainty about the safe transmission of letters and in the rue fossettein short our catholic discipline in certain mattersthough justifiable and expedientmight possibly under peculiar circumstances become liable to misapplicationperhaps abuse  but if you write said i i must have your letters and i will have them ten directors twenty directresses shall not keep them from me i am a protestant i will not bear that kind of discipline monsieur i will not  doucementdoucement rejoined he we will contrive a plan we have our resources soyez tranquille  so speaking he paused  we were now returning from the long walk we had reached the middle of a clean faubourg where the houses were small but looked pleasant it was before the white doorstep of a very neat abode that m paul had halted  i call here said he  he did not knock but taking from his pocket a key he opened and entered at once ushering me in he shut the door behind us no servant appeared the vestibule was small like the house but freshly and tastefully painted its vista closed in a french window with vines trained about the panes tendrils and green leaves kissing the glass silence reigned in this dwelling  opening an inner door m paul disclosed a parlour or salonvery tiny but i thought very pretty its delicate walls were tinged like a blush its floor was waxed a square of brilliant carpet covered its centre its small round table shone like the mirror over its hearth there was a little couch a little chiffonnière the halfopen crimsonsilk door of which showed porcelain on the shelves there was a french clock a lamp there were ornaments in biscuit china the recess of the single ample window was filled with a green stand bearing three green flowerpots each filled with a fine plant glowing in bloom in one corner appeared a guéridon with a marble top and upon it a workbox and a glass filled with violets in water the lattice of this room was open the outer air breathing through gave freshness the sweet violets lent fragrance  pretty pretty place said i m paul smiled to see me so pleased  must we sit down here and wait i asked in a whisper half awed by the deep pervading hush  we will first peep into one or two other nooks of this nutshell he replied  dare you take the freedom of going all over the house i inquired  yes i dare said he quietly  he led the way i was shown a little kitchen with a little stove and oven with few but bright brasses two chairs and a table a small cupboard held a diminutive but commodious set of earthenware  there is a coffee service of china in the salon said m paul as i looked at the six green and white dinnerplates the four dishes the cups and jugs to match  conducted up the narrow but clean staircase i was permitted a glimpse of two pretty cabinets of sleepingrooms finally i was once more led below and we halted with a certain ceremony before a larger door than had yet been opened  producing a second key m emanuel adjusted it to the lock of this door he opened put me in before him  voici he cried  i found myself in a goodsized apartment scrupulously clean though bare compared with those i had hitherto seen the wellscoured boards were carpetless it contained two rows of green benches and desks with an alley down the centre terminating in an estrade a teachers chair and table behind them a tableau on the walls hung two maps in the windows flowered a few hardy plants in short here was a miniature classecomplete neat pleasant  it is a school then said i who keeps it i never heard of an establishment in this faubourg  will you have the goodness to accept of a few prospectuses for distribution in behalf of a friend of mine asked he taking from his surtoutpocket some quires of these documents and putting them into my hand i looked i readprinted in fair characters  externat de demoiselles numéro 7 faubourg clotilde directrice mademoiselle lucy snowe                                       and what did i say to m paul emanuel  certain junctures of our lives must always be difficult of recall to memory certain points crises certain feelings joys griefs and amazements when reviewed must strike us as things wildered and whirling dim as a wheel fast spun  i can no more remember the thoughts or the words of the ten minutes succeeding this disclosure than i can retrace the experience of my earliest year of life and yet the first thing distinct to me is the consciousness that i was speaking very fast repeating over and over again  did you do this m paul is this your house did you furnish it did you get these papers printed do you mean me am i the directress is there another lucy snowe tell me say something  but he would not speak his pleased silence his laughing downlook his attitude are visible to me now  how is it i must know allall i cried  the packet of papers fell on the floor he had extended his hand and i had fastened thereon oblivious of all else  ah you said i had forgotten you all these weary days said he poor old emanuel these are the thanks he gets for trudging about three mortal weeks from housepainter to upholsterer from cabinetmaker to charwoman lucy and lucys cot the sole thoughts in his head  i hardly knew what to do i first caressed the soft velvet on his cuff and then i stroked the hand it surrounded it was his foresight his goodness his silent strong effective goodness that overpowered me by their proved reality it was the assurance of his sleepless interest which broke on me like a light from heaven it was hisi will dare to say ithis fond tender look which now shook me indescribably in the midst of all i forced myself to look at the practical  the trouble i cried and the cost had you money m paul  plenty of money said he heartily the disposal of my large teaching connection put me in possession of a handsome sum with part of it i determined to give myself the richest treat that i have known or shall know i like this i have reckoned on this hour day and night lately i would not come near you because i would not forestall it reserve is neither my virtue nor my vice if i had put myself into your power and you had begun with your questions of look and lipwhere have you been m paul what have you been doing what is your mysterymy solitary first and last secret would presently have unravelled itself in your lap now he pursued you shall live here and have a school you shall employ yourself while i am away you shall think of me sometimes you shall mind your health and happiness for my sake and when i come back  there he left a blank  i promised to do all he told me i promised to work hard and willingly i will be your faithful steward i said i trust at your coming the account will be ready monsieur monsieur you are too good  in such inadequate language my feelings struggled for expression they could not get it speech brittle and unmalleable and cold as ice dissolved or shivered in the effort he watched me still he gently raised his hand to stroke my hair it touched my lips in passing i pressed it close i paid it tribute he was my king royal for me had been that hands bounty to offer homage was both a joy and a duty                                       the afternoon hours were over and the stiller time of evening shaded the quiet faubourg m paul claimed my hospitality occupied and afoot since morning he needed refreshment he said i should offer him chocolate in my pretty gold and white china service he went out and ordered what was needful from the restaurant he placed the small guéridon and two chairs in the balcony outside the french window under the screening vines with what shy joy i accepted my part as hostess arranged the salver served the benefactorguest  this balcony was in the rear of the house the gardens of the faubourg were round us fields extended beyond the air was still mild and fresh above the poplars the laurels the cypresses and the roses looked up a moon so lovely and so halcyon the heart trembled under her smile a star shone subject beside her with the unemulous ray of pure love in a large garden near us a jet rose from a well and a pale statue leaned over the play of waters  m paul talked to me his voice was so modulated that it mixed harmonious with the silver whisper the gush the musical sigh in which light breeze fountain and foliage intoned their lulling vesper  happy hourstay one moment droop those plumes rest those wings incline to mine that brow of heaven white angel let thy light linger leave its reflection on succeeding clouds bequeath its cheer to that time which needs a ray in retrospect  our meal was simple the chocolate the rolls the plate of fresh summer fruit cherries and strawberries bedded in green leaves formed the whole but it was what we both liked better than a feast and i took a delight inexpressible in tending m paul i asked him whether his friends père silas and madame beck knew what he had donewhether they had seen my house  mon amie said he none knows what i have done save you and myself the pleasure is consecrated to us two unshared and unprofaned to speak truth there has been to me in this matter a refinement of enjoyment i would not make vulgar by communication besides smiling i wanted to prove to miss lucy that i could keep a secret how often has she taunted me with lack of dignified reserve and needful caution how many times has she saucily insinuated that all my affairs are the secret of polichinelle  this was true enough i had not spared him on this point nor perhaps on any other that was assailable magnificentminded grandhearted dear faulty little man you deserved candour and from me always had it  continuing my queries i asked to whom the house belonged who was my landlord the amount of my rent he instantly gave me these particulars in writing he had foreseen and prepared all things  the house was not m paulsthat i guessed he was hardly the man to become a proprietor i more than suspected in him a lamentable absence of the saving faculty he could get but not keep he needed a treasurer the tenement then belonged to a citizen in the bassevillea man of substance m paul said he startled me by adding a friend of yours miss lucy a person who has a most respectful regard for you and to my pleasant surprise i found the landlord was none other than m miret the shorttempered and kindhearted bookseller who had so kindly found me a seat that eventful night in the park it seems m miret was in his station rich as well as much respected and possessed several houses in this faubourg the rent was moderate scarce half of what it would have been for a house of equal size nearer the centre of villette  and then observed m paul should fortune not favour you though i think she will i have the satisfaction to think you are in good hands m miret will not be extortionate the first years rent you have already in your savings afterwards miss lucy must trust god and herself but now what will you do for pupils  i must distribute my prospectuses  right by way of losing no time i gave one to m miret yesterday should you object to beginning with three petite bourgeoises the demoiselles miret they are at your service  monsieur you forget nothing you are wonderful object it would become me indeed to object i suppose i hardly expect at the outset to number aristocrats in my little dayschool i care not if they never come i shall be proud to receive m mirets daughters  besides these pursued he another pupil offers who will come daily to take lessons in english and as she is rich she will pay handsomely i mean my goddaughter and ward justine marie sauveur  what is in a namewhat in three words till this moment i had listened with living joyi had answered with gleeful quickness a name froze me three words struck me mute the effect could not be hidden and indeed i scarce tried to hide it  what now said m paul  nothing  nothing your countenance changes your colour and your very eyes fade nothing you must be ill you have some suffering tell me what  i had nothing to tell  he drew his chair nearer he did not grow vexed though i continued silent and icy he tried to win a word he entreated with perseverance he waited with patience  justine marie is a good girl said he docile and amiable not quickbut you will like her  i think not i think she must not come here  such was my speech  do you wish to puzzle me do you know her but in truth there is something again you are pale as that statue rely on paul carlos tell him the grief  his chair touched mine his hand quietly advanced turned me towards him  do you know marie justine said he again  the name repronounced by his lips overcame me unaccountably it did not prostrateno it stirred me up running with haste and heat through my veinsrecalling an hour of quick pain many days and nights of heartsickness near me as he now sat strongly and closely as he had long twined his life in minefar as had progressed and near as was achieved our minds and affections assimilationthe very suggestion of interference of heartseparation could be heard only with a fermenting excitement an impetuous throe a disdainful resolve an ire a resistance of which no human eye or cheek could hide the flame nor any truthaccustomed human tongue curb the cry  i want to tell you something i said i want to tell you all  speak lucy come near speak who prizes you if i do not who is your friend if not emanuel speak  i spoke all escaped from my lips i lacked not words now fast i narrated fluent i told my tale it streamed on my tongue i went back to the night in the park i mentioned the medicated draughtwhy it was givenits goading effecthow it had torn rest from under my head shaken me from my couch carried me abroad with the lure of a vivid yet solemn fancya summernight solitude on turf under trees near a deep cool lakelet i told the scene realized the crowd the masques the music the lamps the splendours the guns booming afar the bells sounding on high all i had encountered i detailed all i had recognised heard and seen how i had beheld and watched himself how i listened how much heard what conjectured the whole history in brief summoned to his confidence rushed thither truthful literal ardent bitter  still as i narrated instead of checking he incited me to proceed he spurred me by the gesture the smile the halfword before i had half done he held both my hands he consulted my eyes with a most piercing glance there was something in his face which tended neither to calm nor to put me down he forgot his own doctrine he forsook his own system of repression when i most challenged its exercise i think i deserved strong reproof but when have we our deserts i merited severity he looked indulgence to my very self i seemed imperious and unreasonable for i forbade justine marie my door and roof he smiled betraying delight warm jealous and haughty i knew not till now that my nature had such a mood he gathered me near his heart i was full of faults he took them and me all home for the moment of utmost mutiny he reserved the one deep spell of peace these words caressed my ear  lucy take my love one day share my life be my dearest first on earth  we walked back to the rue fossette by moonlightsuch moonlight as fell on edenshining through the shades of the great garden and haply gilding a path glorious for a step divinea presence nameless once in their lives some men and women go back to these first fresh days of our great sire and mothertaste that grand mornings dewbathe in its sunrise  in the course of the walk i was told how justine marie sauveur had always been regarded with the affection proper to a daughterhow with m pauls consent she had been affianced for months to one heinrich mühler a wealthy young german merchant and was to be married in the course of a year some of m emanuels relations and connections would indeed it seems have liked him to marry her with a view to securing her fortune in the family but to himself the scheme was repugnant and the idea totally inadmissible  we reached madame becks door jean baptistes clock tolled nine at this hour in this house eighteen months since had this man at my side bent before me looked into my face and eyes and arbitered my destiny this very evening he had again stooped gazed and decreed how different the lookhow far otherwise the fate  he deemed me born under his star he seemed to have spread over me its beam like a banner onceunknown and unloved i held him harsh and strange the low stature the wiry make the angles the darkness the manner displeased me now penetrated with his influence and living by his affection having his worth by intellect and his goodness by hearti preferred him before all humanity  we parted he gave me his pledge and then his farewell we parted the next dayhe sailed     chapter xlii  finis   man cannot prophesy love is no oracle fear sometimes imagines a vain thing those years of absence how had i sickened over their anticipation the woe they must bring seemed certain as death i knew the nature of their course i never had doubt how it would harrow as it went the juggernaut on his car towered

parallels in lifes experiencethat anticipatory craunch proved allyesnearly all the torture the great juggernaut in his great chariot drew on lofty loud and sullen he passed quietly like a shadow sweeping the sky at noon nothing but a chilling dimness was seen or felt i looked up chariot and demon charioteer were gone by the votary still lived  m emanuel was away three years reader they were the three happiest years of my life do you scout the paradox listen i commenced my school i workedi worked hard i deemed myself the steward of his property and determined god willing to render a good account pupils cameburghers at firsta higher class ere long about the middle of the second year an unexpected chance threw into my hands an additional hundred pounds one day i received from england a letter containing that sum it came from mr marchmont the cousin and heir of my dear and dead mistress he was just recovering from a dangerous illness the money was a peaceoffering to his conscience reproaching him in the matter of i know not what papers or memoranda found after his kinswomans deathnaming or recommending lucy snowe mrs barrett had given him my address how far his conscience had been sinned against i never inquired i asked no questions but took the cash and made it useful  with this hundred pounds i ventured to take the house adjoining mine i would not leave that which m paul had chosen in which he had left and where he expected again to find me my externat became a pensionnat that also prospered  the secret of my success did not lie so much in myself in any endowment any power of mine as in a new state of circumstances a wonderfully changed life a relieved heart the spring which moved my energies lay far away beyond seas in an indian isle at parting i had been left a legacy such a thought for the present such a hope for the future such a motive for a persevering a laborious an enterprising a patient and a brave coursei could not flag few things shook me now few things had importance to vex intimidate or depress me most things pleasedmere trifles had a charm  do not think that this genial flame sustained itself or lived wholly on a bequeathed hope or a parting promise a generous provider supplied bounteous fuel i was spared all chill all stint i was not suffered to fear penury i was not tried with suspense by every vessel he wrote he wrote as he gave and as he loved in fullhanded fullhearted plenitude he wrote because he liked to write he did not abridge because he cared not to abridge he sat down he took pen and paper because he loved lucy and had much to say to her because he was faithful and thoughtful because he was tender and true there was no sham and no cheat and no hollow unreal in him apology never dropped her slippery oil on his lipsnever proffered by his pen her coward feints and paltry nullities he would give neither a stone nor an excuseneither a scorpion nor a disappointment his letters were real food that nourished living water that refreshed  and was i grateful god knows i believe that scarce a living being so remembered so sustained dealt with in kind so constant honourable and noble could be otherwise than grateful to the death  adherent to his own religion in him was not the stuff of which is made the facile apostate he freely left me my pure faith he did not tease nor tempt he said  remain a protestant my little english puritan i love protestantism in you i own its severe charm there is something in its ritual i cannot receive myself but it is the sole creed for lucy  all rome could not put into him bigotry nor the propaganda itself make him a real jesuit he was born honest and not falseartless and not cunninga freeman and not a slave his tenderness had rendered him ductile in a priests hands his affection his devotedness his sincere pious enthusiasm blinded his kind eyes sometimes made him abandon justice to himself to do the work of craft and serve the ends of selfishness but these are faults so rare to find so costly to their owner to indulge we scarce know whether they will not one day be reckoned amongst the jewels                                       and now the three years are past m emanuels return is fixed it is autumn he is to be with me ere the mists of november come my school flourishes my house is ready i have made him a little library filled its shelves with the books he left in my care i have cultivated out of love for him i was naturally no florist the plants he preferred and some of them are yet in bloom i thought i loved him when he went away i love him now in another degree he is more my own  the sun passes the equinox the days shorten the leaves grow sere buthe is coming  frosts appear at night november has sent his fogs in advance the wind takes its autumn moan buthe is coming  the skies hang full and darka wrack sails from the west the clouds cast themselves into strange formsarches and broad radiations there rise resplendent morningsglorious royal purple as monarch in his state the heavens are one flame so wild are they they rival battle at its thickestso bloody they shame victory in her pride i know some signs of the sky i have noted them ever since childhood god watch that sail oh guard it  the wind shifts to the west peace peace bansheekeening at every window it will riseit will swellit shrieks out long wander as i may through the house this night i cannot lull the blast the advancing hours make it strong by midnight all sleepless watchers hear and fear a wild southwest storm that storm roared frenzied for seven days it did not cease till the atlantic was strewn with wrecks it did not lull till the deeps had gorged their full of sustenance not till the destroying angel of tempest had achieved his perfect work would he fold the wings whose waft was thunderthe tremor of whose plumes was storm  peace be still oh a thousand weepers praying in agony on waiting shores listened for that voice but it was not utterednot uttered till when the hush came some could not feel it till when the sun returned his light was night to some  here pause pause at once there is enough said trouble no quiet kind heart leave sunny imaginations hope let it be theirs to conceive the delight of joy born again fresh out of great terror the rapture of rescue from peril the wondrous reprieve from dread the fruition of return let them picture union and a happy succeeding life  madame beck prospered all the days of her life so did père silas madame walravens fulfilled her ninetieth year before she died farewell  the
