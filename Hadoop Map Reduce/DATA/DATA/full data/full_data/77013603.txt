roseshaded electric lights let us drink to them wolfendenmr felix  to all such meetings echoed his visàvis also fingering the delicate stem of his glass an excellent toast  to all such meetings as these murmured the third man who made up the little party a capital toast indeed  they sat at a little round table in the brilliantlylit supperroom of one of londons most fashionable restaurants around them were the usual throng of well dressed men of women with bare shoulders and flashing diamonds of darkvisaged waiters deft silent swiftfooted the pleasant hum of conversation louder and more unrestrained as the hour grew towards midnight was varied by the popping of corks and many little trills of feminine laughter of discordant sounds there were none the waiters feet fell noiselessly upon the thick carpet the clatter of plates was a thing unheard of from the balcony outside came the low sweet music of a german orchestra played by master hands  as usual the place was filled several latecomers who had neglected to order their table beforehand had already after a disconsolate tour of the room been led to one of the smaller apartments or had driven off again to where the lights from the larger but less smart altoné flashed out upon the smooth dark waters of the thames only one table was as yet unoccupied and that was within a yard or two of the three young men who were celebrating a chance meeting in pall mall so pleasantly it was laid for two only and a magnificent bunch of white roses had a few minutes before been brought in and laid in front of one of the places by the director of the rooms himself a mans small visitingcard was leaning against a wineglass the table was evidently reserved by some one of importance for several latecomers had pointed to it only to be met by a decided shake of the head on the part of the waiter to whom they had appealed as time went on this empty table became the object of some speculation to the three young men  our neighbours remarked wolfenden are running it pretty fine can you see whose name is upon the card densham  the man addressed raised an eyeglass to his left eye and leaned forward then he shook his head he was a little too far away  no it is a short name seems to begin with s probably a son of israel  his taste in flowers is at any rate irreproachable wolfenden remarked i wish they would come i am in a genial mood and i do not like to think of any one having to hurry over such an excellent supper  the lady densham suggested is probably theatrical and has to dress after the show halfpast twelve is a barbarous hour to turn us out i wonder  shsh  the slight exclamation and a meaning frown from wolfenden checked his speech he broke off in the middle of his sentence and looked round there was the soft swish of silk passing his chair and the faint suggestion of a delicate and perfectly strange perfume at last the table was being taken possession of a girl in a wonderful white dress was standing there leaning over to admire the great bunch of creamywhite blossoms whilst a waiter respectfully held a chair for her a few steps behind came her companion an elderly man who walked with a slight limp leaning heavily upon a stick she turned to him and made some remark in french pointing to the flowers he smiled and passing her stood for a moment leaning slightly upon the back of his chair waiting with a courtesy which was obviously instinctive until she should have seated herself during the few seconds which elapsed before they were settled in their places he glanced around the room with a smile slightly cynical but still goodnatured parting his thin wellshaped lips wolfenden and densham who were looking at him with frank curiosity he glanced at carelessly the third young man of the party felix was bending low over his plate and his face was hidden  the buzz of conversation in their immediate vicinity had been temporarily suspended every one who had seen them enter had been interested in these latecomers and many curious eyes had followed them to their seats briefly the girl was beautiful and the man distinguished when they had taken their places however the hum of conversation recommenced densham and wolfenden leaned over to one another and their questions were almost simultaneous  who are they  who is she  alas neither of them knew neither of them had the least idea felix wolfendens guest it seemed useless to ask he had only just arrived in england and he was a complete stranger to london besides he did not seem to be interested he was proceeding calmly with his supper with his back directly turned upon the newcomers beyond one rapid upward glance at their entrance he seemed almost to have avoided looking at them wolfenden thought of this afterwards  i see harcutt in the corner he said he will know who they are for certain i shall go and ask him  he crossed the room and chatted for a few minutes with a noisy little party in an adjacent recess presently he put his question alas not one of them knew harcutt a journalist of some note and a man who prided himself upon knowing absolutely everybody was as helpless as the rest to his humiliation he was obliged to confess it  i never saw either of them before in my life he said i cannot imagine who they can be they are certainly foreigners  very likely wolfenden agreed quietly in fact i never doubted it an english girl of that ageshe is very young by the byewould never be so perfectly turned out  what a very horrid thing to say lord wolfenden exclaimed the woman on whose chair his hand was resting dont you know that dressing is altogether a matter of ones maid you may rely upon it that that girl has found a treasure  well i dont know wolfenden said smiling young english girls always seem to me to look so dishevelled in evening dress now this girl is dressed with the art of a frenchwoman of mature years and yet with the simplicity of a child  the woman laid down her lorgnettes and shrugged her shoulders  i agree with you she said that she is probably not english if she were she would not wear such diamonds at her age  by the bye harcutt remarked with sudden cheerfulness we shall be able to find out who the man is when we leave the table was reserved so the name will be on the list at the door  his friends rose to leave and harcutt making his adieux crossed the room with wolfenden  we may as well have our coffee together he said i ordered turkish and ive been waiting for it ten minutes we got here early hullo wheres your other guest  densham was sitting alone wolfenden looked at him inquiringly  your friend felix has gone he announced suddenly remembered an engagement with his chief and begged you to excuse him said hed look you up tomorrow  well hes an odd fellow wolfenden remarked motioning harcutt to the vacant place his looks certainly belie his name  hes not exactly a cheerful companion for a supper party densham admitted but i like his face how did you come across him wolfenden and where does he hail from  hes a junior attaché at the russian embassy wolfenden said stirring his coffee only just been appointed charlie meynell gave him a line of introduction to me said he was a decent sort but mopish i looked him up last week met him in pall mall just as you came along and asked you both to supper what liqueurs harcutt  the conversation drifted into ordinary channels and flowed on steadily at the same time it was maintained with a certain amount of difficulty the advent of these two people at the next table had produced an extraordinary effect upon the three men harcutt was perhaps the least affected he was a young man of fortune and natural gifts who had embraced journalism as a career and was really in love with his profession partly on account of his social position which was unquestioned and partly because his tastes tended in that direction he had become the recognised scribe and chronicle of smart society his pen was easy and fluent he was an inimitable maker of short paragraphs he prided himself upon knowing everybody and all about them he could have told how much a year densham a rising young portrait painter was making from his profession and exactly what wolfendens allowance from his father was a strange face was an annoyance to him too a humiliation he had been piqued that he could not answer the eager questions of his own party as to these two people and subsequently wolfendens inquiries the thought that very soon at any rate their name would be known to him was in a sense a consolation the rest would be easy until he knew all about them he meant to conceal so far as possible his own interest     chapter ii  a drama of the pavement   the pitch of conversation had risen higher still mingled with the intermittent popping of corks and the striking of matches blue wreaths of cigarette smoke were curling upwardsa delicate feeling of abandon was making itself felt amongst the roomful of people the music grew softer as the babel of talk grew in volume the whole environment became tinged with a faint but genial voluptuousness densham was laughing over the foibles of some mutual acquaintance wolfenden leaned back in his chair smoking a cigarette and sipping his turkish coffee his eyes scarcely left for a moment the girl who sat only a few yards away from him trifling with a certain dainty indifference with the little dishes which one after the other had been placed before her and removed he had taken pains to withdraw himself from the discussion in which his friends were interested he wanted to be quite free to watch her to him she was certainly the most wonderful creature he had ever seen in every one of her most trifling actions she seemed possessed of an original and curious grace even the way she held her silver fork toyed with her serviette raised her glass to her lips and set it down againall these little things she seemed to him to accomplish with a peculiar and wonderful daintiness of conversation between her companion and herself there was evidently very little nor did she appear to expect it he was enjoying his supper with the moderation and minute care for trifles which denote the epicure and he only spoke to her between the courses she on the other hand appeared to be eating scarcely anything at last however the waiter set before her a dish in which she was evidently interested wolfenden recognised the pink frilled paper and smiled she was human enough then to care for ices she bent over it and shrugged her shouldersturning to the waiter who was hovering near she asked a question he bowed and removed the plate in a moment or two he reappeared with another this time the paper and its contents were brown she smiled as she helped herselfsuch a smile that wolfenden wondered that the waiter did not lose his head and hand her pepper and salt instead of gravely filling her glass she took up her spoon and deliberately tasted the contents of her plate then she looked across the table and spoke the first words in english which he had heard from her lips  coffee ice so much nicer than strawberry  the man nodded back  ices after supper are an abomination he said they spoil the flavour of your wine and many other things but after all i suppose it is waste of time to tell you so a woman never understands how to eat until she is fifty  she laughed and deliberately finished the ice just as she laid down the spoon she raised her eyes quietly and encountered wolfendens he looked away at once with an indifference which he felt to be badly assumed did she know he wondered that he had been watching her like an owl all the time he felt hot and uncomfortablea veritable schoolboy at the thought he plunged into the conversation between harcutt and denshama conversation which they had been sustaining with an effort they too were still as interested in their neighbours although their positions at the table made it difficult for either to observe them closely  when three men are each thinking intently of something else it is not easy to maintain an intelligent discussion wolfenden to create a diversion called for the bill when he had paid it and they were ready to depart densham looked up with a little burst of candour  shes wonderful he exclaimed softly  marvellous wolfenden echoed  i wonder who on earth they can possibly be harcutt said almost peevishly already he was being robbed of some part of his contemplated satisfaction it was true that he would probably find the mans name on the tablelist at the door but he had a sort of presentiment that the girls personality would elude him the question of relationship between the man and the girl puzzled him he propounded the problem and they discussed it with bated breath there was no likeness at all was there any relationship it was significant that although harcutt was a scandalmonger and wolfenden somewhat of a cynic they discussed it with the most profound respect relationship after all of some sort there must be what was it it was harcutt who alone suggested what to wolfenden seemed an abominable possibility  scarcely husband and wife i should think he said thoughtfully yet one never can tell  involuntarily they all three glanced towards the man he was well preserved and his little imperial and short grey moustache were trimmed with military precision yet his hair was almost white and his age could scarcely be less than sixty in his way he was quite as interesting as the girl his eyes underneath his thick brows were dark and clear and his features were strong and delicately shaped his hands were white and very shapely the fingers were rather long and he wore two singularly handsome rings both set with strange stones by the side of the table rested the stick upon which he had been leaning during his passage through the room it was of smooth dark wood polished like a malacca cane and set at the top with a curious green opalescent stone as large as a sparrows egg the eyes of the three men had each in turn been arrested by it in the electric light which fell softly upon the upper part of it the stone seemed to burn and glow with a peculiar iridescent radiance evidently it was a precious possession for once when a waiter had offered to remove it to a stand at the other end of the room the man had stopped him sharply and drawn it a little closer towards him  wolfenden lit a fresh cigarette and gazed thoughtfully into the little cloud of blue smoke  husband and wife he repeated slowly what an absurd idea more likely father and daughter  how about the roses harcutt remarked a father does not as a rule show such excellent taste in flowers  they had finished supper suddenly the girl stretched out her left hand and took a glove from the table wolfenden smiled triumphantly  she has no weddingring he exclaimed softly  then harcutt for the first time made a remark for which he was never altogether forgivena remark which both the other men received in chilling silence  that may or may not be a matter for congratulation he said twirling his moustache one never knows  wolfenden stood up turning his back upon harcutt and pointedly ignoring him  let us go densham he said we are almost the last  as a matter of fact his movement was made at exactly the right time they could scarcely have left the room at the same moment as these two people in whom manifestly they had been taking so great an interest but by the time they had sent for their coats and hats from the cloakroom and harcutt had coolly scrutinised the tablelist they found themselves all together in a little group at the head of the stairs  wolfenden who was a few steps in front drew back to allow them to pass the man leaning upon his stick laid his hand upon the girls sleeve then he looked up at the man and addressed wolfenden directly  you had better precede us sir he said my progress is unfortunately somewhat slow  wolfenden drew back courteously  we are in no hurry he said please go on  the man thanked him and with one hand upon the girls shoulder and with the other on his stick commenced to descend the girl had passed on without even glancing towards them she had twisted a white lace mantilla around her head and her features were scarcely visibleonly as she passed wolfenden received a general impression of rustling white silk and lace and foaming tulle as she gathered her skirts together at the head of the stairs it seemed to him too that the somewhat close atmosphere of the vestibule had become faintly sweet with the delicate fragrance of the white roses which hung by a loop of satin from her wrist  the three men waited until they had reached the bend of the stairs before they began to descend harcutt then leaned forward  his name he whispered is disenchanting it is mr sabin whoever heard of a mr sabin yet he looks like a personage  at the doors there was some delay it was raining fast and the departures were a little congested the three young men still kept in the background densham affected to be busy lighting a cigarette wolfenden was slowly drawing on his gloves his place was almost in a line with the girls he could see the diamonds flashing in her fair hair through the dainty tracery of the drooping white lace and in a moment through some slight change in her position he could get a better view of her face than he had been able to obtain even in the supperroom she was beautiful there was no doubt about that but there were many beautiful women in london whom wolfenden scarcely pretended to admire this girl had something better even than supreme beauty she was anything but a reproduction she was a new type she had originality her hair was dazzlingly fair her eyebrows delicately arched were high and distinctly dark in colour her head was perfectly shapedthe features seemed to combine a delightful piquancy with a somewhat statuesque regularity wolfenden wondering of what she in some manner reminded him suddenly thought of some old french miniatures which he had stopped to admire only a day or two before in a little curio shop near bond street there was a distinct dash of something foreign in her features and carriage it might have been french or austrianit was most certainly not anglosaxon  the crush became a little less they all moved a step or two forwardand wolfenden glancing carelessly outside found his attention immediately arrested just as he had been watching the girl so was a man who stood on the pavement side by side with the commissionaire watching her companion he was tall and thin apparently dressed in evening clothes for though his coat was buttoned up to his chin he wore an opera hat his hands were thrust into the loose pockets of his overcoat and his face was mostly in the shadows once however he followed some motion of mr sabins and moved his head a little forward wolfenden started and looked at him fixedly was it fancy or was there indeed something clenched in his right hand there which gleamed like silveror was it steelin the momentary flash of a passing carriagelight wolfenden was puzzled there was something too which seemed to him vaguely familiar in the mans figure and person he was certainly waiting for somebody and to judge from his expression his mission was no pleasant one wolfenden who through the latter part of the evening had felt a curious and unwonted sense of excitement stirring his blood now felt it go tingling through all his veins he had some subtle prescience that he was on the brink of an adventure he glanced hurriedly at his two companions neither of them had noticed this fresh development  just then the commissionaire who knew wolfenden by sight turned round and saw him standing there stepping back on to the pavement he called up the brougham which was waiting a little way down the street  your carriage my lord he said to wolfenden touching his cap  wolfenden with ready presence of mind shook his head  i am waiting for a friend he said tell my man to pass on a yard or two  the man bowed and the danger of leaving before these two people in whom his interest now was becoming positively feverish was averted as if to enhance it a singular thing now happened the interest suddenly became reciprocal at the sound of wolfendens voice the man with the club foot had distinctly started he changed his position and leaning forward looked eagerly at him his eyes remained for a moment or two fixed steadily upon him there was no doubt about the fact singular in itself though it was wolfenden noticed it himself so did both densham and harcutt but before any remark could pass between them a little coupé brougham had drawn up and the man and the girl started forward  wolfenden followed close behind the feeling which prompted him to do so was a curious one but it seemed to him afterwards that he had even at that time a conviction that something unusual was about to happen the girl stepped lightly across the carpeted way and entered the carriage her companion paused in the doorway to hand some silver to the commissionaire then he too leaning upon his stick stepped across the pavement his foot was already upon the carriage step when suddenly what wolfenden had been vaguely anticipating happened a dark figure sprang from out of the shadows and seized him by the throat something that glittered like a streak of silver in the electric light flashed upwards the blow would certainly have fallen but for wolfenden he was the only person not wholly unprepared for something of the sort and he was consequently not paralysed into inaction as were the others he was so near too that a single step forward enabled him to seize the uplifted arm in a grasp of iron the man who had been attacked was the next to recover himself raising his stick he struck at his assailant violently the blow missed his head but grazed his temple and fell upon his shoulder the man released from wolfendens grasp by his convulsive start went staggering back into the roadway  there was a rush then to secure him but it was too late wolfenden half expecting another attack had not moved from the carriage door and the commissionaire although a powerful man was not swift like a cat the man who had made the attack sprang across the roadway and into the gardens which fringed the embankment the commissionaire and a loiterer followed him just then wolfenden felt a soft touch on his shoulder the girl had opened the carriage door and was standing at his side  is any one hurt she asked quickly  no one he answered it is all over the man has run away  mr sabin stooped down and brushed away some grey ash from the front of his coat then he took a matchbox from his ticketpocket and relit the cigarette which had been crumpled in his fingers his hand was perfectly steady the whole affair had scarcely taken thirty seconds  it was probably some lunatic he remarked motioning to the girl to resume her place in the carriage i am exceedingly obliged to you sir lord wolfenden i believe he added raising his hat but for your intervention the matter might really have been serious permit me to offer you my card i trust that some day i may have a better opportunity of expressing my thanks at present you will excuse me if i hurry i am not of your nation but i share an antipathy with themi hate a row  he stepped into the carriage with a farewell bow and it drove off at once wolfenden remained looking after it with his hat in his hand from the embankment below came the faint sound of hurrying footsteps     chapter iii  the warning of felix   the three friends stood upon the pavement watching the little brougham until it disappeared round the corner in a flickering glitter of light it would have been in accordance with precedent if after leaving the restaurant they had gone to some one of their clubs to smoke a cigar and drink whisky and apollinaris while harcutt retailed the latest society gossip and densham descanted on art and wolfenden contributed genial remarks upon things in general but tonight all three were inclined to depart from precedent perhaps the surprising incident which they had just witnessed made anything like normal routine seem unattractive whatever the reason may have been the young men were of a sudden not in sympathy with one another harcutt murmured some conventional lie about having an engagement supplemented it with some quite unconvincing statement about pressure of work and concluded with an obviously disingenuous protest against the tyranny of the profession of journalism then he sprang with alacrity into a hansom and said goodbye with a good deal less than his usual cordiality densham too hailed a cab and leaning over the apron delivered himself of a farewell speech which sounded rather malignant you are a lucky beast wolfenden he growled enviously adding with a note of venom in his voice but dont forget it takes more than the first game to win the rubber and then he was whirled away nodding his head and wearing an expression of wisdom deeply tinged with gloom  wolfenden was surprised but not exactly sorry that the first vague expression of hostility had been made by the others  both of them must be confoundedly hard hit he murmured to himself i never knew densham turn nasty before and to his coachman he said aloud you may go home dawson i am going to walk  he turned on to the embankment conscious of a curious sense of exhilaration he was no blasé cynic but the uniformly easy life tends to become just a trifle monotonous and lord wolfendens somewhat epicurean mind derived actual pleasure from the subtle luxury of a new sensation what he had said of his friends he could have said with equal truth of himself he was confoundedly hard hit for the first time in his life he found the mere memory of a woman thrilling his whole nature vibrated in response to the appeal she made to him and he walked along buoyantly under the stars revelling in the delight of being alive  suddenly he stopped abruptly huddled up in the corner of a seat was a man with a cloth cap pulled forward screening his face at that moment lord wolfenden was in a mood to be extravagantly generous to any poor applicant for alms lavishly sympathetic to any tale of distress but it was not ordinary curiosity that arrested his progress now he knew almost at the first glance who it was that sat in this dejected attitude although the opera hat was replaced by the soft cloth cap and in other details the mans appearance was altered it was indeed the mr felix who had supped with him at the milan and subsequently behaved in so astonishing a fashion  he knew that he was recognised and sat up looking steadfastly at wolfenden although his lips trembled and his eyes gleamed wildly across his temples a bright red mark was scored  lord wolfenden broke the silence  youre a nice sort of fellow to ask out to supper what in the name of all thats wonderful were you trying to do  i should have thought it was sufficiently obvious the man replied bitterly i tried to kill him and i failed well why dont you call the police i am quite ready i shall not run again  wolfenden hesitated and then sat down by the side of this surprising individual  the man you went for didnt seem to care so i dont see why i should but why do you want to kill him  to keep a vow the other answered how and why made i will not tell you  how did you escape wolfenden asked abruptly  probably because i didnt care whether i escaped or not felix replied with a short bitter laugh i stood behind some shrubs just inside the garden and watched the hunt go by then i came out here and sat down  it all sounds very simple said wolfenden a trifle sarcastically may i ask what you are going to do next  felixs face so clearly intimated that he might not ask anything of the kind or that if he did his curiosity would not be satisfied that wolfenden felt compelled to make some apology  forgive me if i seem inquisitive but i find the situation a little unusual you were my guest you see and had it not been for my chance invitation you might not have met that man at all then again had it not been for my interference he would have been dead now and you would have been in a fair way to be hanged  felix evinced no sign of gratitude for wolfendens intervention instead he said intensely  oh you fool you fool  well really wolfenden protested i dont see why but felix interrupted him  yes you are a fool he repeated because you saved his life he is an old man now i wonder how many there have been in the course of his long life who desired to kill him but no onenot one solitary human beinghas ever befriended him or come to his rescue in time of danger without living to be sorry for it and so it will be with you you will live to be sorry for what you have done tonight you will live to think it would have been far better for him to fall by my hand than for yourself to suffer at his and you will wish passionately that you had let him die before heaven wolfenden i swear that that is true  the man was so much in earnest his passion was so quietly intense that wolfenden against his will was more than half convinced he was silent he suddenly felt cold and the buoyant elation of mind in which he had started homewards vanished leaving him anxious and heavy perhaps just a little afraid  i did what any man would do for any one else he said almost apologetically it was instinctive as a matter of fact that particular man is a perfect stranger to me i have never seen him before and it is quite possible that i shall never see him again  felix turned quickly towards him  if you believe in prayer he said go down on your knees where you are and pray as you have never prayed for anything before that you may not see him again there has never been a man or a woman yet who has not been the worse for knowing him he is like the pestilence that walketh in the darkness poisoning every one that is in the way of his horrible infection  wolfenden pulled himself together there was no doubt about his companions earnestness but it was the earnestness of an unbalanced mind language so exaggerated as his was out of keeping with the times and the place  tell me some more about him he suggested who is he  i wont tell you felix answered obstinately  well then who is the lady  i dont know it is quite enough for me to know that she is his companion for the moment  you do not intend to be communicative i can see said wolfenden after a brief pause but i wish i could persuade you to tell me why you attempted his life tonight  there was the opportunity said felix as if that in itself were sufficient explanation then he smiled enigmatically there are at least three distinct and separate reasons why i should take his lifeall of them good three i mean why i should do it but i have not been his only victim there are plenty of others who have a heavy reckoning against him and he knows what it is to carry his life in his hand but he bears a charmed existence did you see his stick  yes said wolfenden i did it had a peculiar stone in the handle in the electric light it looked like a huge green opal  felix assented moodily  that is it he struck me with a stick he would not part with it for anything it was given him by some indian fakir and it is said that while he carries it he is proof against attack  who says so wolfenden inquired  never mind said felix its enough that it is said he relapsed into silence and when he next spoke his manner was different his excited vehemence had gone and there was nothing in his voice or demeanour inconsistent with normal sanity yet his words were no less charged with deep intention i do not know much about you lord wolfenden he said but i beg you to take the advice i am offering you no one ever gave you better in your life avoid that man as you would avoid the plague go away before he looks you up to thank you for what you did go abroad anywhere the farther the better and stay away for ever if that is the only means of escaping his friendship or even his acquaintance  lord wolfenden shook his head  im a very ordinary matter of fact englishman he said leading a very ordinary matter of fact life and you must forgive me if i consider such a sweeping condemnation a little extravagant and fantastic i have no particular enemies on my conscience i am implicated in no conspiracy and i am in short an individual of very little importance consequently i have nothing to fear from anybody and am afraid of nobody this man cannot have anything to gain by injuring me i believe you said you did not know the lady  the lady felix repeated no i do not know her nor anything of her beyond the fact that she is with him for the time being that is quite sufficient for me  wolfenden got up  thanks he said lazily i only asked you for facts as for your suggestionyou will be well advised not to repeat it  oh exclaimed felix scornfully how blind and pigheaded you english people are i have told you something of the mans reputation what can hers be do you suppose if she will sup alone with him in a public restaurant  goodnight said wolfenden i will not listen to another word  felix rose to his feet and laid his hand upon lord wolfendens arm  lord wolfenden he said you are a very decent fellow do try to believe that i am only speaking for your good that girl  wolfenden shook him off  if you allude to that young lady either directly or indirectly he said very calmly i shall throw you into the river  felix shrugged his shoulders  at least remember that i warned you was all he ventured to say as lord wolfenden strode away                                       leaving the embankment wolfenden walked quickly to half moon street where his chambers were his servant let him in and took his coat there was an anxious expression upon his usually passive face and he appeared to be rather at a loss for words in which to communicate his news at last he got it out accompanying the question with a nervous and deprecating cough  i beg your pardon my lord but were you expecting a young lady  a what selby wolfenden exclaimed looking at him in amazement  a lady my lord a young lady  of course not said wolfenden with a frown what on earth do you mean  selby gathered courage  a young lady called here about an hour ago and asked for you johnson informed her that you might be home shortly and she said she would wait johnson perhaps imprudently admitted her and she is in the study my lord  a young lady in my study at this time of night wolfenden exclaimed incredulously who is she and what is she and why has she come at all have you gone mad selby  then you were not expecting her the man said anxiously she gave no name but she assured johnson that you did  you are a couple of idiots wolfenden said angrily of course i wasnt expecting her surely both you and johnson have been in my service long enough to know me better than that  i am exceedingly sorry my lord the man said abjectly but the young ladys appearance misled us both if you will allow me to say so my lord i am quite sure that she is a lady no doubt there is some mistake but when you see her i think you will exonerate johnson and me from  his master cut his protestations short  wait where you are until i ring he said it never entered my head that you could be such an incredible idiot  he strode into the study closing the door behind him and selby obediently waited for the bell but a long time passed before the summons came     chapter iv  at the russian ambassadors   the brougham containing the man who had figured in the milan table list as mr sabin and his companion turned into the strand and proceeded westwards close behind it came harcutts private cabonly a few yards away followed denshams hansom the procession continued in the same order skirting trafalgar square and along pall mall  each in a different manner the three men were perhaps equally interested in these people geoffrey densham was attracted as an artist by the extreme and rare beauty of the girl wolfendens interest was at once more sentimental and more personal harcutts arose partly out of curiosity partly from innate love of adventure both densham and harcutt were exceedingly interested as to their probable destination from it they would be able to gather some idea as to the status and social position of mr sabin and his companion both were perhaps a little surprised when the brougham which had been making its way into the heart of fashionable london turned into belgrave square and pulled up before a great porticoed house brilliantly lit and with a crimson drugget and covered way stretched out across the pavement harcutt sprang out first just in time to see the two pass through the opened doorway the man leaning heavily upon his stick the girl with her daintily gloved fingers just resting upon his coatsleeve walking with that uncommon and graceful selfpossession which had so attracted densham during her passage through the supperroom at the milan a short while ago  harcutt looked after them watching them disappear with a frown upon his forehead  rather a sell isnt it said a quiet voice in his ear  he turned abruptly round densham was standing upon the pavement by his side  great scott he exclaimed testily what are you doing here  densham threw away his cigarette and laughed  i might return the question i suppose he remarked we both followed the young lady and her imaginary papa we were both anxious to find out where they livedand we are both sold  very badly sold harcutt admitted what do you propose to do now we cant wait outside here for an hour or two  densham hesitated  no we cant do that he said have you any plan  harcutt shook his head  cant say that i have  they were both silent for a moment densham was smiling softly to himself watching him harcutt became quite assured that he had decided what to do  let us consider the matter together he suggested diplomatically we ought to be able to hit upon something  densham shook his head doubtfully  no he said i dont think that we can run this thing in double harness you see our interests are materially opposed  harcutt did not see it in the same light  pooh we can travel together by the same road he protested the time to part company has not come yet wolfenden has got a bit ahead of us tonight after all though you and i may pull level if we help one another you have a plan i can see what is it  densham was silent for a moment  you know whose house this is he asked  harcutt nodded  of course its the russian ambassadors  densham drew a square card from his pocket and held it out under the gaslight from it it appeared that the princess lobenski desired the honour of his company at any time that evening between twelve and two  a card for tonight by jove harcutt exclaimed  densham nodded and replaced it in his pocket  you see harcutt he said i am bound to take an advantage over you i only got this card by an accident and i certainly do not know the princess well enough to present you i shall be compelled to leave you here all that i can promise is that if i discover anything interesting i will let you know about it tomorrow goodnight  harcutt watched him disappear through the open doors and then walked a little way along the pavement swearing softly to himself his first idea was to wait about until they came out and then follow them again by that means he would at least be sure of their address he would have gained something for his time and trouble he lit a cigarette and walked slowly to the corner of the street then he turned back and retraced his steps as he neared the crimson strip of drugget one of the servants drew respectfully aside as though expecting him to enter the mans action was like an inspiration to him he glanced down the vista of covered roof a crowd of people were making their way up the broad staircase and amongst them densham after all why not he laughed softly to himself and hesitated no longer he threw away his cigarette and walked boldly in he was doing a thing for which he well knew that he deserved to be kicked at the same time he had made up his mind to go through with it and he was not the man to fail through nervousness or want of savoir faire  at the cloakroom the multitude of men inspired him with new confidence there were some a very fair sprinkling whom he knew and who greeted him indifferently without appearing in any way to regard his presence as a thing out of the common he walked up the staircase one of a little group but as they passed through the anteroom to where in the distance prince and princess lobenski were standing to receive their guests harcutt adroitly disengaged himselfhe affected to pause for a moment or two to speak to an acquaintance when he was left alone he turned sharp to the right and entered the main dancingsalon  he was quite safe now and his spirits began to rise yonder was densham looking very bored dancing with a girl in yellow so far at least he had gained no advantage he looked everywhere in vain however for a man with a club foot and the girl in white and diamonds they must be in one of the inner rooms he began to make a little tour  two of the antechambers he explored without result in the third two men were standing near the entrance talking harcutt almost held his breath as he came to an abrupt stop within a yard or two of them one was the man for whom he had been looking the otherharcutt seemed to find his face perfectly familiar but for the moment he could not identify him he was tall with white hair and moustaches his coat was covered with foreign orders and he wore english court dress his hands were clasped behind his back he was talking in a low clear tone stooping a little and with eyes steadfastly fixed upon his companion mr sabin was leaning a little forward with both hands resting upon his stick harcutt was struck at once with the singular immobility of his face he did not appear either interested or amused or acquiescent he was simply listening a few words from the other man came to harcutts ears as he lingered there on the other side of the curtain  if it were moneya question of monetary recompensethe secret service purse of my country opens easily and it is well filled if it were anything less simple the proposal could but be made i am taking the thing you understand at your own computation of its worth i am taking it for granted that it carries with it the power you claim for it assuming these things i am prepared to treat with you i am going on leave very shortly and i could myself conduct the negotiations  harcutt would have moved away but he was absolutely powerless naturally and from his journalistic instincts he was one of the most curious of men he had recognised the speaker the interview was pregnant with possibilities who was this mr sabin that so great a man should talk with him so earnestly he was looking up now he was going to speak what was he going to say harcutt held his breath the idea of moving away never occurred to him now  yet mr sabin said slowly your country should be a low bidder the importance of such a thing to you must be less than to france less than to her great ally your relations here are close and friendly nature and destiny seemed to have made you allies as yet there has been no riftno sign of a rift  you are right the other man answered slowly and yet who can tell what lies before us in less than a dozen years the face of all europe may be changed the policy of a great nation is to all appearance a steadfast thing on the face of it it continues the same age after age yet if a change is to come it comes from within it develops slowly it grows from within outwards very slowly like a secret thing do you follow me  i thinkperhaps i do mr sabin admitted deliberately  the ambassadors voice dropped almost to a whisper and but for its singularly penetrating quality harcutt would have heard no more as it was he had almost to hold his breath and all his nerves quivered with the tension of listening  even the press is deceived the inspired organs purposely mislead outside to all the world there seems to be nothing brewing yet when the storm bursts one sees that it has been long in gatheringthat years of careful study and thought have been given to that hidden triumph of diplomacy all has been locked in the breasts of a few the thing is fullfledged when it is hatched upon the world it has grown strong in darkness you understand me  yes i think that i understand you mr sabin said his piercing eyes raised now from the ground and fixed upon the other mans face you have given me food for serious thought i shall do nothing further till i have talked with you again  harcutt suddenly and swiftly withdrew he had stayed as long as he dared at any moment his presence might have been detected and he would have been involved in a situation which even the nerve and effrontery acquired during the practice of his profession could not have rendered endurable he found a seat in an adjoining room and sat quite still thinking his brain was in a whirl he had almost forgotten the special object of his quest he felt like a conspirator the fascination of the unknown was upon him their first instinct concerning these people had been a true one they were indeed no ordinary people he must follow them uphe must know more about them once more he thought over what he had heard it was mysterious but it was interesting it might mean anything the man with mr sabin he had recognised the moment he spoke it was baron von knigenstein the german ambassador those were strange words of his he pondered them over again the journalistic fever was upon him he was no longer in love he had overheard a few words of a discussion of tremendous import if only he could get the key to it if only he could follow this thing through then farewell to society paragraphing and playing at journalism his reputation would be made for ever  he rose and finding his way to the refreshmentroom drank off a glass of champagne then he walked back to the main salon standing with his back to the wall and halfhidden by a tall palm tree was densham he was alone his arms were folded and he was looking out upon the dancers with a gloomy frown harcutt stepped softly up to him  well how are you getting on old chap he whispered in his ear  densham started and looked at harcutt in blank surprise  why how theexcuse me how on earth did you get in he exclaimed  harcutt smiled in a mysterious manner  oh we journalists are trained to overcome small difficulties he said airily it wasnt a very hard task the morning is a pretty good passport getting in was easy enough where isshe  densham moved his head in the direction of the broad space at the head of the stairs where the ambassador and his wife had received their guests  she is under the special wing of the princess she is up at that end of the room somewhere with a lot of old frumps  have you asked for an introduction  densham nodded  yes i asked young lobenski it is no good he does not know who she is but she does not dance and is not allowed to make acquaintances that is what it comes to anyway it was not a personal matter at all lobenski did not even mention my name to his mother he simply said a friend the princess replied that she was very sorry but there was some difficulty the young ladys guardian did not wish her to make acquaintances for the present  her guardian hes not her father then  no it was either her guardian or her uncle i am not sure which by jove there they go theyre off  they both hurried to the cloakroom for their coats and reached the street in time to see the people in whom they were so interested coming down the stairs towards them in the glare of the electric light the girls pale upraised face shone like a piece of delicate statuary to densham the artist she was irresistible he drew harcutt right back amongst the shadows  she is the most beautiful woman i have ever seen in my life he said deliberately titian never conceived anything more exquisite she is a woman to paint and to worship  what are you going to do now harcutt asked drily you can rave about her in your studio if you like  i am going to find out where she lives if i have to follow her home on foot it will be something to know that  two of us harcutt protested it is too obvious  i cant help that densham replied i do not sleep until i have found out  harcutt looked dubious  look here he said we need not both go i will leave it to you on one condition  well  you must let me know tomorrow what you discover  densham hesitated  agreed he decided there they go goodnight i will call at your rooms or send a note tomorrow  densham jumped into his cab and drove away harcutt looked after them thoughtfully  the girl is very lovely he said to himself as he stood on the pavement waiting for his carriage but i do not think that she is for you densham or for me on the whole i am more interested in the man     chapter v  the dilemma of wolfenden   wolfenden was evidently absolutely unprepared to see the girl whom he found occupying his own particular easy chair in his study the light was only a dim one and as she did not move or turn round at his entrance he did not recognise her until he was standing on the hearthrug by her side then he started with a little exclamation  miss merton why what on earth  he stopped in the middle of his question and looked intently at her her head was thrown back amongst the cushions of the chair and she was fast asleep her hat was a little crushed and a little curl of fair hair had escaped and was hanging down over her forehead there were undoubtedly tear stains upon her pretty face her plain black jacket was half undone and the gloves which she had taken off lay in her lap wolfendens anger subsided at once no wonder selby had been perplexed but selbys perplexity was nothing to his own  she woke up suddenly and saw him standing there traces of his amazement still lingering on his face she looked at him halffrightened halfwistfully the colour came and went in her cheeksher eyes grew soft with tears he felt himself a brute surely it was not possible that she could be acting he spoke to her more kindly than he had intended  what on earth has brought you up to townand hereat this time of night is anything wrong at deringham  she sat up in the chair and looked at him with quivering lips  nno nothing particular only i have left  you have left  yes i have been turned away she added piteously  he looked at her blankly  turned away why what for do you mean to say that you have left for good  she nodded and commenced to dry her eyes with a little lace handkerchief  yesyour motherlady deringham has been very horridas though the silly papers were of any use to me or any one else in the world i have not copied them i am not deceitful it is all an excuse to get rid of me because ofof you  she looked up at him and suddenly dropped her eyes wolfenden began to see some glimmerings of light he was still however bewildered  look here he said kindly why you are here i cannot for the life of me imagine but you had better just tell me all about it  she rose up suddenly and caught her gloves from the table  i think i will go away she said i was very stupid to come please forget it and goodbye  he caught her by the wrist as she passed  nonsense he exclaimed you mustnt go like this  she looked steadfastly away from him and tried to withdraw her arm  you are angry with me for coming she said i am very very sorry i will go away please dont stop me  he held her wrist firmly  miss merton  miss merton she repeated his words reproachfully lifting her eyes suddenly to his that he might see the tears gathering there wolfenden began to feel exceedingly uncomfortable  well blanche then he said slowly is that better  she answered nothing but looked at him again her hand remained in his she suffered him to lead her back to the chair  its all nonsense your going away you know he said a little awkwardly you cant wonder that i am surprised perhaps you dont know that it is a little lateafter midnight in fact where should you go to if you ran away like that do you know any one in london  idont think so she admitted  well do be reasonable then first of all tell me all about it  she nodded and began at once now and then lifting her eyes to his mostly gazing fixedly at the gloves which she was smoothing carefully out upon her knee  i think she said that lord deringham is not so well what he has been writing has become more and more incoherent and it has been very difficult to copy it at all i have done my best but he has never seemed satisfied and he has taken to watch me in an odd sort of way just as though i was doing something wrong all the time you know he fancies that the work he is putting together is of immense importance of course i dont know that it isnt all i do know is that it sounds and reads like absolute rubbish and its awfully difficult to copy he writes very quickly and uses all manner of abbreviations and if i make a single mistake in typing it he gets horribly cross  wolfenden laughed softly  poor little girl go on  she smiled too and continued with less constraint in her tone  i didnt really mind that so much as of course i have been getting a lot of money for the work and one cant have everything but just lately he seems to have got the idea that i have been making two copies of this rubbish and keeping one back he has kept on coming into the room unexpectedly and has sat for hours watching me in a most unpleasant manner i have not been allowed to leave the house and all my letters have been looked over it has been perfectly horrid  i am very sorry wolfenden said of course you knew though that it was going to be rather difficult to please my father didnt you the doctors differ a little as to his precise mental condition but we are all aware that he is at any rate a trifle peculiar  she smiled a little bitterly  oh i am not complaining she said i should have stood it somehow for the sake of the money but i havent told you everything yet the worst part so far as i am concerned is to come  i am very sorry he said please go on  this morning your father came very early into the study and found a sheet of carbon paper on my desk and two copies of one page of the work i was doing as a matter of fact i had never used it before but i wanted to try it for practice there was no harm in iti should have destroyed the second sheet in a minute or two and in any case it was so badly done that it was absolutely worthless but directly lord deringham saw it he went quite white and i thought he was going to have a fit i cant tell you all he said he was brutal the end of it was that my boxes were all turned out and my desk and everything belonging to me searched as though i were a housemaid suspected of theft and all the time i was kept locked up when they had finished i was told to put my hat on and go ii had nowhere to go to for murielyou remember i told you about my sisterwent to america last week i hadnt the least idea what to doand soiyou were the only person who had ever been kind to me she concluded suddenly leaning over towards him a little sob in her throat and her eyes swimming with tears  there are certain situations in life when an honest man is at an obvious disadvantage wolfenden felt awkward and desperately ill at ease he evaded the embrace which her movement and eyes had palpably invited and compromised matters by taking her hands and holding them tightly in his even then he felt far from comfortable  but my mother he exclaimed lady deringham surely took your part  she shook her head vigorously  lady deringham did nothing of the sort she replied do you remember last time when you were down you took me for a walk once or twice and you talked to me in the evenings andbut perhaps you have forgotten have you  she was looking at him so eagerly that there was only one answer possible for him he hastened to make it there was a certain lack of enthusiasm in his avowal however which brought a look of reproach into her face she sighed and looked away into the fire  well she continued lady deringham has never been the same since then to me it didnt matter while you were there but after you left it was very wretched i wrote to you but you never answered my letter  he was very well aware of it he had never asked her to write and her note had seemed to him a trifle too ingenuous he had never meant to answer it  i so seldom write letters he said i thought too that it must have been your fancy my mother is generally considered a very goodhearted woman  she laughed bitterly  oh one does not fancy those things she said lady deringham has been coldly civil to me ever since and nothing more this morning she seemed absolutely pleased to have an excuse for sending me away she knows quite well of course that lord deringham isnot himself but she took everything he said for gospel and turned me out of the house there now you know everything perhaps after all it was idiotic to come to you well im only a girl and girls are idiots i havent a friend in the world and if i were alone i should die of loneliness in a week you wont send me away you are not angry with me  she made a movement towards him but he held her hands tightly for the first time he began to see his way before him a certain ingenuousness in her speech and in that little halfforgotten notean ingenuousness by the bye of which he had some doubtswas his salvation he would accept it as absolutely genuine she was a child who had come to him because he had been kind to her  of course i am not angry with you he said quite emphatically i am very glad indeed that you came it is only right that i should help you when my people seem to have treated you so wretchedly let me think for a moment  she watched him very anxiously and moved a little closer to him  tell me she murmured what are you thinking about  i have it he answered standing suddenly up and touching the bell it is an excellent idea  what is it she asked quickly  he did not appear to hear her question selby was standing upon the threshold wolfenden spoke to him  selby are your wifes rooms still vacant  selby believed that they were  thats all right then put on your hat and coat at once i want you to take this young lady round there  very good my lord  her luggage has been lost and may not arrive until tomorrow be sure you tell mrs selby to do all in her power to make things comfortable  the girl had gone very pale wolfenden watching her closely was surprised at her expression  i think he said that you will find mrs selby a very decent sort of a person if i may i will come and see you tomorrow and you shall tell me how i can help you i am very glad indeed that you came to me  she shot a single glance at him partly of anger partly reproach  you are very very kind she said slowly and very considerate she added after a moments pause i shall not forget it  she looked him then straight in the eyes he was more glad than he would have liked to confess even to himself to hear selbys knock at the door  you have nothing to thank me for yet at any rate he said taking her hand i shall be only too glad if you will let me be of service to you  he led her out to the carriage and watched it drive away with selby on the box seat her last glance as she leaned back amongst the cushions was a tender one her lips were quivering and her little fingers more than returned his pressure but wolfenden walked back to his study with all the pleasurable feelings of a man who has extricated himself with tact from an awkward situation  the frankness he remarked to himself as he lit a pipe and stretched himself out for a final smoke was a trifle just a trifle overdone she gave the whole show away with that last glance i should like very much to know what it all means     chapter vi  a compact of three   wolfenden for an idler was a young man of fairly precise habits by ten oclock next morning he had breakfasted and before eleven he was riding in the park perhaps he had some faint hope of seeing there something of the two people in whom he was now greatly interested if so he was certainly disappointed he looked with a new curiosity into the faces of the girls who galloped past him and he was careful even to take particular notice of the few promenaders but he did not see anything of mr sabin or his companion  at twelve oclock he returned to his rooms and exchanged his ridingclothes for the ordinary garb of the west end he even looked on his halltable as he passed out again to see if there were any note or card for him  he could scarcely look me up just yet at any rate he reflected as he walked slowly along piccadilly for he did not even ask me for my address he took the whole thing so coolly that perhaps he does not mean even to call  nevertheless he looked in the rack at his club to see if there was anything against his name and tore into pieces the few unimportant notes he found there with an impatience which they scarcely deserved of the few acquaintances whom he met there he inquired casually whether they knew anything of a man named sabin no one seemed to have heard the name before he even consulted a directory in the hall but without success at one oclock in a fit of restlessness he went out and taking a hansom drove over to westminster to harcutts rooms harcutt was in and with him densham at wolfendens entrance the three men looked at one another and there was a simultaneous laugh  here comes the hero densham remarked he will be able to tell us everything  i came to gather information not to impart it wolfenden answered selecting a cigarette and taking an easy chair i know precisely as much as i knew last night  mr sabin has not been to pour out his gratitude yet then densham asked  wolfenden shook his head  not yet on the whole i am inclined to think that he will not come at all he doubtless considers that he has done all that is necessary in the way of thanks he did not even ask for my card and giving me his was only a matter of form for there was no address upon it  but he knew your name harcutt reminded him i noticed that  yes i suppose he could find me if he wished to wolfenden admitted if he had been very keen about it though i should think he would have said something more his one idea seemed to be to get away before there was a row  i do not think harcutt said that you will find him overburdened with gratitude he does not seem that sort of man  i do not want any gratitude from him wolfenden answered deliberately so far as the man himself is concerned i should rather prefer never to see him again by the bye did either of you fellows follow them home last night  harcutt and densham exchanged quick glances wolfenden had asked his question quietly but it was evidently what he had come to know  yes harcutt said we both did they are evidently people of some consequence they went first to the house of the russian ambassador prince lobenski  wolfenden swore to himself softly he could have been there he made a mental note to leave a card at the embassy that afternoon  and afterwards  afterwards they drove to a house in chilton gardens kensington where they remained  the presumption being then wolfenden began  that they live there harcutt put in in fact i may say that we ascertained that definitely the mans name is sabin and the girl is reputed to be his niece now you know as much as we do the relationship however is little more than a surmise  did either of you go to the reception wolfenden asked  we both did harcutt answered  wolfenden raised his eyebrows  you were there then why didnt you make their acquaintance  densham laughed shortly  i asked for an introduction to the girl he said and was politely declined she was under the special charge of the princess and was presented to no one  and mr sabin wolfenden asked  he was talking all the time to baron von knigenstein the german ambassador they did not stay long  wolfenden smiled  it seems to me he said that you had an excellent opportunity and let it go  harcutt threw his cigarette into the fire with an impatient gesture  you may think so he said all i can say is that if you had been there yourself you could have done no more at any rate we have no particular difficulty now in finding out who this mysterious mr sabin and the girl are we may assume that there is a relationship he added or they would scarcely have been at the embassy where as a rule the guests make up in respectability what they lack in brilliancy  as to the relationship wolfenden said i am quite prepared to take that for granted i for one never doubted it  that harcutt remarked is because you are young and a little quixotic when you have lived as long as i have you will doubt everything you will take nothing for granted unless you desire to live for ever amongst the ruins of your shattered enthusiasms if you are wise you will always assume that your swans are geese until you have proved them to be swans  that is very cheap cynicism wolfenden remarked equably i am surprised at you harcutt i thought that you were more in touch with the times dont you know that today nobody is cynical except schoolboys and dyspeptics pessimism went out with sack overcoats your remarks remind me of the morning odour of patchouli and stale smoke in a cheap quartier latin dancingroom to be in the fashion of today you must cultivate a gentle almost arcadian enthusiasm you must wear rosecoloured spectacles and pretend that you like them didnt you hear what flaskett said last week there is an epidemic of morality in the air we are all going to be very good  some of us densham remarked are going to be very uncomfortable then  great changes always bring small discomforts wolfenden rejoined but after all i didnt come here to talk nonsense i came to ask you both something i want to know whether you fellows are bent upon seeing this thing through  densham and harcutt exchanged glances there was a moments silence densham became spokesman  so far as finding out who they are and all about them he said i shall not rest until i have done it  and you harcutt  harcutt nodded gravely  i am with densham he said at the same time i may as well tell you that i am quite as much if not more interested in the man than in the girl the girl is beautiful and of course i admire her as every one must but that is all the man appeals to my journalistic instincts there is copy in him i am convinced that he is a personage you may in fact regard me both of you as an ally rather than as a rival  if you had your choice then of an hours conversation with either of them wolfenden began  i should choose the man without a seconds hesitation harcutt declared the girl is lovely enough i admit i do not wonder at you fellowsdensham who is a worshipper of beauty you wolfenden who are an idlerbeing struck with her but as regards myself it is different the man appeals to my professional instincts in very much the same way as the girl appeals to the artistic sense in densham he is a conundrum which i have set myself to solve  wolfenden rose to his feet  look here you fellows he said i have a proposition to make we are all three in the same boat shall we pull together or separately  harcutt dropped his eyeglass and smiled quietly  quixotic as usual wolf old chap he said we cant our interests are opposed at least yours and denshams are you will scarcely want to help one another under the circumstances  wolfenden drew on his gloves  i have not explained myself yet he said the thing must have its limitations of course but for a step or two even densham and i can walk together let us form an alliance so far as direct information is concerned afterwards it must be every man for himself of course i suppose we each have some idea as to how and where to set about making inquiries concerning these people very well let us each go our own way and share up the information tonight  i am quite willing densham said only let this be distinctly understoodwe are allies only so far as the collection and sharing of information is concerned afterwards and in other ways it is each man for himself if one of us succeeds in establishing a definite acquaintance with them the thing ends there is no need for either of us to do anything with regard to the others which might militate against his own chances  i am agreeable to that harcutt said from denshams very elaborate provisoes i think we may gather that he has a plan  i agree too wolfenden said and i specially endorse denshams limit it is an alliance so far as regards information only suppose we go and have some lunch together now  i never lunch out and i have a better idea said harcutt let us meet at the milan tonight for supper at the same time we can then exchange information supposing either of us has been fortunate enough to acquire any what do you say wolfenden  i am quite willing wolfenden said  and i echoed densham at halfpast eleven then harcutt concluded     chapter vii  who is mr sabin   mrs thorpesatchell was not at home to ordinary callers nevertheless when a discreet servant brought her mr francis denshams card she gave orders for his admittance without hesitation  that he was a privileged person it was easy to see mrs satchell received him with the most charming of smiles  my dear francis she exclaimed i do hope that you have lost that wretched headache you looked perfectly miserable last night i was so sorry for you  densham drew an easy chair to her side and accepted a cup of tea  i am quite well again he said it was very bad indeed for a little time but it did not last long still i felt that it made me so utterly stupid that i was half afraid you would have written me off your visitors list altogether as a dull person i was immensely relieved to be told that you were at home  mrs thorpesatchell laughed gaily she was a bright blonde little woman with an exquisite figure and piquante face she had a husband whom no one knew and gave excellent parties to which every one went in her way she was something of a celebrity she and densham had known each other for many years  i am not sure she said that you did not deserve it but then you see you are too old a friend to be so summarily dealt with  she raised her blue eyes to his and dropped them smiling softly  densham looked steadily away into the fire wondering how to broach the subject which had so suddenly taken the foremost place in his thoughts he had not come to make even the idlest of love this afternoon the time when he had been content to do so seemed very far away just now somehow this dainty little woman with her watteaulike grace and delicate mannerisms had for the present at any rate lost all her attractiveness for him and he was able to meet the flash of her bright eyes and feel the touch of her soft fingers without any corresponding thrill  you are very good to me he said thoughtfully may i have some more tea  now densham was no strategist he had come to ask a question and he was dying to ask it he knew very well that it would not do to hurry mattersthat he must put it as casually as possible towards the close of his visit but at the same time the period of probation during which he should have been more than usually entertaining was scarcely a success and his manner was restless and constrained every now and then there were long and unusual pauses and he continuously and with obvious effort kept bringing back the conversation to the reception last night in the hope that some remark from her might make the way easier for him but nothing of the sort happened the reception had not interested her in the slightest and she had nothing to say about it and his preoccupation at last became manifest she looked at him curiously after one of those awkward pauses to which she was quite unaccustomed and his thoughts were evidently far away as a matter of fact he was at that moment actually framing the question which he had come to ask  my dear francis she said quietly why dont you tell me what is the matter with you you are not amusing you have something on your mind is it anything you wish to ask of me  yes he said boldly i have come to ask you a favour  she smiled at him encouragingly  well do ask it she said and get rid of your woebegone face you ought to know that if it is anything within my power i shall not hesitate  i want he said to paint your portrait for next years academy  this was a master stroke to have densham paint her picture was just at that moment the height of mrs thorpesatchells ambition a flush of pleasure came into her cheeks and her eyes were very bright  do you really mean it she exclaimed leaning over towards him are you sure  of course i mean it he answered if only i can do you justice i think it ought to be the portrait of the year i have been studying you for a long time in an indefinite sort of way and i think that i have some good ideas  mrs thorpesatchell laughed softly densham although not a great artist was the most fashionable portrait painter of the minute and he had the knack of giving a chic touch to his womenof investing them with a certain style without the sacrifice of similitude he refused quite as many commissions as he accepted and he could scarcely have flattered mrs thorpesatchell more than by his request she was delightfully amiable  you are a dear old thing she said beaming upon him what shall i wear that yellow satin gown that you like or say you like so much  he discussed the question with her gravely it was not until he rose to go that he actually broached the question which had been engrossing all his thoughts  by the bye he said i wanted to ask you something you know harcutt  she nodded of course she knew harcutt were her first suspicions correct had he some other reason for this visit of his  well densham went on he is immensely interested in some people who were at that stupid reception last night he tried to get an introduction but he couldnt find any one who knew them and he doesnt know the princess well enough to ask her he thought that he saw you speaking to the man so i promised that when i saw you i would ask about them  i spoke to a good many men she said what is his name  sabinmr sabin and there is a girl his daughter or niece i suppose  was it denshams fancy or had she indeed turned a shade paler the little bejewelled hand which had been resting close to his suddenly buried itself in the cushions densham who was watching her closely was conscious of a hardness about her mouth which he had never noticed before she was silent some time before she answered him  i am sorry she said slowly but i can tell you scarcely anything about them i only met him once in india many years ago and i have not the slightest idea as to who he is or where he came from i am quite sure that i should not have recollected him last night but for his deformity  densham tried very hard to hide his disappointment  so you met him in india he remarked do you know what he was doing there he was not in the service at all i suppose  i really do not know she answered but i think not i believe that he is or was very wealthy i remember hearing a few things about himnothing of much importance but if mr harcutt is your friend she added looking at him fixedly you can give him some excellent advice  harcutt is a very decent fellow densham said and i know that he will be glad of it  tell him to have nothing whatever to do with mr sabin  densham looked at her keenly  then you do know something about him he exclaimed  she moved her chair back a little to where the light no longer played upon her face and she answered him without looking up  very little it was so long ago and my memory is not what it used to be never mind that the advice is good anyhow if she continued looking steadily up at densham if it were not mr harcutt who was interested in these people if it were any one francis for whose welfare i had a greater care who was really my friend i would make that advice if i could a thousand times stronger i would implore him to have nothing whatever to do with this man or any of his creatures  densham laughednot very easily his disappointment was great but his interest was stimulated  at any rate he said the girl is harmless she cannot have left school a year  a year with that man she answered bitterly is a liberal education in corruption dont misunderstand me i have no personal grievance against him we have never come together thank god but there were storiesi cannot remember them nowi do not wish to remember them but the impression they made still remains if a little of what people said about him is true he is a prince of wickedness  the girl herself  i know nothing of she admitted  densham determined upon a bold stroke  look here he said do me this favouryou shall never regret it you and the princess are intimate i know order your carriage and go and see her this afternoon ask her what she knows about that girl get her to tell you everything then let me know dont ask me to explain just nowsimply remember that we are old friends and that i ask you to do this thing for me  she rang the bell  my victoria at once she told the servant then she turned to densham i will do exactly what you ask she said you can come with me and wait while i see the princessif she is at home you see i am doing for you what i would do for no one else in the world dont trouble about thanking me now do you mind waiting while i get my things on i shall only be a minute or two  her minute or two was half an hour densham waited impatiently he scarcely knew whether to be satisfied with the result of his mission or not he had learnt a very littlehe was probably going to learn a little more but he was quite aware that he had not conducted the negotiations with any particular skill and the bribe which he had offered was a heavy one he was still uncertain about it when mrs thorpesatchell reappeared she had changed her indoor gown for a soft petuniacoloured costume trimmed with sable and she held out her hands towards him with a delightful smile  céleste is wretchedly awkward with gloves she said so i have left them for you do you like my gown  you look charming he said bending over his task and you know it  i always wear my smartest clothes when i am going to see my particular friends she declared they quiz one so besides i do not always have an escort come  she talked to him gaily on the stairs as he handed her into the carriage and all the way to their destination yet he was conscious all the time of a subtle change in her demeanour towards him she was a proud little woman and she had received a shock densham was making use of herdensham of all men was making use of her of all women he had been perfectly correct in those vague fears of his she did not believe that he had come to her for his friends sake she never doubted but that it was he himself who was interested in this girl and she looked upon his visit and his request to her as something very nearly approaching brutality he must be interested in the girl very deeply interested or he would never have resorted to such means of gaining information about her she was suddenly silent and turned a little pale as the carriage turned into the square her errand was not a pleasant one to her  densham was left alone in the carriage for nearly an hour he was impatient and yet her prolonged absence pleased him she had found the princess in she would bring him the information he desired he sat gazing idly into the faces of the passersby with his thoughts very far away how that girls face had taken hold of his fancy had excited in some strange way his whole artistic temperament she was the exquisite embodiment of a new type of girlhood from which was excluded all that was crude and unpleasing and unfinished she seemed to him to combine in some mysterious manner all the dainty freshness of youth with the delicate grace and savoir faire of a frenchwoman of the best period he scarcely fancied himself in love with her at any rate if it had been suggested to him he would have denied it her beauty had certainly taken a singular hold of him his imagination was touched he was immensely attracted but as to anything seriouswell he would not have admitted it even to himself liberty meant so much to him he had told himself over and over again that for many years at least his art must be his sole mistress besides he was no boy to lose his heart as certainly wolfenden had done to a girl with whom he had never even spoken it was ridiculous and yet  a soft voice in his ear suddenly recalled him to the present mrs thorpesatchell was standing upon the pavement the slight pallor had gone from her cheeks and the light had come back to her eyes he looked at her irresistibly attracted she had never appeared more charming  she stepped into the carriage and the soft folds of her gown spread themselves out over the cushions she drew them on one side to make room for him  come she said let us have one turn in the park it is quite early although i am afraid that i have been a very long time  he stepped in at once and they drove off mrs thorpesatchell laughingly repeated some story which the princess had just told her evidently she was in high spirits the strained look had gone from her face her gaiety was no longer forced  you want to know the result of my mission i suppose she remarked pleasantly well i am afraid you will call it a failure the moment i mentioned the mans name the princess stopped me  you mustnt talk to me about that man she said dont ask why only you must not talk about him  i dont want to i assured her but the girl  what did she say about the girl densham asked  well she did tell me something about her mrs thorpesatchell said slowly but unfortunately it will not help your friend she only told me when i had promised unconditionally and upon my honour to keep her information a profound secret so i am sorry francis but even to you  of course you must not repeat it densham said hastily i would not ask you for the world but is there not a single scrap of information about the man or the girl who he is what he is of what family or nationality the girl isanything at all which i can take to harcutt  mrs thorpesatchell looked straight at him with a faint smile at the corners of her lips  yes there is one thing which you can tell mr harcutt she said  densham drew a little breath at last then  you can tell him this mrs thorpesatchell said slowly and impressively that if it is the girl as i suppose it is in whom he is interested that the very best thing he can do is to forget that he has ever seen her i cannot tell you who she is or what although i know but we are old friends francis and i know that my word will be sufficient for you you can take this from me as the solemn truth your friend had better hope for the love of the sphinx or fix his heart upon the statue of diana as think of that girl  densham was looking straight ahead along the stream of vehicles his eyes were set but he saw nothing he did not doubt her word for a moment he knew that she had spoken the truth the atmosphere seemed suddenly grey and sunless he shivered a littlehe was positively chilled just for a moment he saw the girls face heard the swirl of her skirts as she had passed their table and the sound of her voice as she had bent over the great cluster of white roses whose faint perfume reached even to where they were sitting then he half closed his eyes he had come very near making a terrible mistake  thank you he said i will tell harcutt     chapter viii  a meeting in bond street   wolfenden returned to his rooms to lunch intending to go round to see his last nights visitor immediately afterwards he had scarcely taken off his coat however before selby met him in the hall a note in his hand  from the young lady my lord he announced my wife has just sent it round  wolfenden tore the envelope open and read it                                thursday morning       dear lord wolfendenof course i made a mistake in coming to you      last night i am very sorry indeedmore sorry than you will ever      know a woman does not forget these things readily and the lesson      you have taught me it will not be difficult for me to remember all      my life i cannot consent to remain your debtor and i am leaving      here at once i shall have gone long before you receive this note      do not try to find me i shall not want for friends if i choose to      seek them apart from this i do not want to see you again i mean      it and i trust to your honour to respect my wishes i think that i      may at least ask you to grant me this for the sake of those days at      deringham which it is now my fervent wish to utterly forgeti      am yours sincerely                           blanche merton  the young lady my lord selby remarked left early this morning she expressed herself as altogether satisfied with the attention she had received but she had decided to make other arrangements  wolfenden nodded and walked into his diningroom with the note crushed up in his hand  for the sake of those days at deringham he repeated softly to himself was the girl a fool or only an adventuress it was true that there had been something like a very mild flirtation between them at deringham but it had been altogether harmless and certainly more of her seeking than his they had met in the grounds once or twice and walked together he had talked to her a little after dinner feeling a certain sympathy for her isolation and perhaps a little admiration for her undoubted prettiness yet all the time he had had a slightly uneasy feeling with regard to her her ingenuousness had become a matter of doubt to him it was so now more than ever yet he could not understand her going away like this and the tone of her note so far as he was concerned it was the most satisfactory thing that could have happened it relieved him of a responsibility which he scarcely knew how to deal with in the face of her dismissal from deringham any assistance which she might have accepted from him would naturally have been open to misapprehension but that she should have gone away and have written to him in such a strain was directly contrary to his anticipations unless she was really hurt and disappointed by his reception of her he could not see what she had to gain by it he was puzzled a little but his thoughts were too deeply engrossed elsewhere for him to take her disappearance very seriously by the time he had finished lunch he had come to the conclusion that what had happened was for the best and that he would take her at her word  he left his rooms again about three oclock and at precisely the hour at which densham had rung the bell of mrs thorpesatchells house in mayfair he experienced a very great piece of good fortune  coming out of scotts where more from habit than necessity he had turned in to have his hat ironed he came face to face a few yards up bond street with the two people whom more than any one else in the world he had desired to meet they were walking together the girl talking the man listening with an air of halfamused deference suddenly she broke off and welcomed wolfenden with a delightful smile of recognition the man looked up quickly wolfenden was standing before them on the pavement hat in hand his pleasure at this unexpected meeting very plainly evidenced in his face mr sabins greeting if devoid of any special cordiality was courteous and even genial wolfenden never quite knew whence he got the impression which certainly came to him with all the strength and absoluteness of an original inspiration that this encounter was not altogether pleasant to him  how strange that we should meet you the girl said do you know that this is the first walk that i have ever had in london  she spoke rather softly and rather slowly her voice possessed a sibilant and musical intonation there was perhaps the faintest suggestion of an accent as she stood there smiling upon him in a deep blue gown trimmed with a silvery fur in the making of which no english dressmaker had been concerned wolfendens subjection was absolute and complete he was aware that his answer was a little flurried he was less at his ease than he could have wished afterwards he thought of a hundred things he would have liked to have said but the surprise of seeing them so suddenly had cost him a little of his usual selfpossession mr sabin took up the conversation  my infirmity he said glancing downwards makes walking especially on stone pavements rather a painful undertaking however london is one of those cities which can only be seen on foot and my niece has all the curiosity of her age  she laughed out frankly she wore no veil and a tinge of colour had found its way into her cheeks relieving that delicate but not unhealthy pallor which to densham had seemed so exquisite  i think shopping is delightful is it not she exclaimed  wolfenden was absolutely sure of it he was indeed needlessly emphatic mr sabin smiled faintly  i am glad to have met you again lord wolfenden he said if only to thank you for your aid last night i was anxious to get away before any fuss was made or i would have expressed my gratitude at the time in a more seemly fashion  i hope wolfenden said that you will not think it necessary to say anything more about it i did what any one in my place would have done without a moments hesitation  i am not quite so sure of that mr sabin said but by the bye can you tell me what became of the fellow did any one go after him  there was some sort of pursuit i believe wolfenden said slowly but he was not caught  i am glad to hear it mr sabin said  wolfenden looked at him in some surprise he could not make up his mind whether it was his duty to disclose the name of the man who had made this strange attempt  your assailant was i suppose a stranger to you he said slowly  mr sabin shook his head  by no means i recognised him directly so i believe did you  wolfenden was honestly amazed  he was your guest i believe mr sabin continued until i entered the room i saw him leave and i was halfprepared for something of the sort  he was my guest it is true but none the less he was a stranger to me wolfenden explained he brought a letter from my cousin who seems to have considered him a decent sort of fellow  there is mr sabin said dryly nothing whatever the matter with him except that he is mad  on the whole i cannot say that i am surprised to hear it wolfenden remarked but i certainly think that considering the form his madness takes you ought to protect yourself in some way  mr sabin shrugged his shoulders contemptuously  he can never hurt me i carry a talisman which is proof against any attempt that he can make but none the less i must confess that your aid last night was very welcome  i was very pleased to be of any service wolfenden said especially he added glancing toward mr sabins niece since it has given me the pleasure of your acquaintance  a little thrill passed through him her delicatelycurved lips were quivering as though with amusement and her eyes had fallen she had blushed slightly at that unwitting ardent look of his mr sabins cold voice recalled him to himself  i believe he said that i overheard your name correctly it is wolfenden is it not  wolfenden assented  i am sorry that i havent a card he said that is my name  mr sabin looked at him curiously  wolfenden is i believe the family name of the deringhams may i ask are you any relation to admiral lord deringham  wolfenden was suddenly grave  yes he answered he is my father did you ever meet him  mr sabin shook his head  no i have heard of him abroad also i believe of the countess of deringham your mother it is many years ago i trust that i have not inadvertently  not at all wolfenden declared my father is still alive although he is in very delicate health i wonder would you and your niece do me the honour of having some tea with me it is ladies day at the geranium club and i should be delighted to take you there if you would allow me  mr sabin shook his head  wolfenden had the satisfaction of seeing the girl look disappointed  we are very much obliged to you mr sabin said but i have an appointment which is already overdue you must not mind helène if we ride the rest of the way  he turned and hailed a passing hansom which drew up immediately at the kerb by their side mr sabin handed his niece in and stood for a moment on the pavement with wolfenden  i hope that we may meet again before long lord wolfenden he said in the meantime let me assure you once more of my sincere gratitude  the girl leaned forward over the apron of the cab  and may i not add mine too she said i almost wish that we were not going to the milan again tonight i am afraid that i shall be nervous  she looked straight at wolfenden he was ridiculously happy  i can promise he said that no harm shall come to mr sabin tonight at any rate i shall be at the milan myself and i will keep a very close look out  how reassuring she exclaimed with a brilliant smile lord wolfenden is going to be at the milan tonight she added turning to mr sabin why dont you ask him to join us i shall feel so much more comfortable  there was a faint but distinct frown on mr sabins facea distinct hesitation before he spoke but wolfenden would notice neither he was looking over mr sabins shoulder and his instructions were very clear  if you will have supper with us we shall be very pleased mr sabin said stiffly but no doubt you have already made your party supper is an institution which one seldom contemplates alone  i am quite free and i shall be delighted wolfenden said without hesitation about eleven i suppose  a quarter past mr sabin said stepping into the cab we may go to the theatre  the hansom drove off and wolfenden stood on the pavement hat in hand what fortune he could scarcely believe in it then just as he turned to move on something lying at his feet almost at the edge of the kerbstone attracted his attention he looked at it more closely it was a ribbona little delicate strip of deep blue ribbon he knew quite well whence it must have come it had fallen from her gown as she had stepped into the hansom he looked up and down the street it was full but he saw no one whom he knew the thing could be done in a minute he stooped quickly down and picked it up crushing it in his gloved hand and walking on at once with heightened colour and a general sense of having made a fool of himself for a moment or two he was especially careful to look neither to the right or to the left then a sense that some one from the other side of the road was watching him drew his eyes in that direction a young man was standing upon the edge of the pavement a peculiar smile parting his lips and a cigarette between his fingers for a moment wolfenden was furiously angry then the eyes of the two men met across the street and wolfenden forgot his anger he recognised him at once notwithstanding his appearance in an afternoon toilette as carefully chosen as his own it was felix mr sabins assailant     chapter ix  the shadows that go before   wolfenden forgot his anger at once he hesitated for a moment then he crossed the street and stood side by side with felix upon the pavement  i am glad to see that you are looking a sane man again wolfenden said after they had exchanged the usual greetings you might have been in a much more uncomfortable place after your last nights escapade  felix shrugged his shoulders  i think he said that if i had succeeded a little discomfort would only have amused me it is not pleasant to fail  wolfenden stood squarely upon his feet and laid his hand lightly upon the others shoulder  look here he said it wont do for you to go following a man about london like this watching for an opportunity to murder him i dont like interfering in other peoples business but willingly or unwillingly i seem to have got mixed up in this and i have a word or two to say about it unless you give me your promise upon your honour to make no further attempt upon that mans life i shall go to the police tell them what i know and have you watched  you shall have felix said quietly my promise a greater power than the threat of your english police has tied my hands for the present i have abandoned my purpose  i am bound to believe you wolfenden said and you look as though you were speaking the truth yet you must forgive my asking why in that case you are following the man about you must have a motive  felix shook his head  as it happened he said i am here by the merest accident it may seem strange to you but it is perfectly true i have just come out of waldorfs above there and i saw you all three upon the pavement  i am glad to hear it wolfenden said  more glad felix said than i was to see you with them can you not believe what i tell you shall i give you proof will you be convinced then every moment you spend with that man is an evil one for you you may have thought me inclined to be melodramatic last night perhaps i was all the same the man is a fiend will you not be warned i tell you that he is a fiend  perhaps he is wolfenden said indifferently i am not interested in him  but you are interestedin his companion  wolfenden frowned  i think he said that we will leave the lady out of the conversation  felix sighed  you are a good fellow he said but forgive me like all your countrymen you carry chivalry just a thought too fareven to simplicity you do not understand such people and their ways  wolfenden was getting angry but he held himself in check  you know nothing against her he said slowly  it is true felix answered i know nothing against her it is not necessary she is his creature that is apparent the shadow of his wickedness is enough  wolfenden checked himself in the middle of a hot reply he was suddenly conscious of the absurdity of losing his temper in the open street with a man so obviously illbalancedpossessed too of such strange and wild impulses  let us talk he said of something else or say goodmorning which way were you going  to the russian embassy felix said i have some work to do this afternoon  wolfenden looked at him curiously  our ways then are the same for a short distance he said let us walk together forgive me but you are really then attached to the embassy  felix nodded and glanced at his companion with a smile  i am not what you call a fraud altogether he said i am junior secretary to prince lobenski you i think are not a politician are you  wolfenden shook his head  i take no interest in politics he said i shall probably have to sit in the house of lords some day but i shall be sorry indeed when the time comes  felix sighed and was silent for a moment  you are perhaps fortunate he said the ways of the politician are not exactly rosestrewn you represent a class which in my country does not exist there we are all either in the army or interested in statecraft perhaps the secure position of your country does not require such ardent service  you areof what nationality may i ask wolfenden inquired  felix hesitated  perhaps he said you had better not know the less you know of me the better the time may come when it will be to your benefit to be ignorant  wolfenden took no pains to hide his incredulity  it is easy to see that you are a stranger in this country he remarked we are not in russia or in south america i can assure you that we scarcely know the meaning of the word intrigue here we are the most matteroffact and perhaps the most commonplace nation in the world you will find it out for yourself in time whilst you are with us you must perforce fall to our level  i too must become commonplace felix said smiling is that what you mean  in a certain sense yes wolfenden answered you will not be able to help it it will be the natural result of your environment in your own country wherever that may be i can imagine that you might be a person jealously watched by the police your comings and goings made a note of your intriguesi take it for granted that you are concerned in somethe object of the most jealous and unceasing suspicion here there is nothing of that you could not intrigue if you wanted to there is nothing to intrigue about  they were crossing a crowded thoroughfare and felix did not reply until they were safe on the opposite pavement then he took wolfendens arm and leaning over almost whispered in his ear  you speak he said what ninetenths of your countrymen believe yet you are wrong wherever there are international questions which bring great powers such as yours into antagonism or the reverse with other great countries the soil is laid ready for intrigue and the seed is never long wanted yes i know that to all appearance you are the smuggest and most respectable nation ever evolved in this worlds history yet if you tell me that yours is a nation free from intrigue i correct you you are wrong you do not knowthat is all that very man whose life last night you so inopportunely saved is at this moment deeply involved in an intrigue against your country  mr sabin wolfenden exclaimed  yes mr sabin mind i know this by chance only i am not concerned one way or the other my quarrel with him is a private one i am robbed for the present of my vengeance by a power to which i am forced to yield implicit obedience so for the present i have forgotten that he is my enemy he is safe from me yet if last night i had struck home i should have ridded your country of a great and menacing danger perhapswho can tellhe is a man who succeedsi might even have saved england from conquest and ruin  they had reached the top of piccadilly and downward towards the park flowed the great afternoon stream of footpeople and carriages wolfenden on whom his companions words charged as they were with an almost passionate earnestness could scarcely fail to leave some impression was silent for a moment  do you really believe he said that ours is a country which could possibly stand in any such danger we are outside all continental alliances we are pledged to support neither the dual or the triple alliance how could we possibly become embroiled  i will tell you one thing which you may not readily believe felix said there is no country in the world so hated by all the great powers as england  wolfenden shrugged his shoulders  russia he remarked is perhaps jealous of our hold on asia but  russia felix interrupted of all the countries in the world except perhaps italy is the most friendly disposed towards you  wolfenden laughed  come he said you forget germany  germany felix exclaimed scornfully believe it or not as you choose but germany detests you i will tell you a thing which you can think of when you are an old man and there are great changes and events for you to look back upon a war between germany and england is only a matter of timeof a few short years perhaps even months in the cabinet at berlin a war with you today would be more popular than a war with france  you take my breath away wolfenden exclaimed laughing  felix was very much in earnest  in the little world of diplomacy he said in the innermost councils these things are known the outside public knows nothing of the awful responsibilities of those who govern two at least of your ministers have realised the position you read this morning in the papers of more warships and strengthened fortificationsalready there have been whispers of the conscription it is not against russia or against france that you are slowly arming yourselves it is against germany  germany would be mad to fight us wolfenden declared  under certain conditions felix said slowly dont be angrygermany must beat you  wolfenden looking across the street saw harcutt on the steps of his club and beckoned to him  there is harcutt he exclaimed pointing him out to felix he is a journalist you know and in search of a sensation let us hear what he has to say about these things  but felix unlinked his arm from wolfendens hastily  you must excuse me he said harcutt would recognise me and i do not wish to be pointed out everywhere as a wouldbe assassin remember what i have said and avoid sabin and his parasites as you would the devil  felix hurried away wolfenden remained for a moment standing in the middle of the pavement looking blankly along piccadilly harcutt crossed over to him  you look he remarked to wolfenden like a man who needs a drink  wolfenden turned with him into the club  i believe that i do he said i have had rather an eventful hour     chapter x  the secretary   mr sabin who had parted with wolfenden with evident relief leaned back in the cab and looked at his watch  that young man he remarked has wasted ten minutes of my time he will probably have to pay for it some day  by the bye the girl asked who is he  his name is wolfendenlord wolfenden  so i gathered and who is lord wolfenden  the only son of admiral the earl of deringham i dont know anything more than that about him myself  admiral deringham the girl repeated thoughtfully the name sounds familiar  mr sabin nodded  very likely he said he was in command of the channel squadron at the time of the magnificent disaster he was barely half a mile away and saw the whole thing he came in too rightly or wrongly for a share of the blame  didnt he go mad or something the girl asked  he had a fit mr sabin said calmly and left the service almost directly afterwards he is living in strict seclusion in norfolk i believe i should not like to say that he is mad as a matter of fact i do not believe that he is  she looked at him curiously there was a note of reserve in his tone  you are interested in him are you not she asked  in a measure he admitted he is supposed mad or not to be the greatest living authority on the coast defences of england and the state of her battleships they shelved him at the admiralty but he wrote some vigorous letters to the papers and there are people pretty high up who believe in him others of course think that he is a crank  but why she asked languidly are you interested in such matters  mr sabin knocked the ash off the cigarette he was smoking and was silent for a moment  one gets interested nowadays ina great many things which scarcely seem to concern us he remarked deliberately you for instance seem interested in this mans son he cannot possibly be of any account to us  she shrugged her shoulders  did i say that i was interested in him  you did not mr sabin answered but it was scarcely necessary you stopped to speak to him of your own accord and you asked him to supper which was scarcely discreet  one gets so bored sometimes she admitted frankly  you are only a woman he said indulgently a year of waiting seems to you an eternity however vast the stake there will come a time when you will see things differently  i wonder she said softly i wonder                                       mr sabin had unconsciously spoken the truth when he had pleaded an appointment to lord wolfenden his servant drew him on one side directly they entered the house  there is a young lady here sir waiting for you in the study  been here long mr sabin asked  about two hours sir she has rung once or twice to ask about you  mr sabin turned away and opened the study door carefully closing it behind him at once as he recognised his visitor the air was blue with tobacco smoke and the girl who looked up at his entrance held a cigarette between her fingers mr sabin was at least as surprised as lord wolfenden when he recognised his visitor but his face was absolutely emotionless he nodded not unkindly and stood looking at her leaning upon his stick  well blanche what has gone wrong he asked  pretty well everything she answered ive been turned away  detected he asked quickly  suspected at any rate i wrote you that lord deringham was watching me sharply where he got the idea from i cant imagine but he got it and he got it right anyhow hes followed me about like a cat and its all up  what does he know  nothing he found a sheet of carbon on my desk no more i had to leave in an hour  and lady deringham  she is like the restshe thinks him mad she has not the faintest idea that mad or not he has stumbled upon the truth she was glad to have me gofor other reasons but she has not the faintest doubt but that i have been unjustly dismissed  and he how much does he know  exactly what i told younothing his idea was just a confused one that i thought the stuff valuablehow you can make any sense of such trash i dont knowand that i was keeping a copy back for myself he was worrying for an excuse to get rid of me and he grabbed at it  why was lady deringham glad to have you go mr sabin asked  because i amused myself with her son  lord wolfenden  yes  for the first time since he had entered the room mr sabins grim countenance relaxed the corners of his lips slowly twisted themselves into a smile  good girl he said is he any use now  none she answered with some emphasis none whatever he is a fool  the colour in her cheeks had deepened a little a light shot from her eyes mr sabins amusement deepened he looked positively benign  youve tried him he suggested  the girl nodded and blew a little cloud of tobacco smoke from her mouth  yes i went there last night he was very kind he sent his servant out with me and got me nice respectable rooms  mr sabin did what was for him an exceptional thing he sat down and laughed to himself softly but with a genuine and obvious enjoyment  blanche he said it was a lucky thing that i discovered you no one else could have appreciated you properly  she looked at him with a sudden hardness  you should appreciate me she said for what i am you made me i am of your handiwork a man should appreciate the tool of his own fashioning  nature mr sabin said smoothly had made the way easy for me mine were but finishing touches but we have no time for this sort of thing you have done well at deringham and i shall not forget it but your dismissal just now is exceedingly awkward for the moment indeed i scarcely see my way i wonder in what direction lord deringham will look for your successor  not anywhere within the sphere of your influence she answered i do not think that i shall have a successor at all just yet there was only a weeks work to do he will copy that himself  i am very much afraid mr sabin said that he will yet we must have that copy  you will be very clever she said slowly he has put watches all round the place and the windows are barricaded he sleeps with a revolver by his side and there are several horrors in the shape of traps all round the house  no wonder mr sabin said that people think him mad  the girl laughed shortly  he is mad she said there is no possible doubt about that you couldnt live with him a day and doubt it  hereditary no doubt mr sabin suggested quietly  blanche shrugged her shoulders and leaned back yawning  anyhow she said ive had enough of them all it has been very tiresome work and i am sick of it give me some money i want a spree i am going to have a months holiday  mr sabin sat down at his desk and drew out a chequebook  there will be no difficulty about the money he said but i cannot spare you for a month long before that i must have the rest of this madmans figures  the girls face darkened  havent i told you she said that there is not the slightest chance of their taking me back you might as well believe me they wouldnt have me and i wouldnt go  i do not expect anything of the sort mr sabin said there are other directions though in which i shall require your aid i shall have to go to deringham myself and as i know nothing whatever about the place you will be useful to me there i believe that your home is somewhere near there  well  there is no reason i suppose mr sabin continued why a portion of the vacation you were speaking of should not be spent there  none the girl replied except that it would be deadly dull and no holiday at all i should want paying for it  mr sabin looked down at the chequebook which lay open before him  i was intending he said to offer you a cheque for fifty pounds i will make it one hundred and you will rejoin your family circle at fakenham i believe in one week from today  the girl made a wry face  the moneys all right she said but you ought to see my family circle they are all cracked on farming from the poor old dad who loses all his spare cash at it down to little letty my youngest sister who can tell you everything about the last turnip crop do ride over and see us you will find it so amusing  i shall be charmed mr sabin said suavely as he commenced filling in the body of the cheque are all your sisters may i ask as delightful as you  she looked at him defiantly  look here she said none of that of course you wouldnt come but in any case i wont have you the girls arewell not like me im glad to say i wont have the responsibility of introducing a mephistocles into the domestic circle  i can assure you mr sabin said that i had not the faintest idea of coming my visit to norfolk will be anything but a pleasure trip and i shall have no time to spare  i believe i have your address westacott farm fakenham is it not now do what you like in the meantime but a week from today there will be a letter from me there here is the cheque  the girl rose and shook out her skirts  arent you going to take me anywhere she asked you might ask me to have supper with you tonight  mr sabin shook his head gently  i am sorry he said but i have a young lady living with me  oh  she is my niece and it takes more than my spare time to entertain her he continued without noticing the interjection you have plenty of friends go and look them up and enjoy yourselffor a week i have no heart to go pleasuremaking until my work is finished  she drew on her gloves and walked to the door mr sabin came with her and opened it  i wish she said that i could understand what in this world you are trying to evolve from those rubbishy papers  he laughed  some day he said i will tell you at present you would not understand be patient a little longer  it has been long enough she exclaimed i have had seven months of it  and i he answered seven years take care of yourself and remember i shall want you in a week     chapter xi  the fruit that is of gold   at precisely the hour agreed upon harcutt and densham met in one of the anterooms leading into the milan restaurant they surrendered their coats and hats to an attendant and strolled about waiting for wolfenden a quarter of an hour passed the stream of people from the theatres began to grow thinner still wolfenden did not come harcutt took out his watch  i propose that we do not wait any longer for wolfenden he said i saw him this afternoon and he answered me very oddly when i reminded him about tonight there is such a crowd here too that they will not keep our table much longer  let us go in by all means densham agreed wolfenden will easily find us if he wants to  harcutt returned his watch to his pocket slowly and without removing his eyes from denshams face  youre not looking very fit old chap he remarked is anything wrong  densham shook his head and turned away  i am a little tired he said weve been keeping late hours the last few nights theres nothing the matter with me though come let us go in  harcutt linked his arm in denshams the two men stood in the doorway  i have not asked you yet harcutt said in a low tone what fortune  densham laughed a little bitterly  i will tell you all that i know presently he said  you have found out something then  i have found out densham answered all that i care to know i have found out so much that i am leaving england within a week  harcutt looked at him curiously  poor old chap he said softly i had no idea that you were so hard hit as all that you know  they passed through the crowded room to their table suddenly harcutt stopped short and laid his hand upon denshams arm  great scott he exclaimed look at that no wonder we had to wait for wolfenden  mr sabin and his niece were occupying the same table as on the previous night only this time they were not alone wolfenden was sitting there between the two at the moment of their entrance he and the girl were laughing together mr sabin with the air of one wholly detached from his companions was calmly proceeding with his supper  i understand now harcutt whispered what wolfenden meant this afternoon when i reminded him about tonight he laughed and said well i shall see you at any rate i thought it was odd at the time i wonder how he managed it  densham made no reply the two men took their seats in silence wolfenden was sitting with his back halfturned to them and he had not noticed their entrance in a moment or two however he looked round and seeing them leaned over towards the girl and apparently asked her something she nodded and he immediately left his seat and joined them  there was a little hesitation almost awkwardness in their greetings no one knew exactly what to say  you fellows are rather late arent you wolfenden remarked  we were here punctually enough harcutt replied but we have been waiting for you nearly a quarter of an hour  i am sorry wolfenden said the fact is i ought to have left word when i came in but i quite forgot it i took it for granted that you would look into the room when you found that i was behind time  well it isnt of much consequence harcutt declared we are here now at any rate although it seems that after all we are not to have supper together  wolfenden glanced rapidly over his shoulder  you understand the position of course he said i need not ask you to excuse me  harcutt nodded  oh well excuse you by all means but on one conditionwe want to know all about it where can we see you afterwards  at my rooms wolfenden said turning away and resuming his seat at the other table  densham had made no attempt whatever to join in the conversation once his eyes had met wolfendens and it seemed to the latter that there was a certain expression there which needed some explanation it was not angerit certainly was not envy wolfenden was puzzledhe was even disturbed had densham discovered anything further than he himself knew about this man and the girl what did he mean by looking as though the key to this mysterious situation was in his hands and as though he had nothing but pity for the only one of the trio who had met with any success wolfenden resumed his seat with an uncomfortable conviction that densham knew more than he did about these people whose guest he had become and that the knowledge had damped all his ardour there was a cloud upon his face for a moment the exuberance of his happiness had received a sudden check then the girl spoke to him and the memory of denshams unspoken warning passed away he looked at her long and searchingly her face was as innocent and proud as the face of a child she was unconscious even of his close scrutiny the man might be anything it might even be that every word that felix had spoken was true but of the girl he would believe no evil he would not doubt her even for a moment  your friend remarked mr sabin helping himself to an ortolan is a journalist is he not his face seems familiar to me although i have forgotten his name if ever i knew it  he is a journalist wolfenden answered not one of the rank and filerather a dilettante but still a hard worker he is devoted to his profession though and his name is harcutt  harcutt mr sabin repeated although he did not appear to recollect the name he is a political journalist is he not  not that i am aware of wolfenden answered he is generally considered to be the great scribe of society i believe that he is interested in foreign politics though  ah  mr sabins interjection was significant and wolfenden looked up quickly but fruitlessly the mans face was impenetrable  the other fellow wolfenden said turning to the girl is densham the painter his picture in this years academy was a good deal talked about and he does some excellent portraits  she threw a glance at him over her gleaming white shoulder  he looks like an artist she said i liked his picturea french landscape was it not and his portrait of the countess of davenport was magnificent  if you would care to know him wolfenden said i should be very happy to present him to you  mr sabin looked up and shook his head quickly but firmly  you must excuse us he said my niece and i are not in england for very long and we have reasons for avoiding new acquaintances as much as possible  a shade passed across the girls face wolfenden would have given much to have known into what worlds those clear soft eyes suddenly set in a far away gaze were wanderingwhat those regrets were which had floated up so suddenly before her was she too as impenetrable as the man or would he some day share with her what there was of sorrow or of mystery in her young life his heart beat with unaccustomed quickness at the thought mr sabins last remark the uncertainty of his own position with regard to these people filled him with sudden fear it might be that he too was to be included in the sentence which had just been pronounced he looked up from the table to find mr sabins cold steely eyes fixed upon him and acting upon a sudden impulse he spoke what was nearest to his heart  i hope he said that the few acquaintances whom fate does bring you are not to suffer for the same reason  mr sabin smiled and poured himself out a glass of wine  you are very good he said i presume that you refer to yourself we shall always be glad that we met you shall we not helène but i doubt very much if after tonight we shall meet again in england at all  to wolfenden the light seemed suddenly to have gone out and the soft low music to have become a wailing dirge he retained some command of his features only by a tremendous effort even then he felt that he had become pale and that his voice betrayed something of the emotion that he felt  you are going away he said slowlyabroad  very soon indeed mr sabin answered at any rate we leave london during the week you must not look upon us lord wolfenden as ordinary pleasureseekers we are wanderers upon the face of the earth not so much by choice as by destiny i want you to try one of these cigarettes they were given to me by the khedive and i think you will admit that he knows more about tobacco than he does about governing  the girl had been gazing steadfastly at the grapes that lay untasted upon her plate and wolfenden glanced towards her twice in vain now however she looked up and a slight smile parted her lips as her eyes met his how pale she was and how suddenly serious  do not take my uncle too literally lord wolfenden she said softly i hope that we shall meet again some time if not often i should be very sorry not to think so we owe you so much  there was an added warmth in those last few words a subtle light in her eyes was she indeed a past mistress in all the arts of coquetry or was there not some message for him in that lowered tone and softened glance he sat spellbound for a moment her bosom was certainly rising and falling more quickly the pearls at her throat quivered then mr sabins voice cold and displeased dissolved the situation  i think helène if you are ready we had better go he said it is nearly halfpast twelve and we shall escape the crush if we leave at once  she stood up silently and wolfenden with slow fingers raised her cloak from the back of the chair and covered her shoulders she thanked him softly and turning away walked down the room followed by the two men in the anteroom mr sabin stopped  my watch he remarked was fast you will have time after all for a cigarette with your friends goodnight  wolfenden had no alternative but to accept his dismissal a little white hand flashing with jewels but shapely and delicate stole out from the dark fur of her cloak and he held it within his for a second  i hope he said that at any rate you will allow me to call and say goodbye before you leave england  she looked at him with a faint smile upon her lips yet her eyes were very sad  you have heard what my inexorable guardian has said lord wolfenden she answered quietly i am afraid he is right we are wanderers he and i with no settled home  i shall venture to hope he said boldly that some day you will make onein england  a tinge of colour flashed into her cheeks her eyes danced with amusement at his audacitythen they suddenly dropped and she caught up the folds of her gown  ah well she said demurely that would be too great a happiness farewell one never knows  she yielded at last to mr sabins cold impatience and turning away followed him down the staircase wolfenden remained at the top until she had passed out of sight he lingered even for a moment or two afterwards inhaling the faint subtle perfume shaken from her gowna perfume which reminded him of an orchard of pink and white apple blossoms in normandy then he turned back and finding harcutt and densham lingering over their coffee sat down beside them  harcutt looked at him through halfclosed eyesa little cloud of blue tobacco smoke hung over the table densham had eaten little but smoked continually  well he asked laconically  after all wolfenden said i have not very much to tell you fellows mr sabin did not call upon me i met him by chance in bond street and the girl asked me to supper more i believe in jest than anything however of course i took advantage of it and i have spent the evening since eleven oclock with them but as to gaining any definite information as to who or what they are i must confess ive failed altogether i know no more than i did yesterday  at any rate harcutt remarked you will soon learn all that you care to know you have inserted the thin end of the wedge you have established a visiting acquaintance  wolfenden flicked the end from his cigarette savagely  nothing of the sort he declared they have not given me their address or asked me to call on the contrary i was given very clearly to understand by mr sabin that they were only travellers and desired no acquaintances i know them that is all what the next step is to be i have not the faintest idea  densham leaned over towards them there was a strange light in his eyesa peculiar almost tremulous earnestness in his tone  why should there be any next step at all he said let us all drop this ridiculous business it has gone far enough i have a presentimentnot altogether presentiment either as it is based upon a certain knowledge it is true that these are not ordinary people and the girl is beautiful but they are not of our lives let them pass out let us forget them  harcutt shook his head  the man is too interesting to be forgotten or ignored he said i must know more about him and before many days have passed  densham turned to the younger man  at least wolfenden he said you will listen to reason i tell you as a man of honour and i think i may add as your friend that you are only courting disappointment the girl is not for you or me or any of us if i dared tell you what i know you would be the first to admit it yourself  wolfenden returned denshams eager gaze steadfastly  i have gone he said calmly too far to turn back you fellows both know i am not a womans man ive never cared for a girl in all my life or pretended to seriously now that i do it is not likely that i shall give her up without any definite reason you must speak more plainly densham or not at all  densham rose from his chair  i am very sorry he said  wolfenden turned upon him frowning  you need not be he said you and harcutt have both i believe heard some strange stories concerning the man but as for the girl no one shall dare to speak an unbecoming word of her  no one desired to densham answered quietly and yet there may be other and equally grave objections to any intercourse with her  wolfenden smiled confidently  nothing in the world worth winning he said is won without an effort or without difficulty the fruit that is of gold does not drop into your mouth  the band had ceased to play and the lights went out around them was all the bustle of departure the three men rose and left the room     chapter xii  wolfendens luck   to leave london at all under ordinary circumstances was usually a hardship for wolfenden but to leave london at this particular moment of his life was little less than a calamity yet a letter which he received a few mornings after the supper at the milan left him scarcely any alternative he read it over for the third time whilst his breakfast grew cold and each time his duty seemed to become plainer                                deringham hall norfolk       my dear wolfendenwe have been rather looking for you to come      down for a day or two and i do hope that you will be able to      manage it directly you receive this i am sorry to say that your      father is very far from well and we have all been much upset      lately he still works for eight or nine hours a day and his      hallucinations as to the value of his papers increases with every      page he writes his latest peculiarity is a rooted conviction that      there is some plot on hand to rob him of his manuscripts you      remember perhaps miss merton the young person whom we engaged as      typewriter he sent her away the other day without a moments      notice simply because he saw her with a sheet of copying paper in      her hand i did not like the girl but it is perfectly ridiculous      to suspect her of anything of the sort he insisted however that      she should leave the house within an hour and we were obliged to      give in to him since then he has seemed to become even more      fidgety he has had castiron shutters fitted to the study windows      and two of the keepers are supposed to be on duty outside night and      day with loaded revolvers people around here are all beginning to      talk and i am afraid that it is only natural that they should he      will see no one and the library door is shut and bolted      immediately he has entered it altogether it is a deplorable state      of things and what will be the end of it i cannot imagine      sometimes it occurs to me that you might have more influence over      him than i have i hope that you will be able to come down if only      for a day or two and see what effect your presence has the      shooting is not good this year but captain willis was telling me      yesterday that the golf links were in excellent condition and      there is the yacht of course if you care to use it your father      seems to have quite forgotten that she is still in the      neighbourhood i am glad to say those inspection cruises were very      bad things for him he used to get so excited and he was      dreadfully angry if the photographs which i took were at all      imperfectly developed how is everybody have you seen lady susan      lately and is it true that eleanor is engaged i feel literally      buried here but i dare not suggest a move london for him at      present would be madness i shall hope to get a wire from you      tomorrow and will send to cromer to meet any trainfrom your      affectionate mother                           constance manver deringham  there was not a word of reproach in the letter but nevertheless wolfenden felt a little consciencestricken he ought to have gone down to deringham before most certainly after the receipt of this summons he could not delay his visit any longer he walked up and down the room impatiently to leave london just now was detestable it was true that he could not call upon them and he had no idea where else to look for these people who for some mysterious reason seemed to be doing all that they could to avoid his acquaintance yet chance had favoured him oncechance might stand his friend again at any rate to feel himself in the same city with her was some consolation for the last three days he had haunted piccadilly and bond street he had become a saunterer and the shop windows had obtained from him an attention which he had never previously bestowed upon them the thought that at any turning at any moment they might meet continually thrilled him the idea of a journey which would place such a meeting utterly out of the question was more than distastefulit was hateful  and yet he would have to go he admitted that to himself as he ate his solitary breakfast with the letter spread out before him since it was inevitable he decided to lose no time better go at once and have it over the sooner he got there the sooner he would be able to return he rang the bell and gave the necessary orders at a quarter to twelve he was at kings cross  he took his ticket in a gloomy frame of mind and bought the field and a sporting novel at the bookstall then he turned towards the train and walking idly down the platform looking for selby and his belongings he experienced what was very nearly the greatest surprise of his life so far coincidence was certainly doing her best to befriend him a girl was seated alone in the further corner of a firstclass carriage something familiar in the poise of her head or the gleam of her hair gathered up underneath an unusually smart travelling hat attracted his attention he came to a sudden standstill breathless incredulous she was looking out of the opposite window her head resting upon her fingers but a sudden glimpse of her profile assured him that this was no delusion it was mr sabins niece who sat there a passenger by his own train probably as he reflected with a sudden illuminative flash of thought to be removed from the risk of any more meetings with him  wolfenden with a discretion at which he afterwards wondered did not at once attract her attention he hurried off to the smoking carriage before which his servant was standing and had his own belongings promptly removed on to the platform then he paid a visit to the refreshmentroom and provided himself with an extensive luncheon basket and finally at the bookstall he bought up every ladys paper and magazine he could lay his hands upon there was only a minute now before the train was due to leave and he walked along the platform as though looking for a seat followed by his perplexed servant when he arrived opposite to her carriage he paused only to find himself confronted by a severelooking maid dressed in black and the guard for the first time he noticed the little strip engaged pasted across the window  plenty of room lower down sir the guard remarked this is an engaged carriage  the maid whispered something to the guard who nodded and locked the door at the sound of the key however the girl looked round and saw wolfenden she lifted her eyebrows and smiled faintly then she came to the window and let it down  whatever are you doing here she asked you  he interrupted her gently the train was on the point of departure  i am going down into norfolk he said i had not the least idea of seeing you i do not think that i was ever so surprised  then he hesitated for a moment  may i come in with you he asked  she laughed at him he had been so afraid of her possible refusal that his question had been positively tremulous  i suppose so she said slowly is the train quite full then  he looked at her quite keenly she was laughing at him with her eyesan odd little trick of hers he was himself again at once and answered mendaciously but with emphasis  not a seat anywhere i shall be left behind if you dont take me in  a word in the guards ear was quite sufficient but the maid looked at wolfenden suspiciously she leaned into the carriage  would mademoiselle prefer that i too travelled with her she inquired in french  the girl answered her in the same language  certainly not céleste you had better go and take your seat at once we are just going  the maid reluctantly withdrew with disapproval very plainly stamped upon her dark face wolfenden and his belongings were bundled in and the whistle blew the train moved slowly out of the station they were off  i believe she said looking with a smile at the pile of magazines and papers littered all over the seat that you are an impostor or perhaps you have a peculiar taste in literature  she pointed towards the queen and the gentlewoman he was in high spirits and he made open confession  i saw you ten minutes ago he declared and since then i have been endeavouring to make myself an acceptable travelling companion but dont begin to study the fashions yet please tell me how it is that after looking all over london for three days for you i find you here  it is the unexpected she remarked which always happens but after all there is nothing mysterious about it i am going down to a little house which my uncle has taken somewhere near cromer you will think it odd i suppose considering his deformity but he is devoted to golf and some one has been telling him that norfolk is the proper county to go to  and you he asked  she shook her head disconsolately  i am afraid i am not english enough to care much for games she admitted i like riding and archery and i used to shoot a little but to go into the country at this time of the year to play any game seems to me positively barbarous london is quite dull enoughbut the countryand the english country toowell i have been engrossed in selfpity ever since my uncle announced his plans  i do not imagine he said smiling that you care very much for england  i do not imagine she admitted promptly that i do i am a frenchwoman you see and to me there is no city on earth like paris and no country like my own  the women of your nation he remarked are always patriotic i have never met a frenchwoman who cared for england  we have reason to be patriotic she said or rather we had she added with a curious note of sadness in her tone but come i do not desire to talk about my country i admitted you here to be an entertaining companion and you have made me speak already of the subject which is to me the most mournful in the world i do not wish to talk any more about france will you please think of another subject  mr sabin is not with you he remarked  he intended to come something important kept him at the last moment he will follow me perhaps by a later train today if not tomorrow  it is certainly a coincidence he said that you should be going to cromer my home is quite near there  and you are going there now she asked  i am delighted to say that i am  you did not mention it the other evening she remarked you talked as though you had no intention at all of leaving london  neither had i at that time he said i had a letter from home this morning which decided me  she smiled softly  well it is strange she said on the whole it is perhaps fortunate that you did not contemplate this journey when we had supper together the other night  he caught at her meaning and laughed  it is more than fortunate he declared if i had known of it and told mr sabin you would not have been travelling by this train alone  i certainly should not she admitted demurely  he saw his opportunity and swiftly availed himself of it  why does your uncle object to me so much he asked  object to you she repeated on the contrary i think that he rather approves of you you saved his life or something very much like it he should be very grateful i think that he is  yet he persisted he does not seem to desire my acquaintancefor you at any rate you have just admitted that if he had known that there was any chance of our being fellow passengers you would not have been here  she did not answer him immediately she was looking fixedly out of the window her face seemed to him more than ordinarily grave when she turned her head her eyes were thoughtfula little sad  you are quite right she said my uncle does not think it well for me to make any acquaintances in this country we are not here for very long no doubt he is right he has at least reason on his side only it is a little dull for me and it is not what i have been used to yet there are sacrifices always i cannot tell you any more you must please not ask me you are here and i am pleased that you are here there will not that content you  it gives me he answered earnestly more than contentment it is happiness  that is precisely the sort of thing she said slowly to him with laughter in her eyes which you are not to say please understand that  he accepted the rebuke lightly he was far too happy in being with her to be troubled by vague limitations the present was good enough for him and he did his best to entertain her he noticed with pleasure that she did not even glance at the pile of papers at her side they talked without intermission she was interested even gay yet he could not but notice that every now and then especially at any reference to the future her tone grew graver and a shadow passed across her face once he said something which suggested the possibility of her living always in england she had shaken her head at once gently but firmly  no i could never live in this country she said even if my liking for it grew it would be impossible  he was puzzled for a moment  you think that you could never care for it enough he suggested yet you have scarcely had time to judge it fairly london in the spring is gay enough and the life at some of our country houses is very different to what it was a few years ago society is so much more tolerant and broader  it is scarcely a question she said of my likes or dislikes next to paris i prefer london in the spring to any city in europe and a week i spent at radnett was very delightful but nevertheless i could never live here it is not my destiny  the old curiosity was strong upon him radnett was the home of the duchess of radnett and ilchester who had the reputation of being the most exclusive hostess in europe he was bewildered  i would give a great deal he said earnestly to know what you believe that destiny to be  we are bordering upon the forbidden subject she reminded him with a look which was almost reproachful you must please believe me when i tell you that for me things have already been arranged otherwise come i want you to tell me all about this country into which we are going you must remember that to me it is all new  he suffered her to lead the conversation into other channels with a vague feeling of disquiet the mystery which hung around the girl and her uncle seemed only to grow denser as his desire to penetrate it grew at present at any rate he was baffled he dared ask no more questions  the train glided into peterborough station before either of them were well aware that they had entered in earnest upon the journey wolfenden looked out of the window with amazement  why we are nearly half way there he exclaimed how wretched  she smiled and took up a magazine wolfendens servant came respectfully to the window  can i get you anything my lord he inquired  wolfenden shook his head and opening the door stepped out on to the platform  nothing thanks selby he said you had better get yourself some lunch we dont get to deringham until four oclock  the man raised his hat and turned away in a moment however he was back again  you will pardon my mentioning it my lord he said but the young ladys maid has been travelling in my carriage and a nice fidget shes been in all the way shes been muttering to herself in french and she seems terribly frightened about something or other the moment the train stopped here she rushed off to the telegraph office  she seems a little excitable wolfenden remarked all right selby youd better hurry up and get what you want to eat  certainly my lord and perhaps your lordship knows that there is a flowerstall in the corner there  wolfenden nodded and hurried off he returned to the carriage just as the train was moving off with a handful of fresh wet violets whose perfume seemed instantly to fill the compartment the girl held out her hands with a little exclamation of pleasure  what a delightful travelling companion you are she declared i think these english violets are the sweetest flowers in the world  she held them up to her lips wolfenden was looking at a paper bag in her lap  may i inquire what that is he asked  buns she answered you must not think that because i am a girl i am never hungry it is two oclock and i am positively famished i sent my maid for them  he smiled and sweeping away the bundles of rugs and coats produced the luncheon basket which he had secured at kings cross and opening it spread out the contents  for two she exclaimed and what a delightful looking salad where on earth did that come from  oh i am no magician he exclaimed i ordered the basket at kings cross after i had seen you let me spread the cloth here my dressingcase will make a capital table  they picnicked together gaily it seemed to wolfenden that chicken and tongue had never tasted so well before or claret at three shillings the bottle so full and delicious they cleared everything up and then sat and talked over the cigarette which she had insisted upon but although he tried more than once he could not lead the conversation into any serious channelshe would not talk of her past she distinctly avoided the future once when he had made a deliberate effort to gain some knowledge as to her earlier surroundings she reproved him with a silence so marked that he hastened to talk of something else  your maid he said is greatly distressed about something she sent a telegram off at peterborough i hope that your uncle will not make himself unpleasant because of my travelling with you  she smiled at him quite undisturbed  poor céleste she said your presence here has upset her terribly mr sabin has some rather strange notions about me and i am quite sure that he would rather have sent me down in a special train than have had this happen you need not look so serious about it  it is only on your account he assured her  then you need not look serious at all she continued i am not under my uncles jurisdiction in fact i am quite an independent person  i am delighted to hear it he said heartily i should imagine that mr sabin would not be at all a pleasant person to be on bad terms with  she smiled thoughtfully  there are a good many people she said who would agree with you there are a great many people in the world who have cause to regret having offended him let us talk of something else i believe that i can see the sea  they were indeed at cromer he found a carriage for her and collected her belongings he was almost amused at her absolute indolence in the midst of the bustle of arrival she was evidently unused to doing the slightest thing for herself he took the address which she gave to him and repeated it to the driver then he asked the question which had been trembling many times upon his lips  may i come and see you  she had evidently been considering the matter for she answered him at once and deliberately  i should like you to she said but if for any reason it did not suit my uncle to have you come it would not be pleasant for either of us he is going to play golf on the deringham links you will be certain to see him there and you must be guided by his manner towards you  and if he is stillas he was in londonmust this be goodbye then he asked earnestly  she looked at him with a faint colour in her cheeks and a softer light in her proud clear eyes  well she said goodbye would be the last word which could be spoken between us but nimporte we shall see  she flashed a suddenly brilliant smile upon him and leaned back amongst the cushions the carriage drove off and wolfenden humming pleasantly to himself stepped into the dogcart which was waiting for him     chapter xiii  a great work   the countess of deringham might be excused for considering herself the most unfortunate woman in england in a single week she had passed from the position of one of the most brilliant leaders of english society to be the keeper of a recluse whose sanity was at least doubtful her husband admiral the earl of deringham had been a man of iron nerve and constitution with a splendid reputation and undoubtedly a fine seaman the horror of a single day had broken up his life he had been the awestricken witness of a great naval catastrophe in which many of his oldest friends and companions had gone to the bottom of the sea before his eyes together with nearly a thousand british seamen the responsibility for the disaster lay chiefly from those who had perished in it yet some small share of the blame was fastened upon the onlookers and he himself as admiral in command had not altogether escaped from the moment when they had led him down from the bridge of his flagship grey and fainting he had been a changed man he had never recovered from the shock he retired from active service at once under a singular and marvellously persistent delusion briefly he believed or professed to believe that half the british fleet had perished and that the country was at the mercy of the first great power who cared to send her warships up the thames it was a question whether he was really insane on any ordinary topic his views were the views of a rational man but the task which he proceeded to set himself was so absorbing that any other subject seemed scarcely to come within the horizon of his comprehension he imagined himself selected by no less a person than the secretary for war to devote the rest of his life to the accomplishment of a certain undertaking practically his mission was to prove by figures plans and naval details unknown to the general public the complete helplessness of the empire he bought a yacht and commenced a series of short cruises lasting over two years during the whole of which time his wife was his faithful and constant companion they visited in turn each one of the fortified ports of the country winding up with a general inspection of every battleship and cruiser within british waters then with huge piles of amassed information before him he settled down in norfolk to the framing of his report still under the impression that the whole country was anxiously awaiting it his wife remained with him then listening daily to the news of his progress and careful never to utter a single word of discouragement or disbelief in the startling facts which he sometimes put before her the best room in the house the great library was stripped perfectly bare and fitted up for his study and a typist was engaged to copy out the result of his labours in fair form lately the fatal results to england which would follow the public disclosure of her awful helplessness had weighed heavily upon him and he was beginning to live in the fear of betrayal the room in which he worked was fitted with iron shutters and was guarded night and day he saw no visitors and was annoyed if any were permitted to enter the house he met his wife only at dinner time for which meal he dressed in great state and at which no one else was ever allowed to be present he suffered when they were alone no word to pass his lips save with reference to the subject of his labours it is certain he looked upon himself as the discoverer of terrible secrets any remark addressed to him upon other matters utterly failed to make any impression if he heard it he did not reply he would simply look puzzled and as speedily as possible withdraw he was sixty years of age of dignified and kindly appearance a handsome man still save that the fire of his blue eyes was quenched and the firm lines of his commanding mouth had become tremulous wolfenden on his arrival was met in the hall by his mother who carried him off at once to have tea in her own room as he took a low chair opposite to her he was conscious at once of a distinct sense of selfreproach although still a handsome woman the countess of deringham was only the wreck of her former brilliant self wolfenden knowing what her life must be under its altered circumstances could scarcely wonder at it the black hair was still only faintly streaked with grey and her figure was as slim and upright as ever but there were lines on her forehead and about her eyes her cheeks were thinner and even her hands were wasted he looked at her in silent pity and although a man of singularly undemonstrative habits he took her hand in his and pressed it gently then he set himself to talk as cheerfully as possible  there is nothing much wrong physically with the admiral i hope he said calling him by the name they still always gave him i saw him at the window as i came round by the bye what is that extraordinary looking affair like a sentrybox doing there  the countess sighed  that is part of what i have to tell you she said a sentrybox is exactly what it is and if you had looked inside you would have seen dunn or heggs there keeping guard in health your father seems as well as ever mentally i am afraid that he is worse i fear that he is getting very bad indeed that is why i have sent for you wolf  wolfenden was seriously and genuinely concerned surely his mother had had enough to bear  i am very sorry he said your letter prepared me a little for this you must tell me all about it  he has suddenly become the victim the countess said of a new and most extraordinary delusion how it came to pass i cannot exactly tell but this is what happened he has a bed you know made up in an anteroom leading from the library and he sleeps there generally early this morning the whole house was awakened by the sound of two revolver shots i hurried down in my dressinggown and found some of the servants already outside the library door which was locked and barred on the inside when he heard my voice he let me in the room was in partial darkness and some disorder he had a smoking revolver in his hand and he was muttering to himself so fast that i could not understand a word he said the chest which holds all his maps and papers had been dragged into the middle of the room and the iron staple had been twisted as though with a heavy blow i saw that the lamp was flickering and a current of air was in the room and when i looked towards the window i found that the shutters were open and one of the sashes had been lifted all at once he became coherent  send for morton and philip dunn he cried let the shrubbery and all the home park be searched let no one pass out of either of the gates there have been thieves here  i gave his orders to morton where is richardson i asked richardson was supposed to have been watching outside before he could answer richardson came in through the window his forehead was bleeding as though from a blow  what has happened richardson i asked the man hesitated and looked at your father your father answered instead  i woke up five minutes ago he cried and found two men here how they got past richardson i dont know but they were in the room and they had dragged my chest out there and had forced a crowbar through the lock i was just in time i hit one man in the arm and he fired back then they bolted right past richardson they must have nearly knocked you down you must have been asleep you idiot he cried or you could have stopped them  i turned to richardson he did not say a word but he looked at me meaningly the admiral was examining his chest so i drew richardson on one side  is this true richardson i asked the man shook his head  no your ladyship he said bluntly it aint theres no two men been here at all the master dragged the chest out himself i heard him doing it and i saw the light so i left my box and stepped into the room to see what was wrong directly he saw me he yelled out and let fly at me with his revolver its a wonder im alive for one of the bullets grazed my temple  then he went on to say that he would like to leave that no wages were good enough to be shot at and plainly hinted that he thought your father ought to be locked up i talked him over and then got the admiral to go back to bed we had the place searched as a matter of form but of course there was no sign of anybody he had imagined the whole thing it is a mercy that he did not kill richardson  this is very serious wolfenden said gravely what about his revolver  i managed to secure that the countess said it is locked up in my drawer but i am afraid that he may ask for it at any moment  we can make that all right wolfenden said i know where there are some blank cartridges in the gunroom and i will reload the revolver with them by the bye what does blatherwick say about all this  he is almost as worried as i am poor little man lady deringham said i am afraid every day that he will give it up and leave we are paying him five hundred a year but it must be miserable work for him it is really almost amusing though to see how terrified he is at your father he positively shakes when he speaks to him  what does he have to do wolfenden asked  oh draw maps and make calculations and copy all sorts of things you see it is wasted and purposeless work that is what makes it so hard for the poor man  you are quite sure i suppose wolfenden asked after a moments hesitation that it is all wasted work  absolutely the countess declared mr blatherwick brings me sometimes in despair sheets upon which he has been engaged for days they are all just a hopeless tangle of figures and wild calculations nobody could possibly make anything coherent out of them  i wonder wolfenden suggested thoughtfully whether it would be a good idea to get denvers the secretary to write and ask him not to go on with the work for the present he could easily make some excusesay that it was attracting attention which they desired to avoid or something of that sort denvers is a good fellow and he and the admiral were great friends once werent they  the countess shook her head  i am afraid that would not do at all she said besides out of pure good nature of course denvers has already encouraged him only last week he wrote him a friendly letter hoping that he was getting on and telling him how interested every one in the war office was to hear about his work he has known about it all the time you see then too if the occupation were taken from your father i am afraid he would break down altogether  of course there is that to be feared wolfenden admitted i wonder what put this new delusion into his head does he suspect any one in particular  the countess shook her head  i do not think so of course it was miss merton who started it he quite believes that she took copies of all the work she did here but he was so pleased with himself at the idea of having found her out that he has troubled very little about it he seems to think that she had not reached the most important part of his work and he is copying that himself now by hand  but outside the house has he no suspicions at all  not that i know of not any definite suspicion he was talking last night of duchesne the great spy and adventurer in a rambling sort of way duchesne would be the man to get hold of my work if he knew of it he kept on saying but none must know of it the newspapers must be quiet it is a terrible danger he talked like that for some time no i do not think that he suspects anybody it is more a general uneasiness  poor old chap wolfenden said softly what does dr whitlett think of him has he seen him lately i wonder if there is any chance of his getting over it  none at all she answered dr whitlett is quite frank he will never recover what he has losthe will probably lose more but come there is the dressing bell you will see him for yourself at dinner whatever you do dont be latehe hates any one to be a minute behind time     chapter xiv  the tempting of mr blatherwick   wolfenden was careful to reach the hall before the dinner gong had sounded his father greeted him warmly and wolfenden was surprised to see so little outward change in him he was carefully dressed well groomed in every respect and he wore a delicate orchid in his buttonhole  during dinner he discussed the little round of london life and its various social events with perfect sanity and permitted himself his usual goodnatured grumble at wolfenden for his dilatoriness in the choice of a profession  he did not once refer to the subject of his own weakness until dessert had been served when he passed the claret to wolfenden without filling his own glass  you will excuse my not joining you he said to his son but i have still three or four hours writing to do and such work as mine requires a very clear headyou can understand that i daresay  wolfenden assented in silence for the first time perhaps he fully realised the ethical pity of seeing a man so distinguished the victim of a hopeless and incurable mania he watched him sitting at the head of his table courteous gentle dignified noted too the air of intellectual abstraction which followed upon his last speech and in which he seemed to dwell for the rest of the time during which they sat together instinctively he knew what disillusionment must mean for him sooner anything than that it must never be never he repeated firmly to himself as he smoked a solitary cigar later on in the empty smokingroom whatever happens he must be saved from that there was a knock at the door and in response to his invitation to enter mr blatherwick came in wolfenden who was in the humour to prefer any ones society to his own greeted him pleasantly and wheeled up an easy chair opposite to his own  come to have a smoke blatherwick he said thats right try one of these cigars the governors are all right but they are in such shocking condition  mr blatherwick accepted one with some hesitation and puffed slowly at it with an air of great deliberation he was a young man of mild demeanour and deportment and clerical aspirations he wore thick spectacles and suffered from chronic biliousness  i am much obliged to you lord wolfenden he said i seldom smoke cigarsit is not good for my sight an occasional cigarette is all i permit myself  wolfenden groaned inwardly for his regalias were priceless and not to be replaced but he said nothing  i have taken the liberty lord wolfenden mr blatherwick continued of bringing for your inspection a letter i received this morning it is i presume intended for a practical joke and i need not say that i intend to treat it as such at the same time as you were in the house i imagined that noerharm would ensue if i ventured to ask for your opinion  he handed an open letter to wolfenden who took it and read it through it was dated  london and bore the postmark of the previous day       mr arnold blatherwick       dear sirthe writer of this letter is prepared to offer you one      thousand pounds in return for a certain service which you are in a      position to perform the details of that service can only be      explained to you in a personal interview but broadly speaking it      is as follows       you are engaged as private secretary to the earl of deringham      lately an admiral in the british navy your duties it is presumed      are to copy and revise papers and calculations having reference to      the coast defences and navy of great britain the writer is himself      engaged upon a somewhat similar task but not having had the      facilities accorded to lord deringham is without one or two      important particulars the service required of you is the supplying      of these and for this you are offered one thousand pounds       as a man of honour you may possibly hesitate to at once embrace      this offer you need not lord deringhams work is practically      useless for it is the work of a lunatic you yourself from your      intimate association with him must know that this statement is      true he will never be able to give coherent form to the mass of      statistics and information which he has collected therefore you do      him no harm in supplying these few particulars to one who will be      able to make use of them the sum you are offered is out of all      proportion to their valuea few months delay and they could      easily be acquired by the writer without the expenditure of a      single halfpenny that however is not the point       i am rich and i have no time to spare hence this offer i take it      that you are a man of common sense and i take it for granted      therefore that you will not hesitate to accept this offer your      acquiescence will be assumed if you lunch at the grand hotel      cromer between one and two on thursday following the receipt of      this letter you will then be put in full possession of all the      information necessary to the carrying out of the proposals made to      you you are well known to the writer who will take the liberty      of joining you at your table  the letter ended thus somewhat abruptly wolfenden who had only glanced it through at first now reread it carefully then he handed it back to blatherwick  it is a very curious communication he said thoughtfully a very curious communication indeed i do not know what to think of it  mr blatherwick laid down his cigar with an air of great relief he would have liked to have thrown it away but dared not  it must surely be intended for a practical joke lord wolfenden he said either that or my correspondent has been ludicrously misinformed  you do not consider then that my fathers work is of any value at all wolfenden asked  mr blatherwick coughed apologetically and watched the extinction of the cigar by his side with obvious satisfaction  you would i am sure prefer he said that i gave you a perfectly straightforward answer to that question iercannot conceive that the work upon which his lordship and i are engaged can be of the slightest interest or use to anybody i can assure you lord wolfenden that my brain at times reelspositively reelsfrom the extraordinary nature of the manuscripts which your father has passed on to me to copy it is not that they are merely technical they are absolutely and entirely meaningless you ask me for my opinion lord wolfenden and i conceive it to be my duty to answer you honestly i am quite sure that his lordship is not in a fit state of mind to undertake any serious work  the person who wrote that letter wolfenden remarked thought otherwise  the person who wrote that letter mr blatherwick retorted quickly if indeed it was written in good faith is scarcely likely to know so much about his lordships condition of mind as i who have spent the greater portion of every day for three months with him  do you consider that my father is getting worse mr blatherwick wolfenden asked  a week ago mr blatherwick said i should have replied that his lordships state of mind was exactly the same as when i first came here but there has been a change for the worse during the last week it commenced with his sudden and i am bound to say unfounded suspicions of miss merton whom i believe to be a most estimable and worthy young lady  mr blatherwick paused and appeared to be troubled with a slight cough the smile which wolfenden was not altogether able to conceal seemed somewhat to increase his embarrassment  the extraordinary occurrence of last night which her ladyship has probably detailed to you mr blatherwick continued was the next development of what i fear we can only regard as downright insanity i regret having to speak so plainly but i am afraid that any milder phrase would be inapplicable  i am very sorry to hear this wolfenden remarked gravely  under the circumstances mr blatherwick said picking up his cigar which was now extinct and immediately laying it down again i trust that you and lady deringham will excuse my not giving the customary notice of my desire to leave it is of course impossible for me to continue to draw aera stipend such as i am in receipt of for services so ludicrously inadequate  lady deringham will be sorry to have you go wolfenden said couldnt you put up with it a little longer  i would much prefer to leave mr blatherwick said decidedly i am not physically strong and i must confess that his lordships attitude at times positively alarms me i fear that there is no doubt that he committed an unprovoked assault last night upon that unfortunate keeper there iserno telling whom he might select for his next victim if quite convenient lord wolfenden i should like to leave tomorrow by an early train  oh you cant go so soon as that wolfenden said how about this letter  you can take any steps you think proper with regard to it mr blatherwick answered nervously personally i have nothing to do with it i thought of going to spend a week with an aunt of mine in cornwall and i should like to leave by the early train tomorrow  wolfenden could scarcely keep from laughing although he was a little annoyed  look here blatherwick he said you must help me a little before you go theres a good fellow i dont doubt for a moment what you say about the poor old governors condition of mind but at the same time its rather an odd thing isnt it that his own sudden fear of having his work stolen is followed up by the receipt of this letter to you there is some one at any rate who places a very high value upon his manuscripts i must say that i should like to know whom that letter came from  i can assure you mr blatherwick said that i have not the faintest idea  of course you havent wolfenden assented a little impatiently but dont you see how easy it will be for us to find out you must go to the grand hotel on thursday for lunch and meet this mysterious person  i would very much rather not mr blatherwick declared promptly i should feel exceedingly uncomfortable i should not like it at all  look here wolfenden said persuasively i must find out who wrote that letter and can only do so with your help you need only be there i will come up directly i have marked the man who comes to your table your presence is all that is required and i shall take it as a favour if you will allow me to make you a present of a fiftypound note  mr blatherwick flushed a little and hesitated he had brothers and sisters whose bringing up was a terrible strain upon the slim purse of his father a country clergyman and a great deal could be done with fifty pounds it was against his conscience as well as his inclinations to remain in a post where his duties were a farce but this was different  he sighed  you are very generous lord wolfenden he said i will stay until after thursday  theres a good fellow wolfenden said much relieved have another cigar  mr blatherwick rose hastily and shook his head you must excuse me if you please he said i will not smoke any more i think if you will not mind  wolfenden turned to the window and held up his hand  listen he said is that a carriage at this time of night  a carriage it certainly was passing by the window in a moment they heard it draw up at the front door and some one alighted  odd time for callers wolfenden remarked  mr blatherwick did not reply he too was listening in a moment they heard the rustling of a womans skirts outside and the smokingroom door opened     chapter xv  the coming and going of mr franklin wilmot   both men looked up as lady deringham entered the room carefully closing the door behind her she had a card in her hand and an open letter  wolfenden she said i am so glad that you are here it is most fortunate something very singular has happened you will be able to tell me what to do  mr blatherwick rose quietly and left the room  wolfenden was all attention  some one has just arrived he remarked  a gentleman a complete stranger she assented this is his card he seemed surprised that his name was not familiar to me he was quite sure that you would know it  wolfenden took the card between his fingers and read it out  mr franklin wilmot  he was thoughtful for a moment the name was familiar enough but he could not immediately remember in what connection suddenly it flashed into his mind  of course he exclaimed he is a famous physiciana very great swell goes to court and all that  lady deringham nodded  he has introduced himself as a physician he has brought this letter from dr whitlett  wolfenden took the note from her hand it was written on half a sheet of paper and apparently in great haste       dear lady deringhammy old friend franklin wilmot who has been      staying at cromer has just called upon me we have been having a      chat and he is extremely interested in lord deringhams case so      much so that i had arranged to come over with him this evening to      see if you would care to have his opinion unfortunately however      i have been summoned to attend a patient nearly ten miles awaya      bad accident i fearand wilmot is leaving for town tomorrow      morning i suggested however that he might call on his way back      to cromer and if you would kindly let him see lord deringham i      should be glad as his opinion would be of material assistance to      me wilmots reputation as the greatest living authority on cases      of partial mania is doubtless known to you and as he never under      any circumstances visits patients outside london it would be a      great pity to lose this opportunity       in great haste and begging you to excuse this scrawl                 i am dear lady deringham                     yours sincerely                          john whitlett       psyou will please not offer him any fee  wolfenden folded up the letter and returned it  well i suppose its all right he said its an odd time though to call on an errand of this sort  so i thought lady deringham agreed but dr whitletts explanation seems perfectly feasible does it not i said that i would consult you you will come in and see him  wolfenden followed his mother into the drawingroom a tall dark man was sitting in a corner under a palm tree in one hand he held a magazine the pictures of which he seemed to be studying with the aid of an eyeglass the other was raised to his mouth he was in the act of indulging in a yawn when wolfenden and his mother entered the room  this is my son lord wolfenden she said dr franklin wilmot  the two men bowed  lady deringham has explained to you the reason of my untimely visit i presume the latter remarked at once  wolfenden assented  yes i am afraid that it will be a little difficult to get my father to see you on such short notice  i was about to explain to lady deringham before i understood that you were in the house dr wilmot said that although that would be an advantage it is not absolutely necessary at present i should of course have to examine your father before giving a definite opinion as to his case but i can give you a very fair idea as to his condition without seeing him at all  wolfenden and his mother exchanged glances  you must forgive us wolfenden commenced hesitatingly but really i can scarcely understand  of course not their visitor interrupted brusquely my method is one which is doubtless altogether strange to you but if you read the lancet or the medical journal you would have heard a good deal about it lately i form my conclusions as to the mental condition of a patient almost altogether from a close inspection of their letters or any work upon which they are or have been recently engaged i do not say that it is possible to do this from a single letter but when a man has a hobby such as i understand lord deringham indulges in and has devoted a great deal of time to real or imaginary work in connection with it i am generally able from a study of that work to tell how far the brain is weakened if at all and in what manner it can be strengthened this is only the crudest outline of my theory but to be brief i can give you my opinion as to lord deringhams mental condition and my advice as to its maintenance if you will place before me the latest work upon which he has been engaged i hope i have made myself clear  perfectly wolfenden answered it sounds very reasonable and very interesting but i am afraid that there are a few practical difficulties in the way in the first place my father does not show his work or any portion of it to any one on the other hand he takes the most extraordinary precautions to maintain absolute secrecy with regard to it  that dr wilmot remarked is rather a bad feature of the case it is a difficulty which i should imagine you could get over though you could easily frame some excuse to get him away from his study for a short time and leave me there of course the affair is in your hands altogether and i am presuming that you are anxious to have an opinion as to your fathers state of health i am not in the habit of seeking patients he added a little stiffly i was interested in my friend whitletts description of the case and anxious to apply my theories to it as it happens to differ in some respects from anything i have met with lately further i may add he continued glancing at the clock if anything is to be done it must be done quickly i have no time to spare  you had better wolfenden suggested stay here for the night in any case we will send you to the station or into cromer as early as you like in the morning  absolutely impossible dr wilmot replied briefly i am staying with friends in cromer and i have a consultation in town early tomorrow morning you must really make up your minds at once whether you wish for my opinion or not  i do not think lady deringham said that we need hesitate for a moment about that  wolfenden looked at him doubtfully there seemed to be no possibility of anything but advantage in accepting this offer and yet in a sense he was sorry that it had been made  in case you should attach any special importance to your fathers manuscripts dr wilmot remarked with a note of sarcasm in his tone i might add that it is not at all necessary for me to be alone in the study  wolfenden felt a little uncomfortable under the older mans keen gaze neither did he altogether like having his thoughts read so accurately  i suppose he said turning to his mother you could manage to get him away from the library for a short time  i could at least try she answered shall i  i think he said that as dr wilmot has been good enough to go out of his way to call here we must make an effort  lady deringham left the room  dr wilmot whose expression of absolute impassiveness had not altered in the least during their discussion turned towards wolfenden  have you yourself he said never seen any of your fathers manuscripts has he never explained the scheme of his work to you  wolfenden shook his head  i know the central idea he answeredthe weakness of our navy and coast defences and that is about all i know my father even when he was an admiral on active service took an absolutely pessimistic view of both you may perhaps remember this the lords of the admiralty used to consider him i believe the one great thorn in their sides  dr wilmot shook his head  i have never taken any interest in such matters he said my profession has been completely absorbing during the last ten years  wolfenden nodded  i know he remarked that i used to read the newspapers and wonder why on earth my father took such pains to try and frighten everybody but he is altogether changed now he even avoids the subject although i am quite sure that it is his one engrossing thought it is certain that no one has ever given such time and concentrated energy to it before if only his work was the work of a sane man i could understand it being very valuable  not the least doubt about it i should say dr wilmot replied carelessly  the door opened and lady deringham reappeared  i have succeeded she said he is upstairs now i will try and keep him there for half an hour wolfenden will you take dr wilmot into the study  dr wilmot rose with quiet alacrity wolfenden led the way down the long passage which led to the study he himself was scarcely prepared for such signs of unusual labours as confronted them both when they opened the door the round table in the centre of the room was piled with books and a loose heap of papers a special rack was hung with a collection of maps and charts there were nautical instruments upon the table and compasses as well as writing materials and a number of small models of menofwar mr blatherwick who was sitting at the other side of the room busy with some copying looked up in amazement at the entrance of wolfenden and a stranger upon what was always considered forbidden ground  wolfenden stepped forward at once to the table a sheet of paper lay there on which the ink was scarcely yet dry many others were scattered about almost undecipherable with marginal notes and corrections in his fathers handwriting he pushed some of them towards his companion  you can help yourself he said this seems to be his most recent work  dr wilmot seemed scarcely to hear him he had turned the lamp up with quick fingers and was leaning over those freshly written pages decidedly he was interested in the case he stood quite still reading with breathless hastethe papers seemed almost to fly through his fingers wolfenden was a little puzzled mr blatherwick who had been watching the proceedings with blank amazement rose and came over towards them  you will excuse me lord wolfenden he said but if the admiral should come back and find a stranger with you looking over his work he will  its all right blatherwick wolfenden interrupted the more impatiently since he was far from comfortable himself this gentleman is a physician  the secretary resumed his seat dr wilmot was reading with lightninglike speed sheet after sheet making frequent notes in a pocketbook which he had laid on the table before him he was so absorbed that he did not seem to hear the sound of wheels coming up the avenue  wolfenden walked to the window and raising the curtain looked out he gave vent to a little exclamation of relief as he saw a familiar dogcart draw up at the hall door and dr whitletts famous mare pulled steaming on to her haunches  it is dr whitlett he exclaimed he has followed you up pretty soon  the sheet which the physician was reading fluttered through his fingers there was a very curious look in his face he walked up to the window and looked out  so it is he remarked i should like to see him at once for half a minutethen i shall have finished i wonder whether you would mind going yourself and asking him to step this way  wolfenden turned immediately to leave the room at the door he turned sharply round attracted by a sudden noise and an exclamation from blatherwick dr wilmot had disappeared mr blatherwick was gazing at the window in amazement  hes gone sir clean out of the windowjumped it like a cat  wolfenden sprang to the curtains the night wind was blowing into the room through the open casement fainter and fainter down the long avenue came the sound of galloping horses dr franklin wilmot had certainly gone  wolfenden turned from the window to find himself face to face with dr whitlett  what on earth is the matter with your friend wilmot he exclaimed he has just gone off through the window like a madman  wilmot the doctor exclaimed i never knew any one of that name in my life the fellows a rank impostor     chapter xvi  genius or madness   for a moment wolfenden was speechless then with a presence of mind which afterwards he marvelled at he asked no more questions but stepped up to the writingtable  blatherwick he said hurriedly we seem to have made a bad mistake will you try and rearrange these papers exactly as the admiral left them and do not let him know that any one has entered the room or seen them  mr blatherwick commenced his task with trembling fingers  i will do my best he said nervously but i am not supposed to touch anything upon this table at all if the admiral finds me here he will be very angry  i will take the blame wolfenden said do your best  he took the country doctor by the arm and hurried him into the smokingroom  this is a most extraordinary affair dr whitlett he said gravely i presume that this letter then is a forgery  the doctor took the note of introduction which wilmot had brought and adjusting his pincenez read it hastily through  a forgery from the beginning to end he declared turning it over and looking at it helplessly i have never known any one of the name in my life  it is written on notepaper stamped with your address wolfenden remarked it is also i suppose a fair imitation of your handwriting for lady deringham accepted it as such  the doctor nodded  i will tell you he said all that i know of the affair i started out to pay some calls this evening about six oclock as i turned into the main road i met a strange brougham and pair of horses being driven very slowly there was a man who looked like a gentlemans servant sitting by the side of the coachman and as i passed them the latter asked a question and i am almost certain that i heard my name mentioned i was naturally a little curious and i kept looking back all along the road to see which way they turned after passing my house as a matter of fact although i pulled up and waited in the middle of the road i saw no more of the carriage when at last i drove on i knew that one of two things must have happened either the carriage must have come to a standstill and remained stationary in the road or it must have turned in at my gate the hedge was down a little higher up the road and i could see distinctly that they had not commenced to climb the hill it seemed very odd to me but i had an important call to make so i drove on and got through as quickly as i could on my way home i passed your north entrance and looking up the avenue i saw the same brougham on its way up to the house i had half a mind to run in theni wish now that i hadbut instead of doing so i drove quickly home there i found that a gentleman had called a few minutes after i had left home and finding me out had asked permission to leave a note the girl had shown him into the study and he had remained there about ten minutes afterwards he had let himself out and driven away when i looked for the note for me there was none but the writing materials had been used and a sheet of notepaper was gone i happened to remember that there was only one out the whole thing seemed to me so singular that i ordered the dogcart out again and drove straight over here  for which wolfenden remarked we ought to feel remarkably grateful so far the thing is plain enough but what on earth did that man whoever he was expect to find in my fathers study that he should make an elaborate attempt like this to enter it he was no common thief  dr whitlett shook his head he had no elucidation to offer the thing was absolutely mysterious  your father himself he said slowly sets a very high value upon the result of his researches  and on the other hand wolfenden retorted promptly you and my mother mr blatherwick and even the girl who has been copying for him have each assured me that his work is rubbish you four comprise all who have seen any part of it and i understand that you have come to the conclusion that if not insane he is at least suffering from some sort of mania now how are we to reconcile this with the fact of an attempted robbery this evening and the further fact that a heavy bribe has been secretly offered to blatherwick to copy only a few pages of his later manuscripts  dr whitlett started  indeed he exclaimed when did you hear of this  only this afternoon wolfenden answered blatherwick brought me the letter himself what i cannot understand is how these documents could ever become a marketable commodity yet we may look upon it now as an absolute fact that there are personsand no ordinary thieves eitherconspiring to obtain possession of them  wolfenden  the two men started round the countess was standing in the doorway she was pale as death and her eyes were full of fear  who was that man she cried what has happened  he was an impostor i am afraid wolfenden answered the letter from dr whitlett was forged he has bolted  she looked towards the doctor  thank god that you are here she cried i am frightened there are some papers and models missing and the admiral has found it out i am afraid he is going to have a fit please come into the library he must not be left alone  they both followed her down the passage and through the halfopened door in the centre of the room lord deringham was standing his pale cheeks scarlet with passion his fists convulsively clenched he turned sharply round to face them and his eyes flashed with anger  nothing shall make me believe that this room has not been entered and my papers tampered with he stormed out where is that reptile blatherwick i left my mornings work and two models on the desk there less than half an hour ago both the models are gone and one of the sheets either blatherwick has stolen them or the room has been entered during my absence where is that hound  he is in his room lady deringham answered he ran past me on the stairs trembling all over and he has locked himself in and piled up the furniture against the door you have frightened him to death  it is scarcely possible dr whitlett began  dont lie sir the admiral thundered out you are a pack of fools and old women you are as ignorant as rabbits you know no more than the kitchenmaids what has been growing and growing within these walls i tell you that my work of the last few years placed in certain hands would alter the whole face of europeaye of christendom there are men in this country today whose object is to rob me and you my own household seem to be crying them welcome bidding them come and help themselves as though the labour of my life was worth no more than so many sheets of waste paper you have let a stranger into this room today and if he had not been disturbed god knows what he might not have carried away with him  we have been very foolish lady deringham said pleadingly we will set a watch now day and night we will run no more risks i swear it you can believe me horace  aye but tell me the truth now he cried some one has been in this room and escaped through the window i learnt as much as that from that blithering idiot blatherwick i want to know who he was  she glanced towards the doctor he nodded his head slightly then she went up to her husband and laid her hand upon his shoulders  horace you are right she said it is no use trying to keep it from you a man did impose upon us with a forged letter he could not have been here more than five minutes though we found him out almost at once it shall never happen again  the wisdom of telling him was at once apparent his face positively shone with triumph he became quite calm and the fierce glare which had alarmed them all so much died out of his eyes the confession was a triumph for him he was gratified  i knew it he declared with positive good humour i have warned you of this all the time now perhaps you will believe me thank god that it was not duchesne himself i should not be surprised though if it were not one of his emissaries if duchesne comes he muttered to himself his face growing a shade paler god help us  we will be more careful now lady deringham said no one shall ever take us by surprise again we will have special watchmen and bars on all the windows  from this moment the admiral said slowly i shall never leave this room until my work is ended and handed over to lord ss care if i am robbed england is in danger there must be no risks i will have a sofabedstead down and please understand that all my meals must be served here heggs and morton must take it in turns to sleep in the room and there must be a watchman outside now will you please all go away he added with a little wave of his hand i have to reconstruct what has been stolen from me through your indiscretion send me in some coffee at eleven oclock and a box of cartridges you will find in my dressingroom  they went away together wolfenden was grave and mystified nothing about his fathers demeanour or language had suggested insanity what if they were all wrongif the work to which the best years of his life had gone was really of the immense importance he claimed for it other people thought so the slight childishness which was obvious in a great many of his actions was a very different thing from insanity blatherwick might be deceivedblanche was just as likely to have looked upon any technical work as rubbish whitlett was only a country practitionereven his mother might have exaggerated his undoubted eccentricities at any rate one thing was certain there were people outside who made a bold enough bid to secure the fruit of his fathers labours it was his duty to see that the attempt if repeated was still unsuccessful     chapter xvii  the scheming of giants   at very nearly the same moment as the man who had called himself dr wilmot had leaped from the library window of deringham hall mr sabin sat alone in his sanctum waiting for a visitor the room was quite a small one on the ground floor of the house but was furnished with taste and evident originality in the moorish fashion mr sabin himself was ensconced in an easy chair drawn close up to the fire and a thin cloud of blue smoke was stealing up from a thick egyptian cigarette which was burning away between his fingers his head was resting upon the delicate fingers of his left hand his dark eyes were fixed upon the flaming coals he was deep in thought  a single mistake now he murmured softly and farewell to the labour of years a single false step and goodbye to all our dreams tonight will decide it in a few minutes i must say yes or no to knigenstein i thinki am almost sure i shall say yes bah  the frown on his forehead grew more marked the cigarette burned on between his fingers and a long grey ash fell to the floor he was permitting himself the luxury of deep thought all his life he had been a schemer a builder of mighty plans a great power in the destinies of great people tonight he knew that he had reached the crisis of a career in many respects marvellous tonight he would take the first of those few final steps on to the desire of his life it only rested with him to cast the die he must make the decision and abide by it his own lifes ambition and the destinies of a mighty nation hung in the balance had he made up his mind which way to turn the scale scarcely even yet there were so many things  he sat up with a start there was a knock at the door he caught up the evening paper and the cigarette smoke circled about his head he stirred a cup of coffee by his side the hard lines in his face had all relaxed there was no longer any anxiety he looked up and greeted pleasantlywith a certain deference toothe visitor who was being ushered in he had no appearance of having been engaged in anything more than a casual study of the st jamess gazette  a gentleman sir the stolidlooking servant had announced briefly no name had been mentioned mr sabin when he rose and held out his hand did not address his visitor directly he was a tall stout man with an irongrey moustache and the remains of a military bearing when the servant had withdrawn and the two men were alone he unbuttoned his overcoat underneath he wore a foreign uniform ablaze with orders mr sabin glanced at them and smiled  you are going to arlington street he remarked  the other man nodded  when i leave here he said  then there was a short silence each man seemed to be waiting for the other to open the negotiations eventually it was mr sabin who did so  i have been carefully through the file of papers you sent me he remarked  yes  there is no doubt but that to a certain extent the antienglish feeling of which you spoke exists i have made other inquiries and so far i am convinced  so the seed is sown it has been sprinkled with a generous hand believe me my friend that for this country there are in store very great surprises i speak as one who knows i do know so  mr sabin was thoughtful he looked into the fire and spoke musingly  yet the ties of kindred and common origin are strong he said it is hard to imagine an open rupture between the two great saxon nations of the world  the ties of kindred said mr sabins visitor are not worth the snap of a finger so  he snapped his fingers with a report as sharp as a pistolshot mr sabin started in his chair  it is the ties of kindred he continued which breed irritability not kindliness i tell you my friend that there is a great storm gathering it is not for nothing that the great hosts of my country are ruled by a war lord i tell you that we are arming to the teeth silently swiftly and with a purpose it may seem to you a small thing but let me tell you thiswe are a jealous nation and we have cause for jealousy in whatever part of the world we put down our foot it is trodden on by our ubiquitous cousins wherever we turn to colonise we are too late england has already secured the finest territory the most fruitful of the land we must either take her leavings or go abegging wherever we would develope we are held back by the commercial and colonising geniusit amounts to thatof this wonderful nation the world of today is getting cramped there is no room for a growing england and a growing germany so one must give way and germany is beginning to mutter that it shall not always be her sons who go to the wall you say that france is our natural enemy i deny it france is our historical enemynothing else in military circles today a war with england would be wildly hysterically popular and sooner or later a war with england is as certain to come as the rising of the sun and the waning of the moon i can tell you even now where the first blow will be struck it is fixed it is to come so  not in europe mr sabin said  not in europe or in asia the wartorch will be kindled in africa  the transvaal  mr sabins visitor smiled  it is in africa he said that english monopoly has been most galling to my nation we too feel the burden of overpopulation we too have our young blood making itself felt throughout the land eager impetuous thirsting for adventure and freedom we need new countries where these may develop and at once ease and strengthen our fatherland i have seen it written in one of the great english reviews that my country has not the instinct for colonisation it is false we have the instinct and the desire but not the opportunity england is like a great octopus she is ever on the alert thrusting out her suckers and drawing in for herself every new land where riches lay no country has ever been so suitable for us as africa and beholdit is as i have said already england has grabbed the finest and most to be desired of the landshe has it now in her mind to take one step further and acquire the whole but my country has no mind to suffer it we have played second fiddle to a weaker power long enough we want africa my friend and to my mind and the mind of my master africa is worth having at all costslisteneven at the cost of war  mr sabin was silent for a moment there was a faint smile upon his lips it was a situation such as he loved he began to feel indeed that he was making history  you have convinced me he said at last you have taught me how to look upon european politics with new eyes but there remains one important question supposing i break off my negotiations in other quarters are you willing to pay my price  the ambassador waved his hand it was a trifle  if what you give fulfils your own statements he said you cannot ask a price which my master would not pay  mr sabin moved a little in his chair his eyes were bright a faint tinge of colour was in his olive cheeks  four years of my life he said have been given to the perfecting of one branch only of my design the other which is barely completed is the work of the only man in england competent to handle such a task the combined result will be infallible when i place in your hands a simple roll of papers and a small parcel the future of this country is absolutely and entirely at your mercy that is beyond question or doubt to whomsoever i give my secret i give over the destinies of england but the price is a mighty one  name it the ambassador said quietly a million two millions rank what is it  for myself mr sabin said nothing  the other man started nothing  absolutely nothing  the ambassador raised his hand to his forehead  you confuse me he said  my conditions mr sabin said are these the conquest of france and the restoration of the monarchy in the persons of prince henri and his cousin princess helène of bourbon  ach  the little interjection shot from the ambassadors lips with sharp staccato emphasis then there was a silencea brief dramatic silence the two men sat motionless the eyes of each fastened upon the other the ambassador was breathing quickly and his eyes sparkled with excitement mr sabin was pale and calm yet there were traces of nervous exhilaration in his quivering lips and bright eyes  yes you were right you were right indeed the ambassador said slowly it is a great price that you ask  mr sabin laughed very softly  think he said weigh the matter well mark first this fact if what i give you has not the power i claim for it our contract is at an end i ask for nothing i accept nothing therefore you may assume that before you pay my price your own triumph is assured think reflect carefully what will you owe to me the humiliation of england the acquisition of her colonies the destruction of her commerce and such a war indemnity as only the richest power on earth could pay these things you gain then you are the one supreme power in europe france is at your mercy i will tell you why the royalist party have been gaining strength year by year month by month minute by minute proclaim your intentions boldly the country will crumble up before you it would be but a halfhearted resistance france has not the temperament of a people who will remain for ever faithful to a democratic form of government at heart she is aristocratic the old nobility have a life in them which you cannot dream of i know for i have tested it it has been weary waiting but the time is ripe france is ready for the cry of vive le roi vive la monarchie i who tell you these things have proved them i have felt the pulse of my country and i love her too well to mistake the symptoms  the ambassador was listening with greedy earshe was breathing hard through his teeth it was easy to see that the glamour of the thing had laid hold of him he foresaw for himself an immortal name for his country a greatness beyond the wildest dreams of her most sanguine ministers bismarck himself had planned nothing like this yet he did not altogether lose his common sense  but russia he objected she would never sanction a german invasion of france  mr sabin smiled scornfully  you are a great politician my dear baron and you say a thing like that you amaze me but of course the whole affair is new to you you have not thought it out as i have done whatever happens in europe russia will maintain the isolation for which geography and temperament have marked her out she would not stir one finger to help france why should she what could france give her in return what would she gain by plunging into an exhausting war to the core of his heart and the tips of his fingernails the muscovite is selfish then again consider this you are not going to ruin france as you did before you are going to establish a new dynasty and not waste the land or exact a mighty tribute granted that sentiments of friendship exist between russia and france do you not think that russia would not sooner see france a monarchy do you think that she would stretch out her little finger to aid a tottering republic and keep back a king from the throne of france mon dieu never  mr sabins face was suddenly illuminated a fire flashed in his dark eyes and a note of fervent passion quivered lifelike in his vibrating voice his manner had all the abandon of one pleading a great cause nursed by a great heart he was a patriot or a poet surely not only a politician or a mere intriguing adventurer for a moment he suffered his enthusiasm to escape him then the mask was as suddenly dropped he was himself again calm convincing impenetrable  as the echoes of his last interjection died away there was a silence between the two men it was the ambassador at last who broke it he was looking curiously at his companion  i must confess he said slowly that you have fascinated me you have done more you have made me see dreams and possibilities which set down upon paper i should have mocked at mr sabin i can no longer think of you as a personyou are a personage we are here alone and i am as secret as the grave be so kind as to lift the veil of your incognito i can no longer think of you as mr sabin who are you  mr sabin smiled a curious smile and lit a cigarette from the open box before him  that he said pushing the box across the table you may know in good time if in commercial parlance we deal until that point is decided i am mr sabin i do not even admit that it is an incognito  and yet the ambassador said with a curious lightening of his face as though recollection had suddenly been vouchsafed to him i fancy that if i were to call you  mr sabins protesting hand was stretched across the table  excuse me he interrupted let it remain between us as it is now my incognito is a necessity for the present let it continue to bemr sabin now answer me all has been said that can be said between us what is your opinion  the ambassador rose from his seat and stood upon the hearthrug with his back to the fire there was a streak of colour upon his sallow cheeks and his eyes shone brightly underneath his heavy brows he had removed his spectacles and was swinging them lightly between his thumb and forefinger  i will be frank with you he said my opinion is a favourable one i shall apply for leave of absence tomorrow in a week all that you have said shall be laid before my master such as my personal influence is it will be exerted on behalf of the acceptance of your scheme the greatest difficulty will be of course in persuading the emperor of its practicabilityin plain words that what you say you have to offer will have the importance which you attribute to it  if you fail in that mr sabin said also rising send for me but bear this in mind if my scheme should after all be ineffective if it should fail in the slightest detail to accomplish all that i claim for it what can you lose the payment is conditional upon its success the bargain is all in your favour i should not offer such terms unless i held certain cards remember if there are difficulties send for me  i will do so the ambassador said as he buttoned his overcoat now give me a limit of time for our decision  fourteen days mr sabin said how i shall temporise with lobenski so long i cannot tell but i will give you fourteen days from today it is ample  the two men exchanged farewells and parted mr sabin with a cigarette between his teeth and humming now and then a few bars from one of verdis operas commenced to carefully select a bagful of golf clubs from a little pile which stood in one corner of the room already they bore signs of considerable use and he handled them with the care of an expert swinging each one gently and hesitating for some time between a wooden or a metal putter and longer still between the rival claims of a bulger and a flatheaded brassey at last the bag was full he resumed his seat and counted them out carefully  ten he said to himself softly too many it looks amateurish  some of the steel heads were a little dull he took a piece of chamois leather from the pocket of the bag and began polishing them as they grew brighter he whistled softly to himself this time the opera tune seemed to have escaped him he was whistling the marseillaise     chapter xviii  he has gone to the emperor   the ambassador when he left mr sabins house stepped into a hired hansom and drove off towards arlington street a young man who had watched him come out from the other side of the way walked swiftly to the corner of the street and stepped into a private brougham which was waiting there  to the embassy he said drive fast  the carriage set him down in a few minutes at the house to which densham and harcutt had followed mr sabin on the night of their first meeting with him he walked swiftly into the hall  is his excellency within he asked a tall servant in plain dress who came forward to meet him  yes monsieur felix the man answered he is dining very late tonightin fact he has not yet risen from the table  who is with him felix asked  it is a very small party madame la princesse has just arrived from paris and his excellency has been waiting for her  he mentioned a few more names there was no one of importance felix walked into the hallporters office and scribbled a few words on half a sheet of paper which he placed in an envelope and carefully sealed  let his excellency have this privately and at once he said to the man i will go into the waiting room  the man withdrew with the note and felix crossed the hall and entered a small room nearly opposite it was luxuriously furnished with easy chairs and divans there were cigars and cigarettes and decanters upon a round table felix took note of none of these things nor did he sit down he stood with his hands behind him looking steadily into the fire his cheeks were almost livid save for a single spot of burning colour high up on his cheekbone his fingers twitched nervously his eyes were dry and restlessly bright he was evidently in a state of great excitement in less than two minutes the door opened and a tall distinguishedlooking man grey headed but with a moustache still almost black came softly into the room his breast glittered with orders and he was in full court dress he nodded kindly to the young man who greeted him with respect  is it anything important felix he asked you are looking tired  yes your excellency it is important felix answered it concerns the man sabin  the ambassador nodded  well he said what of him you have not been seeking to settle accounts with him i trust after our conversation and your promise  felix shook his head  no he said i gave my word and i shall keep it perhaps you may some day regret that you interfered between us  i think not the prince replied your services are valuable to me my dear felix and in this country more than any other deeds of violence are treated with scant ceremony and affairs of honour are not understood no i saved you from yourself for myself it was an excellent thing for both of us  i trust felix repeated that your excellency may always think so but to be brief the report from cartienne is to hand  the ambassador nodded and listened expectantly  he confirms fully felix continued the value of the documents which are in question how he obtained access to them he does not say but his report is absolute he considers that they justify fully the man sabins version of them  the prince smiled  my own judgment is verified he said i believed in the man from the first it is good by the bye have you seen anything of mr sabin today  i have come straight felix said from watching his house  yes  the baron von knigenstein has been there alone incognito for more than an hour i watched him go inand watched him out  the princes genial smile vanished his face grew suddenly as dark as thunder the muscovite crept out unawares there was a fierce light in his eyes and his face was like the face of a wolf yet his voice when he spoke was low  so ho he said softly mr sabin is doing a little flirting is he ah  i believe the young man answered slowly that he has advanced still further than that the baron was there for an hour he came out walking like a young man he was in a state of great excitement  the prince sat down and stroked the side of his face thoughtfully  the great elephant he muttered fancy such a creature calling himself a diplomatist it is well felix he added that i had finished my dinner otherwise you would certainly have spoilt it if they have met like this there is no end to the possibilities of it i must see sabin immediately it ought to be easy to make him understand that i am not to be trifled with find out where he is tonight felix i must follow him  felix took up his hat  i will be back he said in half an hour  the prince returned to his guests and felix drove off when he returned his chief was waiting for him alone  mr sabin felix announced left town half an hour ago  for abroad the prince exclaimed with flashing eyes he has gone to germany  felix shook his head  on the contrary he said he has gone down into norfolk to play golf  into norfolk to play golf the prince repeated in a tone of scornful wonder did you believe a story like that felix rubbish  felix smiled slightly  it is quite true he said labanoff makes no mistakes and he saw him come out of his house take his ticket at kings cross and actually leave the station  are you sure that it is not a blind the prince asked incredulously  felix shook his head  it is quite true your excellency he said if you knew the man as well as i do you would not be surprised he is indeed a very extraordinary personhe does these sort of things besides he wants to keep out of the way  the princes face darkened  he will find my way a little hard to get out of he said fiercely go and get some dinner felix and then try and find out whether knigenstein has any notion of leaving england he will not trust a matter like this to correspondence stayi know how to manage it i will write and ask him to dine here next week you shall take the invitation  he will be at arlington street felix remarked  well you can take it on to him there the prince directed go first to his house and ask for his whereabouts they will tell you arlington street you will not know of course the contents of the letter you carry your instructions were simply to deliver it and get an answer good you will do that  the prince while he talked was writing the note  felix thrust it into his pocket and went out in less than half an hour he was back the baron had returned to the german embassy unexpectedly before going to arlington street and felix had caught him there the prince tore open the answer and read it hastily through                           the german embassy                               wednesday evening       alas my dear prince had i been able nothing could have given me      so much pleasure as to have joined your little party but      unfortunately this wretched climate which we both so justly      loathe has upset my throat again and i have too much regard for      my life to hand myself over to the english doctors accordingly      all being well i go to berlin tomorrow night to consult our own      justlyfamed dr steinlaus       accept my dear prince this expression of my most sincere regret      and believe me yours most sincerely                           karl von knigenstein  the doctor whom he has gone to consult is no man of medicine the prince said thoughtfully he has gone to the emperor     chapter xix  wolfendens lovemaking   lord wolfenden  he laughed at her surprise and took off his cap he was breathless for he had been scrambling up the steep side of the hill on which she was standing looking steadfastly out to sea down in the valley from which he had come a small boy with a bag of golf clubs on his back was standing making imaginary swings at the ball which lay before him  i saw you from below he explained i couldnt help coming up you dont mind  no i am glad to see you she said simply you startled me that is all i did not hear you coming and i had forgotten almost where i was i was thinking  he stood by her side his cap still in his hand facing the strong sea wind again he was conscious of that sense of extreme pleasure which had always marked his chance meetings with her this time he felt perhaps that there was some definite reason for it there was something in her expression when she had turned so swiftly round which seemed to tell him that her first words were not altogether meaningless she was looking a little pale and he fancied also a little sad there was an inexpressible wistfulness about her soft dark eyes the light and charming gaiety of her manner so unenglish and so attractive to him had given place to quite another mood whatever her thoughts might have been when he had first seen her there her tall slim figure outlined so clearly against the abrupt sky line they were at all events scarcely pleasant ones he felt that his sudden appearance had not been unwelcome to her and he was unreasonably pleased  you are still all alone he remarked has mr sabin not arrived  she shook her head  i am all alone and i am fearfully and miserably dull this place does not attract me at all not at this time of the year i have not heard from my uncle he may be here at any moment  there was no time like the present he was suddenly bold it was an opportunity which might never be vouchsafed to him again  may i come with youa little way along the cliffs he asked  she looked at him and hesitated more than ever he was aware of some subtle change in her it was as though her mental attitude towards him had adapted itself in some way to this new seriousness of demeanour it was written in her featureshis eyes read it eagerly a certain aloofness almost hauteur about the lines of her mouth creeping out even in her most careless tones and plainly manifest in the carriage of her head was absent she seemed immeasurably nearer to him she was softer and more womanly even her voice in its new and more delicate notes betrayed the change perhaps it was only a mood yet he would take advantage of it  what about your golf she said motioning down into the valley where his antagonist was waiting  oh i can easily arrange that he declared cheerfully fortunately i was playing the professional and he will not mind leaving off  he waved to his caddie and scribbled a few lines on the back of a card  give that to mcpherson he said you can clean my clubs and put them in my locker i shall not be playing again this morning  the boy disappeared down the hill they stood for a moment side by side  i have spoilt your game she said i am sorry  he laughed  i think you know he said boldly that i would rather spend five minutes with you than a day at golf  she moved on with a smile at the corners of her lips  what a downright person you are she said but honestly today i am not in the mood to be alone i am possessed with an uneasy spirit of sadness i am afraid of my thoughts  i am only sorry he said that you should have any that are not happy ones dont you think perhaps that you are a little lonely you seem to have so few friends  it is not that she answered i have many and very dear friends and it is only for a little time that i am separated from them it is simply that i am not used to solitude and i am becoming a creature of moods and presentiments it is very foolish that i give way to them but today i am miserable you must stretch out that strong hand of yours my friend and pull me up  i will do my best he said i am afraid i cannot claim that there is anything in the shape of affinity between us for today i am particularly happy  she met his eyes briefly and looked away seawards with the ghost of a sorrowful smile upon her lips her words sounded like a warning  do not be sure she said it may not last  it will last he said so long as you choose for today you are the mistress of my moods  then i am very sorry for you she said earnestly  he laughed it off but her words brought a certain depression with them he went on to speak of something else  i have been thinking about you this morning he said if your uncle is going to play golf here it will be very dull for you would you care for my mother to come and see you she would be delighted i am sure for it is dull for her too and she is fond of young people if you  he stopped short she was shaking her head slowly the old despondency was back in her face her eyes were full of trouble she laid her delicately gloved fingers upon his arm  my friend she said it is very kind of you to think of itbut it is impossible i cannot tell you why as i would wish but at present i do not desire any acquaintances i must not in fact think of it it would give me great pleasure to know your mother only i must not believe me that it is impossible  wolfenden was a little hurta good deal mystified it was a very odd thing he was not in the least a snob but he knew that the visit of the countess of deringham whose name was still great in the social world was not a thing to be refused without grave reasons by a girl in the position of mr sabins niece the old question came back to him with an irresistible emphasis who were these people he looked at her furtively he was an observant man in the small details of a womans toilette and he knew that he had never met a girl better turned out than his present companion the cut of her tailormade gown was perfection her gloves and boots could scarcely have come from anywhere but paris she carried herself too with a perfect ease and indefinable distinction which could only have come to her by descent she was a perfect type of the woman of breedingunrestrained yet aristocratic to the tips of her fingernails  he sighed as he looked away from her  you are a very mysterious young woman he said with a forced air of gaiety  i am afraid that i am she admitted regretfully i can assure you that i am very tired of it butit will not last for very much longer  you are really going away then he asked quickly  yes we shall not be in england much longer  you are going for good he asked i mean to remain away  when we go she said it is very doubtful if ever i shall set my foot on english soil again  he drew a quick breath it was his one chance then her last words must be his excuse for such precipitation they had scrambled down through an opening in the cliffs and there was no one else in sight some instinct seemed to tell her what was coming she tried to talk but she could not his hand had closed upon hers and she had not the strength to draw it away it was so very english this sudden wooing no one had ever dared to touch her fingers before without first begging permission  dont you knowhelènethat i love you i want you to live in englandto be my wife dont say that i havent a chance i know that i ought not to have spoken yet but you are going away so soon and i am so afraid that i might not see you again alone dont stop me please i am not asking you now for your love i know that it is too soonto hope for thataltogether i only want you to know and to be allowed to hope  you must not it is impossible  the words were very low and they came from her quivering with intense pain he released her fingers she leaned upon a huge boulder near and resting her face upon her hand gazed dreamily out to sea  i am very sorry she said my uncle was right after all it was not wise for us to meet i ought to have no friends it was not wiseit was very very foolish  being a man his first thoughts had been for himself but at her words he forgot everything except that she too was unhappy  do you mean he said slowly that you cannot care for me or that there are difficulties which seem to you to make it impossible  she looked up at him and he scarcely knew her transfigured face with the tears glistening upon her eyelashes  do not tempt me to say what might make both of us more unhappy she begged be content to know that i cannot marry you  you have promised somebody else  i shall probably marry she said deliberately somebody else  he ground his heel into the soft sands and his eyes flashed  you are being coerced he cried  she lifted her head proudly  there is no person breathing she said quietly who would dare to attempt such a thing  then he looked out with her towards the sea and they watched the long rippling waves break upon the brown sands the faint and unexpected gleam of wintry sunshine lying upon the bosom of the sea and the screaming seagulls whose white wings shone like alabaster against the darker clouds for him these things were no longer beautiful nor did he see the sunlight which with a sudden fitfulness had warmed the air it was all very cold and grey it was not possible for him to read the riddle yetshe had not said that she could not care for him there was that hope  there is no one he said slowly who could coerce you you will not marry me but you will probably marry somebody else is it then that you care for this other man and not for me  she shook her head  of the two she said with a faint attempt at her old manner i prefer you yet i shall marry him  wolfenden became aware of an unexpected sensation he was getting angry  i have a right he said resting his hand upon her shoulder and gaining courage from her evident weakness to know more i have given you my love at least you owe me in return your confidence let me have it you shall see that even if i may not be your lover i can at least be your faithful friend  she touched his hand tenderly it was scarcely kind of hercertainly not wise she had taken off her glove and the touch of her soft delicate fingers thrilled him the blood rushed through his veins like mad music the longing to take her into his arms was almost uncontrollable her dark eyes looked upon him very kindly  my friend she said i know that you would be faithful you must not be angry with me nay it is your pity i want some day you will know all then you will understand perhaps even you will be sorry for me if i am not forgotten i only wish that i could tell you more only i may not it makes me sad to deny you but i must  i mean to know he said doggedlyi mean to know everything you are sacrificing yourself to talk of marrying a man whom you do not love is absurd who are you if you do not tell me i shall go to your guardian i shall go to mr sabin  mr sabin is always at your service said a suave voice almost at his elbow never more so than at the present  wolfenden turned round with a start it was indeed mr sabin who stood theremr sabin in unaccustomed guise clad in a tweed suit and leaning upon an ordinary walkingstick  come he said goodhumouredly dont look at me as though i were something uncanny if you had not been so very absorbed you would have heard me call to you from the cliffs i wanted to save myself the climb but you were deaf both of you am i the first man whose footsteps upon the sands have fallen lightly now what is it you want to ask me lord wolfenden  wolfenden was in no way disturbed at the mans coming on the contrary he was glad of it he answered boldly and without hesitation  i want to marry your niece mr sabin he said  very natural indeed mr sabin remarked easily if i were a young man of your age and evident taste i have not the least doubt but that i should want to marry her myself i offer you my sincere sympathy unfortunately it is impossible  i want to know wolfenden said why it is impossible i want a reason of some sort  you shall have one with pleasure mr sabin said my niece is already betrothed  to a man wolfenden exclaimed indignantly whom she admits that she does not care for  whom she has nevertheless mr sabin said firmly and with a sudden flash of anger in his eyes agreed and promised of her own free will to marry look here lord wolfenden i do not desire to quarrel with you you saved me from a very awkward accident a few nights ago and i remain your debtor be reasonable my niece has refused your offer i confirm her refusal your proposal does us both much honour but it is utterly out of the question that is putting it plainly is it not now you must choose for yourselfwhether you will drop the subject and remain our valued friend or whether you compel me to ask you to leave us at once and consider us henceforth as strangers  the girl laid her hand upon his shoulder and looked at him pleadingly  for my sake she said choose to remain our friend and let this be forgotten  for your sake i consent he said but i give no promise that i will not at some future time reopen the subject  you will do so mr sabin said exactly when you desire to close your acquaintance with us for the rest you have chosen wisely now i am going to take you home helène afterwards if lord wolfenden will give me a match i shall be delighted to have a round of golf with him  i shall be very pleased wolfenden answered  i will see you at the pavilion in half an hour mr sabin said in the meantime you will please excuse us i have a few words to say to my niece  she held out both her hands looking at him half kindly half wistfully  goodbye she said i am so sorry  but he looked straight into her eyes and he answered her bravely he would not admit defeat  i hope that you are not he said i shall never regret it     chapter xx  from a dim world   wolfenden was in no particularly cheerful frame of mind when a few moments after the half hour was up mr sabin appeared upon the pavilion tee followed by a tall dark young man carrying a bag of golf clubs mr sabin on the other hand was inclined to be sardonically cheerful  your handicap he remarked is two mine is one suppose we play level we ought to make a good match  wolfenden looked at him in surprise  did you say one  mr sabin smiled  yes they give me one at pau and cannes my foot interferes very little with my walking upon turf all the same i expect you will find me an easy victim here shall i drive just here dumayne he added pointing to a convenient spot upon the tee with the head of his driver not too much sand  where did you get your caddie wolfenden asked he is not one of ours is he  mr sabin shook his head  i found him on some links in the south of france he answered he is the only caddie i ever knew who could make a decent tee so i take him about with me he valets me as well that will do nicely dumayne  mr sabins expression suddenly changed his body as though by instinct fell into position he scarcely altered his stand an inch from the position he had first taken up wolfenden who had expected a halfswing was amazed at the wonderfully lithe graceful movement with which he stooped down and the club flew round his shoulder clean and true the ball flew off the tee in a perfectly direct linea capital drive only a little short of the two hundred yards master and servant watched it critically  a fairly well hit ball i think dumayne mr sabin remarked  you got it quite clean away sir the man answered it hasnt run very well though you will find it a little near the far bunker for a comfortable second  i shall carry it all right mr sabin said quietly  wolfenden also drove a long ball but with a little slice he had to play the odd and caught the top of the bunker the hole fell to mr sabin in four  they strolled off towards the second teeing ground  are you staying down here for long mr sabin asked  wolfenden hesitated  i am not sure he said i am rather oddly situated at home at any rate i shall probably be here as long as you  i am not sure about that mr sabin said i think that i am going to like these links and if so i shall not hurry away forgive me if i am inquisitive but your reference to home affairs is i presume in connection with your fathers health i was very sorry to hear that he is looked upon now as a confirmed invalid  wolfenden assented gravely he did not wish to talk about his father to mr sabin on the other hand mr sabin was politely persistent  he does not i presume receive visitors he said as they left the tee after the third drive  never wolfenden answered decisively he suffers a good deal in various ways and apart from that he is very much absorbed in the collection of some statistics connected with a hobby of his he does not see even his oldest friends  mr sabin was obviously interested  many years ago he said i met your father at alexandria he was then in command of the victoria he would perhaps scarcely recollect me now but at the time he made me promise to visit him if ever i was in england it must beyes it surely must be nearly fifteen years ago  i am afraid wolfenden remarked watching the flight of his ball after a successful brassy shot that he would have forgotten all about it by now his memory has suffered a good deal  mr sabin addressed his own ball and from a bad lie sent it flying a hundred and fifty yards with a peculiar jerking shot which wolfenden watched with envy  you must have a wonderful eye he remarked to hit a ball with a full swing lying like that nine men out of ten would have taken an iron  mr sabin shrugged his shoulders he did not wish to talk golf  i was about to remark he said that your father had then the reputation of and impressed me as being the best informed man with regard to english naval affairs with whom i ever conversed  he was considered an authority i believe wolfenden admitted  what i particularly admired about him mr sabin continued was the absence of that cocksureness which sometimes i am afraid almost blinds the judgment of your great naval officers i have heard him even discuss the possibility of an invasion of england with the utmost gravity he admitted that it was far from improbable  my fathers views wolfenden said have always been pessimistic as regards the actual strength of our navy and coast defences i believe he used to make himself a great nuisance at the admiralty  he has ceased now i suppose mr sabin remarked to take much interest in the matter  i can scarcely say that wolfenden answered his interest however has ceased to be official i daresay you have heard that he was in command of the channel fleet at the time of the terrible disaster in the solent he retired almost immediately afterwards and we fear that his health will never altogether recover from the shock  there was a short intermission in the conversation wolfenden had sliced his ball badly from the sixth tee and mr sabin having driven as usual with almost mathematical precision their ways for a few minutes lay apart they came together however on the puttinggreen and had a short walk to the next tee  that was a very creditable half to you mr sabin remarked  my approach wolfenden admitted was a lucky one  it was a very fine shot mr sabin insisted the spin helped you of course but you were justified in allowing for that especially as you seem to play most of your mashie shots with a cut what were we talking about oh i remember of course it was about your father and the solent catastrophe admiral deringham was not concerned with the actual disaster in any way was he  wolfenden shook his hand  thank god no he said emphatically but admiral marston was his dearest friend and he saw him go down with six hundred of his men he was so close that they even shouted farewells to one another  it must have been a terrible shock mr sabin admitted no wonder he has suffered from it now you have spoken of it i think i remember reading about his retirement a sad thing for a man of action as he always was does he remain in norfolk all the year round  he never leaves deringham hall wolfenden answered he used to make short yachting cruises until last year but that is all over now it is twelve months since he stepped outside his own gates  mr sabin remained deeply interested  has he any occupation beyond this hobby of which you spoke he asked he rides and shoots a little i suppose like the rest of your country gentlemen  then for the first time wolfenden began to wonder dimly whether mr sabin had some purpose of his own in so closely pursuing the thread of this conversation he looked at him keenly at the moment his attention seemed altogether directed to the dangerous proximity of his ball and a tall sand bunker throughout his interest had seemed to be fairly divided between the game and the conversation which he had initiated none the less wolfenden was puzzled he could scarcely believe that mr sabin had any real personal interest in his father but on the other hand it was not easy to understand this persistent questioning as to his occupation and doings the last inquiry carelessly though it was asked was a direct one it seemed scarcely worth while to evade it  no my father has special interests he answered slowly he is engaged now upon some work connected with his profession  indeed  mr sabins exclamation suggested a curiosity which it was not wolfendens purpose to gratify he remained silent the game proceeded without remark for a quarter of an hour wolfenden was now three down and with all the stimulus of a strong opponent he set himself to recover lost ground the ninth hole he won with a fine long putt which mr sabin applauded heartily  they drove from the next tee and walked together after their balls which lay within a few yards of one another  i am very much interested mr sabin remarked in what you have been telling me about your father it confirms rather a curious story about lord deringham which i heard in london a few weeks ago i was told i forget by whom that your father had devoted years of his life to a wonderfully minute study of english coast defences and her naval strength my informant went on to say thatforgive me but this was said quite openly you knowthat whilst on general matters your fathers mental health was scarcely all that could be desired his work in connection with these two subjects was of great value it struck me as being a very singular and a very interesting case  wolfenden shook his head dubiously  your informant was misled i am afraid he said my father takes his hobby very seriously and of course we humour him but as regards the value of his work i am afraid it is worthless  have you tested it yourself mr sabin asked  i have only seen a few pages wolfenden admitted but they were wholly unintelligible my chief authority is his own secretary who is giving up an excellent place simply because he is ashamed to take money for assisting in work which he declares to be utterly hopeless  he is a man mr sabin remarked whom you can trust i suppose his judgment is not likely to be at fault  there is not the faintest chance of it wolfenden declared he is a very simple goodhearted little chap and tremendously conscientious what your friend told you by the bye reminds me of rather a curious thing which happened yesterday  wolfenden paused there did not seem however to be any reason for concealment and his companion was evidently deeply interested  a man called upon us wolfenden continued with a letter purporting to be from our local doctor here he gave his name as franklin wilmot the celebrated physician you know and explained that he was interested in a new method of treating mental complaints he was very plausible and he explained everything unusual about his visit most satisfactorily he wanted a sight of the work on which my father was engaged and after talking it over we introduced him into the study during my fathers absence from it he promised to give us a general opinion upon the case and its treatment whilst he was there our doctor drove up in hot haste the letter was a forgery the man an impostor  wolfenden glancing towards mr sabin as he finished his story was surprised at the latters imperfectly concealed interest his lips were indrawn his face seemed instinct with a certain passionate but finely controlled emotion only the slight hiss of his breath and the gleam of his black eyes betrayed him  what happened he asked did you secure the fellow  wolfenden played a long shot and waited whilst he watched the run of his ball then he turned towards his companion and shook his head  no he was a great deal too clever for that he sent me out to meet whitlett and when we got back he had shown us a clean pair of heels he got away through the window  did he take away any papers with him mr sabin asked  he may have taken a loose sheet or two wolfenden said nothing of any consequence i think he had no time i dont think that that could have been his object altogether or he would scarcely have suggested my remaining with him in the study  mr sabin drew a quick little breath he played an iron shot and played it very badly  it was a most extraordinary occurrence he remarked what was the man like did he seem like an ordinary thief  wolfenden shook his head decidedly  not in the least he declared he was well dressed and his manners were excellent he had all the appearance of a man of position he completely imposed upon both my mother and myself  how long were you in the study before dr whitlett arrived mr sabin asked  barely five minutes  it was odd but mr sabin seemed positively relieved  and mr blatherwick he asked where was he all the time  who wolfenden asked in surprise  mr blatherwickyour fathers secretary mr sabin repeated coolly i understood you to say that his name was blatherwick  i dont remember mentioning his name at all wolfenden said vaguely disturbed  mr sabin addressed his ball with care and played it deliberately on to the green then he returned to the subject  i think that you must have done he said suavely or i should scarcely have known it was he in the room  all the time wolfenden answered  mr sabin drew another little breath  he was there when the fellow bolted  wolfenden nodded  why did he not try to stop him  wolfenden smiled  physically he remarked it would have been an impossibility blatherwick is a small man and an exceedingly nervous one he is an honest little fellow but i am afraid he would not have shone in an encounter of that sort  mr sabin was on the point of asking another question but wolfenden interrupted him he scarcely knew why but he wanted to get away from the subject he was sorry that he had ever broached it  come he said we are talking too much let us play golf i am sure i put you off that last stroke  mr sabin took the hint and was silent they were on the eleventh green and bordering it on the far side was an open roadthe sea road which followed the coast for a mile or two and then turned inland to deringham wolfenden preparing to putt heard wheels close at hand and as the stroke was a critical one for him he stood back from his ball till the vehicle had passed glancing carelessly up he saw his own blue liveries and his mother leaning back in a barouche with a word of apology to his opponent he started forward to meet her  the coachman who had recognised him pulled up his horses in the middle of the road wolfenden walked swiftly over to the carriage side his mothers appearance had alarmed him she was looking at him and yet past him her cheeks were pale her eyes were set and distended one of her hands seemed to be convulsively clutching the side of the carriage nearest to her she had all the appearance of a woman who is suddenly face to face with some terrible vision wolfenden looked over his shoulder quickly he could see nothing more alarming in the background than the figure of his opponent who with his back partly turned to them was gazing out to sea he stood at the edge of the green on slightly rising ground and his figure was outlined with almost curious distinctness against the background of air and sky  has anything fresh happened mother wolfenden asked with concern i am afraid you are upset were you looking for me  she shook her head it struck him that she was endeavouring to assume a composure which she assuredly did not possess  no there is nothing fresh naturally i am not well i am hoping that the drive will do me good are you enjoying your golf  very much wolfenden answered the course has really been capitally kept we are having a close match  who is your opponent  wolfenden glanced behind him carelessly mr sabin had thrown several balls upon the green and was practising long putts  fellow named sabin he answered no one you would be likely to be interested in he comes down from london and he plays a remarkably fine game rather a saturninelooking personage isnt he  he is a most unpleasantlooking man lady deringham faltered white now to the lips where did you meet him here or in london  in london wolfenden explained rather a curious meeting it was too a fellow attacked him coming out of a restaurant one night and i interferedjust in time he has taken a little house down here  is he alone lady deringham asked  he has a niece living with him wolfenden answered she is a very charming girl i think that you would like her  the last words he added with something of an effort and an indifference which was palpably assumed lady deringham however did not appear to notice them at all  have no more to do with him than you can help wolfenden she said leaning a little over to him and speaking in a halffearful whisper i think his face is awful  wolfenden laughed  i am not likely to see a great deal of him he declared in fact i cant say that he seems very cordially disposed towards me considering that i saved him from rather a nasty accident by the bye he said something about having met the admiral at alexandria you have never come across him i suppose  the sun was warm and the wind had dropped or wolfenden could almost have declared that his mothers teeth were chattering her eyes were fixed again in a rigid stare which passed him by and travelled beyond he looked over his shoulder mr sabin apparently tired of practising was standing directly facing them leaning upon his putter he was looking steadfastly at lady deringham not in the least rudely but with a faint show of curiosity and a smile which in no way improved his appearance slightly parting his lips meeting his gaze wolfenden looked away with an odd feeling of uneasiness  you are right he said his face is really a handsome one in a way but he certainly is not prepossessinglooking  lady deringham had recovered herself she leaned back amongst the cushions  didnt you ask me she said whether i had ever met the man i cannot remembercertainly i was at alexandria with your father so perhaps i did you will be home to dinner  he nodded  of course how is the admiral today  remarkably well he asked for you just before i came out  i shall see him at dinner wolfenden said perhaps he will let me smoke a cigar with him afterwards  he stood away from the carriage and lifted his cap with a smile the coachman touched his horses and the barouche rolled on wolfenden walked slowly back to his companion  you will excuse my leaving you he said i was afraid that my mother might have been looking for me  by all means mr sabin answered i hope that you did not hurry on my account i am trying he added to recollect if ever i met lady deringham at my time of life ones reminiscences become so chaotic  he looked keenly at wolfenden who answered him after a moments hesitation  lady deringham was at alexandria with my father so it is just possible he said     chapter xxi  harcutts inspiration   wolfenden lost his match upon the last hole nevertheless it was a finely contested game and when mr sabin proposed a round on the following day he accepted without hesitation he did not like mr sabin any the betterin fact he was beginning to acquire a deliberate distrust of him something of that fear with which other people regarded him had already communicated itself to wolfenden without having the shadow of a definite suspicion with regard to the man or his character he was inclined to resent that interest in the state of affairs at deringham hall which mr sabin had undoubtedly manifested at the same time he was helènes guardian and so long as he occupied that position wolfenden was not inclined to give up his acquaintance  they parted in the pavilion wolfenden lingering for a few minutes half hoping that he might receive some sort of invitation to call at mr sabins temporary abode perhaps under the circumstances it was scarcely possible that any such invitation could be given although had it been wolfenden would certainly have accepted it for he had no idea of at once relinquishing all hope as regards helène he was naturally sanguine and he was very much in love there was something mysterious about that other engagement of which he had been told he had an idea that but for mr sabins unexpected appearance helène would have offered him a larger share of her confidence he was content to wait for it  wolfenden had ridden over from home and left his horse in the hotel stables as he passed the hall a familiar figure standing in the open doorway hailed him he glanced quickly up and stopped short it was harcutt who was standing there in a norfolk tweed suit and thick boots  of all men in the world he exclaimed in blank surprise what in the name of all thats wonderful are you doing here  harcutt answered with a certain doggedness almost as though he resented wolfendens astonishment  i dont know why you should look at me as though i were a ghost he said if it comes to that i might ask you the same question what are you doing here  oh im at home wolfenden answered promptly im down to visit my people its only a mile or two from here to deringham hall  harcutt dropped his eyeglass and laughed shortly  you are wonderfully filial all of a sudden he remarked of course you had no other reason for coming  none at all wolfenden answered firmly i came because i was sent for it was a complete surprise to me to meet mr sabin hereat least it would have been if i had not travelled down with his niece their coming was simply a stroke of luck for me  harcutt assumed a more amiable expression  i am glad to hear it he said i thought that you were stealing a march on me and there really was not any necessity for our interests do not clash in the least it was different between you and poor old densham but hes given it up of his own accord and he sailed for india yesterday  poor old chap wolfenden said softly he would not tell you i suppose even at the last what it was that he had heard aboutthese people  he would not tell me harcutt answered but he sent a message to you he wished me to remind you that you had been friends for fifteen years and he was not likely to deceive you he was leaving the country he said because he had certain and definite information concerning the girl which made it absolutely hopeless for either you or he to think of her his advice to you was to do the same  i do not doubt densham wolfenden said slowly but i doubt his information it came from a woman who has been denshams friend then again what may seem an insurmountable obstacle to him may not be so to me nothing vague in the shape of warnings will deter me  well harcutt said i have given you denshams message and my responsibility concerning it is ended as you know my own interests lie in a different direction now i want a few minutes conversation with you the hotel rooms are a little too public are you in a hurry or can you walk up and down the drive with me once or twice  i can spare half an hour very well wolfenden said but i should prefer to do no more walking just yet come and sit down hereit isnt cold  they chose a seat looking over the sea harcutt glanced carefully all around there was no possibility of their being overheard nor indeed was there any one in sight  i am developing fresh instincts harcutt said as he crossed his legs and lit a cigarette i am here i should like you to understand purely in a professional capacityand i want your help  but my dear fellow wolfenden said i dont understand if when you say professionally you mean as a journalist why what on earth in this place can there be worth the chronicling there is scarcely a single person known to society in the neighbourhood  mr sabin is here harcutt remarked quietly  wolfenden looked at him in surprise  that might have accounted for your presence here as a private individual he said but professionally how on earth can he interest you  he interests me professionally very much indeed harcutt answered  wolfenden was getting puzzled  mr sabin interests you professionally he repeated slowly then you have learnt something mr sabin has an identity other than his own  i suspect him to be harcutt said slowly a most important and interesting personage i have learnt a little concerning him i am here to learn more i am convinced that it is worth while  have you learnt anything wolfenden asked concerning his niece  absolutely nothing harcutt answered decidedly i may as well repeat that my interest is in the man alone i am not a sentimental person at all his niece is perhaps the most beautiful woman i have ever seen in my life but it is with no thought of her that i have taken up this investigation having assured you of that i want to know if you will help me  you must speak a little more plainly wolfenden said you are altogether too vague what help do you want and for what purpose  mr sabin harcutt said is engaged in great political schemes he is in constant and anxious communication with the ambassadors of two great powers he affects secrecy in all his movements and the name by which he is known is without doubt an assumed one this much i have learnt for certain my own ideas are too vague yet for me to formulate i cannot say any more except that i believe him to be deep in some design which is certainly not for the welfare of this country it is my assurance of this which justifies me in exercising a certain espionage upon his movementswhich justifies me also wolfenden in asking for your assistance  my position wolfenden remarked becomes a little difficult whoever this man sabin may be nothing would induce me to believe ill of his niece i could take no part in anything likely to do her harm you will understand this better harcutt when i tell you that a few hours ago i asked her to be my wife  you asked herwhat  to be my wife  and she  refused me  harcutt looked at him for a moment in blank amazement  who refused youmr sabin or his niece  both  did shedid mr sabin know your position did he understand that you are the future earl of deringham  without a doubt wolfenden answered drily in fact mr sabin seems to be pretty well up in my genealogy he had met my father once he told me  harcutt with the natural selfishness of a man engaged upon his favourite pursuit quite forgot to sympathise with his friend he thought only of the bearing of this strange happening upon his quest  this he remarked disposes once and for all of the suggestion that these people are ordinary adventurers  if any one wolfenden said was ever idiotic enough to entertain the possibility of such a thing i may add that from the first i have had almost to thrust my acquaintance upon them especially so far as mr sabin is concerned he has never asked me to call upon them here or in london and this morning when he found me with his niece he was quietly but furiously angry  it is never worth while harcutt said to reject a possibility until you have tested and proved it what you say however settles this one they are not adventurers in any sense of the word now will you answer me a few questions it may be just as much to your advantage as to mine to go into this matter  wolfenden nodded  you can ask the questions at any rate he said i will answer them if i can  the young ladydid she refuse you from personal reasons a man can always tell you know hadnt you the impression from her answer that it was more the force of circumstances than any objection to you which prompted her negative ive put it bluntly but you know what i mean  wolfenden did not answer for nearly a minute he was gazing steadily seaward recalling with a swift effort of his imagination every word which had passed between themhe could even hear her voice and see her face with the soft dark eyes so close to his it was a luxury of recollection  i will admit he said quietly that what you suggest has already occurred to me if it had not i should be much more unhappy than i am at this moment to tell you the honest truth i was not content with her answer or rather the manner of it i should have had some hope of inducing her to at any rate modify it but for mr sabins unexpected appearance about him at least there was no hesitation he said no and he meant it  that is what i imagined might be the case harcutt said thoughtfully i dont want to have you think that i imagine any disrespect to the young lady but dont you see that either she and mr sabin must stand towards one another in an equivocal position or else they must be in altogether a different station of life to their assumed one when they dismiss the subject of an alliance with you so peremptorily  wolfenden flushed up to the temples and his eyes were lit with fire  you may dismiss all idea of the former possibility he said with ominous quietness if you wish me to discuss this matter with you further you will be particularly careful to avoid the faintest allusion to it  i have never seriously entertained it harcutt assented cheerfully i too believe in the girl she looks at once too proud and too innocent for any association of such thoughts with her she has the bearing and the manners of a queen granted then that we dismiss the first possibility  absolutely and for ever wolfenden said firmly i may add that mr sabin met me with a distinct reason for his refusalhe informed me his niece was already betrothed  that may or may not be true harcutt said it does not affect the question which we are considering at present we must come to the conclusion that these are people of considerable importance that is what i honestly believe now what do you suppose brings mr sabin to such an out of the way hole as this  the golf very likely wolfenden said he is a magnificent player  harcutt frowned  if i thought so he said i should consider my journey here a wasted one but i cant he is in the midst of delicate and important negotiationsi know as much as that he would not come down here at such a time to play golf it is an absurd idea  i really dont see how else you can explain it wolfenden remarked the greatest men have had their hobbies you know i need not remind you of neros fiddle or drakes bowls  quite unnecessary harcutt declared briskly frankly i dont believe in mr sabins golf there is somebody or something down here connected with his schemes the golf is a subterfuge he plays well because he does everything well  it will tax your ingenuity wolfenden said to connect his visit here with anything in the shape of political schemes  my ingenuity accepts the task at any rate harcutt said i am going to find out all about it and you must help me it will be for both our interests  i am afraid wolfenden answered that you are on a wild goose chase still i am quite willing to help you if i can  well to begin then harcutt said you have been with him some time today did he ask you any questions about the locality did he show any curiosity in any of the residents  wolfenden shook his head  absolutely none he answered the only conversation we had in which he showed any interest at all was concerning my own people by the bye that reminds me i told him of an incident which occurred at deringham hall last night and he was certainly interested and curious i chanced to look at him at an unexpected moment and his appearance astonished me i have never seen him look so keen about anything before  will you tell me the incident at once please harcutt begged eagerly it may contain the very clue for which i am hunting anything which interests mr sabin interests me  there is no secrecy about the matter wolfenden said i will tell you all about it you may perhaps have heard that my father has been in very poor health ever since the great solent disaster it unfortunately affected his brain to a certain extent and he has been the victim of delusions ever since the most serious of these is that he has been commissioned by the government to prepare upon a gigantic scale a plan and description of our coast defences and navy he has a secretary and typist and works ten hours a day but from their report and my own observations i am afraid the only result is an absolutely unintelligible chaos still of course we have to take him seriously and be thankful that it is no worse now the incident which i told mr sabin was this last night a man called and introduced himself as dr wilmot the great mind specialist he represented that he had been staying in the neighbourhood and was on friendly terms with the local medico here dr whitlett my fathers case had been mentioned between them and he had become much interested in it he had a theory of his own for the investigation of such cases which consisted briefly of a careful scrutiny of any work done by the patient he brought a letter from dr whitlett and said that if we would procure him a sight of my fathers most recent manuscripts he would give us an opinion on the case we never had the slightest suspicion as to the truth of his statements and i took him with me to the admirals study however while we were there and he was rattling through the manuscripts up comes dr whitlett the local man in hot haste the letter was a forgery and the man an impostor he escaped through the window and got clean away that is the story just as i told it to mr sabin what do you make of it  harcutt stood up and laid his hand upon the others shoulder  well ive got my clue thats all he declared the things as plain as sunlight  wolfenden rose also to his feet  i must be a fool he said for i certainly cant see it  harcutt lowered his tone  look here wolfenden he said i have no doubt that you are right and that your fathers work is of no value but you may be very sure of one thingmr sabin does not think so  i dont see what mr sabin has got to do with it wolfenden said  harcutt laughed  well i will tell you one thing he said it is the contents of your fathers study which has brought mr sabin to deringham     chapter xxii  from the beginning   a woman stood in the midst of a salt wilderness gazing seaward around her was a long stretch of wet sand and of seaweedstained rocks rising from little pools of water left by the tide and beyond the flat marshy country was broken only by that line of low cliffs from which the little tufts of grass sprouted feebly the waves which rolled almost to her feet were barely ripples breaking with scarcely a visible effort upon the moist sand above the sky was grey and threatening only a few minutes before a cloud of white mist had drifted in from the sea and settled softly upon the land in the form of rain the whole outlook was typical of intense desolation the only sound breaking the silence almost curiously devoid of all physical and animal noises was the soft washing of the sand at her feet and every now and then the jingling of silver harness as the horses of her carriage drawn up on the road above tossed their heads and fidgeted the carriage itself seemed grotesquely out of place the coachman with powdered hair and the dark blue deringham livery sat perfectly motionless his head bent a little forward and his eyes fixed upon his horses ears the footman by their side stood with folded arms and expression as wooden as though he were waiting upon a bond street pavement both were weary and both would have liked to vary the monotony by a little conversation but only a few yards away the woman was standing whose curious taste had led her to visit such a spot  her arms were hanging listlessly by her side her whole expression although her face was upturned towards the sky was one of intense dejection something about her attitude bespoke a keen and intimate sympathy with the desolation of her surroundings the woman was unhappy the light in her dark eyes was inimitably sad her cheeks were pale and a little wan yet lady deringham was very handsomeas handsome as a woman approaching middle age could hope to be her figure was still slim and elegant the streaks of grey in her raven black hair were few and far between she might have lived hand in hand with sorrow but it had done very little to age her only a few years ago in the crowded ballroom of a palace a prince had declared her to be the handsomest woman of her age and the prince had the reputation of knowing it was easy to believe it  how long the woman might have lingered there it is hard to say for evidently the spot possessed a peculiar fascination for her and she had given herself up to a rare fit of abstraction but some soundwas it the low wailing of that seagull or the more distant cry of a hawk motionless in midair and scarcely visible against the cloudy sky which caused her to turn her head inland and then she saw that the solitude was no longer unbroken a dark object had rounded the sandy little headland and was coming steadily towards her she looked at it with a momentary interest her skirt raised in her hand already a few steps back on her return to the waiting carriage was it a man it was something human at any rate although its progression was slow and ungraceful and marked with a peculiar but uniform action she stood perfectly still a motionless figure against the background of wan cloudshadowed sea and gathering twilight her eyes riveted upon this strange thing her lips slightly parted her cheeks as pale as death gradually it came nearer and nearer her skirt dropped from her nerveless fingers her eyes a moment before dull with an infinite and pitiful emptiness were lit now with a new light she was not alone nor was she unprotected yet the woman was suffering from a spasm of terrorone could scarcely imagine any sight revolting enough to call up that expression of acute and trembling fear which had suddenly transformed her appearance it was as though the level sands had yielded up their deadthe shipwrecked mariners of generations and they all with white sad faces and wailing voices were closing in around her yet it was hard to account for a terror so abject there was certainly nothing in the figure now close at hand which seemed capable of inspiring it  it was a man with a club footnothing more nor less in fact it was mr sabin there was nothing about his appearance save that ungainly movement caused by his deformity in any way singular or threatening he came steadily nearer and the woman who awaited him trembled perhaps his expression was a trifle sardonic owing chiefly to the extreme pallor of his skin and the black flannel clothes with invisible stripe which he had been wearing for golf yet when he lifted his soft felt hat from his head and bowed with an ease and effect palpably acquired in other countries his appearance was far from unpleasant he stood there bareheaded in the twilight a strangely winning smile upon his dark face and his head courteously bent  the most delightful of unexpected meetings he murmured i am afraid that i have come upon you like an apparition dear lady deringham i must have startled you yes i can see by your face that i did i am so sorry doubtless you did not know until yesterday that i was in england  lady deringham was slowly recovering herself she was white still even to the lips and there was a strange sick pain at her heart yet she answered him with something of her usual deliberateness conscious perhaps that her servants although their heads were studiously averted had yet witnessed with surprise this unexpected meeting  you certainly startled me she said i had imagined that this was the most desolate part of all unfrequented spots it is here i come when i want to feel absolutely alone i did not dream of meeting another fellow creatureleast of all people in the world perhaps you  i he answered smiling gently was perhaps the better prepared a few minutes ago from the cliffs yonder i saw your carriage drawn up here and i saw you alight i wanted to speak with you so i lost no time in scrambling down on to the sands you have changed marvellously little lady deringham  and you she said only in name you are the mr sabin with whom my son was playing golf yesterday morning  i am mr sabin he answered your son did me a good service a week or two back he is a very fine young fellow i congratulate you  and your niece lady deringham asked who is she my son spoke to me of her last night  mr sabin smiled faintly  ah madame he said there have been so many people lately who have been asking me that question yet to you as to them i must return the same answer she is my niece  you call her  she shares my name at present  is she your daughter  he shook his head sadly  i have never been married he said with an indefinable mournfulness in his flexible tones i have had neither wife nor child nor friend it is well for me that i have not  she looked down at his deformity and womanlike she shivered  it is no better then she murmured with eyes turned seaward  it is absolutely incurable he declared  she changed the subject abruptly  the last i heard of you she said was that you were in china you were planning great things there in ten years i was told europe was to be at your mercy  i left pekin five years ago he said china is a land of cabals she may yet be the greatest country in the world i for one believe in her destiny but it will be in the generations to come i have no patience to labour for another to reap the harvest then too a craving for just one draught of civilisation brought me westward again mongolian habits are interesting but a little trying  and what she asked looking at him steadily has brought you to deringham of all places upon this earth  he smiled and with his stick traced a quaint pattern in the sand  i have never told you anything that was not the truth he said i will not begin now i might have told you that i was here by chance for change of air or for the golf neither of these things would have been true i am here because deringham village is only a mile or two from deringham hall  she drew a little closer to him the jingling of harness as her horses tossed their heads impatiently reminded her of the close proximity of the servants  what do you want of me she asked hoarsely  he looked at her in mild reproach a goodhumoured smile at the corner of his lips yet after all was it good humour or some curious outward reflection of the working of his secret thoughts when he spoke the reproach at any rate was manifest  want of you you talk as though i were a blackmailer or something equally obnoxious is that quite fair constance  she evaded the reproach perhaps she was not conscious of it it was the truth she wanted  you had some end in coming here she persisted what is it i cannot conceive anything in the world you have to gain by coming to see me we have left the world and society we live buried whatever fresh schemes you may be planning there is no way in which we could help you you are richer stronger more powerful than we i can think she added of only one thing which may have brought you  and that he asked deliberately  she looked at him with a certain tremulous wistfulness in her eyes and with softening face  it may be she said that as you grow older you have grown kinder you may have thought of my great desire and you were always generous victor you may have come to grant it  the slightest possible change passed over his face as his christian name slipped from her lips the firm lines about his mouth certainly relaxed his dark eyes gleamed for a moment with a kindlier light perhaps at that minute for both of them came a sudden lifting of the curtain a lingering backward glance into the world of their youth passionate beautiful seductive there were memories there which still seemed set to musicmemories which pierced even the armour of his equanimity her eyes filled with tears as she looked at him with a quick gesture she laid her hand upon his  believe me victor she said i have always thought of you kindly you have suffered terribly for my sake and your silence was magnificent i have never forgotten it  his face clouded over her impulsive words had been after all ill chosen she had touched a sore point there was something in these memories distasteful to him they recalled the one time in his life when he had been worsted by another man his cynicism returned  i am afraid he said that the years which have made so little change in your appearance have made you a sentimentalist i can assure you that these old memories seldom trouble me  then with a lightninglike intuition almost akin to inspiration he saw that he had made a mistake his best hold upon the woman had been through that mixture of sentiment and pity which something in their conversation had reawakened in her he was destroying it ruthlessly and of his own accord what folly  bah i am lying he said softly why should i between you and me constance there should be nothing but truth we at least should be sincere one to the other you are right i have brought you something which should have been yours long ago  she looked at him with wondering eyes  you are going to give me the letters  i am going to give them to you he said with the destruction of this little packet falls away the last link which held us together  he had taken a little bundle of letters tied with a faded ribbon from his pocket and held them out to her even in that saltodorous air the perfume of strange scents seemed to creep out from those closely written sheets as they fluttered in the breeze lady deringham clasped the packet with both hands and her eyes were very bright and very soft  it is not so victor she murmured there is a new and a stronger link between us now the link of my everlasting gratitude ah you were always generous always quixotic someday i felt sure that you would do this  when i left europe he said you would have had them but there was no trusted messenger whom i could spare yet if i had never returned they were so bestowed that they would have come into your hands with perfect safety even now constance will you think me very weak when i say that i part with them with regret they have been with me through many dangers and many strange happenings  you are she whispered the old victor again thank god that i have had this one glimpse of you i am ashamed to think how terrified i have been  she held out her hand impulsively he took it in his and with a glance at her servants let it fall almost immediately  constance he said i am going away now i have accomplished what i came for but first would you care to do me a small service it is only a trifle  a thrill of the old mistrustful fear shook her heart half ashamed of herself she stifled it at once and strove to answer him calmly  if there is anything within my power which i can do for you victor she said it will make me very happy you would not ask me i know unlessunless  you need have no fear he interrupted calmly it is a very little thing do you think that lord deringham would know me again after so many years  my husband  yes  she looked at him in something like amazement before she could ask the question which was framing itself upon her lips however they were both aware of a distant sound rapidly drawing nearerthe thunder of a horses hoofs upon the soft sand looking up they both recognised the rider at the same instant  it is your son mr sabin said quickly you need not mind leave me to explain tell me when i can find you at home alone  i am always alone she answered but come tomorrow     chapter xxiii  mr sabin explains   mr sabin and his niece had finished their dinner and were lingering a little over an unusually luxurious dessert wolfenden had sent some muscatel grapes and peaches from the forcing houses at deringham hallsuch peaches as covent garden could scarcely match and certainly not excel mr sabin looked across at helène as they were placed upon the table with a significant smile  an englishman he remarked pouring himself out a glass of burgundy and drawing the cigarettes towards him never knows when he is beaten as a national trait it is magnificent in private life it is a little awkward  helène had been sitting through the meal still and statuesque in her black dinner gown a little more pale than usual and very silent at mr sabins remark she looked up quickly  are you alluding to lord wolfenden she asked  mr sabin lit his cigarette and nodded through the mist of blue smoke  to no less a person he answered with a shade of mockery in his tone i am beginning to find my guardianship no sinecure after all do you know it never occurred to me when we concluded our little arrangement that i might have to exercise my authority against so ardent a suitor you would have found his lordship hard to get rid of this morning i am afraid but for my opportune arrival  by no means she answered lord wolfenden is a gentleman and he was not more persistent than he had a right to be  perhaps mr sabin remarked you would have been better pleased if i had not come  i am quite sure of it she admitted but then it is so like you to arrive just at a crisis do you know i cant help fancying that there is something theatrical about your comings and goings you appearand one looks for a curtain and a tableau where could you have dropped from this morning  from cromer in a donkeycart he answered smiling i got as far as peterborough last night and came on here by the first train there was nothing very melodramatic about that surely  it does not sound so certainly your playing golf with lord wolfenden afterwards was commonplace enough  i found lord wolfenden very interesting mr sabin said thoughtfully he told me a good deal which was important for me to know i am hoping that tonight he will tell me more  tonight is he coming here  mr sabin assented calmly  yes i thought you would be surprised but then you need not see him you know i met him riding upon the sands this afternoonat rather an awkward moment by the byeand asked him to dine with us  he refused of course  only the dinner presumably he doubted our cook for he asked to be allowed to come down afterwards he will be here soon  why did you ask him  mr sabin looked keenly across the table there was something in the girls face which he scarcely understood  well not altogether for the sake of his company i must confess he replied he has been useful to me and he is in the position to be a great deal more so  the girl rose up she came over and stood before him mr sabin knew at once that something unusual was going to happen  you want to make of him she said in a low intense tone what you make of every onea tool understand that i will not have it  helène  the single word and the glance which flashed from his eyes was expressive but the girl did not falter  oh i am weary of it she cried with a little passionate outburst i am sick to death of it all you will never succeed in what you are planning one might sooner expect a miracle i shall go back to vienna i am tired of masquerading i have had more than enough of it  mr sabins expression did not alter one iota he spoke as soothingly as one would speak to a child  i am afraid he said quietly that it must be dull for you perhaps i ought to have taken you more into my confidence very well i will do so now listen you say that i shall never succeed on the contrary i am on the point of success the waiting for both of us is nearly over  the prospect startled but did not seem altogether to enrapture her she wanted to hear more  i received this dispatch from london this morning he said baron knigenstein has left for berlin to gain the emperors consent to an agreement which we have already ratified the affair is as good as settled it is a matter now of a few days only  germany she exclaimed incredulously i thought it was to be russia  so he answered did i i have to make a certain rather humiliating confession i who have always considered myself keenly in touch with the times especially since my interest in european matters revived have remained wholly ignorant of one of the most extraordinary phases of modern politics in years to come history will show us that it was inevitable but i must confess that it has come upon me like a thunder clap i like all the world have looked upon germany and england as natural and inevitable allies that is neither more nor less than a colossal blunder as a matter of fact they are natural enemies  she sank into a chair and looked at him blankly  but it is impossible she cried there are all the ties of relationship and a common stock they are sister countries  dont you know he said that it is the like which irritates and repels the like it is this relationship which has been at the root of the great jealousy which seems to have spread all through germany i need not go into all the causes of it with you now sufficient it is to say that all the recent successes of england have been at germanys expense there has been a storm brewing for long today tomorrow in a week surely within a month it will break  you may be right she said but who of all the frenchwomen i know would care to reckon themselves the debtors of germany  you will owe germany nothing for she will be paid and overpaid for all she does russia has made terms with the republic of france politically she has nothing to gain by a rupture but with germany it is different she and france are ready at this moment to fly at one anothers throats the military popularity of such a war would be immense the cry to arms would ring from the mediterranean to the rhine  oh i hope that it may not be war she said i had hoped always that diplomacy backed by a waiting army would be sufficient france at heart is true i know but after all it sounds like a fairy tale you are a wonderful man but how can you hope to move nations what can you offer germany to exact so tremendous a price  i can offer mr sabin said calmly what germany desires more than anything else in the worldthe key to england it has taken me six years to perfect my schemes as you know i was in america part of the time i was supposed to be in china it was there in the laboratory of allison that i commenced the work step by step i have moved onlink by link i have forged the chain i may say without falsehood or exaggeration that my work would be the work of another mans lifetime with me it has been a labour of love your part my dear helène will be a glorious one think of it and shake off your depression this hole and corner life is not for longthe time for which we have worked is at hand  she did not look up there was no answering fire of enthusiasm in her dark eyes the colour came into her cheeks and faded away mr sabin was vaguely disturbed  in what way she said without directly looking at him is lord wolfenden likely to be useful to you  mr sabin did not reply for some time in fact he did not reply at all this new phase in the situation was suddenly revealed to him when he spoke his tone was grave enoughgrave with an undertone of contempt  is it possible helène he said that you have allowed yourself to think seriously of the lovemaking of this young man i must confess that such a thing in connection with you would never have occurred to me in my wildest dreams  i am the mistress of my own affections she said coldly i am not pledged to you in any way if i were to say that i intended to listen seriously to lord wolfendeneven if i were to say that i intended to marry himwell there is no one who would dare to interfere but on the other hand i have refused him that should be enough for you i am not going to discuss the matter at all you would not understand it  i must admit mr sabin said that i probably should not of love as you young people conceive it i know nothing but of that greater affectionthe passionate love of a man for his race and his kind and his countrywell that has always seemed to me a thing worth living and working and dying for i had fancied helène that some spark of that same fire had warmed your blood or you would not be here today  i think she answered more gently that it has i too believe me love my country and my people and my order if i do not find these allengrossing you must remember that i am a woman and i am young i do not pretend to be capable only of impersonal and patriotic love  ay you are a woman and the blood of some of your ancestors will make itself felt he added looking at her thoughtfully i ought to have considered the influence of sex and heredity by the bye have you heard from henri lately  she shook her head  not since he has been in france we thought that whilst he was there it would be better for him not to write  mr sabin nodded  most discreet he remarked satirically i wonder what henri would say if he knew  the girls lip curled a little  if even she said there was really something serious for him to know henri would survive it his is not the temperament for sorrow for twenty minutes he would be in a paroxysm he would probably send out for poison which he would be careful not to take and play with a pistol if he were sure that it was not loaded by dinner time he would be calm the opera would soothe him still more and by the time it was over he would be quite ready to take mademoiselle somebody out to supper with the first glass of champagne his sorrow would be drowned for ever if any wound remained at all it would be the wound to his vanity  you have considered then the possibility of upsetting my schemes and withdrawing your part mr sabin said quietly you understand that your marriage with henri would be an absolute necessitythat without it all would be chaos  i do not say that i have considered any such possibility she answered if i make up my mind to withdraw i shall give you notice but i will admit that i like lord wolfenden and i detest henri ah i know of what you would remind me you need not fear i shall not forget it will not be today nor tomorrow that i shall decide  a servant entered the room and announced lord wolfenden mr sabin looked up  where have you shown him he asked  into the library sir the girl answered  mr sabin swore softly between his teeth and sprang to his feet  excuse me helène he exclaimed i will bring lord wolfenden into the drawingroom that girl is an idiot she has shown him into the one room in the house which i would not have had him enter for anything in the world     chapter xxiv  the way of the woman   wolfenden had been shown as he supposed into an empty room by the servant of whom he had inquired for mr sabin but the door was scarcely closed before a familiar sound from a distant corner warned him that he was not alone he stopped short and looked fixedly at the slight feminine figure whose white fingers were flashing over the keyboard of a typewriter there was something very familiar about the curve of her neck and the waving of her brown hair her back was to him and she did not turn round  do leave me some cigarettes she said without lifting her head this is frightfully monotonous work how much more of it is there for me to do  i really dont know wolfenden answered hesitatingly why blanche  she swung round in her chair and gazed at him in blank amazement she was at least as much surprised as he was  lord wolfenden she exclaimed why what are you doing here  i might ask you he said gravely the same question  she stood up  you have not come to see me  he shook his head  i had not the least idea that you were here he assured her  her face hardened  of course not i was an idiot to imagine that you would care enough to come even if you had known  i do not know he remarked why you should say that on the contrary  she interrupted him  oh i know what you are going to say i ran away from mrs selbys nice rooms and never thanked you for your kindness i didnt even leave a message for you did i well never mind you know why i daresay  wolfenden thought that he did but he evaded a direct answer  what i cannot understand he said is why you are here  it is my new situation she answered i was bound to look for one you know there is nothing strange about it i advertised for a situation and i got this one  he was silent there were things in connection with this which he scarcely understood she watched him with a mocking smile parting her lips  it is a good deal harder to understand she said why you are here this is the very last house in the world in which i should have thought of seeing you  why he asked quickly  she shrugged her shoulders her speech had been scarcely a discreet one  i should not have imagined she said that mr sabin would have come within the circle of your friends  i do not know why he should not wolfenden said i consider him a very interesting man  she smiled upon him  yes he is interesting she said only i should not have thought that your tastes were at all identical  you seem to know a good deal about him wolfenden remarked quietly  for a moment an odd light gleamed in her eyes she was very pale wolfenden moved towards her  blanche he said has anything gone wrong with you you dont look well  she withdrew her hands from her face  there is nothing wrong with me she said hush he is coming  she swung round in her seat and the quick clicking of the instrument was resumed as her fingers flew over it the door opened and mr sabin entered he leaned on his stick standing on the threshold and glanced keenly at both of them  my dear lord wolfenden he said apologetically this is the worst of having country servants fancy showing you in here come and join us in the other room we are just going to have our coffee  wolfenden followed him with alacrity they crossed the little hall and entered the diningroom helène was still sitting there sipping her coffee in an easy chair she welcomed him with outstretched hand and a brilliantly soft smile mr sabin who was watching her closely appreciated perhaps for the first time her rare womanly beauty apart from its distinctly patrician qualities there was a change and he was not the man to be blind to it or to underrate its significance he felt that on the eve of victory he had another and an unexpected battle to fight yet he held himself like a brave man and one used to reverses for he showed no signs of dismay  i want you to try a glass of this claret lord wolfenden he said before you begin your coffee i know that you are a judge and i am rather proud of it you are not going away helène  i had no idea of going she laughed this is really the only habitable room in the house and i am not going to let lord wolfenden send me to shiver in what we call the drawingroom  i should be very sorry if you thought of such a thing wolfenden answered  if you will excuse me for a moment mr sabin said i will unpack some cigarettes helène will you see that lord wolfenden has which liqueur he prefers  he limped away and helène watched him leave the room with some surprise these were tactics which she did not understand was he already making up his mind that the game could be played without her she was puzzleda little uneasy  she turned to find wolfendens admiring eyes fixed upon her she looked at him with a smile halfsad halfhumorous  let me remember she said i am to see that you havewhat was it oh liqueurs we havent much choice you will find kummel and chartreuse on the sideboard and benedictine which my uncle hates by the bye at your elbow  no liqueurs thanks he said i wonder did you expect me tonight i dont think that i ought to have come ought i  well you certainly show she answered with a smile a remarkable disregard for all precedents and conventions you ought to be already on your way to foreign parts with your guns and servants it is englishmen is it not who go always to the rocky mountains to shoot bears when their love affairs go wrong  he was watching her closely and he saw that she was less at her ease than she would have had him believe he saw too or fancied that he saw a softening in her face a kindliness gleaming out of her lustrous eyes which suggested new things to him  the rocky mountains he said slowly mean despair a man does not go so far whilst he has hope  she did not answer him he gathered courage from her silence  perhaps he said i might now have been on my way there but for a somewhat sanguine dispositiona very strong determination and he added more softly a very intense love  it takes she remarked a very great deal to discourage an englishman  speaking for myself he answered i defy discouragement i am proof against it i love you so dearly helène that i simply decline to give you up i warn you that i am not a lover to be shaken off  his voice was very tender his words sounded to her simple but strong he was so sure of himself and his love truly she thought for an englishman this was no indifferent wooer his confidence thrilled her she felt her heart beat quickly under its sheath of drooping black lace and roses  i am giving you she said quietly no hope remember that but i do not want you to go away  the hope which her tongue so steadfastly refused to speak he gathered from her eyes her face from that indefinable softening which seems to pervade at the moment of yielding a womans very personality he was wonderfully happy although he had the wit to keep it to himself  you need not fear he whispered i shall not go away  outside they heard the sound of mr sabins stick she leaned over towards him  i want you she said tokiss me  his heart gave a great leap but he controlled himself intuitively he knew how much was permitted to him he seemed to have even some faint perception of the cause for her strange request he bent over and took her face for a moment between his hands her lips touched hisshe had kissed him  he stood away from her breathless with the excitement of the moment the perfume of her hair the soft touch of her lips the gentle movement with which she had thrust him away these things were like the drinking of strong wine to him her own cheeks were scarlet outside the sound of mr sabins stick grew more and more distinct she smoothed her hair and laughed softly up at him  at least she murmured there is that to remember always     chapter xxv  a handful of ashes   the countess of deringham was sitting alone in her smaller drawingroom gazing steadfastly at a certain spot in the blazing fire before her a little pile of grey ashes was all that remained of the sealed packet which she had placed within the bars only a few seconds ago she watched it slowly grow shapelesspiece after piece went fluttering up the broad chimney a gentle yet melancholy smile was parting her lips a chapter of her life was floating away there with the little trembling strips lighter than the air already hopelessly destroyed their disintegration brought with it a sense of freedom which she had lacked for many years yet it was only the folly of a girl the story of a little foolish lovemaking which those grey ashen fragments clinging so tenaciously to the iron bars could have unfolded lady deringham was not a woman who had ever for a single moment had cause to reproach herself with any real lack of duty to the brave young englishman whom she had married so many years ago it was of those days she was thinking as she sat there waiting for the caller whose generosity had set her free  at precisely four oclock there was the sound of wheels in the drive the slow movement of feet in the hall and a servant announced a visitor  mr sabin  lady deringham smiled and greeted him graciously mr sabin leaned upon his wonderful stick for a moment and then bent low over lady deringhams hand she pointed to an easy chair close to her own and he sank into it with some appearance of weariness he was looking a little old and tired and he carried himself without any of his usual buoyancy  only a few minutes ago she said i burnt my letters i was thinking of those days in paris when the man announced you how old it makes one feel  he looked at her critically  i am beginning to arrive at the conclusion he said that the poets and the novelists are wrong it is the man who suffers look at my grey hairs  it is only the art of my maid she said smiling which conceals mine do not let us talk of the past at all to think that we lived so long ago is positively appalling  he shook his head gently  not so appalling he answered as the thought of how long we still have to live one regrets ones youth as a matter of course but the prospect of old age is more terrible still lucky those men and those women who live and then die it is that interregnumthe level monotonous plain of advancing old age when one takes the waters at carlsbad and looks askance at the entréesthat is what one has to dread to watch our own degeneration the dropping away of our energies the decline of our tastewhy the tortures of the inquisition were trifles to it  she shuddered a little  you paint old age in dreary colours she said  i paint it as it must seem to men who have kept the kernel of life between their teeth he answered carelessly to the otherswell one cares little about them most men are like cows they are contented so long as they are fed to that class i daresay old age may seem something of a rest but neither you nor i are akin to them  you talk as you always talked she said mr sabin is very like  he stopped her  mr sabin if you please he exclaimed i am particularly anxious to preserve my incognito just now ever since we met yesterday i have been regretting that i did not mention it to youi do not wish it to be known that i am in england  mr sabin it shall be then she answered only if i were you i would have chosen a more musical name  i wonderhave you by chance spoken of me to your son he asked  it is only by chance that i have not she admitted i have scarcely seen him alone today and he was out last evening do you wish to remain mr sabin to him also  to him particularly mr sabin declared young men are seldom discreet  lady deringham smiled  wolfenden is not a gossip she remarked in fact i believe he is generally considered too reserved  for the present nevertheless he said let me remain mr sabin to him also i do not ask you this without a purpose  lady deringham bowed her head this man had a right to ask her more than such slight favours  you are still she said a man of mystery and incognitos you are still i suppose a plotter of great schemes in the old days you used to terrify me almost are you still as daring  alas no he answered time is rapidly drawing me towards the great borderland and when my foot is once planted there i shall carry out my theories and make my bow to the world with the best grace a man may whose life has been one long chorus of disappointments no i have retired from the great stage mine is now only a passive occupation one returns always you know and in a mild way i have returned to the literary ambitions of my youth it is in connection by the bye with this that i arrive at the favour which you so kindly promised to grant me  if you knew victor she said how grateful i feel towards you you would not hesitate to ask me anything within my power to grant  mr sabin toyed with his stick and gazed steadfastly into the fire he was pensive for several minutes then with the air of a man who suddenly detaches himself from a not unpleasant train of thought he looked up with a smile  i am not going to tax you very severely he said i am writing a critical paper on the armaments of the world for a european review i had letters of introduction to mr c and he gave me a great deal of valuable information there were one or two points however on which he was scarcely clear and in the course of conversation he mentioned your husbands name as being the greatest living authority upon those points he offered to give me a letter to him but i thought it would perhaps scarcely be wise i fancied too you might be inclined for reasons which we need not enlarge upon to help me  for a simple request lady deringhams manner of receiving it was certainly strange she was suddenly white almost to the lips a look of positive fear was in her eyes the frank cordiality the absolute kindliness with which she had welcomed her visitor was gone she looked at him with new eyes the old mistrust was born again once more he was the man to be feared and dreaded above all other men yet she would not give way altogether he was watching her narrowly and she made a brave effort to regain her composure  but do you not know she said hesitatingly that my husband is a great invalid it is a very painful subject for all of us but we fear that his mind is not what it used to be he has never been the same man since that awful night in the solent his work is more of a hobby with him it would not be at all reliable for reference  not all of it certainly he assented mr c explained that to me what i want is an opportunity to discriminate some would be very useful to methe majority of course worse than useless the particular information which i want concerns the structural defects in some of the new battleships it would save an immense amount of time to get this succinctly  she looked away from him still agitated  there are difficulties she murmured serious ones my husband has an extraordinary idea as to the value of his own researches and he is always haunted by a fear lest some one should break in and steal his papers he would not suffer me to glance at them and the room is too closely guarded for me to take you there without his knowledge he is never away himself and one of the keepers is stationed outside  the wit of a woman mr sabin said softly is allconquering  providing always lady deringham said that the woman is willing i do not understand what it all means do you know this perhaps you do there have been efforts made by strangers to break into my husbands room only a few days ago a stranger came here with a forged letter of introduction and obtained access to the admirals library he did not come to steal he came to study my husbands work he came in fact for the very purpose which you avow only yesterday my son began to take the same interest in the same thing the whole of this morning he spent with his father under the pretence of helping him really he was studying and examining for himself he has not told me what it is but he has a reason for this he too has some suspicions now you come and your mission is the same what does it all mean i will write to mr c myself he will come down and advise me  i would not do that if i were you mr sabin said quietly mr c would not thank you to be dragged down here on such an idle errand  ay but would it be an idle errand she said slowly victor be frank with me i should hate to refuse anything you asked me tell me what it means is my husbands work of any real value and if so to whom and for what purpose  mr sabin was gently distressed  my dear lady deringham he said i have told you the exact truth i want to get some statistics for my paper mr c himself recommended me to try and get them from your husband that is absolutely all as for this attempted robbery of which you were telling me believe me when i assure you that i know nothing whatever about it your sons interest is after all only natural the study of the papers on which your husband has been engaged is the only reasonable test of his sanity frankly i cannot believe that any one in lord deringhams mental state could produce any work likely to be of the slightest permanent value  the countess sighed  i suppose that i must believe you victor she said yet notwithstanding all that you say i do not know how to help youmy husband scarcely ever leaves the room he works there with a revolver by his side if he were to find a stranger near his work i believe that he would shoot him without hesitation  at night time  at night time he usually sleeps there in an anteroom and outside there is a man always watching  mr sabin looked thoughtful  it is only necessary he said for me to be in the room for about ten minutes and i do not need to carry anything away my memory will serve me for all that i require by some means or other i must have that ten minutes  you will risk your life lady deringham said for i cannot suggest any plan i would help you if i could but i am powerless  i must have that ten minutes mr sabin said slowly  must lady deringham raised her eyebrows there was a subtle change in the tone of the man a note of authority perhaps even the shadow of a threat he noted the effect and followed it up  i mean what i say constance he declared i am not asking you a great thing you have your full share of womans wit and you can arrange this if you like  but victor be reasonable she protested suggest a way yourself if you think it so easy i tell you that he never leaves the room  he must be made to leave it  by force  if necessary mr sabin answered coolly  lady deringham raised her hand to her forehead and sat thinking the mans growing earnestness bewildered her what was to be donewhat could she say after all he was not changed the old fear of him was creeping through her veins yet she made her effort  you want those papers for something more than a magazine article she declared there is something behind all this victor i cannot help you i am powerless i will take no part in anything which i cannot understand  he stood up leaning a little upon his stick the dull green stone of which flashed brightly in the firelight  you will help me he said slowly you will let me into that room at night and you will see that your husband is not there or that he does not interfere and as to that magazine article you are right what if it were a lie i do not fly at small game now do you understand  she rose to her feet and drew herself up before him proudly she towered above him handsome dignified angry  victor she said firmly i refuse you can go away at once i will have no more to say or to do with you you have given me up my letters it is true yet for that you have no special claim upon my gratitude a man of honour would have destroyed them long ago  he looked up at her and the ghost of an unholy smile flickered upon his lips  did i tell you that i had given them all back to you he said ah that was a mistake all save one i should have said one i kept in case well your sex are proverbially ungrateful you know it is the one on the yellow paper written from mentone you remember it i always liked it better than any of the others  her white hands flashed out in the firelight it seemed almost as though she must have struck him he had lied to her she was not really free he was still the master and she his slave she stood as though turned to stone  i think he said that you will listen now to a little plan which has just occurred to me will you not  she looked away from him with a shudder  what is it she asked hoarsely     chapter xxvi  mr blatherwick as st anthony   i am afraid harcutt said that either the letter was a hoax or the writer has thought better of the matter it is half an hour past the time and poor mr blatherwick is still alone  wolfenden glanced towards the distant table where his fathers secretary was already finishing his modest meal  poor old blatherwick he remarked i know hes awfully relieved hes too nervous for this sort of thing i believe he would have lost his head altogether if his mysterious correspondent had turned up  i suppose harcutt said that we may take it for granted that he is not in the room  every soul here wolfenden answered is known to me either personally or by sight the man with the dark moustache sitting by himself is a london solicitor who built himself a bungalow here four years ago and comes down every other week for golf the two men in the corner are land speculators from norwich and their neighbour is captain stoneham who rides over from the barracks twice a week also for golf  it is rather a sell for us harcutt remarked on the whole i am not sorry that i have to go back to town tonight great scott what a pretty girl  lean back you idiot wolfenden exclaimed softly dont move if you can help it  harcutt grasped the situation and obeyed at once the portion of the diningroom in which they were sitting was little more than a recess divided off from the main apartment by heavy curtains and seldom used except in the summer when visitors were plentiful mr blatherwicks table was really within a few feet of theirs but they themselves were hidden from it by a corner of the folding doors they had chosen the position with care and apparently with success  the girl who had entered the room stood for a moment looking round as though about to select a table harcutts exclamation was not without justification for she was certainly pretty she was neatly dressed in a grey walking suit and a velvet tamoshanter hat with a smart feather suddenly she saw mr blatherwick and advanced towards him with outstretched hand and a charming smile  why my dear mr blatherwick what on earth are you doing here she exclaimed have you left lord deringham  mr blatherwick rose to his feet confused and blushing to his spectacles he greeted the young lady however with evident pleasure  no that is not yet he answered i am leaving this week i did not knowi had no idea that you were in the vicinity i am very pleased to see you  she looked at the empty place at his table  i was going to have some luncheon she said i have walked so much further than i intended and i am ravenously hungry may i sit at your table  with much pleasure mr blatherwick assented i was expecting aafriend but he is evidently not coming  i will take his place then if i may she said seating herself in the chair which the waiter was holding for her and raising her veil will you order something for me i am too hungry to mind what it is  mr blatherwick gave a hesitating order and the waiter departed miss merton drew off her gloves and was perfectly at her ease  now do tell me about the friend whom you were going to meet she said smiling gaily at him i hopeyou really must not tell me mr blatherwick that it was a lady  mr blatherwick coloured to the roots of his hair at the mere suggestion and hastened to disclaim it  mymy dear miss merton he exclaimed i can assure you that it was not ii should not think of such a thing  she nodded and began to break up her roll and eat it  i am very glad to hear it mr blatherwick she said i warn you that i was prepared to be very jealous you used to tell me you know that i was the only girl with whom you cared to talk  it isquite true quite true miss merton he answered eagerly dropping his voice a little and glancing uneasily over his shoulder ii have missed you very much indeed it has been very dull  mr blatherwick sighed he was rewarded by a very kind glance from a pair of very blue eyes he fingered the wine list and began to wonder whether she would care for champagne  now tell me she said all the news how are they all at deringham hallthe dear old admiral and the countess and that remarkably silly young man lord wolfenden  wolfenden received a kick under the table and harcutts face positively beamed with delight mr blatherwick however had almost forgotten their proximity he had made up his mind to order champagne  the adadadmiral is well in health but worse mentally he answered i am leaving for that very reason i do not conceive that in fairness to myself i should continue to waste my time in work which can bring forth no fruit i trust miss merton that you agree with me  perfectly she answered gravely  the countess he continued is well but much worried there have been strange haphaphappenings at the hall since you left lord wolfenden is there by the bye miss merton he added dropping his voice i do notnotthink that you used to consider lord wolfenden so very silly when you were at deringham  it was very dull sometimeswhen you were busy mr blatherwick she answered beginning her lunch i will confess to you that i did try to amuse myself a little with lord wolfenden but he was altogether too rustictoo stupid i like a man with brains  harcutt produced a handkerchief and stuffed it to his mouth his face was slowly becoming purple with suppressed laughter mr blatherwick ordered the champagne  ii was very jealous of him he admitted almost in a whisper  the blue eyes were raised again very eloquently to his  you had no cause she said gently and mr blatherwick havent you forgotten something  mr blatherwick had sipped his glass of champagne and answered without a stutter  i have not he said forgotten you  you used to call me by my christian name  i should be delighted to call you missblanche for ever he said boldly may i  she laughed softly  well i dont quite know about that she said you may for this morning at least it is so pleasant to see you again how is the work getting on  he groaned  dont ask me please it is awful i am truly glad that i am leavingfor many reasons  have you finished copying those awful details of the defective armour plates she asked suddenly dropping her voice so that it barely reached the other side of the table  only last night he answered it was very hard work and so ridiculous it went into the box with the rest of the finished work this morning  did the admiral engage a new typewriter she inquired  he shook his head  no he says that he has nearly finished  i am so glad she said you have had no temptation to flirt then with anybody else have you  to flirtwith anybody else oh missi mean blanche do you think that i could do that  his little round face shone with sincerity and the heat of the unaccustomed wine his eyes were watering a little and his spectacles were dull the girl looked at him in amusement  i am afraid she said with a sigh that you used to flirt with me  i can assure you bbblanche he declared earnestly that i never said a word to you which ii did not honhonhonestly mean blanche i should like to ask you something  not now she interrupted hastily do you know i fancy that we must be getting too confidential that odious man with the eyeglass keeps staring at us tell me what you are going to do when you leave here you can ask mewhat you were going to afterwards  mr blatherwick grew eloquent and blanche was sympathetic it was quite half an hour before they rose and prepared to depart  i know you wont mind blanche said to him confidentially if i ask you to leave the hotel first the people i am with are a little particular and it would scarcely do you see for us to go out together  certainly he replied would you llike me to leave you herewould it be better  you might walk to the door with me please she said i am afraid you must be very disappointed that your friend did not come are you not  mr blatherwicks reply was almost incoherent in its excess of protestation they walked down the room together harcutt and wolfenden look at one another  well the former exclaimed drinking up his liqueur it is a sell  yes wolfenden agreed thoughtfully with his eyes fixed upon the two departing figures it is a sell     chapter xxvii  by chance or design   wolfenden sent his phaeton to the station with harcutt who had been summoned back to town upon important business afterwards he slipped back to the hall to wait for its return and came face to face with mr blatherwick who was starting homewards  i was looking for you wolfenden said your luncheon party turned out a little differently to anything we had expected  i am happy mr blatherwick said to be able to believe that the letter was after all a hoax there was no one in the room as you would doubtless observe likely to be in any way concerned in the matter  wolfenden knocked the ash off his cigarette without replying  you seem he remarked to be on fairly intimate terms with miss merton  we were fellow workers for several months mr blatherwick reminded him naturally we saw a good deal of one another  she is wolfenden continued a very charming girl  i consider her in every way mr blatherwick said with enthusiasm a most delightful young lady ii am very much attached to her  wolfenden laid his hand on the secretarys shoulder  blatherwick he said youre a good fellow and i like you dont be offended at what i am going to say you must not trust miss merton she is not quite what she appears to you  mr blatherwick took a step backward and flushed red with anger  i do not understand you lord wolfenden he said what do you know of miss merton  not very much wolfenden said quietly quite enough though to justify me in warning you seriously against her she is a very clever young person but i am afraid a very unscrupulous one  mr blatherwick was grave almost dignified  lord wolfenden he said you are the son of my employer but i take the liberty of telling you that you are a ll  steady blatherwick wolfenden interrupted you must not call me names  you are not speaking the truth mr blatherwick continued curbing himself with an effort i will not listen to oror permit in my presence any aspersion against that young lady  wolfenden shook his head gently  mr blatherwick he said dont be a fool you ought to know that i am not the sort of man to make evil remarks about a lady behind her back unless i knew what i was talking about i cannot at this moment prove it but i am morally convinced that miss merton came here today at the instigation of the person who wrote to you and that she only refrained from making you some offer because she knew quite well that we were within hearing  i will not listen to another word lord wolfenden mr blatherwick declared vigorously if you are honest you are cruelly misjudging that young lady if not you must know yourself the proper epithet to be applied to the person who defames an innocent girl behind her back i wish you good afternoon sir i shall leave deringham hall tomorrow  he strode away and wolfenden watched him with a faint regretful smile upon his lips then he turned round suddenly a little trill of soft musical laughter came floating out from a recess in the darkest corner of the hall miss merton was leaning back amongst the cushions of a lounge her eyes gleaming with amusement she beckoned wolfenden to her  quite melodramatic wasnt it she exclaimed moving her skirts for him to sit by her side dear little man do you know he wants to marry me  what a clever girl you are wolfenden remarked really youd make an admirable wife for him  she pouted a little  thank you very much she said i am not contemplating making any one an admirable wife matrimony does not attract me at all  i dont know what pleasure you can find in making a fool of a decent little chap like that he said its too bad of you blanche  one must amuse oneself and he is so odd and so very much in earnest  of course wolfenden continued i know that you had another object  had i  you came here to try and tempt the poor little fellow with a thousand pounds  i have never she interposed calmly possessed a thousand shillings in my life  not on your own account of course you came on behalf of your employer mr sabin or some one behind him what is this devilry blanche  she looked at him out of wideopen eyes but she made no answer  so far as i can see he remarked i must confess that foolery seems a better term i cannot imagine anything in my fathers work worth the concoction of any elaborate scheme to steal but never mind that there is a scheme and you are in it now i will make a proposition to you it is a matter of money i suppose will you name your terms to come over to my side  a look crept into her eyes which puzzled him  over to your side she repeated thoughtfully do you mind telling me exactly what you mean by that  as though by accident the delicate white hand from which she had just withdrawn her glove touched his and remained there as though inviting his clasp she looked quickly up at him and drooped her eyes wolfenden took her hand patted it kindly and replaced it in her lap  look here blanche he said i wont affect to misunderstand you but havent you learnt by this time that adventures are not in my wayless now than at any time perhaps  she was watching his face and read its expression with lightninglike truth  bah she said there is no man who would be so brutal as you unless  unless what  he were in love with another girl  perhaps i am blanche  i know that you are  he looked at her quickly  but you do not know with whom  she had not guessed but she knew now  i think so she said it is with the beautiful niece of mr sabin you have admirable taste  never mind about that he said let us come to my offer i will give you a hundred a year for life settle it upon you if you will tell me everything  a hundred a year she repeated is that much money  well it will cost more than two thousand pound he said still i would like you to have it and you shall if you will be quite frank with me  she hesitated  i should like she said to think it over till tomorrow morning it will be better for supposing i decide to accept i shall know a good deal more of this than i know now  very well he said only i should strongly advise you to accept  one hundred a year she repeated thoughtfully perhaps you will have changed your mind by tomorrow  there is no fear of it he assured her quietly  write it down she said i think that i shall agree  dont you trust me blanche  it is a business transaction she said coolly you have made it one yourself  he tore a sheet from his pocketbook and scribbled a few lines upon it  will that do he asked her  she read it through and folded it carefully up  it will do very nicely she said with a quiet smile and now i must go back as quickly as i can  they walked to the hall door lord wolfendens carriage had come back from the station and was waiting for him  how are you going he asked  she shook her head  i must hire something i suppose she said what beautiful horses do you see hector remembers me quite well i used to take bread to him in the stable when i was at deringham hall good old man  she patted the horses neck wolfenden did not like it but he had no alternative  wont you allow me to give you a lift he said with a marked absence of cordiality in his tone or if you would prefer it i can easily order a carriage from the hotel  oh i would much rather go with you if you really dont mind she said may i really  i shall be very pleased he answered untruthfully i ought perhaps to tell you that the horses are very fresh and dont go well together they have a nasty habit of running away down hill  she smiled cheerfully and lifting her skirts placed a dainty little foot upon the step  i detest quiet horses she said and i have been used to being run away with all my life i rather like it  wolfenden resigned himself to the inevitable he took the reins and they rattled off towards deringham about halfway there they saw a little black figure away on the cliff path to the right  it is mr blatherwick wolfenden said pointing with his whip poor little chap i wish youd leave him alone blanche  on one condition she said smiling up at him i will  it is granted already he declared  that you let me drive for just a mile  he handed her the reins at once and changed seats from the moment she took them he could see that she was an accomplished whip he leaned back and lit a cigarette  blatherwicks salvation he remarked has been easily purchased  she smiled rather curiously but did not reply a hired carriage was coming towards them and her eyes were fixed upon it in a moment they swept past and wolfenden was conscious of a most unpleasant sensation it was helène whose dark eyes were glancing from the girl to him in cold surprise and mr sabin who was leaning back by her side wrapped in a huge fur coat blanche looked down at him innocently  fancy meeting them she remarked touching hector with the whip it does not matter does it you look dreadfully cross  wolfenden muttered some indefinite reply and threw his cigarette savagely into the road after all he was not so sure that mr blatherwicks salvation had been cheaply won     chapter xxviii  a midnight visitor   wolf wolf  wolfenden to whom sleep before the early morning hours was a thing absolutely impossible was lounging in his easy chair meditating on the events of the day over a final cigarette he had come to his room at midnight in rather a dejected frame of mind the days happenings had scarcely gone in his favour helène had looked upon him coldlyalmost with suspicion in the morning he would be able to explain everything but in the meantime blanche was upon the spot and he had an uneasy feeling that the girl was his enemy he had begun to doubt whether that drive so natural a thing as it really happened was not carefully planned on her part with a full knowledge of the fact that they would meet mr sabin and his niece it was all the more irritating because during the last few days he had been gradually growing into the belief that so far as his suit with helène was concerned the girl herself was not altogether indifferent to him she had refused him definitely enough so far as mere words went but there were lights in her soft dark eyes and something indefinable but apparent in her manner which had forbidden him to abandon all hope yet it was hard to believe that she was in any way subject to the will of her guardian mr sabin in small things she took no pains to study him she was evidently not in the least under his dominion on the contrary there was in his manner towards her a certain deference as though it were she whose will was the ruling one between them as a matter of fact her appearance and whole bearing seemed to indicate one accustomed to command her family or connections she had never spoken of to him yet he had not the slightest doubt but that she was of gentle birth even if it should turn out that this was not the case wolfenden was democratic enough to think that it made no difference she was good enough to be his wife her appearance and manners were almost typically aristocraticwhatever there might be in her present surroundings or in her past which savoured of mystery he would at least have staked his soul upon her honesty he realised very fully as he sat there smoking in the early hours of the morning that this was no passing fancy of his she was his first lovefor good or for evil she would be his last failure he said to himself was a word which he would not admit in his vocabulary she was moving towards him already some day she should be his through the mists of blue tobacco smoke which hovered around him he seemed with a very slight and very pleasant effort of his imagination to see some faint visions of her in that more softening mood the vaguest recollection of which set his heart beating fast and sent the blood moving through his veins to music how delicately handsome she was how exquisite the lines of her girlish yet graceful and queenly figure with her clear creamy skin soft as alabaster below the red gold of her hair the somewhat haughty poise of her small shapely head she brought him vivid recollections of that old aristocracy of france as one reads of them now only in the pages of romance or history she had the grand aireven the great queen could not have walked to the scaffold with a more magnificent contempt of the rabble whose victim she was some more personal thought came to him he half closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair steeped in pleasant thoughts and then it all came to a swift abrupt end these reveries and pleasant castlebuilding he was back in the present suddenly recalled in a most extraordinary manner to realisation of the hour and place surely he could not have been mistaken that was a low knocking at his locked door outside there was no doubt about it there it was again he heard his own name softly but unmistakably spoken in a trembling voice he glanced at his watch it was between two and three oclock then he walked quickly to the door and opened it without hesitation it was his father who stood there fully dressed with pale face and angrily burning eyes in his hand he carried a revolver wolfenden noticed that the fingers which clasped it were shaking as though with cold  father wolfenden exclaimed what on earth is the matter  he dropped his voice in obedience to that sudden gesture for silence the admiral answered him in a hoarse whisper  a great deal is the matter i am being deceived and betrayed in my own house listen  they stood together on the dimly lit landing holding his breath and listening intently wolfenden was at once aware of faint distant sounds they came from the ground floor almost immediately below them his father laid his hand heavily upon wolfendens shoulder  some one is in the library he said i heard the door open distinctly when i tried to get out i found that the door of my room was locked there is treachery here  how did you get out wolfenden asked  through the bathroom and down the back stairs that door was locked too but i found a key that fitted it come with me be careful make no noise  they were on their way downstairs now as they turned the angle of the broad oak stairway wolfenden caught a glimpse of his fathers face and shuddered it was very white and his eyes were bloodshot and wild his forefinger was already upon the trigger of his revolver  let me have that wolfenden whispered touching it my hand is steadier than yours  but the admiral shook his head he made no answer in words but the butt end of the revolver became almost welded into the palm of his hand wolfenden began to feel that they were on the threshold of a tragedy they had reached the ground floor now straight in front of them was the library door the sound of muffled movements within the room was distinctly audible the admirals breath came fast  tread lightly wolf he muttered dont let them hear us let us catch them redhanded  but the last dozen yards of the way was over white flags tesselated and polished like marble wolfendens shoes creaked the admirals tiptoe walk was no light one there was a sudden cessation of all sounds they had been heard the admiral with a low cry of rage leaped forwards wolfenden followed close behind  even as they crossed the threshold the room was plunged into sudden darkness they had but a momentary and partial glimpse of the interior wolfenden saw a dark slim figure bending forward with his finger still pressed to the ball of the lamp the table was strewn with papers somethingsomebodywas fluttering behind the screen yonder there was barely a second of light then with a sharp click the lamp went out and the figure of the man was lost in obscurity almost simultaneously there came a flash of level fire and the loud report of the admirals revolver there was no groan so wolfenden concluded that the man whoever he might be had not been hit the sound of the report was followed by a few seconds breathless silence there was no movement of any sort in the room only a faint breeze stealing in through the wideopen windows caused a gentle rustling of the papers with which the table was strewn and the curtains swayed gently backwards and forwards the admiral with his senses all on the alert stood motionless the revolver tense in his hand his fiercely eager eyes straining to pierce the darkness by his side wolfenden equally agitated now though from a different reason stood holding his breath his head thrust forward his eyes striving to penetrate the veil of gloom which lay like a thick barrier between him and the screen his fear had suddenly taken to itself a very real and terrible form there had been a moment before the extinction of the lamp had plunged the room into darkness when he had seen or fancied that he had seen a womans skirts fluttering there up to the present his fathers attention had been wholly riveted upon the other end of the room yet he was filled with a nervous dread lest at any moment that revolver might change its direction his ears were strained to the uttermost to catch the slightest sign of any movement  at last the silence was broken there was a faint movement near the window and then again without a seconds hesitation there was that level line of fire and loud report from the admirals revolver there was no groan no sign of any one having been hit the admiral began to move slowly in the direction of the window wolfenden remained where he was listening intently he was right there was a smothered movement from behind the screen some one was moving from there towards the door some one with light footsteps and a trailing skirt he drew back into the doorway he meant to let her pass whoever it might be but he meant to know who it was he could hear her hurried breathing a faint familiar perfume shaken out by the movement of her skirts puzzled him its very familiarity bewildered him she knew that he was there she must know it for she had paused the position was terribly critical a few yards away the admiral was groping about revolver in hand mumbling to himself a string of terrible threats the casting of a shadow would call forth that deathdealing fire wolfenden thrust out his hand cautiously it fell upon a womans arm she did not cry out although her rapid breathing sank almost to a moan for a moment he was staggeredthe room seemed to be going round with him he had to bite his lips to stifle the exclamation which very nearly escaped him then he stood away from the door with a little shudder and guided her through it he heard her footsteps die away along the corridor with a peculiar sense of relief then he thrust his hand into the pocket of his dinner coat and drew out a box of matches  i am going to strike a light he whispered in his fathers ear  quick then was the reply i dont think the fellow has got away yet he must be hiding behind some of the furniture  there was the scratching of a match upon a silver box a feeble flame gradually developing into a sure illumination wolfenden carefully lit the lamp and raised it high over his head the room was empty there was no doubt about it they two were alone but the window was wide open and a chair in front of it had been thrown over the admiral strode to the casement and called out angrily  heggs are you there is no one on duty  there was no answer the tall sentrybox was empty  wolfenden came over to his fathers side and brought the lamp with him and together they leaned out at first they could see nothing then wolfenden threw off the shade from the lamp and the light fell in a broad track upon a dark motionless figure stretched out upon the turf wolfenden stooped down hastily  my god he exclaimed it is heggs father wont you sound the gong we shall have to arouse the house  there was no need already the library was half full of hastily dressed servants awakened by the sound of the admirals revolver pale and terrified but never more selfcomposed lady deringham stepped out to them in a long white dressinggown  what has happened she cried who is it wolfendenhas your father shot any one  but wolfenden shook his head as he stood for a moment upright and looked into his mothers face  there is a man hurt he said it is heggs i think but he is not shot the evil is not of our doing     chapter xxix  it was mr sabin   it was still an hour or two before dawn no trace whatever of the marauders had been discovered either outside the house or within with difficulty the earl had been persuaded to relinquish his smoking revolver and had retired to his room the doors had all been locked and two of the most trustworthy servants left in charge of the library wolfenden had himself accompanied his father upstairs and after a few words with him had returned to his own apartment with his mother he had scarcely exchanged a single sentence once their eyes had met and he had immediately looked away nevertheless he was not altogether unprepared for that gentle knocking at his door which came about half an hour after the house was once more silent  he rose at once from his chairit seemed scarcely a night for sleepand opened it cautiously it was lady deringham who stood there white and trembling he held out his hand and she leaned heavily on it during her passage into the room  he wheeled his own easy chair before the fire and helped her into it she seemed altogether incapable of speech she was trembling violently and her face was perfectly bloodless wolfenden dropped on his knees by her side and began chafing her hands the touch of his fingers seemed to revive her she was not already judged then she lifted her eyes and looked at him sorrowfully  what do you think of me wolfenden she asked  i have not thought about it at all he answered i am only wondering you have come to explain everything  she shuddered explain everything that was a task indeed when the heart is young and life is a full and generous thing in the days of romance when adventures and lovemaking come as a natural heritage and form part of the order of things then the words which the woman had to say would have come lightly enough from her lips less perhaps as a confession than as a half apologetic narration but in the days when youth lies far behind when its glamour has faded away and nothing but the bare incidents remain unbeautified by the full colouring and exuberance of the springtime of life the most trifling indiscretions then stand out like idiotic crimes lady deringham had been a proud womana proud woman all her life she had borne in society the reputation of an almost ultraexclusiveness in her home life she had been something of an autocrat perhaps this was the most miserable moment of her life her son was looking at her with cold inquiring eyes she was on her defence before him she bowed her head and spoke  tell me what you thought wolfenden  forgive me he said i could only think that there was robbery and that you for some sufficient reason i am sure were aiding i could not think anything else could i  you thought what was true wolfenden she whispered i was helping another man to rob your father it was only a very trifling thefta handful of notes from his work for a magazine article but it was theft and i was an accomplice  there was a short silence her eyes seeking steadfastly to read his face could make nothing of it  i will not ask you why he said slowly you must have had very good reasons but i want to tell you one thing i am beginning to have grave doubts as to whether my fathers state is really so bad as dr whitlett thinkswhether in short his work is not after all really of some considerable value there are several considerations which incline me to take this view  the suggestion visibly disturbed lady deringham she moved in her chair uneasily  you have heard what mr blatherwick says she objected i am sure that he is absolutely trustworthy  there is no doubt about blatherwicks honesty he admitted but the admiral himself says that he dare trust no one and that for weeks he has given him no paper of importance to work upon simply for that reason it has been growing upon me that we may have been mistaken all along that very likely miss merton was paid to steal his work and that it may possess for certain people and for certain purposes a real technical importance how else can we account for the deliberate efforts which have been made to obtain possession of it  you have spent some time examining it yourself she said in a low tone what was your own opinion  i found some sheets he answered and i read them very carefully they were connected with the various landingplaces upon the suffolk coast an immense amount of detail was very clearly given the currents bays and fortifications were all set out even the roads and railways into the interior were dealt with i compared them afterwards with a map of suffolk they were so far as one could judge correct of course this was only a page or two at random but i must say it made an impression upon me  there was another silence this time longer than before lady deringham was thinking once more then the man had lied to her he was on some secret business of his own she shuddered slightly she had no curiosity as to its nature only she remembered what many people had told her that where he went disaster followed a piece of coal fell into the grate hissing from the fire he stooped to pick it up and catching a glimpse of her face became instantly graver he remembered that as yet he had heard nothing of what she had come to tell him her presence in the library was altogether unexplained  you were very good she said slowly you stayed what might have been a tragedy you knew that i was there you helped me to escape yet you must have known that i was in league with the man who was trying to steal those papers  there was no mistake then you were doing that you  it is true she answered it was i who let him in who unlocked your fathers desk i was his accomplice  who was the man  she did not tell him at once  he was once she said my lover  before  before i met your father we were never really engaged but he loved me and i thought i cared for him i wrote him lettersthe foolish letters of an impulsive girl these he has kept i treated him badly i know that but i too have suffered it has been the desire of my life to have those letters last night he called here before my face he burnt all but one that he kept the price of his returning it to me was my helplast night  for what purpose wolfenden asked what use did he propose to make of the admirals papers if he succeeded in stealing them  she shook her head mournfully  i cannot tell he answered me at first that he simply needed some statistics to complete a magazine article and that mr c himself had sent him here if what you tell me of their importance is true i have no doubt that he lied  why could he not go to the admiral himself  lady deringhams face was as pale as death and she spoke with downcast head her eyes fixed upon her clenched hands  at cairo she said not long after my marriage we all met i was indiscreet and your father was hotheaded and jealous they quarrelled and fought your father wounded him he fired in the air you understand now that he could not go direct to the admiral  i cannot understand he admitted why you listened to his proposal  wolfenden i wanted that letter she said her voice dying away in something like a moan it is not that i have anything more than folly to reproach myself with but it was writtenit was the only oneafter my marriage just at first i was not very happy with your father we had had a quarrel i forget what about and i sat down and wrote words which i have many a time bitterly repented ever having put on paper i have never forgotten themi never shall i have seen them often in my happiest moments and they have seemed to me to be written with letters of fire  you have it back now you have destroyed it  she shook her head wearily  no i was to have had it when he had succeeded i had not let him in five minutes when you disturbed us  tell me the mans name  why  i will get you the letter  he would not give it you you could not make him  wolfendens eyes flashed with a sudden fire  you are mistaken he said the man who holds for blackmail over a womans head a letter written twenty years ago is a scoundrel i will get that letter from him tell me his name  lady deringham shuddered  wolfenden it would bring trouble he is dangerous dont ask me at least i have kept my word to him it was not my fault that we were disturbed he will not molest me now  mother i will know his name  i cannot tell it you  then i will find it out it will not be difficult i will put the whole matter in the hands of the police i shall send to scotland yard for a detective there are marks underneath the window i picked up a mans glove upon the library floor a clever fellow will find enough to work upon i will find this blackguard for myself and the law shall deal with him as he deserves  wolfenden have mercy may i not know best are my wishes my prayers nothing to you  a great deal mother yet i consider myself also a judge as to the wisest course to pursue the plan which i have suggested may clear up many things it may bring to light the real object of this man it may solve the mystery of that impostor wilmot i am tired of all this uncertainty we will have some daylight i shall telegraph tomorrow morning to scotland yard  wolfenden i beseech you  so also do i beseech you mother to tell me that mans name great heavens  wolfenden sprang suddenly from his chair with startled face an idea slow of coming but absolutely convincing from its first conception had suddenly flashed home to him how could he have been so blind he stood looking at his mother in fixed suspense the light of his knowledge was in his face and she saw it she had been dreading this all the while  it was mr sabinthe man who calls himself sabin  a little moan of despair crept out from her lips she covered her face with her hands and sobbed     chapter xxx  the gathering of the warstorm   mr sabin entering his breakfastroom as usual at ten oclock on the following morning found besides the usual pile of newspapers and letters a telegram which had arrived too late for delivery on the previous evening he opened it in leisurely fashion whilst he sipped his coffee it was handed in at the charing cross post office and was signed simply k       just returned when can you call and conclude arrangements am      anxious to see you read tonights paperk  the telegram slipped from mr sabins fingers he tore open the st jamess gazette and a little exclamation escaped from his lips as he saw the thick black type which headed the principal columns       extraordinary telegram of the german      emperor to moenig      german sympathy with the rebels      warships ordered to delamere bay      great excitement on the stock exchange  mr sabins breakfast remained untasted he read every word in the four columns and then turned to the other newspapers they were all ablaze with the news englands most renowned ally had turned suddenly against her without the slightest warning the firebrand of war had been kindled and waved threateningly in our very faces the occasion was hopelessly insignificant a handful of english adventurers engaged in a somewhat rash but plucky expedition in a distant part of the world had met with a sharp reverse in itself the affair was nothing yet it bade fair to become a matter of international history illadvised though they may have been the englishmen carried with them a charter granted by the british government there was no secret about itthe fact was perfectly understood in every cabinet of europe yet the german emperor had himself written a telegram congratulating the state which had repelled the threatened attack it was scarcely an invasionit was little more than a demonstration on the part of an illtreated section of the population the fact that german interests were in no way concernedthat any outside interference was simply a piece of gratuitous impertinenceonly intensified the significance of the incident a deliberate insult had been offered to england and the man who sat there with the paper clenched in his hand whilst his keen eyes devoured the long columns of wonder and indignation knew that his had been the hand which had hastened the longpentup storm he drew a little breath when he had finished and turned to his breakfast  is miss sabin up yet he asked the servant who waited upon him  the man was not certain but withdrew to inquire he reappeared almost directly miss sabin had been up for more than an hour she had just returned from a walk and had ordered breakfast to be served in her room  tell her mr sabin directed that i should be exceedingly obliged if she would take her coffee with me i have some interesting news  the man was absent for several minutes before he returned helène came in mr sabin greeted her with his usual courtesy and even more than his usual cordiality  you are missing the best part of the morning with your continental habits she exclaimed brightly i have been out on the cliffs since halfpast eight the air is delightful  she threw off her hat and going to the sideboard helped herself to a cup of coffee there was a becoming flush upon her cheeksher hair was a little tossed by the wind mr sabin watched her curiously  you have not i suppose seen a morning paperor rather last nights paper he remarked  she shook her head  a newspaper you know that i never look at an english one she answered you wanted to see me reynolds said is there any news  there is great news he answered there is such news that by sunset today war will probably be declared between england and germany  the flush died out of her cheeks she faced him pallid to the lips  it is not possible she exclaimed  so the whole world would have declared a week ago as a matter of fact it is not so sudden as we imagine the storm has been long brewing it is we who have been blind a little black spot of irritation has spread and deepened into a warcloud  this will affect us she asked  for us he answered it is a triumph it is the end of our schemes the climax of our desires when knigenstein came to me i knew that he was in earnest but i never dreamed that the torch was so nearly kindled i see now why he was so eager to make terms with me  and you she said you have their bond  for a moment he looked thoughtful  not yet i have their promisethe promise of the emperor himself but as yet my share of the bargain is incomplete there must be no more delay it must be finished nowat once that telegram would never have been sent from berlin but for their covenant with me it would have been better perhaps had they waited a little time but one cannot tell the opportunity was too good to let slip  how long will it be she asked before your work is complete  his face clouded over in the greater triumph he had almost forgotten the minor difficulties of the present he was a diplomatist and a schemer of european fame he had planned great things and had accomplished them success had been on his side so long that he might almost have been excused for declining to reckon failure amongst the possibilities the difficulty which was before him now was as trifling as the uprooting of a hazel switch after the conquest of a forest of oaks but none the less for the moment he was perplexed it was hard in the face of this need for urgent haste to decide upon the next step  my work he said slowly must be accomplished at once there is very little wanted yet that little i must confess troubles me  you have not succeeded then in obtaining what you want from lord deringham  no  will he not help you at all  never  how then do you mean to get at these papers of his  at present he replied i scarcely know in an hour or two i may be able to tell you it is possible that it might take me twentyfour hours certainly no longer than that  she walked to the window and stood there with her hands clasped behind her back mr sabin had lit a cigarette and was smoking it thoughtfully  presently she spoke to him  you will get them she said yes i believe that in the end you will succeed as you have succeeded in everything  there was a lack of enthusiasm in her tone he looked up quietly and flicked the ash from the end of his cigarette  you are right he said i shall succeed my only regret is that i have made a slight miscalculation it will take longer than i imagined knigenstein will be in a fever and i am afraid that he will worry me at the same time he is himself to blame he has been needlessly precipitate  she turned away from the window and stood before him she had a look in her face which he had seen there but once before and the memory of which had ever since troubled him  i want you she said to understand this i will not have any direct harm worked upon the deringhams if you can get what they have and what is necessary to us by craftwell very good if not it must go i will not have force used you should remember that lord wolfenden saved your life i will have nothing to do with any scheme which brings harm upon them  he looked at her steadily a small spot of colour was burning high up on his pallid cheeks the white slender fingers toying carelessly with one of the breakfast appointments were shaking he was very near being passionately angry  do you mean he said speaking slowly and enunciating every word with careful distinctness do you mean that you would sacrifice or even endanger the greatest cause which has ever been conceived in the heart of the patriot to the whole skin of a household of english people i wonder whether you realise the position as it stands at this moment i am bound in justice to you to believe that you do not do you realise that germany has closed with our offer and will act at our behest that only a few trifling sheets of paper stand between us and the fullest the most glorious success is it a time do you think for scruples or for maudlin sentiment if i were to fail in my obligations towards knigenstein i should not only be dishonoured and disgraced but our cause would be lost for ever the work of many years would crumble into ashes my own life would not be worth an hours purchase helène you are mad you are either mad or worse  she faced him quite unmoved it was more than ever apparent that she was not amongst those who feared him  i am perfectly sane she said and i am very much in earnest ours shall be a strategic victory or we will not triumph at all i believe that you are planning some desperate means of securing those papers i repeat that i will not have it  he looked at her with curling lips  perhaps he said it is i who have gone mad at least i can scarcely believe that i am not dreaming is it really you helène of bourbon the descendant of kings a daughter of the rulers of france who falters and turns pale at the idea of a little blood shed for her countrys sake i am very much afraid he added with biting sarcasm that i have not understood you you bear the name of a great queen but you have the heart of a servingmaid it is lord wolfenden for whom you fear  she was not less firm but her composure was affected the rich colour streamed into her cheeks she remained silent  for a betrothed young lady he said slowly you will forgive me if i say that your anxiety is scarcely discreet what you require i suppose is a safe conduct for your lover i wonder how henri would  she flashed a glance and an interjection upon him which checked the words upon his lips the gesture was almost a royal one he was silenced  how dare you sir she exclaimed you are taking insufferable liberties i do not permit you to interfere in my private concerns understand that even if your words were true if i choose to have a lover it is my affair not yours as for henri what has he to complain of read the papers and ask yourself that they chronicle his doings freely enough he is singularly discreet is he notsingularly faithful  she threw at him a glance of contempt and turned as though to leave the room mr sabin recognising the fact that the situation was becoming dangerous permitted himself no longer the luxury of displaying his anger he was quite himself again calm judicial incisive  dont go away please he said i am sorry that you have read those reportsmore than sorry that you should have attached any particular credence to them as you know the newspapers always exaggerate in many of the stories which they tell i do not believe that there is a single word of truth but i will admit that henri has not been altogether discreet yet he is young and there are many excuses to be made for him apart from that the whole question of his behaviour is beside the question your marriage with him was never intended to be one of affection he is well enough in his way but there is not the stuff in him to make a man worthy of your love your alliance with him is simply a necessary link in the chain of our great undertaking between you you will represent the two royal families of france that is what is necessary you must marry him but afterwardswell you will be a queen  again he had erred she looked at him with bent brows and kindling eyes  oh you are hideously cynical she exclaimed i may be ambitious but it is for my countrys sake if i reign the court of france shall be of a new type we will at least show the world that to be a frenchwoman is not necessarily to abjure morals  he shrugged his shoulders  that he said will be as you choose you will make your court what you please personally i believe that you are right such sentiments as you have expressed properly conveyed to them would make yours abjectly half the bourgeois of france be as ambitious as you please but at least be sensible do not think any more of this young englishman not at any rate at present nothing but harm can come of it he is not like the men of our own country who know how to take a ladys dismissal gracefully  he is at least a man  helène why should we discuss him he shall come to no harm at my hands be wise and forget him he can be nothing whatever to you you know that you are pledged to greater things  she moved back to her place by the window her eyes were suddenly soft her face was sorrowful she did not speak and he feared her silence more than her indignation when a knock at the door came he was grateful for the interruptiongrateful that is until he saw who it was upon the threshold then he started to his feet with a little exclamation  lord wolfenden you are an early visitor  wolfenden smiled grimly and advanced into the room  i was anxious he said to run no risk of finding you out my mission is not altogether a pleasant one     chapter xxxi  i make no promise   a single glance from mr sabin into wolfendens face was sufficient under his breath he swore a small quiet oath wolfendens appearance was unlooked for and almost fatal yet that did not prevent him from greeting his visitor with his usual ineffusive but well bred courtesy  i am finishing a late breakfast he remarked can i offer you anythinga glass of claret or benedictine  wolfenden scarcely heard him and answered altogether at random he had suddenly become aware that helène was in the room she was coming towards him from the window recess with a brilliant smile upon her lips  how very kind of you to look us up so early she exclaimed  mr sabin smiled grimly as he poured himself out a liqueur and lit a cigarette he was perfectly well aware that wolfendens visit was not one of courtesy a single glance into his face had told him all that he cared to know it was fortunate that helène had been in the room every moments respite he gained was precious  have you come to ask me to go for a drive in that wonderful vehicle she said lightly pointing out of the window to where his dogcart was waiting i should want a stepladder to mount it  wolfenden answered her gravely  i should feel very honoured at being allowed to take you for a drive at any time he said only i think that i would rather bring a more comfortable carriage  she shrugged her shoulders and looked at him significantly  the one you were driving yesterday  he bit his lip and frowned with vexation yet on the whole perhaps he did not regret her allusion it was proof that she had not taken the affair too seriously  the one i was driving yesterday would be a great deal more comfortable he said today i only thought of getting here quickly i have a little business with mr sabin  is that a hint for me to go she asked you are not agreeable this morning what possible business can you have with my uncle which does not include me i am not inclined to go away i shall stay and listen  mr sabin smiled faintly the girl was showing her sense now at any rate wolfenden was obviously embarrassed helène remained blandly unconscious of anything serious  i suppose she said that you want to talk golf again golf why one hears nothing else but golf down here dont you ever shoot or ride for a change  wolfenden was suddenly assailed by an horrible suspicion he could scarcely believe that her unconsciousness was altogether natural at the bare suspicion of her being in league with this man he stiffened he answered without looking at her conscious though he was that her dark eyes were seeking his invitingly and that her lips were curving into a smile  i am not thinking of playing golf today he said unfortunately i have less pleasant things to consider if you could give me five minutes mr sabin he added i should be very glad  she rose immediately with all the appearance of being genuinely offended there was a little flush in her cheeks and she walked straight to the door wolfenden held it open for her  i am exceedingly sorry to have been in the way for a moment she said pray proceed with your business at once  wolfenden did not answer her as she passed through the doorway she glanced up at him he was not even looking at her his eyes were fixed upon mr sabin the fingers which rested upon the door knob seemed twitching with impatience to close it she stood quite still for a moment the colour left her cheeks and her eyes grew soft she was not angry any longer instinctively some idea of the truth flashed in upon her she passed out thoughtfully wolfenden closed the door and turned to mr sabin  you can easily imagine the nature of my business he said coldly i have come to have an explanation with you  mr sabin lit a fresh cigarette and smiled on wolfenden thoughtfully  certainly he said an explanation exactly  well said wolfenden suppose you commence then  mr sabin looked puzzled  had you not better be a little more explicit he suggested gently  i will be wolfenden replied as explicit as you choose my mother has given me her whole confidence i have come to ask how you dare to enter deringham hall as a common burglar attempting to commit a theft and to demand that you instantly return to me a letter on which you have attempted to levy blackmail is that explicit enough  mr sabins face did not darken nor did he seem in any way angry or discomposed he puffed at his cigarette for a moment or two and then looked blandly across at his visitor  you are talking rubbish he said in his usual calm even tones but you are scarcely to blame it is altogether my own fault it is quite true that i was in your house last night but it was at your mothers invitation and i should very much have preferred coming openly at the usual time to sneaking in according to her directions through a window it was only a very small favour i asked but lady deringham persuaded me that your fathers mental health and antipathy to strangers was such that he would never give me the information i desired voluntarily and it was entirely at her suggestion that i adopted the means i did i am very sorry indeed that i allowed myself to be overpersuaded and placed in an undoubtedly false position women are always nervous and imaginative and i am convinced that if i had gone openly to your father and laid my case before him he would have helped me  he would have done nothing of the sort wolfenden declared nothing would induce him to show even a portion of his work to a stranger  mr sabin shrugged his shoulders gently and continued without heeding the interruption  as to my blackmailing lady deringham you have spoken plainly to me and you must forgive me for answering you in the same fashion it is a lie i had letters of hers which i voluntarily destroyed in her presence they were only a little foolish or i should have destroyed them long ago i had the misfortune to be once a favoured suitor for your mothers hand and i think i may venture to sayi am sure she will not contradict methat i was hardly treated the only letter i ever had from her likely to do her the least harm i destroyed fifteen years ago when i first embarked upon what has been to a certain extent a career of adventure i told her that it was not in the packet which we burnt together yesterday if she understood from that that it was still in my possession and that i was retaining it for any purpose whatever she was grievously mistaken in my words that is all i have to say  he had said it very well indeed wolfenden listening intently to every word with his eyes rigidly fixed upon the mans countenance could not detect a single false note anywhere he was puzzled perhaps his mother had been nervously excited and had mistaken some sentence of his for a covert threat yet he thought of her earnestness her terrible earnestness and a sense of positive bewilderment crept over him  we will leave my mother out of the question then he said we will deal with this matter between ourselves i should like to know exactly what part of my fathers work you are so anxious to avail yourself of and for what purpose  mr sabin drew a letter from his pocket and handed it over to wolfenden it was from the office of one of the first european reviews and briefly contained a request that mr sabin would favour them with an article on the comparative naval strengths of european powers with particular reference to the armament and coast defences of great britain wolfenden read it carefully and passed it back the letter was genuine there was no doubt about that  it seemed to me mr sabin continued the most natural thing in the world to consult your father upon certain matters concerning which he is or has been a celebrated authority in fact i decided to do so at the instigation of one of the lords of your admiralty to whom he is personally well known i had no idea of acting except in the most open manner and i called at deringham hall yesterday afternoon and sent in my card in a perfectly orthodox way as you may have heard your mother took quite an unexpected view of the whole affair owing partly to your fathers unfortunate state of health and partly to some extraordinary attempts which i am given to understand have been made to rob him of his work she was very anxious to help me but insisted that it must be secretly last nights business was i admit a ghastly mistakeonly it was not my mistake i yielded to lady deringhams proposals under strong protest as a man i think i may say of some intelligence i am ashamed of the whole affair at the same time i am guilty only of an indiscretion which was sanctioned and instigated by your mother i really do not see how i can take any blame to myself in the matter  you could scarcely attribute to lady deringham wolfenden remarked the injury to the watchman  i can take but little blame to myself mr sabin answered promptly the man was drunk he had been i imagine made drunk and i merely pushed him out of the way he fell heavily but the fault was not mine look at my physique and remember that i was unarmed and ask yourself what mischief i could possibly have done to the fellow  wolfenden reflected  you appear to be anxious he said to convince me that your desire to gain access to a portion of my fathers papers is a harmless one i should like to ask you why you have in your employ a young lady who was dismissed from deringham hall under circumstances of strong suspicion  mr sabin raised his eyebrows  it is the first time i have heard of anything suspicious connected with miss merton he said she came into my service with excellent testimonials and i engaged her at willings bureau the fact that she had been employed at deringham hall was merely a coincidence  was it also a coincidence wolfenden continued that in reply to a letter attempting to bribe my fathers secretary mr blatherwick it was she miss merton who kept an appointment with him  that mr sabin answered i know nothing of if you wish to question miss merton you are quite at liberty to do so i will send for her  wolfenden shook his head  miss merton was far too clever to commit herself he said she knew from the first that she was being watched and behaved accordingly if she was not there as your agent her position becomes more extraordinary still  i can assure you mr sabin said with an air of weariness that i am not the man of mystery you seem to think me i should never dream of employing such roundabout means for gaining possession of a few statistics  wolfenden was silent his case was altogether one of surmises he could prove nothing  perhaps he said i have been precipitate it would appear so but if i am unduly suspicious you have yourself only to blame you admit that your name is an assumed one you refuse my suit to your niece without any reasonable cause you are evidently to be frank a person of much more importance than you lay claim to be now be open with me if there is any reason although i cannot conceive an honest one for concealing your identity why i will respect your confidence absolutely you may rely upon that tell me who you are and who your niece is and why you are travelling about in this mysterious way  mr sabin smiled goodhumouredly  well he said you must forgive me if i plead guilty to the false identityand preserve it for certain reasons it would not suit me to take even you into my confidence besides which if you will forgive my saying so there does not seem to be the least necessity for it we are leaving here during the week and shall in all probability go abroad almost at once so we are not likely to meet again let us part pleasantly and abandon a somewhat profitless discussion  for a moment wolfenden was staggered they were leaving england going away that meant that he would see no more of helène his indignation against the man kindled almost into passionate anger by his mothers story was forgotten overshadowed by a keen thrill of personal disappointment if they were really leaving england he might bid farewell to any chance of winning her and there were certain words of hers certain gestures which had combined to fan that little flame of hope which nothing as yet had ever been able to extinguish he looked into mr sabins quiet face and he was conscious of a sense of helplessness the man was too strong and too wily for him it was an unequal contest  we will abandon the discussion then if you will wolfenden said slowly i will talk with lady deringham again she is in an extremely nervous state it is possible of course that she may have misunderstood you  mr sabin sighed with an air of gentle relief ah if the men of other countries were only as easy to delude as these englishmen what a triumphant career might yet be his  i am very glad he said that you do me the honour to take what i can assure you is the correct view of the situation i hope that you will not hurry away may i not offer you a cigarette  wolfenden sat down for the first time  are you in earnest he asked when you speak of leaving england so soon  assuredly you will do me the justice to admit that i have never pretended to like your country have i i hope to leave it for several years if not for ever within the course of a few weeks  and your niece mr sabin  she accompanies me of course she likes this country even less than i do perhaps under the circumstances our departure is the best thing that could happen it is at any rate opportune  i cannot agree with you wolfenden said for me it is most inopportune i need scarcely say that i have not abandoned my desire to make your niece my wife  i should have thought mr sabin said with a fine note of satire in his tone that you would have put far away from you all idea of any connection with such suspicious personages  i have never had wolfenden said calmly any suspicion at all concerning your niece  she would be i am sure much flattered mr sabin declared at the same time i can scarcely see on what grounds you continue to hope for an impossibility my nieces refusal seemed to me explicit enough especially when coupled with my own positive prohibition  your niece wolfenden said is doubtless of age i should not trouble about your consent if i could gain hers and i may as well tell you at once that i by no means despair of doing so  mr sabin bit his lip and his dark eyes flashed out with a sudden fire  i should be glad to know sir he said on what grounds you consider my voice in the affair to be ineffective  partly wolfenden answered for the reason which i have already given youbecause your niece is of age and partly also because you persist in giving me no definite reason for your refusal  i have told you distinctly mr sabin said that my niece is betrothed and will be married within six months  to whom where is he why is he not here your niece wears no engagement ring i will answer for it that if she is as you say betrothed it is not of her own free will  you talk mr sabin said with dangerous calm like a fool it is not customary amongst the class to which my niece belongs to wear always an engagement ring as for her affections she has had i am glad to say a sufficient selfcontrol to keep them to herself your presumption is simply the result of your entire ignorance i appeal to you for the last time lord wolfenden to behave like a man of common sense and abandon hopes which can only end in disappointment  i have no intention of doing anything of the sort wolfenden said doggedly we englishmen are a pigheaded race as you were once polite enough to observe your niece is the only woman whom i have wished to marry and i shall marry her if i can  i shall make it my especial concern mr sabin said firmly to see that all intercourse between you ends at once  wolfenden rose to his feet  it is obviously useless he said to continue this conversation i have told you my intentions i shall pursue them to the best of my ability goodmorning  mr sabin held out his hand  i have just a word more to say to you he declared it is about your father  i do not desire to discuss my father or any other matter with you wolfenden said quietly as to my fathers work i am determined to solve the mystery connected with it once and for all i have wired for mr c to come down and if necessary take possession of the papers you can get what information you require from him yourself  mr sabin rose up slowly his long white fingers were clasped around the head of that curious stick of his there was a peculiar glint in his eyes and his cheeks were pale with passion  i am very much obliged to you for telling me that he said it is valuable information for me i will certainly apply to mr c  he had been drawing nearer and nearer to wolfenden suddenly he stopped and with a swift movement raised the stick on which he had been leaning over his head it whirled round in a semicircle wolfenden fascinated by that line of gleaming green light hesitated for a moment then he sprang backwards but he was too late the head of the stick came down on his head his upraised arm did little to break the force of the blow he sank to the ground with a smothered groan     chapter xxxii  the secret of mr sabins niece   at the sound of his cry helène who had been crossing the hall threw open the door just as mr sabins fingers were upon the key seeing that he was powerless to keep from her the knowledge of what had happened he did not oppose her entrance she glided into the centre of the room with a stifled cry of terror together she and mr sabin bent over wolfendens motionless figure mr sabin unfastened the waistcoat and felt his heart she did not speak until he had held his hand there for several seconds then she asked a question  have you killed him  mr sabin shook his head and smiled gently  too tough a skull by far he said can you get a basin and a towel without any one seeing you  she nodded and fetched them from her own room the water was fresh and cold and the towel was of fine linen daintily hemmed and fragrant with the perfume of violets yet neither of these things nor the soft warmth of her breathing upon his cheek seemed to revive him in the least he lay quite still in the same heavy stupor mr sabin stood upright and looked at him thoughtfully his face had grown almost haggard  we had better send for a doctor she whispered fiercely i shall fetch one myself if you do not  mr sabin gently dissented  i know quite as much as any doctor he said the man is not dead or dying or likely to die i wonder if we could move him on to that sofa  together they managed it somehow mr sabin in the course of his movements to and fro about the room was attracted by the sight of the dogcart still waiting outside he frowned and stood for a moment looking thoughtfully at it then he went outside  are you waiting for lord wolfenden he asked the groom  the man looked up in surprise  yes sir i set him down here nearly an hour ago i had no orders to go home  lord wolfenden has evidently forgotten all about you mr sabin said he left by the back way for the golf course and i am going to join him there directly he is not coming back here at all you had better go home i should think  the man touched his hat  very good sir  there was a little trampling up of the gravel and wolfendens dogcart rapidly disappeared in the distance mr sabin with set face and a hard glitter in his eyes went back into the morning room helène was still on her knees by wolfendens prostrate figure when he entered she spoke to him without looking up  he is a little better i think he opened his eyes just now  he is not seriously hurt mr sabin said there may be some slight concussion nothing more the question is first what to do with him and secondly how to make the best use of the time which must elapse before he will be well enough to go home  she looked at him now in horror he was always like this unappalled by anything which might happen eager only to turn every trick of fortune to his own ends surely his nerves were of steel and his heart of iron  i think she said that i should first make sure that he is likely to recover at all  mr sabin answered mechanically his thoughts seemed far away  his recovery is a thing already assured he said his skull was too hard to crack he will be laid up for an hour or two what i have to decide is how to use that hour or two to the best possible advantage  she looked away from him and shuddered this passionate absorption of all his energies into one channel had made a fiend of the man her slowly growing purpose took to itself root and branch as she knelt by the side of the young englishman who only a few moments ago had seemed the very embodiment of all manly vigour  mr sabin stood up he had arrived at a determination  helène he said i am going away for an hour perhaps two will you take care of him until i return  yes  you will promise not to leave him or to send for a doctor  i will promise unless he seems to grow worse  he will not get worse he will be conscious in less than an hour keep him with you as long as you can he will be safer here remember that  i will remember she said  he left the room and soon she heard the sound of carriage wheels rolling down the avenue his departure was an intense relief to her she watched the carriage furiously driven disappear along the road then she returned to wolfendens side for nearly an hour she remained there bathing his head forcing now and then a little brandy between his teeth and watching his breathing become more regular and the ghastly whiteness leaving his face and all the while she was thoughtful once or twice her hands touched his hair tenderly almost caressingly there was a certain wistfulness in her regard of him she bent close over his face he was still apparently as unconscious as ever she hesitated for a moment the red colour burned in one bright spot on her cheeks she stooped down and kissed him on the forehead whispering something under her breath almost before she could draw back he opened his eyes she was overwhelmed with confusion but seeing that he had no clear knowledge of what had happened she rapidly recovered herself he looked around him and then up into her face  what has happened he asked where am i  you are at the lodge she said quietly you called to see mr sabin this morning you know and i am afraid you must have quarrelled  ah it was that beastly stick he said slowly he struck at me suddenly where is he now  she did not answer him at once it was certainly better not to say that she had seen him driven rapidly away only a short time ago with his horses heads turned to deringham hall  he will be back soon she said do not think about him please i cannot tell you how sorry i am  he was recovering himself rapidly something in her eyes was sending the blood warmly through his veins he felt better every instant  i do not want to think about him he murmured i do not want to think about any one else but you  she looked down at him with a half pathetic half humorous twitching of her lips  you must please not make love to me or i shall have to leave you she said the idea of thinking about such a thing in your condition you dont want to send me away do you  on the contrary he answered i want to keep you always with me  that she said briefly is impossible  nothing he declared is impossible if only we make up our minds to it i have made up mine  you are very masterful are all englishmen as confident as you  i know nothing about other men he declared but i love you helène and i am not sure that you do not care a little for me  she drew her hand away from his tightening clasp  i am going she said it is your own faultyou have driven me away  her draperies rustled as she moved towards the door but she did not go far  i do not feel so well he said quietly i believe that i am going to faint  she was on her knees by his side again in a moment for a fainting man the clasp of his fingers around hers was wonderfully strong  i feel better now he announced calmly i shall be all right if you stay quietly here and dont move about  she looked at him doubtfully  i do not believe she said that you felt ill at all you are taking advantage of me  i can assure you that i am not he answered when you are here i feel a different man  i am quite willing to stay if you will behave yourself she said  will you please define good behaviour he begged  in the present instance she laughed it consists in not saying silly things  a thing which is true cannot be silly he protested it is true that i am never happy without you that is why i shall never give you up  she looked down at him with bright eyes and a frown which did not come easily  if you persist in making love to me she said i am going away it is not permitted understand that  he sighed  i am afraid he answered softly that i shall always be indulging in the luxury of the forbidden for i love you and i shall never weary of telling you so  then i must see she declared making a subtle but unsuccessful attempt to disengage her hand that you have fewer opportunities  if you mean that he said i must certainly make the most of this one helène you could care for me i know and i could make you happy you say no to me because there is some vague entanglementi will not call it an engagementwith some one else you do not care for him i am sure dont marry him it will be for your sorrow so many womens lives are spoilt like that dearest he added gaining courage from her averted face i can make you happy i am sure of it i do not know who you are or who your people are but they shall be my peoplenothing matters except that i love you i dont know what to say to you helène there is something shadowy in your mind which seems to you to come between us i dont know what it is or i would dispel it tell me dear wont you give me a chance  she yielded her other hand to his impatient fingers and looked down at him wistfully yet there was something in her gaze which he could not fathom of one thing he was very sure there was a little tenderness shining out of her dark brilliant eyes a little regret a little indecision on the whole he was hopeful  dear she said softly perhaps i do care for you a little perhapswell some time in the futurewhat you are thinking of might be possible i cannot say something apart from you has happened which has changed my life you must let me go for a little while but i will promise you this the entanglement of which you spoke shall be broken off i will have no more to do with that man  he sat upright  helène he said you are making me very happy but there is one thing which i must ask you and which you must forgive me for asking this entanglement of which you speak has nothing to do with mr sabin  nothing whatever she answered promptly how i should like to tell you everything but i have made a solemn promise and i must keep it my lips are sealed but one thing i should like you to understand in case you have ever had any doubt about it mr sabin is really my uncle my mothers brother he is engaged in a great enterprise in which i am a necessary figure he has suddenly become very much afraid of you  afraid of me wolfenden repeated  she nodded  i ought to tell you perhaps that my marriage with some one else is necessary to insure the full success of his plans so you see he has set himself to keep us apart  the more you tell me the more bewildered i get wolfenden declared what made him attack me just now without any warning surely he did not wish to kill me  her hand within his seemed to grow colder  you were imprudent she said  imprudent in what way  you told him that you had sent for mr c to come and go through your fathers papers  what of it  i cannot tell you any more  wolfenden rose to his feet he was still giddy but he was able to stand  all that he told me here was a tissue of lies then helène i will not leave you with such a man you cannot continue to live with him  i do not intend to she answered i want to get away what has happened today is more than i can pardon even from him yet you must not judge him too harshly in his way he is a great man and he is planning great things which are not wholly for his advantage but he is unscrupulous so long as the end is great he believes himself justified in stooping to any means  wolfenden shuddered  you must not live another day with him he exclaimed you will come to deringham hall my mother will be only too glad to come and fetch you it is not very cheerful there just now but anything is better than leaving you with this man  she looked at him curiously her eyes were soft with something which suggested pity but resembled tears  no she said that would not do at all you must not think because i have been living with mr sabin that i have no other relations or friends i have a very great many of both only it was arranged that i should leave them for a while i can go back at any time i am altogether my own mistress  then go back at once he begged her feverishly i could not bear to think of you living here with this man another hour have your things put together now and tell your maid let me take you to the station i want to see you leave this infernal house and this atmosphere of cheating and lies when i do  her lips parted into the ghost of a smile  i have not found so much to regret in my stay here she said softly  he held out his arms but she eluded him gently  i hope he said nay i know that you will never regret it never tell me what you are going to do now  i shall leave here this afternoon she said and go straight to some friends in london then i shall make new plans or rather set myself to the remaking of old ones when i am ready i will write to you but remember againi make no promise  he held out his hands  but you will write to me  she hesitated  no i shall not write to you i am not going to give you my address even you must be patient for a little while  you will not go away you will not at least leave england without seeing me  not unless i am compelled she promised and then if i go i will come back again or let you know where i am you need not fear i am not going to slip away and be lost you shall see me again  wolfenden was dissatisfied  i hate letting you go he said i hate all this mystery when one comes to think of it i do not even know your name it is ridiculous why cannot i take you to london and we can be married tomorrow then i should have the right to protect you against this blackguard  she laughed softly her lips were parted in dainty curves and her eyes were lit with merriment  how delightful you are she exclaimed and to think that the women of my country call you englishmen slow wooers  wont you prove the contrary he begged  she shook her head  it is already proved but if you are sure you feel well enough to walk please go now i want to catch the afternoon train to london  he held out his hands and tried once more to draw her to him but she stepped backwards laughing  you must please be patient she said and remember that today i am betrothed tosomebody else goodbye     chapter xxxiii  mr sabin triumphs   wolfenden for perhaps the first time in his life chose the inland road home he was still feeling faint and giddy and the fresh air only partially revived him he walked slowly and rested more than once it took him almost half an hour to reach the cross roads here he sat on a stile for a few minutes until he began to feel himself again just as he was preparing to resume his walk he was aware of a carriage being driven rapidly towards him along the private road from deringham hall  he stood quite still and watched it the roads were heavy after much rain and the mud was leaping up into the sunshine from the flying wheels bespattering the carriage and reaching even the man who sat upon the box the horses had broken into a gallop the driver was leaning forward whip in hand he knew at once whose carriage it was it was the little brougham which mr sabin had brought down from london he had been up to the hall then wolfendens face grew stern he stood well out in the middle of the road the horses would have to be checked a little at the sharp turn before him they would probably shy a little seeing him stand there in the centre of the road he would be able to bring them to a standstill so he remained there motionless nearer and nearer they came wolfenden set his teeth hard and forgot his dizziness  they were almost upon him now to his surprise the driver was making no effort to check his galloping horses it seemed impossible that they could round that narrow corner at the pace they were going a froth of white foam was on their bits and their eyes were bloodshot they were almost upon wolfenden before he realised what was happening they made no attempt to turn the corner which he was guarding but flashed straight past him along the cromer road wolfenden shouted and waved his arms but the coachman did not even glance in his direction he caught a glimpse of mr sabins face as he leaned back amongst the cushions dark satyrlike forbidding the thin lips seemed to part into a triumphant smile as he saw wolfenden standing there it was all over in a moment the carriage with its whirling wheels was already a speck in the distance  wolfenden looked at his watch it was fiveandtwenty minutes to one mr sabins purpose was obvious he was trying to catch the one oclock express to london to pursue that carriage was absolutely hopeless wolfenden set his face towards deringham hall and ran steadily along the road he was filled with vague fears the memory of mr sabins smile haunted him he had succeeded by what means perhaps by violence wolfenden forgot his own aching head he was filled only with an intense anxiety to reach his destination if mr sabin had so much as raised his hand he should pay for it he understood now why that blow had been given it was to keep him out of the way as he ran on his teeth clenched and his breath coming fast he grew hot with passionate anger he had been mr sabins dupe curse the man  he turned the final corner in the drive climbed the steps and entered the hall the servants were standing about as usual there was no sign of anything having happened they looked at him curiously but that might well be owing to his dishevelled condition  where is the admiral groves he asked breathlessly  his lordship is in the billiardroom the man answered  wolfenden stopped short in his passage across the hall and looked at the man in amazement  where  in the billiardroom my lord the man repeated he was inquiring for you only a moment ago  wolfenden turned sharp to the left and entered the billiardroom his father was standing there with his coat off and a cue in his hand directly he turned round wolfenden was aware of a peculiar change in his face and expression the hard lines had vanished every trace of anxiety seemed to have left him his eyes were soft and as clear as a childs he turned to wolfenden with a bland smile and immediately began to chalk his cue  come and play me a game wolf he cried out cheerfully youll have to give me a few im so out of practice well make it a hundred and you shall give me twenty which will you have spot or plain  wolfenden gulped down his amazement with an effort  ill take plain he said its a long time isnt it since we played  his father faced him for a minute and seemed perplexed  not so very long surely wasnt it yesterday or the day before  wolfenden wondered for a moment whether that blow had affected his brain it was years since he had seen the billiardroom at deringham hall opened  i dont exactly remember he faltered perhaps i was mistaken time goes so quickly  i wonder the admiral said making a cannon and stepping briskly round the table how it goes at all with you young men who do nothing great mistake to have no profession wolf i wish i could make you see it  i quite agree with you wolfenden said you must not look upon me as quite an idler though i am a fullfledged barrister you know although i do not practise and i have serious thoughts of parliament  the admiral shook his head  poor career my boy poor career for a gentlemans son take my advice and keep out of parliament i am going to pot the red i dont like the red ball wolf it keeps looking at me likelike that man ah  he flung his cue with a rattle upon the floor of inlaid wood and started back  look wolf he cried hes grinning at me come here boy tell me the truth have i been tricked he told me that he was mr c and i gave him everything look at his face how it changes he isnt like c now he is likewho is it he is like cs face is not so pale as that and he does not limp i seem to remember him too cant you help me cant you see him boy  he had been moving backwards slowly he was leaning now against the wall his face blanched and perfectly bloodless his eyes wild and his pupils dilated wolfenden laid his cue down and came over to his side  no i cant see him father he said gently i think it must be fancy you have been working too hard  you are blind boy blind the admiral muttered where was it i saw him last there were sandsand a burning sunhis shot went wide but i aimed low and i hit him he carried himself bravely he was an aristocrat and he never forgot it but why does he call himself mr c what has he to do with my work  wolfenden choked down a lump in his throat he began to surmise what had happened  let us go into the other room father he said gently it is too cold for billiards  the admiral held out his arm he seemed suddenly weak and old his eyes were dull and he was muttering to himself wolfenden led him gently from the room and upstairs to his own apartment there he made an excuse for leaving him for a moment and hurried down into the library mr blatherwick was writing there alone  blatherwick wolfenden exclaimed what has happened this morning who has been here  mr blatherwick blushed scarlet  miss merton called and a gentleman with her from the home office i bbbelieve  who let him into the library wolfenden asked sternly  mr blatherwick fingered his collar as though he found it too tight for him and appeared generally uncomfortable  at miss mertons request lord wolfenden he said nervously i allowed him to come in i understood that he had been sent for by her ladyship i trust that i did not do wrong  you are an ass blatherwick wolfenden exclaimed angrily you seem to enjoy lending yourself to be the tool of swindlers and thieves my father has lost his reason entirely now and it is your fault you had better leave here at once you are altogether too credulous for this world  wolfenden strode away towards his mothers room but a cry from upstairs directed his steps lady deringham and he met outside his fathers door and entered the room together they came face to face with the admiral  out of my way he cried furiously come with me wolf we must follow him i must have my papers back or kill him i have been dreaming he told me that he was c i gave him all he asked for we must have them back merciful heavens if he publishes them we are ruined  where did he come from they told me that he was dead has he crawled back out of hell i shot him once he has never forgotten it this is his vengeance oh god  he sank down into a chair the perspiration stood out in great beads upon his white forehead he was shaking from head to foot suddenly his head drooped in the act of further speech the words died away upon his lips he was unconscious the countess knelt by his side and wolfenden stood over her  do you know anything of what has happened wolfenden asked  very little she whispered somehow hemr sabingot into the library and the shock sent himlike this here is the doctor  dr whitlett was ushered in they all three looked down upon the admiral and the doctor asked a few rapid questions there was certainly a great change in his face a strong line or two had disappeared the countenance was milder and younger it was like the face of a child wolfenden was afraid to see the eyes open he seemed already in imagination to picture to himself their vacant unseeing light dr whitlett shook his head sadly  i am afraid he said gravely that when lord deringham recovers he will remember nothing he has had a severe shock and there is every indication that his mind has given way  wolfenden drew his teeth together savagely this then was the result of mr sabins visit     chapter xxxiv  blanche mertons little plot   at about four oclock in the afternoon as helène was preparing to leave the lodge a telegram was brought in to her from mr sabin  i have succeeded and am now en route for london you had better follow when convenient but do not be later than tomorrow  she tore it into small pieces and hummed a tune  it is enough she murmured i am not ambitious any longer i am going to london it is true my dear uncle but not to kensington you can play richelieu to henri and my cousin if it pleases you i wonder  her face grew softer and more thoughtful suddenly she laughed outright to herself she went and sat down on the couch where wolfenden had been lying  it would have been simpler she said to herself how like a man to think of such a daring thing i wishi almost wishi had consented what a delightful sensation it would have made cécile will laugh when i tell her of this to her i have always seemed ambitious and ambitious only  and now i have found out that i have a heart only to give it away hélas  there was a knock at the door a servant entered  miss merton would be glad to know if you could spare her a moment before you left miss the man announced  helène glanced at the clock  i am going very shortly she said she had better come in now  the man withdrew but returned almost immediately ushering in miss merton for the first time helène noticed how pretty the girl was her trim dainty little figure was shown off to its utmost advantage by the neat tailor gown she was wearing and there was a bright glow of colour in her cheeks helène who had no liking for her uncles typewriter and who had scarcely yet spoken to her remained standing waiting to hear what she had to say  i wanted to see mr sabin she began can you tell me when he will be back  he has gone to london helène replied he will not be returning here at all  the girls surprise was evidently genuine  but he said nothing about it a few hours ago she exclaimed you are in his confidence i know this morning he gave me something to do i was to get mr blatherwick away from the hall and keep him with me as long as i could you do not know mr blatherwick then you cannot sympathise with me since ten oclock i have been with him at last i could keep him no longer he has gone back to the hall  mr sabin will probably write to you helène said this house is taken for another fortnight and you can of course remain here if you choose you will certainly hear from him within the next day or two  miss merton shrugged her shoulders  well i shall take a holiday she declared ive finished typing all the copy i had havent you dropped something there  she stooped suddenly forward and picked up a locket from the floor  is this yours she asked why  she held the locket tightly in her hand her eyes seemed rivetted upon it it was very small and fashioned of plain gold with a coronet and letter on the face miss merton looked at it in amazement  why this belongs to wolfto lord wolfenden she exclaimed  helène looked at her in cold surprise  it is very possible she said he was here a short time ago  miss merton clenched the locket in her hand as though she feared for its safety  here in this room  certainly he called to see mr sabin and remained for some time  miss merton was a little paler she did not look quite so pretty now  did you see him she asked  helène raised her eyebrows  i scarcely understand she said what business it is of yours since you ask me however i have no objection to telling you that i did see lord wolfenden he remained some time here with me after mr sabin left  perhaps miss merton suggested with acidity that was why i was sent out of the way  helène looked at her through halfclosed eyes  i am afraid she said that you are a very impertinent young woman be so good as to put that locket upon the table and leave the room  the girl did neither on the contrary she slipped the locket into the bosom of her gown  i will take care of this she remarked  helène laid her hand upon the bell  i am afraid she said that you must be unwell i am going to ring the bell perhaps you will be good enough to place the locket on that table and leave the room  miss merton drew herself up angrily  i have a better claim upon the locket than any one she said i am seeing lord wolfenden constantly i will give it to him  thank you you need not trouble helène answered i shall send a servant with it to deringham hall will you be good enough to give it to me  miss merton drew a step backwards and shook her head  i think she said that i am more concerned in it than you are for i gave it to him  you gave it to him  miss merton nodded  yes if you dont believe me look here  she drew the locket from her bosom and holding it out touched a spring there was a small miniature inside helène leaning over recognised it at once it was a likeness of the girl herself she felt the colour leave her cheeks but she did not flinch  i was not aware she said that you were on such friendly terms with lord wolfenden  the girl smiled oddly  lord wolfenden she said has been very kind to me  perhaps helène continued i ought not to ask but i must confess that you have surprised me is lord wolfendenyour lover  miss merton shut up the locket with a click and returned it to her bosom there was no longer any question as to her retaining it she looked at helène thoughtfully  has he been making love to you she asked abruptly  helène raised her eyes and looked at her the other girl felt suddenly very insignificant  you must not ask me impertinent questions she said calmly of course you need not tell me anything unless you choose it is for you to please yourself  the girl was white with anger she had not a tithe of helènes selfcontrol and she felt that she was not making the best of her opportunities  lord wolfenden she said slowly did promise to marry me once i was his fathers secretary and i was turned away on his account  indeed  there was a silence between the two women miss merton was watching helène closely but she was disappointed her face was set in cold proud lines but she showed no signs of trouble  under these circumstances helène said the locket certainly belongs to you if you will allow me i will ring now for my maid i am leaving here this evening  i should like miss merton said to tell you about lord wolfenden and myself  helène smiled languidly  you will excuse me i am sure she said it is scarcely a matter which interests me  miss merton flushed angrily she was at a disadvantage and she knew it  i thought that you were very much interested in lord wolfenden she said spitefully  i have found him much pleasanter than the majority of englishmen  but you dont care to hear about himfrom me miss merton exclaimed  helène smiled  i have no desire to be rude she said but since you put it in that way i will admit that you are right  the girl bit her lip she felt that she had only partially succeeded this girl was more than her match she suddenly changed her tactics  oh you are cruel she exclaimed you want to take him from me i know you do he promisedto marry mebefore you came he must marry me i dare not go home  i can assure you helène said quietly that i have not the faintest desire to take lord wolfenden from youor from any one else i do not like this conversation at all and i do not intend to continue it perhaps if you have nothing more to say you will go to your room or if you wish to go away i will order a carriage for you please make up your mind quickly  miss merton sprang up and walked towards the door her pretty face was distorted with anger  i do not want your carriage she said i am leaving the house but i will walk  just as you choose if you only go helène murmured  she was already at the door but she turned back  i cant help it she exclaimed ive got to ask you a question has lord wolfenden asked you to marry him  helène was disgusted but she was not hardhearted the girl was evidently distressedit never occurred to her that she might not be in earnest she herself could not understand such a lack of selfrespect a single gleam of pity mingled with her contempt  i am not at liberty to answer your question she said coldly as it concerns lord wolfenden as well as myself but i have no objection to telling you this i am the princess helène of bourbon and i am betrothed to my cousin prince henri of ortrens so you see that i am not likely to marry lord wolfenden now please go away at once  miss merton obeyed she left the room literally speechless helène rang the bell  if that young personmiss merton i think her name isattempts to see me again before i leave be sure that she is not admitted she told the servant  the man bowed and left the room helène was left alone she sank into an easy chair by the fire and leaned her head upon her hand her selfcontrol was easy and magnificent but now that she was alone her face had softened the proud little mouth was quivering a feeling of uneasiness of utter depression stole over her tears stood for a moment in her eyes but she brushed them fiercely away  how could he have dared she murmured i wish that i were a man after all then it must beambition     chapter xxxv  a little game of cards   mr sabin whose carriage had set him down at the cromer railway station with barely two minutes to spare took his seat in an empty firstclass smoking carriage of the london train and deliberately lit a fine cigar he was filled with that sense of triumphant selfsatisfaction which falls to the lot of a man who after much arduous labour successfully accomplished sees very near at hand the great desire of his life two days more quiet work and his task was done all that he had pledged himself to give he would have ready for the offering the finishing touches were but a matter of detail it had been a great undertakingmore difficult at times than he had ever reckoned for he told himself with some complacency that no other man breathing could have brought it to so satisfactory a conclusion his had been a life of great endeavours this one however was the crowning triumph of his career  he watched the people take their seats in the train with idle eyes he was not interested in any of them he scarcely saw their faces they were not of his world nor he of theirs but suddenly he received a rude shock he sat upright and wiped away the moisture from the window in order that he might see more clearly a young man in a long ulster was buying newspapers from a boy only a yard or two away something about the figure and manner of standing seemed to mr sabin vaguely familiar he waited until his head was turned and the eyes of the two men metthen the last vestige of doubt disappeared it was felix mr sabin leaned back in his corner with darkening face he had noticed to his dismay that the encounter surprising though it had been to him had been accepted by felix as a matter of coursehe was obviously prepared for it he had met mr sabins anxious and incredulous gaze with a faint peculiar smile his probable presence in the train had evidently been confidently reckoned upon felix had been watching him secretly and knowing what he did know of that young man mr sabin was seriously disturbed he did not hesitate for a moment however to face the position he determined at once upon a bold course of action letting down the window he put out his head  are you going to town he asked felix as though seeing him then was the most natural thing in the world  the young man nodded  yes its getting pretty dreary down here isnt it youre off back i see  mr sabin assented  yes he said ive had about enough of it besides im overdue at pau and im anxious to get there are you coming in here  felix hesitated at first the suggestion had astonished him almost immediately it became a temptation it would be distinctly piquant to travel with this man on the other hand it was distinctly unwise it was running an altogether unnecessary risk mr sabin read his thoughts with the utmost ease  i should rather like to have a little chat with you he said quietly you are not afraid are you i am quite unarmed and as you see nature has not made me for a fighting man  felix hesitated no longer he motioned to the porter who was carrying his dressingcase and golf clubs and had them conveyed into mr sabins carriage he himself took the opposite seat  i had no idea mr sabin remarked that you were in the neighbourhood  felix smiled  you have been so engrossed in yourgolf he remarked it is a fascinating game is it not  very mr sabin assented you yourself are a devotee i see  i am a beginner felix answered and a very clumsy beginner too i take my clubs with me however whenever i go to the coast at this time of year they save one from being considered a madman  it is singular mr sabin remarked that you should have chosen to visit cromer just now it is really a most interesting meeting i do not think that i have had the pleasure of seeing you since that evening at the milan when your behaviour towards meforgive my alluding to itwas scarcely considerate  mr sabin was quite friendly and unembarrassed he seemed to treat the affair as a joke felix looked glumly out of the window  your luck stood you in good steadas usual he said i meant to kill you that night you see i dont mind confessing it i had sworn to make the attempt the first time we met face to face  considering that we are quite alone mr sabin remarked looking around the carriage and that from physical considerations my life under such conditions is entirely at your mercy i should like some assurance that you have no intention of repeating the attempt it would add very materially to my comfort  the young man smiled without immediately answering then he was suddenly grave he appeared to be reflecting almost imperceptibly mr sabins hand stole towards the window he was making a mental calculation as to what height above the carriage window the communication cord might be felix watching his fingers smiled again  you need have no fear he said the cause of personal enmity between you and me is dead you have nothing more to fear from me at any time  mr sabins hand slid down again to his side  i am charmed to hear it he declared you are i presume in earnest  most certainly it is as i say the cause for personal enmity between us is removed save for a strong personal dislike which under the circumstances i trust that you will pardon memr sabin bowedi have no feeling towards you whatever  mr sabin drew a somewhat exaggerated sigh of relief i live he said with one more fear removed but i must confess he added to a certain amount of curiosity we have a somewhat tedious journey before us and several hours at our disposal would it be asking you too much  felix waved his hand  not at all he said a few words will explain everything i have other matters to speak of with you but they can wait as you remark we have plenty of time before us three weeks ago i received a telegram from brussels it was fromforgive me if i do not utter her name in your presence it seems somehow like sacrilege  mr sabin bowed a little red spot was burning through the pallor of his sunken cheeks  i was there felix continued in a matter of twentyfour hours she was illbelieved herself to be dying we spoke together of a little event many years old yet which i venture to think neither you nor she nor i have ever forgotten  mr sabin pulled down the blind by his side it was only a stray gleam of wintry sunshine which had stolen through the grey clouds but it seemed to dazzle him  it had come to her knowledge that you and i were together in londonthat you were once more essaying to play a part in civilised and great affairs and lest our meeting should bring harm about she told mesomething of which i have always been in ignorance  ah  mr sabin moved uneasily in his seat he drew his clubfoot a little further back felix seemed to be looking at it absently  she showed me he continued a little pistol she explained to me that a womans aim is a most uncertain thing besides you were some distance away and your spring aside helped you then too so far as i could see from the mechanism of the thingit was an old and clumsy affairit carried low at any rate the shot which was doubtless meant for your heart found a haven in your foot from her lips i learned for the first time that she the sweetest and most timid of her sex had dared to become her own avenger life is a sad enough thing and pleasure is rare yet i tasted pleasure of the keenest and subtlest kind when she told me that story i feel even now some slight return of it when i look at yourshall we call deformity and consider how different a person  mr sabin half rose to his feet his face was white and set save where a single spot of colour was flaring high up near his cheekbone his eyes were bloodshot for a moment he seemed about to strike the other man felix broke off in his sentence and watched him warily  come he said it is not like you to lose control of yourself in that manner it is a simple matter you wronged a woman and she avenged herself magnificently as for me i can see that my interference was quite uncalled for i even venture to offer you my apologies for the fright i must have given you at the milan the account had already been straightened by abler hands i can assure you that i am no longer your enemy in fact when i look at youhis eyes seemed to fall almost to the groundwhen i look at you i permit myself some slight sensation of pity for your unfortunate affliction but it was magnificent shall we change the subject now  mr sabin sat quite still in his corner his eyes seemed fixed upon a distant hill bordering the flat country through which they were passing felixs stinging words and mocking smile had no meaning for him in fact he did not see his companion any longer nor was he conscious of his presence the narrow confines of the railway carriage had fallen away he was in a lofty room in a chamber of a palace a privileged guest the lover of the woman whose dark passionate eyes and soft white arms were gleaming there before his eyes it was but one of many such scenes he shuddered very slightly as he went back further still he had been faithful to one god and one god onlythe god of self was it a sign of coming trouble that for the first time for many years he had abandoned himself to the impotent morbidness of abstract thought he shook himself free from it with an effort what lunacy today he was on the eve of a mighty successhis feet were planted firmly upon the threshold the end of all his ambitions stood fairly in view and the path to it was wide and easy only a little time and his must be one of the first names in europe the thought thrilled him the little flood of impersonal recollections ebbed away he was himself again keen alert vigorous suddenly he met the eyes of his companion fixed steadfastly upon him and his face darkened there was something ominous about this mans appearance his very presence seemed like a foreboding of disaster  i am much obliged to you for your little romance he said there is one point however which needs some explanation if your interest is really as you suggest at an end what are you doing down here i presume that your appearance is not altogether a coincidence  certainly not felix answered let me correct you however on one trifling point i said you must remembermy personal interest  i do not mr sabin remarked exactly see the distinction in fact i do not follow you at all  i am so stupid felix declared apologetically i ought to have explained myself more clearly it is even possible that you who know everything may yet be ignorant of my present position  i certainly have no knowledge of it mr sabin admitted  felix was gently astonished  really i took it for granted of course that you knew well i am employednot in any important post of courseat the russian embassy his excellency has been very kind to me  mr sabin for once felt his nerve grow weak those evil forebodings of his had very swiftly become verified this man was his enemy yet he recovered himself almost as quickly what had he to fear his was still the winning hand  i am pleased to hear he said that you have found such creditable employment i hope you will make every effort to retain it you have thrown away many chances  felix at first smiled then he leaned back amongst the cushions and laughed outright when he had ceased he wiped the tears from his eyes he sat up again and looked with admiration at the still pale figure opposite to him  you are inimitable he saidwonderful if you live long enough you will certainly become very famous what will it be i wonderemperor dictator president of a republic the minister of an emperor the latter i should imagine you were always such an aristocrat i would not have missed this journey for the world i am longing to know what you will say to prince lobenski at kings cross  mr sabin looked at him keenly  so you are only a lacquey after all then he remarkeda common spy  very much at your service felix answered with a low bow a spy if you like engaged for the last two weeks in very closely watching your movements and solving the mystery of your sudden devotion to a heathenish game  there at any rate mr sabin said calmly you are quite wrong if you had watched my play i flatter myself that you would have realised that my golf at any rate was no pretence  i never imagined felix rejoined that you would be anything but proficient at any game in which you cared to interest yourself but i never imagined either that you came to cromer to play golfespecially just now  modern diplomacy mr sabin said after a brief pause has undergone as you may be aware a remarkable transformation secrecy is now quite out of date it is the custom amongst the masters to play with the cards upon the table  there is a good deal in what you say felix answered thoughtfully come we will play the game then it is my lead very well i have been down here watching you continually with the object of discovering the source of this wonderful power by means of which you are prepared to offer up this country bound hand and foot to whichever power you decide to make terms with sounds like a fairy tale doesnt it but you obviously believe in it yourself and lobenski believes in you  good mr sabin declared that power of which i have spoken i now possess it was nearly complete a month ago an hours work now will make it a living and invulnerable fact  you obtained felix said your final success this afternoon when you robbed the mad admiral  mr sabin shook his head gently  i have not robbed any one he said i never use force  felix looked at him reproachfully  i have heard much that is evil about you he said but i have never heard before that you were known totodear me it is a very unpleasant thing to say  well sir  to cheat at cards  mr sabin drew a short little breath  what i have said is true to the letter he repeated the admiral gave me the trifling information i asked for with his own hands  felix remained incredulous  then you must add the power of hypnotism he declared to your other accomplishments  mr sabin laughed scornfully nevertheless he did not seem to be altogether at his ease the little scene in the library at deringham hall was not a pleasant recollection for him  the matter after all he said coldly is unimportant it is merely a detail i will admit that you have done your spys work well now what will buy your memory and your departure from this train at the next station  felix smiled  you are becoming more sensible he said it is a very fair question to ask my price is the faithful fulfilment of your contract with my chief  i have made no contract with him  you have opened negotiations he is ready to come to terms with you you have only to name your price  i have no price mr sabin said quietly that he could pay  what knigenstein can give felix said he can give double the secret service funds of russia are the largest in the world you can have practically a blank cheque upon them  i repeat mr sabin said i have no price that prince lobenski could pay you talk as though i were a blackmailer or a common thief you have always misunderstood me come i will remember that the cards are upon the table i will be wholly frank with you it is knigenstein with whom i mean to treat and not your chief he has agreed to my termsrussia never could  felix was silent for a moment  you are holding he said your trump card in your hand whatever in this world germany could give you russia could improve upon  she could do so mr sabin said only at the expense of her honour come here is that trump card i will throw it upon the table now you see that my hands are empty my price is the invasion of france and the restoration of the monarchy  felix looked at him as a man looks upon a lunatic  you are playing with me he cried  i was never more in earnest in my life mr sabin said  do you mean to tell me that youin cold bloodare working for so visionary so impossible an end  it is neither visionary mr sabin said nor impossible i do not believe that any man save myself properly appreciates the strength of the royalist party in france every day every minute brings it fresh adherents it is as certain that some day a king will reign once more at versailles as that the sun will set before many hours are past the french people are too bourgeois at heart to love a republic the desire for its abolition is growing up in their hearts day by day you understand me now when i say that i cannot treat with your country the honour of russia is bound up with her friendship to france germany on the other hand has ready her battle cry she and france have been quivering on the verge of war for many a year my whole hand is upon the table now felix look at the cards and tell me whether we can treat  felix was silent he looked at his opponent with unwilling admiration the man after all then was great for the moment he could think of nothing whatever to say  now listen to me mr sabin continued earnestly i made a great mistake when i ever mentioned the matter to prince lobenski i cannot treat with him but on the other hand i do not want to be hampered by his importunities for the next few days you have done your duty and you have done it well it is not your fault that you cannot succeed leave the train at the next stationdisappear for a week and i will give you a fortune you are youngthe world is before you you can seek distinction in whatever way you will i have a chequebook in my pocket and a fountain pen i will give you an order on the crédit lyonnaise for £20000  felix laughed softly his face was full of admiration he looked at his watch and began to gather together his belongings  write out the cheque he said i agree we shall be at the junction in about ten minutes     chapter xxxvi  the modern richelieu   so i have found you at last  mr sabin looked up with a distinct start from the table where he sat writing when he saw who his visitor was he set down his pen and rose to receive her at once he permitted himself to indulge in a little gesture of relief her noiseless entrance had filled him with a sudden fear  my dear helène he said placing a chair for her if i had had the least idea that you wished to see me i would have let you know my whereabouts i am sorry that you should have had any difficulty you should have written  she shrugged her shoulders slightly  what does it all mean she asked why are you masquerading in cheap lodgings and why do they say at kensington that you have gone abroad have things gone wrong  he turned and faced her directly she saw then that pale and haggard though he was his was not the countenance of a man tasting the bitterness of failure  very much the contrary he said we are on the brink of success all that remains to be done is the fitting together of my american work with the last of these papers it will take me about another twentyfour hours  she handed across to him a morning newspaper which she had been carrying in her muff a certain paragraph was marked  we regret to state that admiral the earl of deringham was seized yesterday morning with a fit whilst alone in his study dr bond of harley street was summoned at once to a consultation but we understand that the case is a critical one and the gravest fears are entertained lord deringham was the greatest living authority upon the subject of our fleet and coast defences and we are informed that at the time of his seizure he was completing a very important work in connection with this subject  mr sabin read the paragraph slowly and then handed the paper back to helène  deringham was a very distinguished man he remarked but he was stark mad and has been for years they have been able to keep it quiet only because he was harmless  you remember what i told you about these people helène said sternly i told you distinctly that i would not have them harmed in any way you were at deringham hall on the morning of his seizure you went straight there from the lodge  that is quite true he admitted but i had nothing to do with his illness  i wish i could feel quite certain of that helène answered you are a very determined man and you went there to get papers from him by any means you proved that you were altogether reckless as to how you got them by your treatment of lord wolfenden you succeeded no one living knows by what means  he interrupted her with an impatient gesture  there is nothing in this worth discussion he declared lord deringham is nothing to youyou never even saw him in your life and if you really have any misgivings about it i can assure you that i got what i wanted from him without violence it is not a matter for you to concern yourself in nor is it a matter worth considering at all especially at such a time as the present  she sat quite still her head resting upon her gloved hand he did not altogether like her appearance  i want you to understand he continued slowly that success absolute success is ours i have the personal pledge of the german emperor signed by his own hand tomorrow at noon the compact is concluded in a few weeks at the most the thunderbolt will have fallen these arrogant islanders will be facing a great invasion whose success is already made absolutely sure and then  he paused his face kindled with a passionate enthusiasm his eyes were lit with fire there was something great in the mans rapt expression  then the only true the only sweet battlecry in the french tongue will ring through the woods of brittany ay even to the walls of paris vive la france vive la monarchie  france has suffered so much she murmured do not you who love her so tremble when you think of her rivers running once more red with blood  if there be war at all he answered it will be brief year by year the loyalists have gained power and influence i have notes here from secret agents in every town almost in every village the great heart of paris is with us henri will only have to show himself and the voice of the people will shout him king and you  for me she interrupted nothing i withdraw i will not marry henri he must stand his chance alone his is the elder branchhe is the direct heir to the throne  mr sabin drew in a long breath between his teeth he was nerving himself for a great effort this fear had been the one small black cloud in the sky of his happiness  helène he said if i believed that you meantthat you could possibly meanwhat you have this moment said i would tear my compact in two throw this box amongst the flames and make my bow to my lifes work but you do not mean it you will change your mind  but indeed i shall not  of necessity you must the alliance between you and henri is absolutely compulsory you unite the two great branches of our royal family the sound of your name coupled with his will recall to the ears of france all that was most glorious in her splendid history and apart from that henri needs such a woman as you for his queen he has many excellent qualities but he is weak a trifle too easy a trifle thoughtless  he is a dissipated roué she said in a low tone with curling lip  mr sabin who had been walking restlessly up and down the room came and stood over her leaning upon his wonderful stick  helène he said gravely for your own sake and for your countrys sake i charge you to consider well what you are doing what does it matter to you if henri is even as bad as you say which mark you i deny he is the king of france personally you can be strangers if you please but marry him you must you need not be his wife but you must be his queen almost you make me ask myself whether i am talking to helène of bourbon a princess royal of france or to a lovesick english country girl pining for a sweetheart whose highest ambition it is to bear children and whose destiny is to become a drudge may god forbid it may god forbid that after all these years of darkness you should play me false now when the dawn is already lightening the sky sink your sex forget it remember that you are more than a womanyou are royal and your country has the first claim upon your heart the dignity which exalts demands also sacrifices think of your great ancestors who died with this prayer upon their lipsthat one day their childrens children should win again the throne which they had lost their eyes may be upon you at this moment give me a single reason for this change in youone single valid reason and i will say no more  she was silent the colour was coming and going in her cheeks she was deeply moved the honest passion in his tone had thrilled her  i would not dare to suggest even in a whisper to myself he went on his dark eyes fixed upon her and his voice lowered that helène of bourbon princess of brittany could set a greater price upon the love of a manand that man an englishmanthan upon her countrys salvation i would not even suffer so dishonouring a thought to creep into my brain yet i will remember that you are a girla womanthat is to say a creature of strange moods and i remind you that the marriage of a queen entails only the giving of a hand her heart remains always at her disposal and never yet has a queen of france been without her lover  she looked up at him with burning cheeks  you have spoken bitterly to me she said but from your point of view i have deserved it perhaps i have been weak after all men are not so very different they are all ignoble you are right when you call us women creatures of moods today i should prefer the convent to marriage with any man but listen if you can persuade me that my marriage with henri is necessary for his acceptance by the people of france if i am assured of that i will yield  mr sabin drew a long breath of relief blanche had succeeded then even in that moment he found time to realise that without her aid he would have run a terrible risk of failure he sat down and spoke calmly but impressively  from my point of view he said and i have considered the subject exhaustively i believe that it is absolutely necessary you and henri represent the two great houses who might with almost equal right claim the throne the result of your union must be perfect unanimity now suppose that henri stands alone dont you see that your cousin louis of bourbon is almost as near in the direct line he is young and impetuous without ballast but i believe ambitious he would be almost sure to assert himself at any rate his very existence would certainly lead to factions and the splitting up of nobles into parties this is the greatest evil we could possibly have to face there must be no dissensions whatever during the first generation of the reestablished monarchy the country would not be strong enough to bear it with you married to henri the two great houses of bourbon and ortrens are allied against their representative there would be no one strong enough to lift a hand have i made it clear  yes the girl answered you have made it very clear will you let me consider for a few moments  she sat there with her back halfturned to him gazing into the fire he moved back in the chair and went on with his writing she heard the lightning rush of his pen as he covered sheet after sheet of paper without even glancing towards her he had no more to say he knew very well that his work was done the influence of his words were strong upon her in her heart they had awakened some echo of those old ambitions which had once been very real and live things she set herself the task of fanning them once more with the fire of enthusiasm for she had no longer any doubts as to her duty wolfendens wordsthe first spoken words of love which had ever been addressed to herhad carried with them at the time a peculiar and a very sweet conviction she had lost faith too in mr sabin and his methods she had begun to wonder whether he was not after all a visionary whether there was really the faintest chance of the people of her country ever being stirred into a return to their old faith and allegiance wolfendens appearance had been for him singularly opportune and she had almost decided a few mornings ago that after all there was not any real bar between them she was a princess but of a fallen house he was a nobleman of the most powerful country in the world she had permitted herself to care for him a little she was astonished to find how swiftly that sensation had grown into something which had promised to become very real and precious to herand then this insolent girl had come to herher photograph was in his locket he was like henri and all the others she despised herself for the heartache of which she was sadly conscious her cheeks burned with shame and her heart was hot with rage when she thought of the kiss she had given himperhaps he had even placed her upon a level with the typewriting girl had dared to consider her too as a possible plaything for his idle moments she set her teeth and her eyes flashed  mr sabin as his pen flew over the paper felt a touch upon his arm  i am quite convinced she said when the time comes i shall be ready  he looked up with a faint but gratified smile  i had no fear of you he said frankly in henri alone i should have been destitute of confidence i should not have laboured as i have done but for you in your hands largely the destinies of your country will remain  i shall do my duty she answered quietly  i always knew it and now he said looking back towards his papers how about the present i do not want you here your presence would certainly excite comment and i am virtually in hiding for the next twentyfour hours  the duchess of montegarde arrived in london yesterday she replied i am going to her  you could not do a wiser thing he declared send your address to avon house tomorrow night or saturday night i shall come for you all will be settled then we shall have plenty to do but after the labour of the last seven years it will not seem like work it will be the beginning of the harvest  she looked at him thoughtfully  and your reward she said what is that to be  he smiled  i will not pretend he answered that i have worked for the love of my country and my order alone i also am ambitious although my ambition is more patriotic than personal i mean to be first minister of france  you will deserve it she said you are a very wonderful man  she walked out into the street and entered the cab which she had ordered to wait for her  fourteen grosvenor square she told the man but call at the first telegraph office  he set her down in a few minutes she entered a small postoffice and stood for a moment before one of the compartments then she drew a form towards her and wrote out a telegram                      to lord wolfenden                          deringham hall                                norfolk       i cannot send for you as i promised farewellhelÈne     chapter xxxvii  for a great stake        germanys insult to england      englands reply      mobilisation imminent      arming of the fleet      war almost certain  wolfenden who had bought no paper on his way up from norfolk gazed with something approaching amazement at the huge placards everywhere displayed along the strand thrust into his cab by adventurous newsboys flaunting upon every lamppost he alighted near trafalgar square and purchased a globe the actual facts were meagre enough but significant when considered in the light of a few days ago a vacancy had occurred upon the throne of one of englands far off dependencies the british nominee had been insulted in his palace by the german consula rival denounced as rebel by the authorities had been carried off in safety on to a german gunboat and accorded royal honours the thing was trivial as it stood but its importance had been enhanced a thousandfold by later news the german emperor had sent a telegram approving his consuls action and forbidding him to recognise the new sovereign there was no possibility of misinterpreting such an action it was an overt and deliberate insult the second within a week wolfenden read the news upon the pavements of pall mall jostled from right to left by hurrying passers by conscious too all the while of that subtle sense of excitement which was in the air and was visibly reflected in the faces of the crowd he turned into his club and here he found even a deeper note of the prevailing fever men were gathered around the tape in little clusters listening to the click click of the instrument and reading aloud the little items of news as they appeared there was a burst of applause when the prime ministers dignified and peremptory demand for an explanation eked out about four oclock in the afternoonan hour later it was rumoured that the german ambassador had received his papers the stock exchange remained firmthere was enthusiasm but no panic wolfenden began to wish that he too were a soldier as he passed from one to another of the eager groups of young men about his own age eagerly discussing the chances of the coming campaign he walked out into the streets presently and made his way boldly down to the house which had been pointed out to him as the town abode of mr sabin and his niece he found it shut up and apparently empty the servant who after some time answered his numerous ringings was either from design or chance more than usually stupid he could not tell where mr sabin was or when he would returnhe seemed to have no information whatever as regards the young lady wolfenden turned away in despair and walked slowly back towards pall mall at the bottom of piccadilly he stopped for a moment to let a little stream of carriages pass by he was about to cross the road when a large barouche with a pair of restive horses again blocked the way attracted by an unknown coronet upon the panel and the quiet magnificence of the servants liveries he glanced curiously at the occupants as the carriage passed him it was one of the surprises of his life the woman nearest to him he knew well by sight she was the duchess de montegarde one of the richest and most famous of frenchwomena woman often quoted as exactly typical of the old french nobility and who had furthermore gained for herself a personal reputation for delicate and aristocratic exclusiveness not altogether shared by her compeers in english society by her sidein the seat of honourwas helène and opposite to them was a young man with a dark fiercely twisted moustache and distinctly foreign appearance they passed slowly and wolfenden remained upon the edge of the pavement with his eyes fixed upon them  he was conscious at once of something about her which seemed strange to himsome new development she leaned back in her seat barely pretending to listen to the young mans conversation her lips a little curled her own face the very prototype of aristocratic languor all the lines of race were in her delicately chiselled features the mere idea of regarding her as the niece of the unknown mr sabin seemed just then almost ridiculous the carriage went by without her seeing himshe appeared to have no interest whatever in the passersby but wolfenden remained there without moving until a touch on the arm recalled him to himself  he turned abruptly round and to his amazement found himself shaking hands vigorously with densham  where on earth did you spring from old chap he asked dick said that you had gone abroad  densham smiled a little sadly  i was on my way he said when i heard the war rumours there seemed to be something in it so i came back as fast as express trains and steamers would bring me i only landed in england this morning i am applying for the post of correspondent to the london news  wolfenden sighed  i would give the world he said for some such excitement as that  densham drew his hand through wolfendens arm  i saw whom you were watching just now he said she is as beautiful as ever  wolfenden turned suddenly round  densham he said you know who she istell me  do you mean to say that you have not found out  i do i know her better but still only as mr sabins niece  densham was silent for several moments he felt wolfendens fingers gripping his arm nervously  well i do not see that i should be betraying any confidence now he said the promise i gave was only binding for a short time and now that she is to be seen openly with the duchess de montegarde i suppose the embargo is removed the young lady is the princess helène frances de bourbon and the young man is her betrothed husband the prince of ortrens  piccadilly became suddenly a vague and shadowy thoroughfare to wolfenden he was not quite sure whether his footsteps even reached the pavement densham hastened him into the club and installing him into an easy chair called for brandies and soda  poor old wolf he said softly im afraid youre like i wasvery hard hit here drink this im beastly sorry i told you but i certainly thought that you would have had some idea  i have been a thickheaded idiot wolfenden exclaimed there have been heaps of things from which i might have guessed something near the truth at any rate what a fool she must have thought me  the two men were silent outside in the street there was a rush for a special edition and a half cheer rang in the room a waiter entered with a handful of copies which were instantly seized upon wolfenden secured one and read the headings       mobilization declared      all leave cancelled      cabinet council still sitting  densham do you realise that we are really in for war  densham nodded  i dont think there can be any doubt about it myself what a thunderbolt by the bye where is your friend mr sabin  wolfenden shook his head  i do not know i came to london partially to see him i have an account to settle when we do meet at present he has disappeared densham  well  if miss sabin has become the princess helène of bourbon who is mr sabin  i am not sure densham answered i have been looking into the genealogy of the family and if he is really her uncle there is only one man whom he can bethe duke de souspennier  souspennier wasnt he banished from france for something or otherintriguing for the restoration of the monarchy i think it was  densham nodded  yes he disappeared at the time of the commune and since then he is supposed to have been in asia somewhere he has quite a history i believe and at different times has been involved in several european complications i shouldnt be at all surprised if he isnt our man mr sabin has rather the look of a man who has travelled in the east and he is certainly an aristocrat  wolfenden was suddenly thoughtful  harcutt would be very much interested in this he declared whats up outside  there had been a crash in the street and the sound of a horse plunging the two men walked to the windows the débris of a hansom was lying in the road with one wheel hopelessly smashed a few yards off a man covered with mud rose slowly up from the wreck densham and wolfenden simultaneously recognised him  it is felix wolfenden exclaimed come on  they both hurried out into the street the driver of the hansom who also was covered with mud stood talking to felix while staunching the blood from a wound in his forehead  im very sorry sir he was saying i hope youll remember as it was your orders to risk an accident sooner than lose sight of tother gent mines a good oss but what is he against a pair and a light brougham and piccadilly aint the place for a chase of this sort itll cost me three pun ten sir to say nothing of the wheel  felix motioned him impatiently to be silent and thrust a note into his hand  if the damage comes to more than that he said ask for me at the russian embassy and i will pay it here is my card  felix was preparing to enter another cab but wolfenden laid his hand upon his shoulder  wont you come into my club here and have a wash he suggested i am afraid that you have cut your cheek  felix raised his handkerchief to his face and found it covered with blood  thank you lord wolfenden he said i should be glad to you seem destined always to play the part of the good samaritan to me  they both went with him into the lavatory  do you know he asked wolfenden when he had sponged his face whom i was following  wolfenden shook his head  mr sabin he suggested  not mr sabin himself felix answered but almost the same thing it was foo cha his chinese servant who has just arrived in england have you any idea where mr sabin is  they both shook their heads  i do not know wolfenden said but i am very anxious to find out i have an account to settle with him  and i felix murmured in a low tone have a very much longer one against him tonight if i am not too late there will be a balance struck between us i have lost foo cha but others better skilled than i am are in search of his master they will succeed too they always succeed what have you against him lord wolfenden  wolfenden hesitated yet why not tell the man the truth he had nothing to gain by concealment  he forced himself into my fathers house in norfolk and obtained either by force or craft some valuable papers my father was in delicate health and we fear that the shock will cost him his reason  do you want to know what they were felix said i can tell you do you want to know what he required them for i can tell you that too he has concocted a marvellous scheme and if he is left to himself for another hour or two he will succeed but i have no fear i have set working a mightier machinery than even he can grapple with  they had walked together into the smokeroom felix seemed somewhat shaken and was glad to rest for a few minutes  has he outstepped the law been guilty of any crime wolfenden asked he is daring enough  felix laughed shortly he was lighting a cigarette but his hand trembled so that he could scarcely hold the match  a further reaching arm than the law he said dropping his voice more powerful than governments even by this time his whereabouts is known if we are only in time that is the only fear  cannot you tell us wolfenden asked something of this wonderful scheme of hiswhy was he so anxious to get those papers and drawings from my fatherto what purpose can he possibly put them  felix hesitated  well he said why not you have a right to know understand that i myself have only the barest outline of it i will tell you this however mr sabin is the duc de souspennier a frenchman of fabulous wealth who has played many strange parts in european history amongst other of his accomplishments he is a mechanical and strategical genius he has studied under addison in america one subject only for three yearsthe destruction of warships and fortifications by electrical contrivances unknown to the general world then he came to england and collected a vast amount of information concerning your navy and coast defences in many different waysfinally he sent a girl to play the part of typist to your father whom he knew to be the greatest living authority upon all naval matters connected with your country every line he wrote was copied and sent to mr sabin until by some means your fathers suspicions were aroused and the girl was dismissed the last portion of your fathers work consisted of a set of drawings of no fewer than twentyseven of englands finest vessels every one of which has a large proportion of defective armour plating which would render the vessels utterly useless in case of war these drawings show the exact position of the defective plates and it was to secure these illustrations that mr sabin paid that daring visit to your father on tuesday morning now what he professes broadly is that he has elaborated a scheme by means of which combined with the aid of his inventions a few torpedo boats can silence every fort in the thames and leave london at the mercy of any invaders at the same time his plans include the absolutely safe landing of troops on the east and south coast at certain selected spots this scheme together with some very alarming secret information affecting the great majority of your battleships will he asserts with absolute confidence place your country at the mercy of any power to whom he chooses to sell it he offered it to russia first and then to germany germany has accepted his terms and will declare war upon england the moment she has his whole scheme and inventions in her possession  wolfenden and densham looked at one another partly incredulous partly aghast it was like a page from the arabian nights surely such a thing as this was not possible yet even that short silence was broken by the cry of the newsboys out in the street       germany arming      reported declaration of war     chapter xxxviii  the men who saved england   mr sabin leaned back in his chair with a long deep sigh of content the labour of years was concluded at last with that final little sketch his work was done a pile of manuscripts and charts lay before him everything was in order he took a bill of lading from his lettercase and pinned it carefully to the rest then he glanced at his watch and taking a cigarettecase from his pocket began to smoke  there was a knock at the door and mr sabin who had recognised the approaching footsteps glanced up carelessly  what is it foo cha i told you that i would ring when i wanted you  the chinaman glided to his side  master he said softly i have fears there is something not good in the air  mr sabin turned sharply around  what do you mean he asked  foo cha was apologetic but serious  master i was followed from the house of the german by a man who drove fast after me in a twowheeled cab he lost me on the way but there are others i have been into the street and i am sure of it the house is being watched on all sides  mr sabin drew a quiet little breath for a moment his haggard face seemed almost ghastly he recovered himself however with an effort  we are not in china foo cha he said i have done nothing against the law of this country no man can enter here if we resist if we are really being watched it must be by persons in the pay of the russian but they can do nothing it is too late knigenstein will be here in half an hour the thing will be settled then once and for ever  foo cha was troubled still  me afraid he admitted frankly strange men this end and that end of street me no like it ah  the front door bell rang softly it was a timid hesitating ring as though some one had but feebly touched the knob foo cha and his master looked at one another in silence there was something almost ominous in that gentle peal  you must see who it is foo cha mr sabin said it may be knigenstein come early if so show him in at once to everybody else the house is empty  foo cha bowed silently and withdrew he struck a match in the dark passage and lit the hanging gaslamp then he opened the door cautiously  one man alone was standing there foo cha looked at him in despair it was certainly not knigenstein nor was there any sign of his carriage in the street the stranger was a man of middle height squarely built and stout he wore a long black overcoat and he stood with his hands in his pockets  what you want foo cha asked what you want with me  the man did not answer at once but he stepped inside into the passage foo cha tried to shut the door in his face but it was like pushing against a mountain  where is your master he asked  master he not here foo cha answered with glib and untruthful earnestness indeed he is not herequite true he come tomorrow i preparing house for him what do you want go away or me call policeman  the intruder smiled indulgently into the chinamans earnest upturned face  foo cha he said that is enough take this card to your master mr sabin  foo cha was ready to begin another torrent of expostulations but in the gaslight he met the newcomers steadfast gaze and he was silent the stranger was dressed in the garb of a superior working man but his speech and manner indicated a very different station foo cha took the card and left him in the passage he made his way softly into the sittingroom and as he entered he turned the key in the lock behind him there at any rate was a moment or two of respite  master he said there is a man there whom we cannot stop when me tell him you no here he laugh at me he will see you he no go way he laugh again when i try shut the door he give me card i no understand what on it  mr sabin stretched out his hand and took the card from the chinamans fingers there seemed to be one or two words upon it traced in a delicate sloping handwriting mr sabin had snatched at the little piece of pasteboard with some impatience but the moment he had read those few words a remarkable change came over him he started as though he had received an electric shock the pupils of his eyes seemed hideously dilated the usual pallor of his face was merged in a ghastly whiteness and then after the first shock came a look of deep and utter despair his hand fell to his side a halfmuttered imprecation escaped from his trembling lips yet he laid the card gently even with reverence upon the desk before him  you can show him in foo cha he directed in a low tone show him in at once  foo cha glided out disappointed something had gone terribly wrong he was sure of that he went slowly downstairs his eyes fixed upon the dark figure standing motionless in the dimlylit hall he drew a sharp breath which sounded through his yellow protuberant teeth like a hiss a single stroke of that long knifeit would be so easy then he remembered the respect with which mr sabin had treated that card and he sighed perhaps it would be a mistake it might make evil worse he beckoned to the stranger and conducted him upstairs  mr sabin received his visitor standing he was still very pale but his face had resumed its wonted impassiveness in the dim lamplit room he could see very little of his visitor only a thickset man with dark eyes and a closelycropped black beard he was roughly dressed yet held himself well the two men eyed one another steadily for several moments before any speech passed between them  you are surprised the stranger said i do not wonder at it perhapsyou have been much engrossed it is saidyou had even forgotten  mr sabins lips curled in a bitter smile  one does not forget those things he said to business let me know what is required of me  it has been reported the stranger said that you have conceived and brought to great perfection a comprehensive and infallible scheme for the conquest of this country further that you are on the point of handing it over to the emperor of germany for the use of that country i think i may conclude that the report is correct he added with a glance at the table we are not often misinformed  the report mr sabin assented is perfectly correct  we have taken counsel upon the matter the stranger continued and i am here to acquaint you with our decision the papers are to be burnt and the appliances to be destroyed forthwith no portion of them is to be shown to the german government or any person representing that country nor to any other power further you are to leave england within two months  mr sabin stood quite still his hands resting lightly upon the desk in front of him his eyes fixed on vacancy were looking far out of that shabby little room back along the avenues of time thronged with the fragments of his broken dreams he realised once more the full glory of his daring and ambitious scheme he saw his country revelling again in her old splendour stretching out her limbs and taking once more the foremost place among her sister nations he saw the pageantry and rich colouring of imperialism firing the imagination of her children drawing all hearts back to their allegiance breaking through the hard crust of materialism which had spread like an evil dream through the land he saw himself great and revered the patriot the richelieu of his days the adored of the people the friend and restorer of his king once more he was a figure in european history the consort of emperors the man whose slightest word could shake the money markets of the world he saw all these things as though for the last time with strange unreal vividness once more their full glory warmed his blood and dazzled his eyes then a flash of memory an effort of realisation chilled him his feet were upon the earth again his head was heavy that thickset motionless figure before him seemed like the incarnation of his despair  i shall appeal he said hoarsely england is no friend of ours  the man shrugged his shoulders  england is tolerant at least he said and she has sheltered us  i shall appeal mr sabin repeated  the man shook his head  it is the order of the high council he said there is no appeal  it is my lifes work mr sabin faltered  your lifes work the man said slowly should be with us  god knows why i ever  the man stretched out a white hand which gleamed through the semidarkness mr sabin stopped short  you very nearly he said solemnly pronounced your own deathsentence if you had finished what you were about to say i could never have saved you be wise friend this is a disappointment to you well is not our life one long torturing disappointment what of us indeed we are like the waves which beat ceaselessly against the seashore what we gain one day we lose the next it is fate it is life once more friend remember farewell                                       mr sabin was left alone a martyr to his thoughts already it was past the hour for knigensteins visit should he remain and brave the storm or should he catch the boattrain from charing cross and hasten to hide himself in one of the most remote quarters of the civilised world in any case it was a dreary outlook for him not only had this dearly cherished scheme of his come crashing about his head but he had very seriously compromised himself with a great country the emperors gracious letter was in his pockethe smiled grimly to himself as he thought for a moment of the consternation of berlin and of knigensteins disgrace and then the luxury of choice was suddenly denied him he was brought back to the present and a sense of its paramount embarrassments by a pealing ring at the bell and the trampling of horses feet in the street he had no time to rescind his previous instructions to foo cha before knigenstein himself wrapped in a great sealskin coat and muffled up to the chin with a silk handkerchief was shown into the room  the ambassadors usually phlegmatic face bore traces of some anxiety behind his spectacles his eyes glittered nervously he grasped mr sabins hand with unwonted cordiality and was evidently much relieved to have found him  my dear souspennier he said this is a great occasion i am a little late but as you can imagine i am overwhelmed with work of the utmost importance you have finished now i hope you are ready for me  i am as ready for you mr sabin said grimly as i ever shall be  what do you mean knigenstein asked sharply dont tell me that anything has gone amiss i am a ruined man unless you carry out your covenant to the letter i have pledged my word upon your honour  then i am afraid mr sabin said that we are both of us in a very tight place i am bound hand and foot there he cried pointing to the grate half choked with a pile of quivering grey ashes lies the work of seven years of my lifeseven years of intrigue of calculation of unceasing toil by this time all my american inventions which would have paralysed europe are blown sky high that is the position knigenstein we are undone  knigenstein was shaking like a child he laid his hand upon mr sabins arm and gripped it fiercely  souspennier he said if you are speaking the truth i am ruined and disgraced for ever the emperor will never forgive me i shall be dismissed and banished i have pledged my word for yours you cannot mean to play me false like this if there is any personal favour or reward which the emperor can grant it is yoursi will answer for it i will answer for it too that war shall be declared against france within six months of the conclusion of peace with england come say that you have been jesting good god man you are torturing me why have you seen the papers tonight the emperor has been hasty i own but he has already struck the first blow war is as good as declared i am waiting for my papers every hour  i cannot help it mr sabin said doggedly the thing is at an end to give up all the fruits of my workthe labour of the best years of my lifeis as bitter to me as your dilemma is to you but it is inevitable be a man knigenstein put the best face on it you can  the utter impotence of all that he could say was suddenly revealed to knigenstein in mr sabins set face and hopeless words his tone of entreaty changed to one of anger the veins on his forehead stood out like knotted string his mouth twitched as he spoke he could not control himself  you have made up your mind he cried very well russia has bought you very well if lobenski has bribed you with all the gold in christendom you shall never enjoy it you shall not live a year i swear it you have insulted and wronged our country our fatherland listen a word shall be breathed in the ears of a handful of our officers where you go they shall go if you leave england you will be struck on the cheek in the first public place at which you show yourself if one falls there are othershundreds thousands an army oh you shall not escape my friend but if ever you dared to set foot in germany  i can assure you mr sabin interrupted that i shall take particular care never to visit your delightful country elsewhere i think i can take care of myself but listen knigenstein all your talk about russia and playing you false is absurd if i had wished to deal with lobenski i could have done so instead of with you i have not even seen him a greater hand than his has stopped me a greater even than the hand of your emperor  knigenstein looked at him as one looks at a madman  there is no greater hand on earth he said than the hand of his imperial majesty the emperor of germany  mr sabin smiled  you are a german he said and you know little of these things yet you call yourself a diplomatist and i suppose you have some knowledge of what this means  he lifted the lamp from the table and walked to the wall opposite to the door knigenstein followed him closely before them high up as the fingers of a man could reach was a small irregular red patchsomething between a cross and a star mr sabin held the lamp high over his head and pointed to the mark  do you know what that means he asked  the man by his side groaned  yes he answered with a gesture of abject despair i know  mr sabin walked back to the table and set down the lamp  you know now he said coolly who has intervened  if i had had any idea knigenstein said that you were one of them i should not have treated with you  it was many years ago mr sabin said with a sigh my father was half a russian you know it served my purpose whilst i was envoy at teheran since then i had lost sight of them i thought that they too had lost sight of me i was mistakenonly an hour ago i was visited by a chief official they knew everything they forbade everything as a matter of fact they have saved england  and ruined us knigenstein groaned i must go and telegraph but souspennier one word  mr sabin looked up  you are a brave man and a patriot you want to see your country free well why not free it still you and i are philosophers we know that life after all is an uncertain thing hold to your bargain with us it will be to your death i do not deny that but i will pledge the honour of my country i will give you the holy word of the emperor that we will faithfully carry out our part of the contract and the whole glory shall be yours you will be immortalised you will win fame that shall be deathless your name will be enshrined in the heart of your countrys history  mr sabin shook his head slowly  my dear knigenstein he said pray dont misunderstand me i do not cast the slightest reflection upon your emperor or your honour but if ever there was a country which required watching it is yours i could not carry your pledges with me into oblivion and there is no one to whom i could leave the legacy that being the case i think that i prefer to live  knigenstein buttoned up his coat and sighed  i am a ruined man souspennier he said but i bear you no malice let me leave you a little word of warning though the nihilists are not the only people in the world who have the courage and the wit to avenge themselves farewell  mr sabin broke into a queer little laugh as he listened to his guests departing footsteps then he lit a cigarette and called to foo cha for some coffee     chapter xxxix  the heart of the princess   when wolfenden opened his paper on saturday morning london had already drawn a great breath partly of relief partly of surprise for the black headlines which topped the columns of the papers the placards in the streets and the cry of the newsboys all declared a most remarkable change in the political situation       the german emperor explains      there will be no war      german consul ordered home      no rupture  wolfenden in common with most of his fellowcountrymen could scarcely believe his eyes yet there it was in plain black and white the dogs of war had been called back germany was climbing downnot with dignity she had gone too far for thatbut with a scuffle wolfenden read the paper through before he even thought of his letters then he began to open them slowly the first was from his mother the admiral was distinctly better the doctors were more hopeful he turned to the next one it was in a delicate foreign handwriting and exhaled a faint perfume which seemed vaguely familiar to him he opened it and his heart stood still                           14 grosvenor square                               london w       will you come and see me today about four oclockhelÈne  he looked at his watchfour oclock seemed a very long way off he decided that he would go out and find felix but almost immediately the door was opened and that very person was shown in  felix was radiant he appeared to have grown years younger he was immaculately dressed and he wore an exquisite orchid in his buttonhole  wolfenden greeted him warmly  have you seen the paper he asked do you know the news  felix laughed  of course you may not believe it but it is true that i am the person who has saved your country and i am quits at last with herbert de la meux duc de souspennier  meaning i suppose the person whom we have been accustomed to callmr sabin wolfenden remarked  exactly  wolfenden pushed an easy chair towards his visitor and produced some cigarettes  i must say he continued that i should exceedingly like to know how the thing was done  felix smiled  that my dear friend he said you will never know no one will ever know the cause of germanys suddenly belligerent attitude and her equally speedy climbdown there are many pages of diplomatic history which the world will never read and this is one of them come and lunch with me lord wolfenden my vow is paid and without bloodshed i am a free man and my promotion is assured today is the happiest of my life  wolfenden smiled and looked at the letter on the table before him might it not also be the happiest day of his own life                                       and it was punctually at four oclock he presented himself at grosvenor square and was ushered into one of the smaller reception rooms helène came to him at once a smile halfshy halfapologetic upon her lips he was conscious from the moment of her entrance of a change in her deportment towards him she held in her hand a small locket  i wanted to ask you lord wolfenden she said drawing her fingers slowly away from his lingering clasp does this locket belong to you  he glanced at it and shook his head at once  i never saw it before in my life he declared i do not wear a watch chain and i dont possess anything of that sort  she threw it contemptuously away from her into the grate  a woman lied to me about it she said slowly i am ashamed of myself that i should have listened to her even for a second i chanced to look at it last night and it suddenly occurred to me where i had seen it it was on a mans watchchain but not on yours  surely he said it belongs to mr sabin  she nodded and held out both her hands  will you forgive me she begged softly andandi thinki promised to send for you                                       they had been together for nearly an hour when the door opened abruptly and the young man whom wolfenden had seen with helène in the barouche entered the room he stared in amazement at her and rudely at wolfenden helène rose and turned to him with a smile  henri she said let me present to you the english gentleman whom i am going to marry prince henri of ortrenslord wolfenden  the young man barely returned wolfendens salute he turned with flashing eyes to helène and muttered a few hasty words in french  a kingdom and my betrothed in one day it is too much we will see  he left the room hurriedly helène laughed  he has gone to find the duchess she said and there will be a scene let us go out in the park  they walked about under the trees suddenly they came face to face with mr sabin he was looking a little worn but he was as carefully dressed as usual and he welcomed them with a smile and an utter absence of any embarrassment  so soon he remarked pleasantly you englishmen are as prompt in love as you are in war lord wolfenden it is an admirable trait  helène laid her hand upon his arm yes it was no fancy his hair was greyer and heavy lines furrowed his brow  uncle she said believe me that i am sorry for you though for myselfi am glad  he looked at her kindly yet with a faint contempt  the bourbon blood runs very slowly in your veins child he said after all i begin to doubt whether you would have made a queen as for myselfwell i am resigned i am going to pau to play golf  for how long i wonder she said smiling will you be able to content yourself there  for a month or two he answered until i have lost the taste of defeat then i have plansbut never mind i will tell you later on you will all hear of me again so far as you two are concerned at any rate he added i have no need to reproach myself my failure seems to have brought you happiness  he passed on and they both watched his slim figure lost in the throng of passersby  he is a great man she murmured he knows how to bear defeat  he is a great man wolfenden answered but none the less i am not sorry to see the last of mr sabin     chapter xl  the way to pau   the way to pau which mr sabin chose may possibly have been the most circuitous but it was certainly the safest although not a muscle of his face had moved although he had not by any physical movement or speech betrayed his knowledge of the fact he was perfectly well aware that his little statement as to his future movements was overheard and carefully noted by the tall immaculately dressed young man who by some strange chance seemed to have been at his elbow since he had left his rooms an hour ago into the lions mouth indeed he muttered to himself grimly as he hailed a hansom at the corner and was driven homewards the limes of berlin were very beautiful but it was not with any immediate idea of sauntering beneath them that a few hours later he was driven to euston and stepped into an engaged carriage on the liverpool express there with a travelling cap drawn down to his eyes and a rug pulled up to his throat he sat in the far corner of his compartment apparently enjoying an evening paperas a matter of fact anxiously watching the platform he had taken care to allow himself only a slender margin of time in two minutes the train glided out of the station  he drew a little sigh of reliefhe who very seldom permitted himself the luxury of even the slightest revelation of his feelings at least he had a start then he unlocked a travelling case and drawing out an atlas sat with it upon his knee for some time when he closed it there was a frown upon his face  america he exclaimed softly to himself what a lack of imagination even the sound of the place seems to denote it is the most ignominious retreat i have ever made  you made the common mistake a quiet voice at his elbow remarked of many of the worlds greatest diplomatists you underrated your adversaries  mr sabin distinctly started and clutching at his rug leaned back in his corner a young man in a tweed travelling suit was standing by the opposite window behind him mr sabin noticed for the first time a narrow mahogany door mr sabin drew a short breath and was himself again underneath the rug his fingers stole into his overcoat pocket and clasped something cold and firm  one at least he said grimly i perceive that i have held too lightly will you pardon a novice at necromancy if he asks you how you found your way here  felix smiled  a little forethought he remarked a little luck and a sovereign tip to an accommodating inspector the carriage in which you are travelling is as you will doubtless perceive before you reach your journeys end a species of saloon this little doortouching the one through which he had issuedleads on to a lavatory and on the other side is a nonsmoking carriage i found that you had engaged a carriage on this train by posing as your servant i selected this one as being particularly suited to an old gentleman of nervous disposition and arranged also that the nonsmoking portion should be reserved for me  mr sabin nodded and how he asked did you know that i meant to go to america  felix shrugged his shoulders and took a seat  well he said i concluded that you would be looking for a change of air somewhere and i really could not see what part of the world you had left open to yourself america is the only country strong enough to keep you besides i reckoned a little upon that curiosity with regard to undeveloped countries which i have observed to be one of your traits so far as i am aware you have never resided long in america  neither have i even visited kamtchatka or greenland mr sabin remarked  i understand you felix remarked nodding his head america is certainly one of the last places one would have dreamed of looking for you you will find it i am afraid politically unborn your own little methods at any rate would scarcely achieve popularity there further its sympathies of course are with democratic france i can imagine that you and the president of the united states would represent opposite poles of thought yet there were two considerations which weighed with me  this is very interesting mr sabin remarked may i know what they were to be permitted a glimpse into the inward workings of a brain like yours is indeed a privilege  felix bowed with a gratified smile upon his lips the satire of mr sabins dry tone was apparently lost upon him  you are most perfectly welcome he declared in the first place i said to myself that kamtchatka and greenland although equally interesting to you would be quite unable to afford themselves the luxury of offering you an asylum you must seek the shelter of a great and powerful country and one which you had never offended and save america there is none such in the world secondly you are a sybarite and you do not without very serious reasons place yourself outside the pale of civilisation thirdly america is the only country save those which are barred to you where you could play golf  you are really a remarkable young man sabin declared softly stroking his little grey imperial you have read me like a book i am humiliated that the course of my reasoning should have been so transparent to prove the correctness of your conclusions see the little volume which i had brought to read on my way to liverpool  he handed it out to felix it was entitled the golf courses of the world and a leaf was turned down at the chapter headed united states  i wish he remarked that you were a golfer i should like to have asked your opinion about that plan of the myopia golf links to me it seems cramped and the bunkers are artificial  felix looked at him admiringly  you are a wonderful man he said you do not bear me any illwill then  none in the least mr sabin said quietly i never bear personal grudges so far as i am concerned i never have a personal enemy it is fate itself which vanquished me you were simply an instrument you do not figure in my thoughts as a person against whom i bear any illwill i am glad though that you did not cash my cheque for £20000  felix smiled you went to see then he asked  i took the liberty mr sabin answered of stopping payment of it  it will never be presented felix said i tore it into pieces directly i left you  mr sabin nodded  quixotic he murmured  the express was rushing on through the night mr sabin thrust his hand into his bag and took out a handful of cigars he offered one to felix who accepted and lit it with the air of a man enjoying the reasonable civility of a chance fellow passenger  you had i presume mr sabin remarked some object in coming to see the last of me i do not wish to seem unduly inquisitive but i feel a little natural interest or shall we say curiosity as to the reason for this courtesy on your part  you are quite correct felix answered i am here with a purpose i am the bearer of a message to you  may i ask a friendly message or otherwise  his fingers were tightening upon the little hard substance in his pocket but he was already beginning to doubt whether after all felix had come as an enemy  friendly was the prompt answer i bring you an offer  from lobenski  from his august master the czar himself has plans for you  his serene majesty mr sabin murmured has always been most kind  since you left the country of the shah felix continued russian influence in central asia has been gradually upon the wane all manner of means have been employed to conceal this but the unfortunate fact remains you were the only man who ever thoroughly grasped the situation and attained any real influence over the master of western asia your removal from teheran was the result of an intrigue on the part of the english it was the greatest misfortune which ever befel russia  and your offer mr sabin asked  is that you return to teheran not as the secret agent but as the accredited ambassador of russia with an absolutely free hand and unlimited powers  such an offer mr sabin remarked ten years ago would have made russia mistress of all asia  the czar felix said is beginning to appreciate that but what was possible then is possible now  mr sabin shook his head i am ten years older he said and the shah who was my friend is dead  the new shah felix said has a passion for intrigue and the sands around teheran are magnificent for golf  mr sabin shook his head  too hard he said and too monotonous i am peculiar perhaps in that respect but i detest artificial bunkers now there is a little valley he continued thoughtfully about seven miles north of teheran where something might be done i wonder  you accept felix asked quietly  mr sabin shook his head  no i decline  it was a shock to felix but he hid his disappointment  absolutely  and finally  why  i am ten years too old  that is resentment  mr sabin denied it  no why should i not be frank with you my friend what i would have done for russia ten years ago i would not do today she has made friends with the french republic she has done more than recognise the existence of that iniquitous institutionshe has pressed her friendship upon the presidentshe has spoken the word of alliance henceforth my feeling for russia has changed i have no object to gain in her development i am richer than the richest of her nobles and there is no title in europe for which i would exchange my own you see russia has absolutely nothing to offer me on the other hand what would benefit russia in asia would ruin england and england has given me and many of my kind a shelter and has even held aloof from france of the two countries i would much prefer to aid england if i had been the means of destroying her asiatic empire ten years ago it would have been to me today a source of lasting regret there my friend i have paid you the compliment of perfect frankness  if felix said slowly the price of your success at teheran should be the breach of our covenants with francewhat then remember that it is the country whose friendship is pleasing to us not the government you cannot seriously doubt but that an autocrat such as the czar would prefer to extend his hand to an emperor of france than to soil his fingers with the clasp of a tradesman  mr sabin shook his head softly i have told you why i decline he said but in my heart there are many other reasons for one i am no longer a young man this last failure of mine has aged me i have no heart for fresh adventures  felix sighed  my mission to you comes he said at an unfortunate time for the present then i accept defeat  the fault mr sabin murmured is in no way with you my refusal was a thing predestined the czar himself could not move me  the train was slowing a little felix looked out of the window  we are nearing crewe he said i shall alight then and return to london you are for america then  beyond doubt mr sabin declared  felix drew from his pocket a letter  if you will deliver this for me he said you will do me a kindness and you will make a pleasant acquaintance  mr sabin glanced at the imprescription it was addressed to                      mrs j b peterson                          lenox                               mass usa  i will do so with pleasure he remarked slipping it into his dressingcase  and remember this felix remarked glancing out at the platform along which they were gliding you are a marked man disguise is useless for you be ever on your guard you and i have been enemies but after all you are too great a man to fall by the hand of a german assassin farewell  i will thank you for your caution and remember it mr sabin answered farewell  felix raised his hat and mr sabin returned the salute the whistle sounded felix stepped out on to the platform  you will not forget the letter he asked  i will deliver it in person without fail mr sabin answered     chapter xli  mr and mrs watson of new york   it was their third day out and mr sabin was enjoying the voyage very much indeed the calipha was a small boat sailing to boston instead of new york and contemptuously termed by the oceangoing public an old tub she carried consequently only seven passengers besides mr sabin and it had taken him but a very short time to decide that of those seven passengers not one was interested in him or his affairs he had got clear away for the present at any rate from all the complications and dangers which had followed upon the failure of his great scheme of course by this time the news of his departure and destination was known to every one whom his movements concerned that was almost a matter of course and realising even the impossibility of successful concealment mr sabin had made no attempt at any he had given the name of sabin to the steward and had secured the decks cabin for his own use he chatted every day with the captain who treated him with respect and in reply to a question from one of the stewards who was a frenchman he admitted that he was the duc de souspennier and that he was travelling incognito only as a whim he was distinctly popular with every one of the seven passengers who were a little doubtful how to address him but whom he succeeded always in putting entirely at their ease he entered too freely into the little routine of steamer life he played shuffleboard for an hour or more every morning and was absolutely invincible at the game he brought his golf clubs on deck one evening after dinner and explained the manner of their use to an admiring little circle of the seven passengers the captain and doctor he rigorously supported the pool each day and he even took a hand at a mild game of poker one wet afternoon when timidly invited to do so by mr hiram shedge an oil merchant of boston he had in no way the deportment or manner of a man who had just passed through a great crisis nor would any one have gathered from his conversation or demeanour that he was the head of one of the greatest houses in europe and a millionaire the first time a shadow crossed his face was late one afternoon when coming on deck a little behind the others after lunch he found them all leaning over the starboard bow gazing intently at some object a little distance off and at the same time became aware that the engines had been put to halfspeed  he was strolling towards the little group when the captain seeing him beckoned him on to the bridge  heres something that will interest you mr sabin he called out wont you step this way  mr sabin mounted the iron steps carefully but with his eyes turned seawards a large yacht of elegant shape and painted white from stern to bows was lyingto about half a mile off flying signals  mr sabin reached the bridge and stood by the captains side  a pleasure yacht he remarked what does she want  i shall know in a moment the captain answered with his glass to his eye she flew a distress signal at first for us to stand by so i suppose shes in trouble ah there it goes mainshaft broken she says  she doesnt lie like it mr sabin remarked quietly  the captain looked at him with a smile  you know a bit about yachting too he said and to tell you the truth thats just what i was thinking  holmes  yes sir  ask her what she wants us to do  the signalman touched his hat and the little row of flags ran fluttering up in the breeze  she signals herself the mayflower private yacht owner mr james watson of new york he remarked shes a beautiful boat  mr sabin who had brought his own glasses looked at her long and steadily  shes not an american built boat at any rate he remarked  an answering signal came fluttering back the captain opened his book and read it  shes going on under canvas he said but she wants us to take her owner and his wife on board  are you compelled to do so mr sabin asked  the captain laughed  not exactly im not expected to pick up passengers in mid ocean  then i shouldnt do it mr sabin said if they are in a hurry the alaska is due up today isnt she and shell be in new york in three days and the baltimore must be close behind her i should let them know that  well the captain answered i dont want fresh passengers bothering just now  the flags were run up and the replies came back as promptly the captain shut up his glass with a bang  no getting out of them he remarked to mr sabin they reply that the lady is nervous and will not wait they are coming on board at oncefor fear i should go on i suppose they add that mr watson is the largest american holder of cunard stock and a director of the american board so have them we mustthats pretty certain i must see the purser  he descended and mr sabin following him joined the little group of passengers they all stood together watching the long rowing boat which was coming swiftly towards them through the smooth sea mr sabin explained to them the messages which had passed and together they admired the disabled yacht  mr sabin touched the first mate on the arm as he passed  did you ever see a vessel like that johnson he remarked  the man shook his head  their engineer is a fool sir he declared scornfully nothing but my own eyes would make me believe theres anything serious the matter with her shaft  i agree with you mr sabin said quietly  the boat was now within hailing distance mr sabin leaned down over the side and scanned its occupants closely there was nothing in the least suspicious about them the man who sat in the stern steering was a typical american with thin sallow face and bright eyes the woman wore a thick veil but she was evidently young and when she stood up displayed a figure and clothes distinctly parisian the two came up the ladder as though perfectly used to boarding a vessel in mid ocean and the ladys nervousness was at least not apparent the captain advanced to meet them and gallantly assisted the lady on to the deck  this is captain ackinson i presume the man remarked with extended hand we are exceedingly obliged to you sir for taking us off this is my wife mrs james b watson  mrs watson raised her veil and disclosed a dark piquant face with wonderfully bright eyes  its real nice of you captain she said frankly you dont know how good it is to feel the deck of a real oceangoing steamer beneath your feet after that little sailing boat of my husbands this is the very last time i attempt to cross the atlantic except on one of your steamers  we are very glad to be of any assistance the captain answered more heartily than a few minutes before he would have believed possible full speed ahead john  there was a churning of water and dull throb of machinery restarting the little rowing boat already well away on its return journey rocked on the long waves mr watson turned to shout some final instructions then the captain beckoned to the purser  mr wilson will show you your state rooms he remarked fortunately we have plenty of room steward take the baggage down  the lady went below but mr watson remained on deck talking to the captain mr sabin strolled up to them  your yacht rides remarkably well if her shaft is really broken he remarked  mr watson nodded  shes a beautifully built boat he remarked with enthusiasm if the weather is favourable her canvas will bring her into boston harbour two days after us  i suppose the captain asked looking at her through his glass you satisfied yourself that her shaft was really broken  i did not sir mr watson answered my engineer reported it so and as i know nothing of machinery myself i was content to take his word he holds very fine diplomas and i presume he knows what he is talking about but anyway mrs watson would never have stayed upon that boat one moment longer than she was compelled shes a wonderfully nervous woman is mrs watson  thats a somewhat unusual trait for your countrywoman is it not mr sabin asked  mr j b watson looked steadily at his questioner  my wife sir he said has lived for many years on the continent she would scarcely consider herself an american  i beg your pardon mr sabin remarked courteously one can see at least that she has acquired the polish of the only habitable country in the world but if i had taken the liberty of guessing at her nationality i should have taken her to be a german  mr watson raised his eyebrows and somehow managed to drop the match he was raising to his cigar  you astonish me very much sir he remarked i always looked upon the fair rotund woman as the typical german face  mr sabin shook his head gently  there are many types he said and nationality you know does not always go by complexion or size for instance you are very like many american gentlemen whom i have had the pleasure of meeting but at the same time i should not have taken you for an american  the captain laughed  i cant agree with you mr sabin he said mr watson appears to me to be if he will pardon my saying so the very type of the modern american man  im much obliged to you captain mr watson said cheerfully im a boston man thats sure and i believe sir im proud of it i want to know for what nationality you would have taken me if you had not been informed  i should have looked for you also mr sabin said deliberately in the streets of berlin     chapter xlii  a weak conspirator   at dinnertime mrs watson appeared in a very dainty toilette of black and white and was installed at the captains right hand she was introduced at once to mr sabin and proceeded to make herself a very agreeable companion  why i call this perfectly delightful was almost her first exclamation after a swift glance at mr sabins quiet but irreproachable dinner attire you cant imagine how pleased i am to find myself once more in civilised society i was never so dull in my life as on that poky little yacht  poky little yacht indeed mr watson interrupted with a note of annoyance in his tone the mayflower anyway cost me pretty well two hundred thousand dollars and shes nearly the largest pleasure yacht afloat  i dont care if she cost you a million dollars mrs watson answered pettishly i never want to sail on her again i prefer this infinitely  she laughed at captain ackinson and her husband continued his dinner in silence mr sabin made a mental note of two thingsfirst that mr watson did not treat his wife with that consideration which is supposed to be distinctive of american husbands and secondly that he drank a good deal of wine without becoming even a shade more amiable his wife somewhat pointedly drank water and turning her right shoulder upon her husband devoted herself to the entertainment of her two companions at the conclusion of the meal the captain was her abject slave and mr sabin was quite willing to admit that mrs j b watson whatever her nationality might be was a very charming woman  after dinner mr sabin went to his lower state room for an overcoat and whilst feeling for some cigars heard voices in the adjoining room which had been empty up to now  wont you come and walk with me james he heard mrs watson say it is such a nice evening and i want to go on deck  you can go without me then was the gruff answer im going to have a cigar in the smokeroom  you can smoke she reminded him on deck  thanks he replied but i dont care to give my laranagas to the winds you would come here and you must do the best you can you cant expect to have me dangling after you all the time  there was a silence and then the sound of mr watsons heavy tread as he left the state room followed in a moment or two by the light footsteps and soft rustle of silk skirts which indicated the departure also of his wife  mr sabin carefully enveloped himself in an ulster and stood for a moment or two wondering whether that conversation was meant to be overheard or not he rang the bell for the steward  the man appeared almost immediately mr sabin had known how to ensure prompt service  was it my fancy john or did i hear voices in the state room opposite mr sabin asked  mr and mrs watson have taken it sir the man answered  mr sabin appeared annoyed  you know that some of my clothes are hung up there he remarked and i have been using it as a dressingroom there are heaps of staterooms vacant surely you could have found them another  i did my best sir the man answered but they seemed to take a particular fancy to that one i couldnt get them off it nohow  did they know mr sabin asked carelessly that the room opposite was occupied  yes sir the man answered i told them that you were in number twelve and that you used this as a dressingroom but they wouldnt shift it was very foolish of them too for they wanted two one each and they could just as well have had them together  just as well mr sabin remarked quietly thank you john dont let them know i have spoken to you about it  certainly not sir  mr sabin walked upon deck as he passed the smokeroom he saw mr watson stretched upon a sofa with a cigar in his mouth mr sabin smiled to himself and passed on  the evening promenade on deck after dinner was quite a social event on board the calipha as a rule the captain and mr sabin strolled together none of the other passengers notwithstanding mr sabins courtesy towards them having yet attempted in any way to thrust their society upon him but tonight as he had half expected the captain had already a companion mrs watson with a very becoming wrap around her head and a cigarette in her mouth was walking by his side chatting gaily most of the time but listening also with an air of absorbed interest to the personal experiences which her questions provoked every now and then as they passed mr sabin sometimes walking sometimes gazing with an absorbed air at the distant chaos of sea and sky she flashed a glance of invitation upon him which he as often ignored once she half stopped and asked him some slight question but he answered it briefly standing on one side and the captain hurried her on it was a stroke of illfortune he thought to himself the coming of these two people he had had a clear start and a fair field now he was suddenly face to face with a danger the full extent of which it was hard to estimate for he could scarcely doubt but that their coming was on his account they had played their parts well but they were secret agents of the german police he smoked his cigar leisurely the object every few minutes of many side glances and covert smiles from the delicately attired little lady whose silken skirts daintily raised from the ground brushed against him every few minutes as she and her companion passed and repassed what was their plan of action he wondered if it was simply to be assassination why so elaborate an artifice and what worse place in the world could there be for anything of the sort than the narrow confines of a small steamer no there was evidently something more complex on hand was the woman brought as a decoy he wondered did they really imagine him capable of being dazzled or fascinated by any woman on the earth he smiled softly at the thought and the sight of that smile lingering upon his lips brought her to a standstill he heard suddenly the swish of her skirt and her soft voice in his ear lower down the deck the captains broad shoulders were disappearing as he passed on the way to the engineers room for his nightly visit of inspection  you have not made a single effort to rescue me she said reproachfully you are most unkind  mr sabin lifted his cap and removed the cigar from his teeth  my dear lady he said i have been suffering the pangs of the neglected but how dared i break in upon so confidential a têteàtête  you have little of the courage of your nation then she answered laughing for i gave you many opportunities but you have been engrossed with your thoughts and they succeeded at least where i failedyou were distinctly smiling when i came upon you  it was a premonition he began but she raised a little white hand flashing with rings to his lips and he was silent  please dont think it necessary to talk nonsense to me all the time she begged come i am tiredi want to sit down dont you want to take my chair down by the side of the boat there i like to watch the lights on the water and you may talk to meif you like  your husband he remarked a moment or two later as he arranged her cushions does not care for the evening air  it is sufficient for him she answered quietly that i prefer it he will not leave the smokingroom until the lights are put out  in an ordinary way he remarked that must be dull for you  in an ordinary way and every way she answered in a low tone i am always dull but after all i must not weary a stranger with my woes tell me about yourself mr sabin are you going to america on pleasure or have you business there  a faint smile flickered across mr sabins face he watched the white ash trembling upon his cigar for a moment before he spoke  i can scarcely be said to be going to america on pleasure he answered nor have i any business there let us agree that i am going because it is the one country in the world of any importance which i have never visited  you have been a great traveller then she murmured looking up at him with innocent wideopen eyes you look as though you have been everywhere wont you tell me about some of the odd places you have visited  with pleasure he answered but first wont you gratify a natural and very specific curiosity of mine i am going to a country which i have never visited before tell me a little about it let us talk about america  she stole a sudden swift glance at her questioner no he did not appear to be watching her his eyes were fixed idly upon the sheet of phosphorescent light which glittered in the steamers track nevertheless she was a little uneasy  america she said after a moments pause is the one country i detest we are only there very seldomwhen mr watsons business demands it you could not seek for information from any one worse informed than i am  how strange he said softly you are the first unpatriotic american i have ever met  you should be thankful she remarked that i am an exception isnt it pleasant to meet people who are different from other people  in the present case it is delightful  i wonder she said reflectively in which school you studied my sex and from what particular woman you learned the art of making those little speeches  i can assure you that i am a novice he declared  then you have a wonderful future before you you will make a courtier mr sabin  i shall be happy to be the humblest of attendants in the court where you are queen  such proficiency she murmured is the hall mark of insincerity you are not a man to be trusted mr sabin  try me he begged  i will i will tell you a secret  i will lock it in the furthest chamber of my inner consciousness  i am going to america for a purpose  wonderful woman he murmured to have a purpose  i am going to get a divorce  mr sabin was suddenly thoughtful  i have always understood he said that the marriage laws of america are convenient  they are humane they make me thankful that i am an american  mr sabin inclined his head slightly towards the smokingroom  does your unfortunate husband know  he does and he acquiesces he has no alternative but is that quite nice of you mr sabin to call my husband an unfortunate man  i cannot conceive he said slowly greater misery than to have possessed and lost you  she laughed gaily mr sabin permitted himself to admire that laugh it was like the tinkling of a silver bell and her teeth were perfect  you are incorrigible she said i believe that if i would let you you would make love to me  if i thought he answered that you would never allow me to make love to you i should feel like following this cigar he threw it into the sea  she sighed and tapped her little french heel upon the deck  what a pity that you are like all other men  i will say nothing so unkind of you he remarked you are unlike any other woman whom i ever met  they listened together to the bells sounding from the quarter deck it was eleven oclock the deck behind them was deserted and a fine drizzling rain was beginning to fall mrs watson removed the rug from her knees regretfully  i must go she said do you hear how late it is  you will tell me all about america he said rising and drawing back her chair tomorrow  if we can find nothing more interesting to talk about she said looking up at him with a sparkle in her dark eyes goodnight  her hand very small and white and very soft lingered in his at that moment an unpleasant voice sounded in their ears  do you know the time violet the lights are out all over the ship i dont understand what you are doing on deck  mr watson was not pleasant to look upon his eyes were puffy and swollen and he was not quite steady upon his feet his wife looked at him in cold displeasure  the lights are out in the smokeroom i suppose she said or we should not have the pleasure of seeing you goodnight mr sabin thank you so much for looking after me  mr sabin bowed and walked slowly away lighting a fresh cigarette if it was acting it was very admirably done     chapter xliii  the coming of the kaiser wilhelm   the habit of early rising was one which mr sabin had never cultivated and breakfast was a meal which he abhorred it was not until nearly midday on the following morning that he appeared on deck and he had scarcely exchanged his customary greeting with the captain before he was joined by mr watson who had obviously been on the lookout for him  i want sir the latter commenced to apologise to you for my conduct last night  mr sabin looked at him keenly  there is no necessity for anything of the sort he said if any apology is owing at all it is i think to your wife  mr watson shook his head vigorously  no sir he declared i am ashamed to say that i am not very clear as to the actual expressions i made but mrs watson has assured me that my behaviour to you was discourteous in the extreme  i hope you will think no more of it i had already mr sabin said forgotten the circumstance it is not of the slightest consequence  you are very good mr watson said softly  i had the pleasure mr sabin remarked of an interesting conversation with your wife last night you are a very fortunate man  i think so indeed sir mr watson replied modestly  american women mr sabin continued looking meditatively out to sea are very fascinating  i have always found them so mr watson agreed  mrs watson mr sabin said told me so much that was interesting about your wonderful country that i am looking forward to my visit more than ever  mr watson darted a keen glance at his companion he was suddenly on his guard for the first time he realised something of the resources of this man with whom he had to deal  my wife he said knows really very little of her native country she has lived nearly all her life abroad  so i perceived mr sabin answered shall we sit down a moment mr watson one wearies so of this incessant promenading and there is a little matter which i fancy that you and i might discuss with advantage  mr watson obeyed in silence this was a wonderful man with whom he had to deal already he felt that all the elaborate precautions of his coming had been wasted he might be mr james b watson the new york yacht owner and millionaire to the captain and his seven passengers but he was nothing of the sort to mr sabin he shrugged his shoulders and followed him to a seat after all silence was a safe card  im going mr sabin said to be very frank with you i know of course who you are  mr watson shrugged his shoulders  do you he remarked dryly  mr sabin bowed with a faint smile at the corner of his lips  certainly he answered you are mr james b watson of new york and the lady with you is your wife now i want to tell you a little about myself  most interested im sure mr watson murmured  my real name mr sabin said turning a little as though to face his companion is victor duc de souspennier it suits me at present to travel under the name by which i was known in england and by which you are in the habit of addressing me mr watson im leaving england because a certain scheme of mine which if successful would have revolutionised the whole face of europe has by a most unfortunate chance become a failure i have incurred thereby the resentment perhaps i should say the just resentment of a great nation i am on my way to the country where i concluded i should be safest against those means of shall i say retribution or vengeance which will assuredly be used against me now what i want to say to you mr watson is thisi am a rich man and i value my life at a great deal of money i wonder if by any chance you understand me  mr watson smiled  im curious to know he said softly at what price you value yourself  my account in new york mr sabin said quietly is i believe something like ten thousand pounds  fifty thousand dollars mr watson remarked is a nice little sum for one but an awkward amount to divide  mr sabin lit a cigarette and breathed more freely he began to see his way  i forgot the lady he murmured the expense of cabling is not great for the sake of argument let us say twenty thousand  mr watson rose  so far as im concerned he said it is a satisfactory sum forgive me if i leave you for a few minutes i must have a little talk with mrs watson  mr sabin nodded  we will have a cigar together after lunch he said i must have my morning game of shuffleboard with the captain  mr watson went below and mr sabin played shuffleboard with his usual deadly skill  a slight mist had settled around them by the time the game was over and the foghorn was blowing the captain went on the bridge and the engines were checked to half speed  mr sabin leaned over the side of the vessel and gazed thoughtfully into the dense white vapour  i think he said softly to himself that after all im safe  there was perfect silence on the ship even the luncheon gong had not sounded the passengers having been summoned in a whisper by the deck steward the fog seemed to be getting denser and the sea was like glass suddenly there was a little commotion aft and the captain leaning forward shouted some brief orders the foghorn emitted a series of spasmodic and hideous shrills and beyond a slight drifting the steamer was almost motionless  mr sabin understood at once that somewhere it might be close at hand or it might be a mile away the presence of another steamer had been detected  the same almost ghostlike stillness continued orders were passed backward and forward in whispers the men walked backward and forward on tiptoe and then suddenly without any warning they passed out into the clear air the mist rolled away the sun shone down upon them again and the decks dried as though by magic cheerful voices broke in upon the chill and unnatural silence the machinery recommenced to throb and the passengers who had finished lunch went upon deck every one was attracted at once by the sight of a large white steamer about a mile on the starboard side  mr watson joined the captain who was examining her through his glass  manofwar isnt she he inquired  the captain nodded  not much doubt about that he answered look at her guns the odd part of it is too she is flying no flag we shall know who she is in a minute or two though  mr sabin descended the steps on his way to a late luncheon as he turned the corner he came face to face with mr watson whose eyes were fixed upon the coming steamer with a very curious expression  manofwar mr sabin remarked you look as though you had seen her before  mr watson laughed harshly  i should like to see her he remarked at the bottom of the sea  mr sabin looked at him in surprise  you know her then he remarked  i know her mr watson answered too well she is the kaiser wilhelm and she is going to rob me of twenty thousand pounds     chapter xliv  the germans are annoyed   mr sabin ate his luncheon with unimpaired appetite and with his usual care that everything of which he partook should be so far as possible of the best the close presence of the german manofwar did not greatly alarm him he had some knowledge of the laws and courtesies of maritime life and he could not conceive by what means short of actual force he could be inveigled on board of her mr watsons last words had been a little disquieting but he probably held an exaggerated opinion as to the powers possessed by his employers mr sabin had been in many tighter places than this and he had sufficient belief in the country of his recent adoption to congratulate himself that it was an english boat on which he was a passenger he proceeded to make himself agreeable to mrs watson who in a charming costume of blue and white and a fascinating little hat had just come on to luncheon  i have been talking he remarked after a brief pause in their conversation to your husband this morning  she looked up at him with a meaning smile upon her face  so he has been telling me  i hope mr sabin continued gently that your advice to himi take it for granted that he comes to you for advicewas in my favour  it was very much in your favour she answered leaning across towards him i think that you knew it would be  i hoped at least  mr sabin broke off suddenly in the midst of his sentence and turning round looked out of the open porthole mrs watson had dropped her knife and fork and was holding her hands to her ears the saloon itself seemed to be shaken by the booming of a gun fired at close quarters  what is it she exclaimed looking across at him with frightened eyes what can have happened england is not at war with anybody is she  mr sabin looked up with a quiet smile from the salad which he was mixing  it is simply a signal from another ship he answered she wants us to stop  what ship do you know anything about it do you know what they want  not exactly mr sabin said at the same time i have some idea the ship who fired that signal is a german manofwar and you see we are stopping  of the two mrs watson was certainly the most nervous her fingers shook so that the wine in her glass was spilt she set her glass down and looked across at her companion  they will take you away she murmured  i think not mr sabin answered i am inclined to think that i am perfectly safe will you try some of my salad  a look of admiration flashed for a moment across her face  you are a wonderful man she said softly no salad thanks i am too nervous to eat let us go on deck  mr sabin rose and carefully selected a cigarette  i can assure you he said that they are powerless to do anything except attempt to frighten captain ackinson of course they might succeed in that but i dont think it is likely let us go and hear what he has to say  captain ackinson was standing alone on the deck watching the manofwars boat which was being rapidly pulled towards the calipha he was obviously in a bad temper there was a black frown upon his forehead which did not altogether disappear when he turned his head and saw them approaching  are we arrested captain mr sabin asked why couldnt they signal what they wanted  because theyre blistering idiots captain ackinson answered they blither me to stop and i signalled back to ask their reason and im dashed if they didnt put a shot across my bows as if i hadnt lost enough time already without fooling  thanks to us i am afraid captain mrs watson put in  well im not regretting that mrs watson the captain answered gallantly we got something for stopping there but we shall get nothing decent from these confounded germans i am very sure by the bye can you speak their lingo mr sabin  yes mr sabin answered i can speak german can i be of any assistance to you  you might stay with me if you will captain ackinson answered in case they dont speak english  mr sabin remained by the captains side standing with his hands behind him mrs watson leaned over the rail close at hand watching the approaching boat and exchanging remarks with the doctor in a few minutes the boat was alongside and an officer in the uniform of the german navy rose and made a stiff salute  are you the captain he inquired in stiff but correct english  the captain returned his salute  i am captain ackinson cunard ss calipha he answered what do you want with me  i am captain von dronestein in command of the kaiser wilhelm german navy was the reply i want a word or two with you in private captain ackinson can i come on board  captain ackinsons reply was not gushing he gave the necessary orders however and in a few moments captain von dronestein and a thin dark man in the dress of a civilian clambered to the deck they looked at mr sabin standing by the captains side and exchanged glances of intelligence  if you will kindly permit us captain the newcomer said we should like to speak with you in private the matter is one of great importance  mr sabin discreetly retired the captain turned on his heel and led the way to his cabin he pointed briefly to the lounge against the wall and remained himself standing  now gentlemen if you please he said briskly to business you have stopped a mail steamer in mid ocean by force so i presume you have something of importance to say please say it and let me go on i am behind time now  the german held up his hands we have stopped you he said it is true but not by force no no  i dont know what else you call it when you show me a bounding thirty guns and put a shot across my bows  it was a blank charge the german began but captain ackinson interrupted him  it was nothing of the sort he declared bluntly i was on deck and i saw the charge strike the water  it was then contrary to my orders captain dronestein declared and in any case it was not intended for intimidation  never mind what it was intended for i have my own opinion about that captain ackinson remarked impatiently proceed if you please  in the first place permit me to introduce the baron von graisheim who is attached to the ministry for foreign affairs at berlin  captain ackinsons acknowledgment of the introduction was barely civil the german continued  i am afraid you will not consider my errand here a particularly pleasant one herr captain i have a warrant here for the arrest of one of your passengers whom i have to ask you to hand over to me  a what captain ackinson exclaimed with a spot of deep colour stealing through the tan of his cheeks  a warrant dronestein continued drawing an imposing looking document from his breast pocket if you will examine it you will perceive that it is in perfect order it bears in fact he continued pointing with reverential forefinger to a signature near the bottom of the document the seal of his most august majesty the emperor of germany  captain ackinson glanced at the document with imperturbable face  what is the name of the gentleman to whom all this refers he inquired  the duc de souspennier  the name captain ackinson remarked is not upon my passengers list  he is travelling under the alias of mr sabin baron von graisheim interjected  and do you expect me captain ackinson remarked to hand over the person in question to you on the authority of that document  certainly the two men exclaimed with one voice  then i am very sorry indeed captain ackinson declared that you should have had the temerity to stop my ship and detain me here on such a fools errand we are on the high seas and under the english flag the document you have just shown me impeaching the duc de souspennier for lèse majestie and high treason and all the rest of it is not worth the paper it is written on here nor i should think in america i must ask you to leave my ship at once gentlemen and i can promise you that my employers the cunard ss company will bring a claim against your government for this unwarrantable detention  you must if you please be reasonable captain dronestein said we have force behind us and we are determined to rescue this man at all costs  captain ackinson laughed scornfully  i shall be interested to see what measures of force you will employ he remarked you may have a tidy bill to pay as it is for that shot you put across my bows if you try another it may cost you the kaiser wilhelm and the whole of the german navy now if you please ive no more time to waste  captain ackinson moved towards the door dronestein laid his hand upon his arm  captain ackinson he said do not be rash if i have seemed too peremptory in this matter remember that germany as my fatherland is as dear to me as england to you and this man whose arrest i am commissioned to effect has earned for himself the deep enmity of all patriots listen to me i beg you run not one shadow of risk in delivering this man up to my custody he has no country with whom you might become embroiled he is a french royalist who has cast himself adrift altogether from his country and is indeed her enemy apart from that his detention trial and sentence would be before a secret court he would simply disappear as for you you need not fear but that your services will be amply recognised make your claims now for this detention of your steamer fix it if you will at five or even ten thousand pounds and i will satisfy it on the spot by a draft on the imperial exchequer the man can be nothing to you make a great country your debtor you will never regret it  captain ackinson shook his arm free from the others grasp and strode out on to the deck  kaiser wilhelm boat alongside he shouted blowing his whistle smith have these gentlemen lowered at once and pass the word to the engineers room full speed ahead  he turned to the two men who had followed him out  you had better get off my ship before i lose my temper he said bluntly but rest assured that i shall report this attempt at intimidation and bribery to my employers and they will without doubt lay the matter before the government  but captain ackinson  not another word sir  my dear  captain ackinson turned his back upon the two men and with a stiff military salute turned towards the bridge already the machinery was commencing to throb mr watson who was hovering near came up and helped them to descend a few apparently casual remarks passed between the three men from a little lower down mr sabin and mrs watson leaned over the rail and watched the visitors lowered into their boat  that was rather a foolish attempt he remarked lightly nevertheless they seem disappointed  she looked after them pensively  i wish i knew what they said tomy husband she murmured  orders for my assassination very likely he remarked lightly did you see your husbands face when he passed us  she nodded and looked behind mr watson had entered the smokeroom she drew a little nearer to mr sabin and dropped her voice almost to a whisper  what you have said in jest is most likely the truth be very careful     chapter xlv  mr sabin in danger   mr sabin found the captain by no means inclined to talk about the visit which they had just received he was still hurt and ruffled at the propositions which had been made to him and annoyed at the various delays which seemed conspiring to prevent him from making a decent passage  i have been most confoundedly insulted by those d germans he said to mr sabin meeting him a little later in the gangway i dont know exactly what your position may be but you will have to be on your guard they have gone on to new york and i suppose they will try and get their warrant endorsed there before we land  they have a warrant then mr sabin remarked  they showed me something of the sort the captain answered scornfully and it is signed by the kaiser but of course here it isnt worth the paper it is written on and america would never give you up without a special extradition treaty  mr sabin smiled he had calculated all the chances nicely and a volume of international law was lying at that moment in his stateroom face downwards  i think he said that i am quite safe from arrest but at the same time captain i am very sorry to be such a troublesome passenger to you  the captain shrugged his shoulders oh it is not your fault he said but i have made up my mind about one thing i am not going to stop my ship this side of boston harbour for anything afloat we have lost half a day already  if the cunard company will send me the extra coal bill mr sabin said i will pay it cheerfully for i am afraid that both stoppages have been on my account  bosh the captain who was moving away stopped short you had nothing to do with these new yorkers and their brokendown yacht  mr sabin finished lighting a cigarette which he had taken from his case and passing his arm through the captains drew him a little further away from the gangway  im afraid i had he said as a matter of fact they are not new yorkers and they are not husband and wife they are simply agents in the pay of the german secret police  what spies the captain exclaimed  mr sabin nodded  exactly  the captain was still incredulous do you mean to tell me he exclaimed that charming little woman is not an american at allthat she is a fraud  there isnt a shadow of a doubt about it mr sabin replied they have both tacitly admitted it as a matter of fact i am in treaty now to buy them over they were on the point of accepting my terms when these fellows boarded us whether they will do so now i cannot tell i saw that fellow graisheim talking to the man just before they left the vessel  you are safe while you are on my ship mr sabin the captain said firmly i shall watch that fellow watson closely and if he gives me the least chance i will have him put in irons confound the man and his plausible  they were interrupted by the deck steward who came with a message from mrs watson she was making tea on deckmight she have the loan of the captains table and would they come  the captain gave the necessary assent but was on the point of declining the invitation i dont want to go near the people he said  on the other hand mr sabin objected i do not want them to think at present at any rate that i have told you who they are you had better come  they crossed the deck to a sunny little corner behind one of the boats where mrs watson had just completed her preparation for tea  she greeted them gaily and chatted to them while they waited for the kettle to boil but to mr sabins observant eyes there was a remarkable change in her her laughter was forced and she was very pale  several times mr sabin caught her watching him in an odd way as though she desired to attract his attention but mr watson who for once had seemed to desert the smokingroom remained by her side like a shadow mr sabin felt that his presence was ominous the tea was made and handed round  mr watson sent away the deck steward who was preparing to wait upon them and did the honours himself he passed the sugar to the captain and stood before mr sabin with the sugartongs in his hand  sugar he inquired holding out a lump  mr sabin took sugar and was on the point of holding out his cup just then he chanced to glance across to mrs watson her eyes were dilated and she seemed to be on the point of springing from her chair meeting his glance she shook her head and then bent over her hot water apparatus  no sugar thanks mr sabin answered this tea looks too good to spoil by any additions one of the best things i learned in asia was to take my tea properly help yourself mr watson  mr watson rather clumsily dropped the piece of sugar which he had been holding out to mr sabin and the ship giving a slight lurch just at that moment it rolled down the deck and apparently into the sea with a little remark as to his clumsiness he resumed his seat  mr sabin looked into his tea and across to mrs watson the slightest of nods was sufficient for him he drank it off and asked for some more  the tea party on the whole was scarcely a success the captain was altogether upset and quite indisposed to be amiable towards people who had made a dupe of him mrs watson seemed to be suffering from a state of nervous excitement and her husband was glum and silent mr sabin alone appeared to be in good spirits and he talked continually with his customary ease and polish  the captain did not stay very long and upon his departure mr sabin also rose  am i to have the pleasure of taking you for a little walk mrs watson he asked  she looked doubtfully at the tall glum figure by her side and her face was almost haggard  im afraidi thinki thinkmr watson has just asked me to walk with him she said lamely we must have our stroll later on  i shall be ready and delighted at any time mr sabin answered with a bow  we are going to have a moon tonight perhaps you may be tempted to walk after dinner  he ignored the evident restraint of both the man and the woman and strolled away having nothing in particular to do he went into his deck cabin to dress a little earlier than usual and when he had emerged the dinner gong had not yet sounded  the deck was quite deserted and lighting a cigarette dappetit he strolled past the scene of their teaparty a dark object under the boat attracted his attention he stooped down and looked at it thomas the ships cat was lying there stiff and stark and by the side of his outstretched tongue a lump of sugar     chapter xlvi  mr watson is astonished   at dinnertime mr sabin was the most silent of the little quartette who occupied the head of the table the captain who had discovered that notwithstanding their stoppage they had made a very fair days run and had just noticed a favourable change in the wind was in a better humour and on the whole was disposed to feel satisfied with himself for the way he had repulsed the captain of the kaiser wilhelm he departed from his usual custom so far as to drink a glass of mr sabins champagne having first satisfied himself as to the absence of any probability of fog mr watson too was making an effort to appear amiable and his wife though her colour seemed a trifle hectic and her laughter not altogether natural contributed her share to the conversation mr sabin alone was curiously silent and distant many times he had escaped death by what seemed almost a fluke more often than most men he had been at least in danger of losing it but this last adventure had made a distinct and deep impression upon him he had not seriously believed that the man watson was prepared to go to such lengths he recognised for the first time his extreme danger then as regards the woman he was genuinely puzzled he owed her his life he could not doubt it she had given him the warning by which he had profited and she had given it him behind his companions back he was strongly inclined to believe in her still she was doubtless in fear of the man her whole appearance denoted it she was still without doubt his tool willing or unwilling  they lingered longer than usual over their dessert it was noticeable that throughout their conversation all mention of the events of the day was excluded a casual remark of mr watsons the captain had ignored there was an obvious inclination to avoid the subject the captain was on the qui vive all the time and he promptly quashed any embarrassing remark so far as mrs watson was concerned there was certainly no fear of her exhibiting any curiosity it was hard to believe that she was the same woman who had virtually taken the conversation into her own hands on the previous evening and had talked to them so well and so brightly she sat there white and cowed looking a great deal at mr sabin with sad faraway eyes and seldom originating a remark mr watson on the contrary talked incessantly in marked contrast to his previous silence he drank no wine but seemed in the best of spirits only once did he appear at a loss and that was when the captain helping himself to some nuts turned towards mr sabin and asked a question  i wonder mr sabin whether you ever heard of an indian nut called i believe the fakella they say that an oil distilled from its kernel is the most deadly poison in the world  i have both heard of it and seen it mr sabin answered in fact i may say that i have tasted iton the tip of my finger  and yet the captain remarked laughing you are alive  and yet i am alive mr sabin echoed but there is nothing very wonderful in that i am poisonproof  mr watson was in the act of raising a hastily filled glass to his lips when his eyes met mr sabins he set it down hurriedly white to the lips he knew then surely there must be something supernatural about the man a conviction of his own absolute impotence suddenly laid hold of him he was completely shaken of what use were the ordinary weapons of his kind against an antagonist such as this he knew nothing of the silent evidence against him on deck he could only attribute mr sabins foreknowledge of what had been planned against him to the miraculous he stumbled to his feet and muttering something about some cigars left his place mrs watson rose almost immediately afterwards as she turned to walk down the saloon she dropped her handkerchief mr sabin who had risen while she passed out stooped down and picked it up she took it with a smile of thanks and whispered in his ear  come on deck with me quickly i want to speak to you  he obeyed turning round and making some mute sign to the captain she walked swiftly up the stairs after a frightened glance down the corridor to their staterooms a fresh breeze blew in their faces as they stepped out on deck and mr sabin glanced at her bare neck and arms  you will be cold he said let me fetch you a wrap  dont leave me she exclaimed quickly walk to the side of the steamer dont look behind  mr sabin obeyed directly she was sure that they were really beyond earshot of any one she laid her hand upon his arm  i am going to ask you a strange question she said dont stop to think what it means but answer me at once where are you going to sleep tonightin your stateroom or in the deck cabin  he started a little but answered without hesitation  in my deck cabin  then dont she exclaimed quickly say that you are going to if you are asked mind that sit up on deck out of sight all night stay with the captainanythingbut dont sleep there and whatever you may see dont be surprised and please dont think too badly of me  he was surprised to see that her cheeks were burning and her eyes were wet he laid his hand tenderly upon her arm  i will promise that at any rate he said  and you will remember what i have told you  most certainly he promised your warnings are not things to be disregarded  she drew a quick little breath and looked nervously over her shoulders  i am afraid he said kindly that you are not well today has that fellow been frightening or illusing you  her face was very close to his and he fancied that he could hear her teeth chattering she was obviously terrified  we must not be talking too seriously she murmured he may be here at any moment i want you to remember that there is a price set upon you and he means to earn it he would have killed you before but he wants to avoid detection you had better tell the captain everything remember you must be on the watch always  i can protect myself now that i am warned he said reassuringly i have carried my life in my hands many a time before but you  she shivered  they tell me she whispered that from boston you can take a train right across the continent thousands of miles i am going to take the very first one that starts when i land and i am going to hide somewhere in the furthest corner of the world i can get to to live in such fear would drive me mad and i am not a coward let us walk he will not think so much of our being together then  i am going to send for a wrap he said looking down at her thin dinner dress it is much too cold for you here bareheaded we will send the steward for something  they turned round to find a tall form at their elbows mr watsons voice thin and satirical broke the momentary silence  you are in a great hurry for fresh air violet i have brought your cape allow me to put it on  he stooped down and threw the wrap over her shoulders then he drew her reluctant fingers through his arm  you were desiring to walk he said very well we will walk together  mr sabin watched them disappear and lighting a cigar strolled off towards the captains room many miles away now he could still see the green light of the german manofwar     chapter xlvii  a charmed life   the night was still enough but piledup masses of black clouds obscured a weakly moon and there were only now and then uncertain gleams of glimmering light there was no fog nor any sign of any the captain slept in his room and on deck the steamer was utterly deserted only through the black darkness she still bounded on her furnaces roaring and the black trail of smoke leaving a long clear track behind her it seemed as though every one were sleeping on board the steamer except those who fed her fires below and the grim silent figure who stood in the wheelhouse  mr sabin who muffled up with rugs was reclining in a deck chair drawn up in the shadow of the long boat was already beginning to regret that he had attached any importance at all to mrs watsons warning it wanted only an hour or so of dawn all night long he had sat there in view of the door of his deck cabin and shivered to sleep had been impossible his dozing was only fitful and unrestful his hands were thrust deep down into the pockets of his overcoatthe revolver had long ago slipped from his cold fingers more than once he had made up his mind to abandon his watch to enter his room and chance what might happen and then suddenly there came what he had been waiting for all this whilea soft footfall along the deck some one was making their way now from the gangway to the door of his cabin  the frown on his forehead deepened he leaned stealthily forward watching and listening intently surely that was the rustling of a silken gown that gleam of white behind the funnel was the fluttering of a womans skirt suddenly he saw her distinctly she was wearing a long white dressinggown and noiseless slippers of some kind her face was very pale and her eyes seemed fixed and dilated once twice she looked nervously behind her then she paused before the door of his cabin hesitated for a moment and finally passed over the threshold mr sabin who had been about to spring forward paused after all perhaps he was safer where he was  there was a full minute during which nothing happened mr sabin who had now thoroughly regained his composure lingered in the shadow of the boat prepared to wait upon the course of events but a mans footstep this time fell softly upon the deck some one had emerged from the gangway and was crossing towards his room mr sabin peered cautiously through the twilight it was mr watson of new york partially dressed with a revolver flashing in his hand then mr sabin perceived the full wisdom of having remained where he was  under the shadow of the boat he drew a little nearer to the door of the cabin there was absolute silence within what they were doing he could not imagine but the place was in absolute darkness thoroughly awake now he crouched within a few feet of the door listening intently once he fancied that he could hear a voice it seemed to him that a hand was groping along the wall for the knob of the electric light then the door was softly opened and the woman came out she stood for a moment leaning a little forward listening intently ready to make her retreat immediately she was assured that the coast was clear she was a little pale but in a stray gleam of moonlight mr sabin fancied that he caught a glimpse of a smile upon her parted lips there was a whisper from behind her shoulder she answered in a german monosyllable then apparently satisfied that she was unobserved she stepped out and flitting round the funnel disappeared down the gangway mr sabin made no attempt to stop her or to disclose his presence his fingers had closed now upon his revolverhe was waiting for the man the minutes crept onnothing happened then a hand softly closed the window looking out upon the deck immediately afterwards the door was pushed open and mr watson with a handkerchief to his mouth stepped out  he stood perfectly still listening for a moment then he was on the point of stealing away when a hand fell suddenly upon his shoulder he was face to face with mr sabin  he started back with a slight but vehement guttural interjection his hand stole down towards his pocket but the shining argument in mr sabins hand was irresistible  step back into that room mr watson i want to speak to you  he hesitated mr sabin reaching across him opened the door of the cabin immediately they were assailed with the fumes of a strange sickly odour mr sabin laughed softly but a little bitterly  a very oldfashioned device he murmured i gave you credit for more ingenuity my friend come i have opened the window and the door you see let us step inside there will be sufficient fresh air  mr watson was evidently disinclined to make the effort he glanced covertly up the deck and seemed to be preparing himself for a rush again that little argument of steel and the grim look on mr sabins face prevailed they both crossed the threshold the odour though powerful was almost nullified by the rushing of the salt wind through the open window and door which mr sabin had fixed open with a catch reaching out his hand he pulled down a little brass hookthe room was immediately lit with the soft glare of the electric light  mr sabin having assured himself that his companions revolver was safely bestowed in his hip pocket and could not be reached without warning glanced carefully around his cabin  he looked first towards the bed and smiled his little device then had succeeded the rug which he had rolled up under the sheets into the shape of a human form was undisturbed in the absence of a light mr watson had evidently taken for granted that the man whom he had sought to destroy was really in the room the two men suddenly exchanged glances and mr sabin smiled at the others look of dismay  it was not like you he said gently it was really very clumsy indeed to take for granted my presence here i have great faith in you and your methods my friend but do you think that it would have been altogether wise for me to have slept here alone with unfastened doorunder the circumstances  mr watson admitted his error with a gleam in his dark eyes which mr sabin accepted as an additional warning  your little device he continued raising an unstopped flask from the table by the side of the bed is otherwise excellent and i feel that i owe you many thanks for arranging a death that should be painless you might have made other plans which would have been not only more clumsy but which might have caused me a considerable amount of personal inconvenience and discomfort your arrangements i see were altogether excellent you arranged for myerextermination asleep or awake if awake the little visit which your charming wife had just paid here was to have provided you at once with a motive for the crime and a distinctly mitigating circumstance that was very ingenious pardon my lighting a cigarette these fumes are a little powerful then if i was asleep and had not been awakened by the time you arrivedwell it was to be a drug supposing my dear mr watson you do me the favour of emptying this little flask into the sea  mr watson obeyed promptly there were several points in his favour to be gained by the destruction of this evidence of his unsuccessful attempt as he crossed the deck holding the little bottle at arms length from him a delicate white vapour could be distinctly seen rising from the bottle and vanishing into the air there was a little hiss like the hiss of a snake as it touched the water and a spot of white froth marked the place where it sank  much too strong mr sabin murmured a sad waste of a very valuable drug my friend now will you please come inside with me we must have a little chat but first kindly stand quite still for one moment there is no particular reason why i should run any risk i am going to take that revolver from your pocket and throw it overboard  mr watsons first instinct was evidently one of resistance then suddenly he felt the cold muzzle of a revolver upon his forehead  if you move mr sabin said quietly you are a dead man my best policy would be to kill you i am foolish not to do it but i hate violence you are safe if you do as i tell you  mr watson recognised the fact that his companion was in earnest he stood quite still and watched his revolver describe a semicircle in the darkness and a fall with a little splash in the water then he followed mr sabin into his cabin     chapter xlviii  the doomschen   i suppose mr sabin began closing the door of the cabin behind him that i may take itthis episodeas an indication of your refusal to accept the proposals i made to you  mr watson did not immediately reply he had seated himself on the corner of a lounge and was leaning forward his head resting moodily upon his hands his sallow face was paler even than usual and his expression was sullen he looked as he undoubtedly was in an evil humour with himself and all things  it was not a matter of choice with me he muttered look out of your window there and you will see that even here upon the ocean i am under surveillance  mr sabins eyes followed the mans forefinger far away across the ocean he could see a dim green light almost upon the horizon it was the german manofwar  that is quite true mr sabin said i admit that there are difficulties but it seems to me that you have overlooked the crux of the whole matter i have offered you enough to live on for the rest of your days without ever returning to europe you know very well that you can step off this ship arminarm with me when we reach boston even though your manofwar be alongside the dock they could not touch youyou could leave yourpardon menot too honourable occupation once and for ever america is not the country in which one would choose to live but it has its resourcesit can give you big game and charming women i have lived there and i know it is not europe but it is the next best thing come you had better accept my terms  the man had listened without moving a muscle of his face there was something almost pitiable in its white sullen despair then his lips parted  would to god i could he moaned would to god i had the power to listen to you  mr sabin flicked the ash off his cigarette and looked thoughtful he stroked his grey imperial and kept his eyes on his companion  the extradition laws the other interrupted savagely  mr sabin shrugged his shoulders by all means he murmured personally i have no interest in them but if you would talk like a reasonable man and tell me where your difficulty lies i might be able to help you  the man who had called himself watson raised his head slowly his expression remained altogether hopeless he had the appearance of a man given wholly over to despair  have you ever heard of the doomschen he asked slowly  mr sabin shuddered he became suddenly very grave you are not one of them he exclaimed  the man bowed his head  i am one of those devils he admitted  mr sabin rose to his feet and walked up and down the little room  of course he remarked that complicates matters but there ought to be a way out of it let me think for a moment  the man on the lounge sat still with unchanging face in his heart he knew that there was no way out of it the chains which bound him were such as the hand of man had no power to destroy the arm of his master was long it had reached him hereit would reach him to the farthermost corner of the world nor could mr sabin for the moment see any light the man was under perpetual sentence of death there was no country in the world which would not give him up if called upon to do so  what you have told me mr sabin said explains of course to a certain extent your present indifference to my offers but when i first approached you in this way you certainly led me to think  that was before that cursed kaiser wilhelm came up watson interrupted i had a plani might have made a rush for liberty at any rate  but surely you would have been marked down at boston mr sabin said  the only friend i have in the world the other said slowly is the manager of the governments secret cable office at berlin he was on my side it would have given me a chance but nowhe looked out of the windowit is hopeless  mr sabin resumed his chair and lit a fresh cigarette he had thought the matter out and began to see light  it is rather an awkward fix he said but hopeless is a word which i do not understand as regards our present dilemma i think that i see an excellent way out of it  a momentary ray of hope flashed across the mans face then he shook his head  it is not possible he murmured  mr sabin smiled quietly  my friend he said i perceive that you are a pessimist you will find yourself in a very short time a free man with the best of your life before you take my advice whatever career you embark in do so in a more sanguine spirit difficulties to the man who faces them boldly lose half their strength but to proceed you are one of those who are called doomschen that means i believe that you have committed a crime punishable by deaththat you are on parole only so long as you remain in the service of the secret police of your country that is so is it not  the man assented grimly mr sabin continued  if you were to abandon your present task and fail to offer satisfactory explanationsif you were to attempt to settle down in america your extradition i presume would at once be applied for you would be given no second chance  i should be shot without a moments hesitation watson admitted grimly  exactly and there is i believe another contingency if you should succeed in your present enterprise which i presume is my extermination you would obtain your freedom  the man on the lounge nodded a species of despair was upon him this man was his master in all ways he would be his master to the end  that brings us mr sabin continued to my proposition i must admit that the details i have not fully thought out yet but that is a matter of only half an hour or so i propose that you should kill me in boston harbour and escape to your manofwar they will of course refuse to give you up and on your return to germany you will receive your freedom  butbut you watson exclaimed bewildered you dont want to be killed surely  i do not intend to beactually mr sabin explained exactly how i am going to manage it i cant tell you just now but it will be quite easy i shall be dead to the belief of everybody on board here except the captain and he will be our accomplice i shall remain hidden until your kaiser wilhelm has left and when i do land in americait shall not be as mr sabin  watson rose to his feet he was a transformed man a sudden hope had brightened his face his eyes were on fire  it is a wonderful scheme he exclaimed but the captainsurely he will never consent to help  on the contrary mr sabin answered he will do it for the asking there is not a single difficulty which we cannot easily surmount  there is my companion watson remarked she will have to be reckoned with  leave her mr sabin said to me i will undertake that she shall be on our side before many hours are passed you had better go down to your room now it is getting light and i want to rest  watson paused upon the threshold he pointed in some embarrassment to the table by the side of the bed  is it any use he murmured in a low tone saying that i am sorry for this  you only didwhatin a sense was your duty mr sabin answered i bear no maliceespecially since i escaped  watson closed the door and mr sabin glanced at the bed for a moment or two he hesitated although the desire for sleep had gone by then he stepped out on to the deck and leaned thoughtfully over the white railing far away eastwards there were signs already of the coming day a soft grey twilight rested upon the sea darker and blacker the waters seemed just then by contrast with the lightening skies a fresh breeze was blowing there was no living thing within sight save that faint green light where the rolling sea touched the clouds mr sabins eyes grew fixed a curious depression came over him in that half hour before the dawn when all emotion is quickened by that intense brooding stillness he was passing he felt into perpetual exile he who had been so intimately in touch with the large things of the world had come to that point when after all he was bound to write his life down a failure for its great desire was no nearer consummation he had made his grand effort and he had failed he had been very near success he had seen closely into the promised land perhaps it was such thoughts as these which made his nonsuccess the more bitter and then with the instincts of a philosopher he asked himself now surrounded in fancy by the fragments of his broken dreams whether it had been worth while that love of the beautiful and picturesque side of his country which had been his first inspiration which had been at the root of his passionate patriotism seemed just then in the grey moments of his despair so weak a thing he had sacrificed so much to ithis whole life had been moulded and shaped to that one end there had been other ways in which he might have found happiness was he growing morbid he wondered bitterly but unresistingly that her face should suddenly float before his eyes in fancy he could see her coming towards him there across the still waters the old brilliant smile upon her lips the lovelight in her eyes that calm disdain of all other men written so plainly on the face which should surely have been a queens  mr sabin thought of those things which had passed and he thought of what was to come and a moment of bitterness crept into his life which he knew must leave its mark for ever his head drooped into his hands and remained buried there thus he stood until the first ray of sunlight travelling across the water fell upon him and he knew that morning had come he crossed the deck and entering his cabin closed the door     chapter xlix  mr sabin is sentimental   mr sabin found it a harder matter than he had anticipated to induce the captain to consent to the scheme he had formulated nevertheless he succeeded in the end and by lunch time the following day the whole affair was settled there was a certain amount of risk in the affair but on the other hand if successfully carried out it set free once and for ever the two men mainly concerned in it mr sabin who was in rather a curious mood came out of the captains room a little after one oclock feeling altogether indisposed for conversation of any sort ordered his luncheon from the deck steward and moved his chair apart from the others into a sunny secluded corner of the boat  it was here that mrs watson found him an hour later he heard the rustle of silken draperies across the deck a faint but familiar perfume suddenly floated into the salt sunlit air he looked around to find her bending over him a miracle of whitecool dainty and elegant  and why this seclusion sir misanthrope  he laughed and dragged her chair alongside of his  come and sit down he said i want to talk to you i want he added lowering his voice to thank you for your warning  they were close together now and alone cut off from the other chairs by one of the lifeboats she looked up at him from amongst the cushions with which her chair was hung  you understood she murmured  perfectly  you are safe now she said from him at any rate you have won him over  i have found a way of safety mr sabin said for both of us  she leaned her head upon her delicate white fingers and looked at him curiously  your plans she said are admirable but what of me  mr sabin regarded her with some faint indication of surprise he was not sure what she meant did she expect a reward for her warning he wondered her words would seem to indicate something of the sort and yet he was not sure  i am afraid he said kindly we have not considered you very much yet you will go on to boston of course then i suppose you will return to germany  never she exclaimed with suppressed passion i have broken my vows i shall never set foot in germany again i broke them for your sake  mr sabin looked at her thoughtfully  i am glad to hear you say that he declared believe me my dear young lady i have seen a great deal of such matters and i can assure you that the sooner you break away from all association with this man watson and his employers the better  it is all over she murmured i am a free woman  mr sabin was delighted to hear it yet he felt that there was a certain awkwardness between them he was this womans debtor and he had made no effort to discharge his debt what did she expect from him he looked at her through halfclosed eyes and wondered  if i can be of any use to you he suggested softly in any fresh start you may make in life you have only to command me  she kept her face averted from him there was land in sight and she seemed much interested in it  what are you going to do in america  mr sabin looked out across the sea and he repeated her question to himself what was he going to do in this great strange land whose ways were not his ways and whose sympathies lay so far apart from his  i cannot tell he murmured i have come here for safety i have no country nor any friends this is the land of my exile  a soft white hand touched his for a moment he looked into her face and saw there an emotion which surprised him  it is my exile too she said i shall never dare to return i have no wish to return  but your friends mr sabin commenced your family  i have no family  mr sabin was thoughtful for several moments then he took out his case and lit a cigarette he watched the blue smoke floating away over the ships side and looked no more at the woman at his elbow  if you decide he said quietly to settle in america you must not allow yourself to forget that i am very much your debtor i  your friendship she interrupted i shall be very glad to have we may perhaps help one another to feel less lonely  mr sabin gently shook his head  i had a friend of your sex once he said i shallforgive menever have another  is she dead  if she is dead it is i who have killed her i sacrificed her to my ambition we parted and for monthsfor yearsi scarcely thought of her and now the day of retribution has come i think of her but it is in vain great barriers have rolled between us since those days but she was my first friend and she will be my only one  there was a long silence mr sabins eyes were fixed steadily seawards a flood of recollections had suddenly taken possession of him when at last he looked round the chair by his side was vacant     chapter l  a harbour tragedy   the voyage of the calipha came to its usual termination about ten oclock on the following morning when she passed boston lights and steamed slowly down the smooth waters of the harbour the seven passengers were all upon deck in wonderfully transformed guise already the steamer chairs were being tied up and piled away the stewards officiously anxious to render some last service were hovering around mrs watson in a plain tailor gown and quiet felt hat was sitting heavily veiled apart and alone there were no signs of either mr watson or mr sabin the captain was on the bridge talking to the pilot scarcely a hundred yards away lay the kaiser wilhelm white and stately with her brass work shining like gold in the sunlight and her decks as white as snow  the calipha was almost at a standstill awaiting the doctors brig which was coming up to her on the port side every one was leaning over the railing watching her mr watson and mr sabin who had just come up the gangway together turned away towards the deserted side of the boat engaged apparently in serious conversation suddenly every one on deck started a revolver shot followed by two heavy splashes in the water rang out clear and crisp above the clanking of chains and slighter noises there was a moments startled silenceevery one looked at one anotherthen a rush for the starboard side of the steamer above the little torrent of minor exclamations the captains voice sang out like thunder  lower the number one boat quartermaster man a crew  the seven passengers two stewards and a stray seaman arrived on the starboard side of the gangway at about the same moment there was at first very little to be seen a faint cloud of blue smoke was curling upwards and there was a strong odour of gunpowder in the air on the deck were lying a small recentlydischarged revolver and a mans white linen cap which from its somewhat peculiar shape every one recognised at once as belonging to mr sabin at first sight there was absolutely nothing else to be seen then suddenly some one pointed to a mans head about fifty yards away in the water every one crowded to the side to look at it it was hard at that distance to distinguish the features but a little murmur arose doubtful at first but gaining confidence it was the head of mr watson the murmur rather grew than increased when it was seen that he was swimming not towards the steamer but away from it and that he was alone where was mr sabin  a slight cry from behind diverted attention for a moment from the bobbing head mrs watson who had heard the murmurs was lying in a dead faint across a chair one of the women moved to her side the others resumed their watch upon events  a boat was already lowered acting upon instructions from the captain the crew combined a search for the missing man with a leisurely pursuit of the fugitive one the first lieutenant stood up in the gunwale with a hook in his hand looking from right to left and the men pulled with slow even strokes but nowhere was there any sign of mr sabin  the man who was swimming was now almost out of sight and the first lieutenant who was in command of the little search party reluctantly gave orders for the quickening of his mens stroke but almost as the men bent to their work a curious thing happened the fugitive who had been swimming at a great pace suddenly threw up his arms and disappeared  hes done by jove exclaimed the lieutenant row hard you chaps we must catch him when he rises  but to all appearance mr j b watson of new york never rose again the boat was rowed time after time around the spot where he had sunk but not a trace was to be found of him the only vessel anywhere near was the kaiser wilhelm they rowed slowly up and hailed her  an officer came to the railing and answered their inquiries in execrable english no they had not seen any one in the water they had not picked any one up yes if herr lieutenant pleased he could come on board but to make a searchno without authority no it was impossible that any one could have been taken on board without his knowledge he pointed down the steep sides of the steamship and shrugged his shoulders it was indeed an impossible feat the lieutenant of the calipha saluted and gave the order to his men to backwater once more they went over the ground carefully there was no sign of either of the men after about threequarters of an hours absence they reluctantly gave up the search and returned to the calipha  the first lieutenant was compelled to report both men drowned the captain was in earnest conversation with an official in plain dark livery the boat of the harbour police was already waiting below the whole particulars of the affair were scanty enough mr sabin and mr watson were seen to emerge from the gangway together engaged in animated conversation they had at first turned to the left but seeing the main body of the passengers assembled there had stepped back again and emerged on the starboard side which was quite deserted after then no one except the captain had even a momentary glimpse of them and his was so brief that it could scarcely be called more than an impression he had been attracted by a slight cry he believed from mr sabin and had seen both men struggling together in the act of disappearing in the water he had seen none of the details of the fight he could not even say whether mr sabin or mr watson had been the aggressor although on that subject there was only one opinion mrs watson was absolutely overcome and unable to answer any questions but as regards the final quarrel and struggle between the two men it was impossible for her to have seen anything of it as she was sitting in a steamer chair on the opposite side of the boat there was at present absolutely no further light to be thrown upon the affair the sergeant of police signalled for his boat and went off to make his report the calipha at halfspeed steamed slowly for the dock  arrived there her passengers crew and officers became the natural and recognised prey of the american pressman the captain sternly refused to answer a single question and in peremptory fashion ordered every stranger off his ship but nevertheless his edict was avoided in the confusion of landing and the customs house effectually barred flight on the part of their victims somehow or other no one exactly knew how or from what source they came strange rumours began to float about who was mr j b watson of new york yacht owner and millionaire no one had ever heard of him and he did not answer in the least to the description of any known watson the closely veiled features of his widow were eagerly scannedone by one the newspaper men confessed themselves baffled no one had ever seen her before one man the most daring of them ventured upon a timid question as she stepped down the gangway she passed him by with a swift look of contempt none of the others ventured anything of the sortbut nevertheless they watched her and they made note of two things the first was that there was no one to meet herthe second that instead of driving to a railway depôt or wiring to any friends she went straight to an hotel and engaged a room for the night  the pressmen took counsel together and agreed that it was very odd they thought it odder still when one of their number calling at the hotel later in the day was informed that mrs watson after engaging a room for the week had suddenly changed her mind and had left boston without giving any one any idea as to her destination they took counsel together and they found fresh food for sensation in her flight she was the only person who could throw any light upon the relations between the two men and she had thought fit to virtually efface herself they made the most of her disappearance in the thick black headlines which headed every column in the boston evening papers     chapter li  the persistence of felix   of all unhappy men he is assuredly the most unhappy who ambitious patient and doggedly persevering has chosen the moment to make his supreme venture and having made it has reaped failure instead of success the gambler while he lives may play again the miser robbed embark once more upon his furtive task of hoarding money even the rejected lover need not despair of some day somewhere finding happiness since no one heart has a monopoly of love but to him who aspires to shape the destiny of nations to control the varying interests of great powers and play upon the emotions of whole peoples there is never vouchsafed more than one opportunity and failure then does more than bring upon the schemer the execration of the world he would have controlled it clears eyes into which he had thrown dust awakens passions he had lulled to sleep provokes hostility where he had made false peace and renders for ever impossible the recombination of conditions under which alone he could if at all succeed for such an one life has lost all its savour existence may perhaps be permitted to him but no more he stakes his all upon one single venture and win or lose he has no second throw failure is absolute and spells despair  in such unhappy state was mr sabin more than ten days had passed since the tragedy in boston harbour and now he sat alone in a private room in a small but exclusive hotel in new york he had affected no small change in his appearance by shaving off his imperial and moustache but a far more serviceable disguise was provided for him by the extreme pallor of his face and the listlessness of his every movement he had made the supreme effort of his life and had failed and failure had so changed his whole demeanour that had any of his recent companions on the calipha been unexpectedly confronted with him it is doubtful if they would have recognised him  for a brief space he had enjoyed some of the old zest of life in scheming for the freedom of his wouldbe murderer in outwitting the police and pressmen and in achieving his own escape but with all this secured and in the safe seclusion of his room he had leisure to look within himself and found himself the most miserable of men utterly lonely with failure to look back upon and nothing for which to hope  he had dreamed of being a minister to france he was an exile in an unsympathetic land he had dreamed of restoring dynasties and readjusting the balance of power he was an alien refugee in a republic where visionaries are not wanted and where opulence gives control america held nothing for him europe had no place there was not a capital in the whole continent where he could show himself and live and his mind dwelt upon the contrast between what might have been and what was he tasted for the first time the full bitterness of isolation and despair to his present plight any alternative would be preferableeven death he took the little revolver which lay near him on the table and thoughtfully turned it over and over in his hand it was as it were a key with which he could unlock the portal to another world where weariness was unknown and where every desire was satisfied or unfelt and even if there were no other existence beyond this extinction was not an idea that repelled him now it would be an accident so easy to come by so little painful to endure should he should he not should he  he was so engrossed in his own thoughts that he did not hear the soft knock at the door nor the servant murmuring the name of a visitor but becoming conscious of the presence of some one in the room he looked up suddenly to see a lady by his side  is there not some mistake he said rising to his feet i do not think i have the pleasure  she laughed and raised her veil  does it make so much difference she asked lightly yet really mr sabin you are more changed than i  i must apologize he said golden hair ismost becoming but sit down and tell me how you found me out and why  she sank into the chair he brought for her and looked at him thoughtfully  it does not matter how i found you since i did why i came is easily explained i have had a cablegram from mr watson  good news i hope he said politely  i suppose it is she answered indifferently at least your conspiracy seems to have been successful it is generally believed that you are dead and mr watson has been pardoned and reinstated in all that once was his and now he has sent me this cablegram asking me to join him in germany and marry him  dejected as mr sabin was he had not yet lost all his sense of humour he found the idea excessively amusing  let me be the first to congratulate you he said his twinkling eyes belying the grave courtesy of his voice it is the conventional happy end to a charming romance  are you never serious she protested  indeed yes he answered forgive me for seeming to be flippant about so serious a matter as a proposal of marriage i presume you will accept it  am i to do so she asked gravely it was to ask your advice that i came here today  i have no hesitation in giving it he declared accept the proposal at once it means emancipation for youemancipation from a career of espionage which has nothing to recommend it there cannot be two opinions on such a point give up this unwholesome business and make this man and yourself too happy you will never regret it  i wish i could be as sure of that she said wistfully  mr sabin with his training and natural power of seeing through the words to the heart of the speaker could not misunderstand her and he spoke with a gentle earnestness very moving  believe me my dear lady when i say that to every one once at least in his life there comes a chance of happiness although every one is not wise enough to take it i had my chance and i threw it away there has never been an hour in my life since then that i have not regretted it let me help you to be wiser than i was i am an old man now i have played for high stakes and have had my share of winning i have been involved in great affairs i have played my part in the making of history and i speak from experience security lies in middle ways and happiness belongs to the simple life to what has my interest in things of high import brought me i am an exile from my country doomed to pass the small remainder of my days among a people whom i know not and with whom i have nothing in common  i have a heart and now i am paying the penalty for having treated badly the one woman who had power to touch it so bitter a penalty that i would i could save you from the experiencing the like you come to me for advice then be advised by me leave meddling with affairs that are too high for you walk in those middle ways where safety is and lead the simple life where alone happiness is and let me part from you knowing that to one human being at least i have helped to give what alone is worth the having need i say any more  she took his hands and pressed them  goodbye she said i shall start for germany tomorrow                                       so mr sabin was left free to return to his former melancholy mood but it was not long before fresh interruption came a servant brought a cablegram  be sure you deliver my letter to lenox it ran and the signature was felix  he rolled the paper into a little ball and threw it on one side and presently went into his dressingroom to change for dinner as he came into the hall another servant brought him another cablegram he opened it and read  deliver my letter at oncefelix  he tore the paper carefully into little pieces and went into the diningroom for dinner he dined leisurely and well and lingered over his coffee lost in meditation he was still sitting so when a third servant brought him yet another cablegram  remember your promisefelix  then mr sabin rose  will you please see that my bag is packed he said to the waiting man and let my account be prepared and brought to me upstairs i shall leave by the night train     chapter lii  mrs james b peterson of lenox   mr sabin found himself late on the afternoon of the following day alone on the platform of a little wooden station watching the train which had dropped him there a few minutes ago snorting away round a distant curve outside the servant whom he had hired that morning in new york was busy endeavouring to arrange for a conveyance of some sort in which they might complete their journey mr sabin himself was well content to remain where he was the primitiveness of the place itself and the magnificence of his surroundings had made a distinct and favourable impression upon him facing him was a chain of lofty hills whose foliage luxuriant and brilliantly tinted seemed almost like a long wave of rich deep colour the country close at hand was black with pine trees through which indeed a winding way for the railroad seemed to have been hewn it was only a little clearing which had been made for the depôt a few yards down the line seemed to vanish into a tunnel of black foliage from amongst which the red barked tree trunks stood out with the regularity of a regiment of soldiers the clear air was fragrant with a peculiar and aromatic perfume so sweet and wholesome that mr sabin held the cigarette which he had lighted at arms length that he might inhale this the most fascinating odour in the world he was at all times sensitive to the influence of scenery and natural perfumes and the possibility of spending the rest of his days in this country had never seemed so little obnoxious as during those few moments then his eyes suddenly fell upon a large white house magnificent but evidently newly finished gleaming forth from an opening in the woods and his brows contracted his former moodiness returned  it is not the country he muttered to himself it is the people  his servant came back presently with explanations for his prolonged absence  i am sorry sir he said but i made a mistake in taking the tickets  mr sabin merely nodded a little time ago a mistake on the part of a servant was a thing which he would not have tolerated but those were days which seemed to him to lie very far back in the past  you ought to have alighted at the last station sir the man continued stockbridge is eleven miles from here  what are we going to do mr sabin asked  we must drive sir i have hired a conveyance but the luggage will have to come later in the day by the cars there will only be room for your dressingbag in the buggy  mr sabin rose to his feet  the drive will be pleasant he said especially if it is through such country as this i am not sure that i regret your mistake harrison you will remain and bring the baggage on i suppose  it will be best sir the man agreed there is a train in about an hour  they walked out on to the road where a onehorse buggy was waiting the driver took no more notice of them than to terminate in a leisurely way his conversation with a railway porter and unhitch the horse  mr sabin took the seat by his side and they drove off  it was a very beautiful road and mr sabin was quite content to lean back in his not uncomfortable seat and admire the scenery for the most part it was of a luxuriant and broken character there were very few signs of agriculture save in the immediate vicinity of the large newlybuilt houses which they passed every now and then at times they skirted the side of a mountain and far below them in the valley the river leine wound its way along like a broad silver band here and there the road passed through a thick forest of closelygrowing pines and mr sabin holding his cigarette away from him leaned back and took long draughts of the rosinous piney odour it was soon after emerging from the last of these that they suddenly came upon a house which moved mr sabin almost to enthusiasm it lay not far back from the road a very long twostoried white building free from the overornamentation which disfigured most of the surrounding mansions white pillars in front after the colonial fashion supported a long sloping veranda roof and the smooth trimlykept lawns stretched almost to the terrace which bordered the piazza there were sun blinds of striped holland to the southern windows and about the whole place there was an air of simple and elegant refinement which mr sabin found curiously attractive he broke for the first time the silence which had reigned between him and the driver  do you know he inquired whose house that is  the man flipped his horses ears with the whip  i guess so he answered that is the old peterson house mrs james b peterson lives there now  mr sabin felt in his breast pocket and extracted therefrom a letter it was a coincidence undoubtedly but the fact was indisputable the address scrawled thereon in felixs sprawling hand was                           mrs james b peterson                               lenox       by favour of mr sabin  i will make a call there mr sabin said to the man drive me up to the house  the man pulled up his horse  what do you know her he asked  mr sabin affected to be deeply interested in a distant point of the landscape the man muttered something to himself and turned up the drive  you have met her abroad maybe he suggested  mr sabin took absolutely no notice of the question the mans impertinence was too small a thing to annoy him but it prevented his asking several questions which he would like to have had answered the man muttered something about a civil answer to a civil question not being much to expect and pulled up his horse in front of the great entrance porch  mr sabin calmly ignoring him descended and stepped through the wide open door into a beautiful square hall in the centre of which was a billiard table a servant attired in unmistakably english livery stepped forward to meet him  is mrs peterson at home mr sabin inquired  we expect her in a very few minutes the man answered she is out riding at present may i inquire if you are mr sabin sir  mr sabin admitted the fact with some surprise  the man received the intimation with respect  will you kindly walk this way your grace he said  mr sabin followed him into a large and delightfully furnished library then he looked keenly at the servant  you know me he remarked  monsieur le duc souspennier the man answered with a bow i am an englishman but i was in the service of the marquis de la merle in paris for ten years  your face mr sabin said was familiar to me you look like a man to be trusted will you be so good as to remember that the duc is unfortunately dead and i am mr sabin  most certainly sir the man answered is there anything which i can bring you  nothing thank you mr sabin answered  the man withdrew with a low bow and mr sabin stood for a few minutes turning over magazines and journals which covered a large round table and represented the ephemeral literature of nearly every country in europe  mrs peterson he remarked to himself must be a woman of catholic tastes here is the le petit journal inside the pages of the english contemporary review  he was turning the magazines over with interest when he chanced to glance through the great south window a few feet away from him something he saw barely a hundred yards from the little iron fence which bordered the lawns attracted his attention he rubbed his eyes and looked at it again he was puzzled and was on the point of ringing the bell when the man who had admitted him entered bearing a tray with liqueurs and cigarettes mr sabin beckoned him over to the window  what is that little flag he asked  it is connected i believe in some way the man answered with a game of which mrs peterson is very fond i believe that it indicates the locality of a small hole  golf mr sabin exclaimed  that is the name of the game sir the man answered i had forgotten it for the moment  mr sabin tried the window  i want to get out he said  the man opened it  if you are going down there sir he said i will send james green to meet you mrs peterson is so fond of the game that she keeps a scotchman here to look after the links and instruct her  this mr sabin murmured is the most extraordinary thing in the world  if you would like to see your room sir before you go out the man suggested it is quite ready if you will give me your keys i will have your clothes laid out  mr sabin turned about in amazement  what do you mean he exclaimed i have not come here to stay  i understood so sir the man answered your room has been ready for three weeks  mr sabin was bewildered then he remembered the stories which he had heard of american hospitality and concluded that this must be an instance of it  i had not the slightest intention of stopping here he said to the man  mrs peterson expected you to do so sir and we have sent your conveyance away if it is inconvenient for you to remain now it will be easy to send you anywhere you desire later  for the immediate present mr sabin said mrs peterson not having arrived i want to see that golf course  if you will permit me sir the man said i will show you the way  they followed a winding footpath which brought them suddenly out on the border of a magnificent stretch of parklike country mr sabin whose enthusiasms were rare failed wholly to restrain a little exclamation of admiration a few yards away was one of the largest and most magnificently kept puttinggreens that he had ever seen in his life by his side was a raised teeingground well and solidly built far away down in the valley he could see the flag of the first hole just on the other side of a broad stream  the gentlemans a golfplayer maybe remarked a voice by his side in familiar dialect mr sabin turned around to find himself confronted by a long thin scotchman who had strolled out of a little shed close at hand  i am very fond of the game mr sabin admitted you appear to me to have a magnificent course here  its none so bad mr james green admitted maybe the gentleman would like a round  there is nothing in this wide world mr sabin answered truthfully that i should like so well but i have no clubs or any shoes  come this way sir come this way was the prompt reply theres clubs here of all sorts such as none but jimmy green can make ay and shoes too mr wilson will you be sending me two boys down from the house  in less than ten minutes mr sabin was standing upon the first tee a freshly lit cigarette in his mouth and a new gleam of enthusiasm in his eyes he modestly declined the honour and mr green forthwith drove a ball which he watched approvingly  thats no such a bad ball he remarked  mr sabin watched the construction of his tee and swung his club lightly just a little sliced wasnt it he said that will do thanks he addressed his ball with a confidence which savoured almost of carelessness swung easily back and drove a clean hard hit ball full seventy yards further than the professional the man for a moment was speechless with surprise and he gave a little gasp  aye mon he exclaimed that was a fine drive might you be having a handicap sir  i am scratch at three clubs mr sabin answered quietly and plus four at one  a gleam of delight mingled with respect at his opponent shone in the scotchmans face  aye but we will be having a fine game he exclaimed though im thinking you will down me but it is grand good playing with a mon again                                       the match was now at the fifteenth hole mr sabin with a long and deadly puttbecame four up and three to play as the ball trickled into the hole the scotchman drew a long breath  its a fine match he said and im properly downed whats more youre holding the record of the links up to this present fifteen holes for sixtyfour is verra goodverra good indeed theres no man in america today to beat it  and then mr sabin who was on the point of making a genial reply felt a sudden and very rare emotion stir his heart and blood for almost in his ears there had sounded a very sweet and familiar voice perhaps the voice above all others which he had least expected to hear again in this world  you have not then forgotten your golf mr sabin what do you think of my little course  he turned slowly round and faced her she was standing on the rising ground just above the puttinggreen the skirt of her riding habit gathered up in her hand her lithe supple figure unchanged by time the old bewitching smile still playing about her lips she was still the most beautiful woman he had ever seen  mr sabin with his cap in his hand moved slowly to her side and bowed low over the hand which she extended to him  this is a happiness he murmured for which i had never dared to hope are you too an alien  she shook her head  this she said is the land of my adoption perhaps you did not know that i am mrs peterson  i did not know it he answered gravely for i never heard of your marriage  they turned together toward the house mr sabin was amazed to find that the possibilities of emotion
