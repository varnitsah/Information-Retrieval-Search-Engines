83748782	a passionate pilgrim   by henry james      i  intending to sail for america in the early part of june i determined to spend the interval of six weeks in england to which country my minds eye only had as yet been introduced i had formed in italy and france a resolute preference for old inns considering that what they sometimes cost the ungratified body they repay the delighted mind on my arrival in london therefore i lodged at a certain antique hostelry much to the east of temple bar deep in the quarter that i had inevitably figured as the johnsonian here on the first evening of my stay i descended to the little coffeeroom and bespoke my dinner of the genius of attendance in the person of the solitary waiter no sooner had i crossed the threshold of this retreat than i felt i had cut a goldenripe crop of english impressions the coffeeroom of the red lion like so many other places and things i was destined to see in the motherland seemed to have been waiting for long years with just that sturdy sufferance of time written on its visage for me to come and extract the romantic essence of it  the latent preparedness of the american mind even for the most characteristic features of english life was a matter i meanwhile failed to get to the bottom of the roots of it are indeed so deeply buried in the soil of our early culture that without some great upheaval of feeling we are at a loss to say exactly when and where and how it begins it makes an americans enjoyment of england an emotion more searching than anything continental i had seen the coffeeroom of the red lion years ago at homeat saragossa illinoisin books in visions in dreams in dickens in smollett in boswell it was small and subdivided into six narrow compartments by a series of perpendicular screens of mahogany something higher than a mans stature furnished on either side with a meagre uncushioned ledge denominated in ancient britain a seat in each of these rigid receptacles was a narrow tablea table expected under stress to accommodate no less than four pairs of active british elbows high pressure indeed had passed away from the red lion for ever it now knew only that of memories and ghosts and atmosphere round the room there marched breasthigh a magnificent panelling of mahogany so dark with time and so polished with unremitted friction that by gazing a while into its lucid blackness i made out the dim reflexion of a party of wigged gentlemen in kneebreeches just arrived from york by the coach on the dark yellow walls coated by the fumes of english coal of english mutton of scotch whiskey were a dozen melancholy prints sallowtoned with agethe derby favourite of the year 1807 the bank of england her majesty the queen on the floor was a turkey carpetas old as the mahogany almost as the bank of england as the queeninto which the waiter had in his lonely revolutions trodden so many massive sootflakes and drops of overflowing beer that the glowing looms of smyrna would certainly not have recognised it to say that i ordered my dinner of this archaic type would be altogether to misrepresent the process owing to which having dreamed of lamb and spinach and a salade de saison i sat down in penitence to a muttonchop and a rice pudding bracing my feet against the crossbeam of my little oaken table i opposed to the mahogany partition behind me the vigorous dorsal resistance that must have expressed the oldenglish idea of repose the sturdy screen refused even to creak but my poor yankee joints made up the deficiency  while i was waiting there for my chop there came into the room a person whom after i had looked at him a moment i supposed to be a fellow lodger and probably the only one he seemed like myself to have submitted to proposals for dinner the table on the other side of my partition had been prepared to receive him he walked up to the fire exposed his back to it and after consulting his watch looked directly out of the window and indirectly at me he was a man of something less than middle age and more than middle stature though indeed you would have called him neither young nor tall he was chiefly remarkable for his emphasised leanness his hair very thin on the summit of his head was dark short and fine his eye was of a pale turbid grey unsuited perhaps to his dark hair and welldrawn brows but not altogether out of harmony with his colourless bilious complexion his nose was aquiline and delicate beneath it his moustache languished much rather than bristled his mouth and chin were negative or at the most provisional not vulgar doubtless but ineffectually refined a cold fatal gentlemanly weakness was expressed indeed in his attenuated person his eye was restless and deprecating his whole physiognomy his manner of shifting his weight from foot to foot the spiritless droop of his head told of exhausted intentions of a will relaxed his dress was neat and toned downhe might have been in mourning i made up my mind on three points he was a bachelor he was out of health he was not indigenous to the soil the waiter approached him and they conversed in accents barely audible i heard the words claret sherry with a tentative inflexion and finally beer with its last letter changed to ah perhaps he was a russian in reduced circumstances he reminded me slightly of certain sceptical cosmopolite russians whom i had met on the continent while in my extravagant way i followed this trainfor you see i was interestedthere appeared a short brisk man with reddishbrown hair with a vulgar nose a sharp blue eye and a red beard confined to his lower jaw and chin my putative russian still in possession of the rug let his mild gaze stray over the dingy ornaments of the room the other drew near and his umbrella dealt a playful poke at the concave melancholy waistcoat a penny hapenny for your thoughts  my friend as i call him uttered an exclamation stared then laid his two hands on the others shoulders the latter looked round at me keenly compassing me in a momentary glance i read in its own vague light that this was a transatlantic eyebeam and with such confidence that i hardly needed to see its owner as he prepared with his companion to seat himself at the table adjoining my own take from his overcoatpocket three new york newspapers and lay them beside his plate as my neighbours proceeded to dine i felt the crumbs of their conversation scattered pretty freely abroad i could hear almost all they said without straining to catch it over the top of the partition that divided us occasionally their voices dropped to recovery of discretion but the mystery pieced itself together as if on purpose to entertain me their speech was pitched in the key that may in english air be called alien in spite of a few coincidences the voices were american however with a difference and i had no hesitation in assigning the softer and clearer sound to the pale thin gentleman whom i decidedly preferred to his comrade the latter began to question him about his voyage  horrible horrible i was deadly sick from the hour we left new york  well you do look considerably reduced said the secondcomer  reduced ive been on the verge of the grave i havent slept six hours for three weeks this was said with great gravity  well ive made the voyage for the last time  the plague you have you mean to locate here permanently  oh it wont be so very permanent  there was a pause after which youre the same merry old boy searle going to give up the ghost tomorrow eh  i almost wish i were  youre not so sweet on england then ive heard people say at home that you dress and talk and act like an englishman but i know these people here and i know you youre not one of this crowd clement searle not you youll go under here sir youll go under as sure as my names simmons  following this i heard a sudden clatter as of the drop of a knife and fork well youre a delicate sort of creature if it is your ugly name ive been wandering about all day in this accursed city ready to cry with homesickness and heartsickness and every possible sort of sickness and thinking in the absence of anything better of meeting you here this evening and of your uttering some sound of cheer and comfort and giving me some glimmer of hope go under aint i under now i cant do more than get under the ground  mr simmonss superior brightness appeared to flicker a moment in this gust of despair but the next it was burning steady again dont cry searle i heard him say remember the waiter ive grown englishman enough for that for heavens sake dont lets have any nerves nerves wont do anything for you here its best to come to the point tell me in three words what you expect of me  i heard another movement as if poor searle had collapsed in his chair upon my word sir youre quite inconceivable you never got my letter  yes i got your letter i was never sorrier to get anything in my life  at this declaration mr searle rattled out an oath which it was well perhaps that i but partially heard abijah simmons he then cried what demon of perversity possesses you are you going to betray me here in a foreign land to turn out a false friend a heartless rogue  go on sir said sturdy simmons pour it all out ill wait till youve done your beers lovely he observed independently to the waiter ill have some more  for gods sake explain yourself his companion appealed  there was a pause at the end of which i heard mr simmons set down his empty tankard with emphasis you poor morbid mooning man he resumed i dont want to say anything to make you feel sore i regularly pity you but you must allow that youve acted more like a confirmed crank than a member of our best societyin which every ones so sensible  mr searle seemed to have made an effort to compose himself be so good as to tell me then what was the meaning of your letter  well you had got on my nerves if you want to know when i wrote it it came of my always wishing so to please folks i had much better have let you alone to tell you the plain truth i never was so horrified in my life as when i found that on the strength of my few kind words you had come out here to seek your fortune  what then did you expect me to do  i expected you to wait patiently till i had made further enquiries and had written you again  and youve made further enquiries now  enquiries ive committed assaults  and you find ive no claim  no claim that one of these big bugs will look at it struck me at first that you had rather a neat little case i confess the look of it took hold of me  thanks to your liking so to please folks mr simmons appeared for a moment at odds with something it proved to be with his liquor i rather think your beers too good to be true he said to the waiter i guess ill take water come old man he resumed dont challenge me to the arts of debate or youll have me right down on you and then you will feel me my native sweetness as i say was part of it the idea that if i put the thing through it would be a very pretty feather in my cap and a very pretty penny in my purse was part of it and the satisfaction of seeing a horrid low american walk right into an old english estate was a good deal of it upon my word searle when i think of it i wish with all my heart that extravagant vain man as you are i could for the charm of it put you through i should hardly care what you did with the blamed place when you got it i could leave you alone to turn it into yankee notionsinto ducks and drakes as they call em here i should like to see you tearing round over it and kicking up its sacred dust in their very faces  you dont know me one little bit said mr searle rather shirking i thought the burden of this tribute and for all response to the ambiguity of the compliment  i should be very glad to think i didnt sir ive been to no small amount of personal inconvenience for you ive pushed my way right up to the headspring ive got the best opinion thats to be had the best opinion thats to be had just gives you one leer over its spectacles i guess that look will fix you if you ever get it straight ive been able to tap indirectly mr simmons went on the solicitor of your usurping cousin and he evidently knows something to be in the wind it seems your elder brother twenty years ago put out a feeler so youre not to have the glory of even making them sit up  i never made any one sit up i heard mr searle plead i shouldnt begin at this time of day i should approach the subject like a gentleman  well if you want very much to do something like a gentleman youve got a capital chance take your disappointment like a gentleman  i had finished my dinner and had become keenly interested in poor mr searles unencouragingor unencouragedclaim so interested that i at last hated to hear his trouble reflected in his voice without being ableall respectfullyto follow it in his face i left my place went over to the fire took up the evening paper and established a post of observation behind it  his cold counsellor was in the act of choosing a soft chop from the dishan act accompanied by a great deal of prying and poking with that gentlemans own fork my disillusioned compatriot had pushed away his plate he sat with his elbows on the table gloomily nursing his head with his hands his companion watched him and then seemed to wonderto do mr simmons justicehow he could least ungracefully give him up i say searleand for my benefit i think taking me for a native ingenuous enough to be dazzled by his wit he lifted his voice a little and gave it an ironical ringin this country its the inestimable privilege of a loyal citizen under whatsoever stress of pleasure or of pain to make a point of eating his dinner  mr searle gave his plate another push anything may happen now i dont care a straw  you ought to care have another chop and you will care have some better tipple take my advice mr simmons went on  my friendi adopt that name for himgazed from between his two hands coldly before him ive had enough of your advice  a little more said simmons mildly i shant trouble you again what do you mean to do  nothing  oh come  nothing nothing nothing  nothing but starve how about meeting expenses  why do you ask said my friend you dont care  my dear fellow if you want to make me offer you twenty pounds you set most clumsily about it you said just now i dont know you mr simmons went on possibly come back with me then he said kindly enough and lets improve our acquaintance  i wont go back i shall never go back  never  never  mr simmons thought it shrewdly over well you are sick he exclaimed presently all i can say is that if youre working out a plan for cold poison or for any other act of desperation you had better give it right up you cant get a dose of the commonest kind of cold poison for nothing you know look here searleand the worthy man made what struck me as a very decent appeal if youll consent to return home with me by the steamer of the twentythird ill pay your passage down more than that ill pay for your beer  my poor gentleman met it i believe i never made up my mind to anything before but i think its made up now i shall stay here till i take my departure for a newer world than any patchedup newness of ours its an odd feelingi rather like it what should i do at home  you said just now you were homesick  i meant i was sick for a home dont i belong here havent i longed to get here all my life havent i counted the months and the years till i should be able to go as we say and now that ive gone that is that ive come must i just back out no no ill move on im much obliged to you for your offer ive enough money for the present ive about my person some forty pounds worth of british gold and the same amount say of the toughness of the heavensent idiot theyll see me through together after theyre gone i shall lay my head in some english churchyard beside some ivied tower beneath an old gnarled black yew  i had so far distinctly followed the dialogue but at this point the landlord entered and begging my pardon would suggest that number 12 a most superior apartment having now been vacated it would give him pleasure if i would look in i declined to look in but agreed for number 12 at a venture and gave myself again with dissimulation to my friends they had got up simmons had put on his overcoat he stood polishing his rusty black hat with his napkin do you mean to go down to the place he asked  possibly ive thought of it so often that i should like to see it  shall you call on mr searle  heaven forbid  something has just occurred to me simmons pursued with a grin that made his upper lip look more than ever denuded by the razor and jerked the ugly ornament of his chin into the air theres a certain miss searle the old mans sister  well my gentleman quavered  well siryou talk of moving on you might move on the damsel  mr searle frowned in silence and his companion gave him a tap on the stomach line those ribs a bit first he blushed crimson his eyes filled with tears you are a coarse brute he said the scene quite harrowed me but i was prevented from seeing it through by the reappearance of the landlord on behalf of number 12 he represented to me that i ought in justice to him to come and see how tidy they had made it half an hour afterwards i was rattling along in a hansom toward covent garden where i heard madame bosio in the barber of seville on my return from the opera i went into the coffeeroom it had occurred to me i might catch there another glimpse of mr searle i was not disappointed i found him seated before the fire with his head sunk on his breast he slept dreaming perhaps of abijah simmons i watched him for some moments his closed eyes in the dim lamplight looked even more helpless and resigned and i seemed to see the fine grain of his nature in his unconscious mask they say fortune comes while we sleep and standing there i felt really tender enoughthough otherwise most unqualifiedto be poor mr searles fortune as i walked away i noted in one of the little prandial pews i have described the melancholy waiter whose whiskered chin also reposed on the bulge of his shirtfront i lingered a moment beside the old innyard in which upon a time the coaches and postchaises found space to turn and disgorge above the dusky shaft of the enclosing galleries where lounging lodgers and crumpled chambermaids and all the picturesque domesticity of a rattling tavern must have leaned on their elbows for many a year i made out the faroff lurid twinkle of the london constellations at the foot of the stairs enshrined in the glittering niche of her wellappointed bar the landlady sat napping like some solemn idol amid votive brass and plate  the next morning not finding the subject of my benevolent curiosity in the coffeeroom i learned from the waiter that he had ordered breakfast in bed into this asylum i was not yet prepared to pursue him i spent the morning in the streets partly under pressure of business but catching all kinds of romantic impressions by the way to the searching american eye there is no tint of association with which the great grimy face of london doesnt flush as the afternoon approached however i began to yearn for some site more gracefully classic than what surrounded me and thinking over the excursions recommended to the ingenuous stranger decided to take the train to hampton court the day was the more propitious that it yielded just that dim subaqueous light which sleeps so fondly upon the english landscape  at the end of an hour i found myself wandering through the apartments of the great palace they follow each other in infinite succession with no great variety of interest or aspect but with persistent pomp and a fine specific effect they are exactly of their various times you pass from painted and panelled bedchambers and closets anterooms drawingrooms councilrooms through kings suite queens suite princes suite until you feel yourself move through the appointed hours and stages of some rigid monarchical day on one side are the old monumental upholsteries the big cold tarnished beds and canopies with the circumference of disapparelled royalty symbolised by a gilded balustrade and the great carved and yawning chimneyplaces where dukesinwaiting may have warmed their weary heels on the other in deep recesses rise the immense windows the framed and draped embrasures where the sovereign whispered and favourites smiled looking out on terraced gardens and misty park the brown walls are dimly illumined by innumerable portraits of courtiers and captains more especially with various members of the batavian entourage of william of orange the restorer of the palace with good store too of the lilybosomed models of lely and kneller the whole tone of this processional interior is singularly stale and sad the tints of all things have both faded and darkenedyou taste the chill of the place as you walk from room to room it was still early in the day and in the season and i flattered myself that i was the only visitor this complacency however dropped at sight of a person standing motionless before a simpering countess of sir peter lelys creation on hearing my footstep this victim of an evaporated spell turned his head and i recognised my fellow lodger of the red lion i was apparently recognised as well he looked as if he could scarce wait for me to be kind to him and in fact didnt wait seeing i had a catalogue he asked the name of the portrait on my satisfying him he appealed rather timidly as to my opinion of the lady  well said i not quite timidly enough perhaps i confess she strikes me as no great matter  he remained silent and was evidently a little abashed as we strolled away he stole a sidelong glance of farewell at his leering shepherdess to speak with him face to face was to feel keenly that he was no less interesting than infirm we talked of our inn of london of the palace he uttered his mind freely but seemed to struggle with a weight of depression it was an honest mind enough with no great cultivation but with a certain natural love of excellent things i foresaw that i should find him quite to the manner bornto ours full of glimpses and responses of deserts and desolations his perceptions would be fine and his opinions pathetic i should moreover take refuge from his sense of proportion in his sense of humour and then refuge from that ah mein what on my telling him that i was a fellow citizen he stopped short deeply touched and silently passing his arm into my own suffered me to lead him through the other apartments and down into the gardens a large gravelled platform stretches itself before the basement of the palace taking the afternoon sun parts of the great structure are reserved for private use and habitation occupied by statepensioners reduced gentlewomen in receipt of the queens bounty and other deserving persons many of the apartments have their dependent gardens and here and there between the verdurecoated walls you catch a glimpse of these somewhat stuffy bowers my companion and i measured more than once this long expanse looking down on the floral figures of the rest of the affair and on the stoutlywoven tapestry of creeping plants that muffle the foundations of the huge red pile i thought of the various images of oldworld gentility which early and late must have strolled in front of it and felt the protection and security of the place we peeped through an antique grating into one of the mossy cages and saw an old lady with a black mantilla on her head a decanter of water in one hand and a crutch in the other come forth followed by three little dogs and a cat to sprinkle a plant she would probably have had an opinion on the virtue of queen caroline feeling these things together made us quickly made us extraordinarily intimate my companion seemed to ache with his impression he scowled all gently as if it gave him pain i proposed at last that we should dine somewhere on the spot and take a late train to town we made our way out of the gardens into the adjoining village where we entered an inn which i pronounced very sincerely exactly what we wanted mr searle had approached our board as shyly as if it had been a cold bath but gradually warming to his work he declared at the end of half an hour that for the first time in a month he enjoyed his victuals  im afraid youre rather out of health i risked  yes sirim an incurable  the little village of hampton court stands clustered about the entrance of bushey park and after we had dined we lounged along into the celebrated avenue of horsechestnuts there is a rare emotion familiar to every intelligent traveller in which the mind seems to swallow the sum total of its impressions at a gulp you take in the whole place whatever it be you feel england you feel italy and the sensation involves for the moment a kind of thrill i had known it from time to time in italy and had opened my soul to it as to the spirit of the lord since my landing in england i had been waiting for it to arrive a bottle of tolerable burgundy at dinner had perhaps unlocked to it the gates of sense it arrived now with irresistible force just the scene around me was the england of ones early reveries over against us amid the ripeness of its gardens the dark red residence with its formal facings and its vacant windows seemed to make the past definite and massive the little village nestling between park and palace around a patch of turfy common with its taverns of figurative names its ivytowered church its mossy roofs looked like the property of a feudal lord it was in this dark composite light that i had read the british classics it was this mild moist air that had blown from the pages of the poets while i seemed to feel the buried generations in the dense and elastic sod and that i must have testified in some form or other to what i have called my thrill i gather remembering it from a remark of my companions  youve the advantage over me in coming to all this with an educated eye you already know what old things can be ive never known it but by report ive always fancied i should like it in a small way at home of course i did try to stand by my idea of it i must be a conservative by nature people at home used to call me a cockney and a fribble but it wasnt true he went on if it had been i should have made my way over here long ago beforebefore he paused and his head dropped sadly on his breast  the bottle of burgundy had loosened his tongue i had but to choose my time for learning his story something told me that i had gained his confidence and that so far as attention and attitude might go i was in for responsibilities but somehow i didnt dread them before you lost your health i suggested  before i lost my health he answered and my propertythe little i had and my ambition and any power to take myself seriously  come i cried you shall recover everything this tonic english climate will wind you up in a month and then see how youll take yourselfand how i shall take you  oh he gratefully smiled i may turn to dust in your hands i should like he presently pursued to be an old genteel pensioner lodged over there in the palace and spending my days in maundering about these vistas i should go every morning at the hour when it gets the sun into that long gallery where all those pretty women of lelys are hungi know you despise themand stroll up and down and say something kind to them poor precious forsaken creatures so flattered and courted in their day so neglected now offering up their shoulders and ringlets and smiles to that musty deadly silence  i laid my hand on my friends shoulder oh sir youre all right  just at this moment there came cantering down the shallow glade of the avenue a young girl on a fine black horseone of those little budding gentlewomen perfectly mounted and equipped who form to alien eyes one of the prettiest incidents of english scenery she had distanced her servant and as she came abreast of us turned slightly in her saddle and glanced back at him in the movement she dropped the huntingcrop with which she was armed whereupon she reined up and looked shyly at us and at the implement this is something better than a lely i said searle hastened forward picked up the crop and with a particular courtesy that became him handed it back to the rider fluttered and blushing she reached forward took it with a quick sweet sound and the next moment was bounding over the quiet turf searle stood watching her the servant as he passed us touched his hat when my friend turned toward me again i saw that he too was blushing oh sir youre all right i repeated  at a short distance from where we had stopped was an old stone bench we went and sat down on it and as the sun began to sink watched the light mist powder itself with gold we ought to be thinking of the train back to london i suppose i at last said  oh hang the train sighed my companion  willingly there could be no better spot than this to feel the english evening stand still so we lingered and the twilight hung about us strangely clear in spite of the thickness of the air as we sat there came into view an apparition unmistakeable from afar as an immemorial vagrantthe disowned in his own rich way of all the english ages as he approached us he slackened pace and finally halted touching his cap he was a man of middle age clad in a greasy bonnet with falselooking earlocks depending from its sides round his neck was a grimy red scarf tucked into his waistcoat his coat and trousers had a remote affinity with those of a reduced hostler in one hand he had a stick on his arm he bore a tattered basket with a handful of withered vegetables at the bottom his face was pale haggard and degraded beyond descriptionas base as a counterfeit coin yet as modelled somehow as a tragic mask he too like everything else had a history from what height had he fallen from what depth had he risen he was the perfect symbol of generated constituted baseness and i felt before him in presence of a great artist or actor  for gods sake gentlemen he said in the raucous tone of weatherbeaten poverty the tone of chronic sorethroat exacerbated by perpetual gin for gods sake gentlemen have pity on a poor ferncollectorturning up his stale daisies food hasnt passed my lips gentlemen for the last three days we gaped at him and at each other and to our imagination his appeal had almost the force of a command i wonder if halfacrown would help i privately wailed and our fasting botanist went limping away through the park with the grace of controlled stupefaction still further enriching his outline  i feel as if i had seen my doppelganger said searle he reminds me of myself what am i but a mere figure in the landscape a wandering minstrel or picker of daisies  what are you anyway my friend i thereupon took occasion to ask who are you kindly tell me  the colour rose again to his pale face and i feared i had offended him he poked a moment at the sod with the point of his umbrella before answering who am i he said at last my name is clement searle i was born in new york and thats the beginning and the end of me  ah not the end i made bold to plead  then its because i have no endany more than an illwritten book i just stop anywhere which means im a failure the poor man all lucidly and unreservedly pursued a failure as hopeless and helpless sir as any that ever swallowed up the slender investments of the widow and the orphan i dont pay five cents on the dollar what i might have beenoncetheres nothing left to show i was rotten before i was ripe to begin with certainly i wasnt a fountain of wisdom all the more reason for a definite channelfor having a little character and purpose but i hadnt even a little i had nothing but nice tastes as they call them and fine sympathies and sentiments take a turn through new york today and youll find the tattered remnants of these things dangling on every bush and fluttering in every breeze the men to whom i lent money the women to whom i made love the friends i trusted the follies i invented the poisonous fumes of pleasure amid which nothing was worth a thought but the manhood they stifled it was my fault that i believed in pleasure here below i believe in it still but as i believe in the immortality of the soul the soul is immortal certainlyif youve got one but most people havent pleasure would be right if it were pleasure straight through but it never is my taste was to be the best in the world well perhaps it was i had a little money it went the way of my little wit here in my pocket i have the scant dregs of it i should tell you i was the biggest kind of ass just now that description would flatter me it would assume theres something left of me but the ghost of a donkeywhats that i think he went on with a charming turn and as if striking off his real explanation i should have been all right in a world arranged on different lines before heaven sirwhoever you areim in practice so absurdly tenderhearted that i can afford to say it i entered upon life a perfect gentleman i had the love of old forms and pleasant rites and i found them nowherefound a world all hard lines and harsh lights without shade without composition as they say of pictures without the lovely mystery of colour to furnish colour i melted down the very substance of my own soul i went about with my brush touching up and toning down a very pretty chiaroscuro youll find in my track sitting here in this old park in this old country i feel that i hover on the misty verge of what might have been i should have been born here and not there here my makeshift distinctions would have found things theyd have been true of how it was i never got free is more than i can say it might have cut the knot but the knot was too tight i was always out of health or in debt or somehow desperately dangling besides i had a horror of the great black sickening sea a year ago i was reminded of the existence of an old claim to an english estate which has danced before the eyes of my family at odd moments any time these eighty years i confess its a bit of a muddle and a tangle and am by no means sure that to this hour ive got the hang of it you look as if you had a clear head some other time if you consent well have a go at it such as it is together poverty was staring me in the face i sat down and tried to commit the points of our case to memory as i used to get ninetimesnine by heart as a boy i dreamed of it for six months halfexpecting to wake up some fine morning and hear through a latticed casement the cawing of an english rookery a couple of months ago there came out to england on business of his own a man who once got me out of a dreadful mess not that i had hurt anyone but myself a legal practitioner in our courts a very rough diamond but with a great deal of flair as they say in new york it was with him yesterday you saw me dining he undertook as he called it to nose round and see if anything could be made of our questionable but possible show the matter had never seriously been taken up a month later i got a letter from simmons assuring me that it seemed a very good show indeed and that he should be greatly surprised if i were unable to do something this was the greatest push i had ever got in my life i took a deliberate step for the first time i sailed for england ive been here three days theyve seemed three months after keeping me waiting for thirtysix hours my legal adviser makes his appearance last night and states to me with his mouth full of mutton that i havent a leg to stand on that my claim is moonshine and that i must do penance and take a ticket for six more days of purgatory with his presence thrown in my friend my friendshall i say i was disappointed im already resigned i didnt really believe i had any case i felt in my deeper consciousness that it was the crowning illusion of a life of illusions well it was a pretty one poor legal adviseri forgive him with all my heart but for him i shouldnt be sitting in this place in this air under these impressions this is a world i could have got on with beautifully theres an immense charm in its having been kept for the last after it nothing else would have been tolerable i shall now have a month of it i hope which wont be long enough for it to go back on me theres one thingand here pausing he laid his hand on mine i rose and stood before himi wish it were possible you should be with me to the end  i promise you to leave you only when you kick me downstairs but i suggested my terms it must be on condition of your omitting from your conversation this intolerable flavour of mortality i know nothing of ends im all for beginnings  he kept on me his sad weak eyes then with a faint smile dont cut down a man you find hanging he has had a reason for it im bankrupt  oh healths money i said get well and the rest will take care of itself im interested in your questionable claimits the question thats the charm and pretenders to anything big enough have always been for me an attractive class only their first dutys to be gallant  their first dutys to understand their own points and to know their own mind he returned with hopeless lucidity dont ask me to climb our family tree now he added i fear i havent the head for it ill try some dayif it will bear my weight or yours added to mine theres no doubt however that we as they say go back but i know nothing of business if i were to take the matter in hand i should break in two the poor little silken thread from which everything hangs in a better world than this i think i should be listened to but the wind doesnt set to ideal justice theres no doubt that a hundred years ago we suffered a palpable wrong yet we made no appeal at the time and the dust of a century now lies heaped upon our silence let it rest  what then i asked is the estimated value of your interest  we were instructed from the first to accept a compromise compared with the whole property our ideas have been small we were once advised in the sense of a hundred and thirty thousand dollars why a hundred and thirty im sure i dont know dont beguile me into figures  allow me one more question i said whos actually in possession  a certain mr richard searle i know nothing about him  hes in some way related to you  our greatgrandfathers were halfbrothers what does that make us  twentieth cousins say and where does your twentieth cousin live  at a place called lackleyin middleshire  i thought it over well suppose we look up lackley in middleshire  he got straight up go and see it  go and see it  well he said with you ill go anywhere  on our return to town we determined to spend three days there together and then proceed to our errand we were as conscious one as the other of that deeper mystic appeal made by london to those superstitious pilgrims who feel it the mothercity of their race the distributing heart of their traditional life certain characteristics of the dusky babylon certain aspects phases features say more to the american spiritual ear than anything else in europe the influence of these things on searle it charmed me to note his observation i soon saw to be as i pronounced it to him searching and caressing his almost morbid appetite for any overscoring of time wellnigh extinct from long inanition threw the flush of its revival into his face and his talk     ii  we looked out the topography of middleshire in a countyguide which spoke highly as the phrase is of lackley park and took up our abode our journey ended at a wayside inn where in the days of leisure the coach must have stopped for luncheon and burnished pewters of rustic ale been handed up as straight as possible to outsiders athirst with the sense of speed we stopped here for mere gaping joy of its steepthatched roof its latticed windows its hospitable porch and allowed a couple of days to elapse in vague undirected strolls and sweet sentimental observance of the land before approaching the particular business that had drawn us on the region i allude to is a compendium of the general physiognomy of england the noble friendliness of the scenery its latent oldfriendliness the way we scarcely knew whether we were looking at it for the first or the last time made it arrest us at every step the countryside in the full warm rains of the last of april had burst into sudden perfect spring the dark walls of the hedgerows had turned into blooming screens the sodden verdure of lawn and meadow been washed over with a lighter brush we went forth without loss of time for a long walk on the great grassy hills smooth arrested central billows of some primitive upheaval from the summits of which you find half england unrolled at your feet a dozen broad counties within the scope of your vision commingle their green exhalations closely beneath us lay the dark rich hedgy flats and the copsechequered slopes white with the blossom of apples at widely opposite points of the expanse two great towers of cathedrals rose sharply out of a reddish blur of habitation taking the mild english light  we gave an irrepressible attention to this same solar reserve and found in it only a refinement of art the sky never was empty and never idle the clouds were continually at play for our benefit over against us from our station on the hills we saw them piled and dissolved condensed and shifted blotting the blue with sullen rainspots stretching breezefretted into dappled fields of grey bursting into an explosion of light or melting into a drizzle of silver we made our way along the rounded ridge of the downs and reached by a descent through slanting angular fields green to cottagedoors a russet village that beckoned us from the heart of the maze in which the hedges wrapped it up close beside it i admit the roaring train bounces out of a hole in the hills yet there broods upon this charming hamlet an oldtime quietude that makes a violation of confidence of naming it so far away we struck through a narrow lane a green lane dim with its barriers of hawthorn it led us to a superb old farmhouse now rather rudely jostled by the multiplied roads and byways that have reduced its ancient appanage it stands there in stubborn picturesqueness doggedly submitting to be pointed out and sketched it is a wonderful image of the domiciliary conditions of the pastcruelly complete with bended beams and joists beneath the burden of gables that seem to ache and groan with memories and regrets the short low windows where lead and glass combine equally to create an inward gloom retain their opacity as a part of the primitive idea of defence such an old house provokes on the part of an american a luxury of respect so propped and patched so tinkered with clumsy tenderness clustered so richly about its central english sturdiness its oaken vertebrations so humanised with ages of use and touches of beneficent affection it seemed to offer to our grateful eyes a small rude symbol of the great english social order passing out upon the highroad we came to the common browsingpatch the villagegreen of the tales of our youth nothing was absent the shaggy mousecoloured donkey nosing the turf with his mild and huge proboscis the geese the old womanthe old woman in person with her red cloak and her black bonnet frilled about the face and doublefrilled beside her decent placid cheeksthe towering ploughman with his white smockfrock puckered on chest and back his short corduroys his mighty calves his big red rural face we greeted these things as children greet the loved pictures in a storybook lost and mourned and found again we recognised them as one recognises the handwriting on letterbacks beside the road we saw a ploughboy straddle whistling on a stile and he had the merit of being not only a ploughboy but a gainsborough beyond the stile across the level velvet of a meadow a footpath wandered like a streak drawn by a finger over a surface of fine plush we followed it from field to field and from stile to stile it was all adorably the way to church at the church we finally arrived lost in its rookhaunted churchyard hidden from the workday world by the broad stillness of pasturesa grey grey tower a huge black yew a cluster of villagegraves with crooked headstones and protrusions that had settled and sunk the place seemed so to ache with consecration that my sensitive companion gave way to the force of it  you must bury me here you knowhe caught at my arm its the first place of worship ive seen in my life how it makes a sunday where it stands  it took the church we agreed to make churches but we had the sense the next day of seeing still better why we walked over some seven miles to the nearer of the two neighbouring seats of that lesson and all through such a mist of local colour that we felt ourselves a pair of smolletts pedestrian heroes faring tavernward for a night of adventures as we neared the provincial city we saw the steepled mass of the cathedral long and high rise far into the cloudfreckled blue and as we got closer stopped on a bridge and looked down at the reflexion of the solid minster in a yellow stream going further yet we entered the russet townwhere surely miss austens heroines in chariots and curricles must often have come ashopping for their sandals and mittens we lounged in the grassed and gravelled precinct and gazed insatiably at that most soulsoothing sight the waning wasting afternoon light the visible ether that feels the voices of the chimes cling far aloft to the quiet sides of the cathedraltower saw it linger and nestle and abide as it loves to do on all perpendicular spaces converting them irresistibly into registers and dials tasted too as deeply of the peculiar stillness of this place of priests saw a rosy english lad come forth and lock the door of the old foundationschool that dovetailed with cloister and choir and carry his big responsible key into one of the quiet canonical houses and then stood musing together on the effect on ones mind of having in ones boyhood gone and come through cathedralshades as a kings scholar and yet kept ruddy with much cricket in misty river meadows on the third morning we betook ourselves to lackley having learned that parts of the grounds were open to visitors and that indeed on application the house was sometimes shown  within the range of these numerous acres the declining spurs of the hills continued to undulate and subside a long avenue wound and circled from the outermost gate through an untrimmed woodland whence you glanced at further slopes and glades and copses and bosky recessesat everything except the limits of the place it was as free and untended as i had found a few of the large loose villas of old italy and i was still never to see the angular fact of english landlordism muffle itself in so many concessions the weather had just become perfect it was one of the dozen exquisite days of the english yeardays stamped with a purity unknown in climates where fine weather is cheap it was as if the mellow brightness as tender as that of the primroses which starred the dark waysides like petals windscattered over beds of moss had been meted out to us by the cubic footdistilled from an alchemists crucible from this pastoral abundance we moved upon the more composed scene the park properpassed through a second lodgegate with weatherworn gilding on its twisted bars to the smooth slopes where the great trees stood singly and the tame deer browsed along the bed of a woodland stream here before us rose the gabled grey front of the tudortime developed and terraced and gardened to some later loss as we were afterwards to know of type  here you can wander all day i said to searle like an exiled prince who has come back on tiptoe and hovers about the dominion of the usurper  to think of others having hugged this all these years he answered i know what i am but what might i have been what do such places make of a man  i dare say he gets stupidly used to them i said but i dare say too even then that when you scratch the mere owner you find the perfect lover  what a perfect scene and background it forms my friend however had meanwhile gone on what legends what histories it knows my heart really breaks with all i seem to guess theres tennysons talking oak what summer days one could spend here how i could lounge the rest of my life away on this turf of the middle ages havent i some maidencousin in that old hall or grange or courtwhat in the name of enchantment do you call the thingwho would give me kind leave and then he turned almost fiercely upon me why did you bring me here why did you drag me into this distraction of vain regrets  at this moment there passed within call a decent lad who had emerged from the gardens and who might have been an underling in the stables i hailed him and put the question of our possible admittance to the house he answered that the master was away from home but that he thought it probable the housekeeper would consent to do the honours i passed my arm into searles come i said drain the cup bittersweet though it be we must go in we hastened slowly and approached the fine front the house was one of the happiest fruits of its freshlyfeeling era a multitudinous cluster of fair gables and intricate chimneys brave projections and quiet recesses brown old surfaces weathered to silver and mottled roofs that testified not to seasons but to centuries two broad terraces commanded the wooded horizon our appeal was answered by a butler who condescended to our weakness he renewed the assertion that mr searle was away from home but he would himself lay our case before the housekeeper we would be so good however as to give him our cards this request following so directly on the assertion that mr searle was absent was rather resented by my companion surely not for the housekeeper  the butler gave a diplomatic cough miss searle is at home sir  yours alone will have to serve said my friend i took out a card and pencil and wrote beneath my name new york as i stood with the pencil poised a temptation entered into it without in the least considering proprieties or results i let my implement yieldi added above my name that of mr clement searle what would come of it  before many minutes the housekeeper waited upon usa fresh rosy little old woman in a clean dowdy cap and a scanty sprigged gown a quaint careful person but accessible to the tribute of our pleasure to say nothing of any other she had the accent of the country but the manners of the house under her guidance we passed through a dozen apartments duly stocked with old pictures old tapestry old carvings old armour with a hundred ornaments and treasures the pictures were especially valuable the two vandykes the trio of rosy rubenses the sole and sombre rembrandt glowed with conscious authenticity a claude a murillo a greuze a couple of gainsboroughs hung there with high complacency searle strolled about scarcely speaking pale and grave with bloodshot eyes and lips compressed he uttered no comment on what we sawhe asked but a question or two missing him at last from my side i retraced my steps and found him in a room we had just left on a faded old ottoman and with his elbows on his knees and his face buried in his hands before him ranged on a great credence was a magnificent collection of old italian majolica plates of every shape with their glaze of happy colour jugs and vases nobly bellied and embossed there seemed to rise before me as i looked a sudden vision of the young english gentleman who eighty years ago had travelled by slow stages to italy and been waited on at his inn by persuasive toymen what is it my dear man i asked are you unwell  he uncovered his haggard face and showed me the flush of a consciousness sharper i think to myself than to him a memory of the past there comes back to me a china vase that used to stand on the parlour mantelshelf when i was a boy with a portrait of general jackson painted on one side and a bunch of flowers on the other how long do you suppose that majolica has been in the family  a long time probably it was brought hither in the last century into old old england out of old old italy by some contemporary dandy with a taste for foreign gimcracks here it has stood for a hundred years keeping its clear firm hues in this quiet light that has never sought to advertise it  searle sprang to his feet i say for mercys sake take me away i cant stand this sort of thing before i know it i shall do something scandalous i shall steal some of their infernal crockery i shall proclaim my identity and assert my rights i shall go blubbering to miss searle and ask her in pitys name to put me up  if he could ever have been said to threaten complications he rather visibly did so now i began to regret my officious presentation of his name and prepared without delay to lead him out of the house we overtook the housekeeper in the last room of the series a small unused boudoir over whose chimneypiece hung a portrait of a young man in a powdered wig and a brocaded waistcoat i was struck with his resemblance to my companion while our guide introduced him this is mr clement searle mr searles greatuncle by sir joshua reynolds he died young poor gentleman he perished at sea going to america  he was the young buck who brought the majolica out of italy i supplemented  indeed sir i believe he did said the housekeeper without wonder  hes the image of you my dear searle i further observed  hes remarkably like the gentleman saving his presence said the housekeeper  my friend stood staring clement searleat seagoing to america he broke out then with some sharpness to our old woman why the devil did he go to america  why indeed sir you may well ask i believe he had kinsfolk there it was for them to come to him  searle broke into a laugh it was for them to come to him well well he said fixing his eyes on our guide theyve come to him at last  she blushed like a wrinkled roseleaf indeed sir i verily believe youre one of us  my names the name of that beautiful youth searle went on dear kinsman im happy to meet you and what do you think of this he pursued as he grasped me by the arm i have an idea he perished at sea his spirit came ashore and wandered about in misery till it got another incarnationin this poor trunk and he tapped his hollow chest here it has rattled about these forty years beating its wings against its rickety cage begging to be taken home again and i never knew what was the matter with me now at last the bruised spirit can escape  our old lady gaped at a breadth of appreciationif not at the disclosure of a connexionbeyond her the scene was really embarrassing and my confusion increased as we became aware of another presence a lady had appeared in the doorway and the housekeeper dropped just audibly miss searle my first impression of miss searle was that she was neither young nor beautiful she stood without confidence on the threshold pale trying to smile and twirling my card in her fingers i immediately bowed searle stared at her as if one of the pictures had stepped out of its frame  if im not mistaken one of you gentlemen is mr clement searle the lady adventured  my friends mr clement searle i took upon myself to reply allow me to add that i alone am responsible for your having received his name  i should have been sorry not tonot to see him said miss searle beginning to blush your being from america has led meperhaps to intrude  the intrusion madam has been on our part and with just that excusethat we come from so far away  miss searle while i spoke had fixed her eyes on my friend as he stood silent beneath sir joshuas portrait the housekeeper agitated and mystified fairly let herself go heaven preserve us miss its your greatuncles picture come to life  im not mistaken then said miss searlewe must be distantly related she had the air of the shyest of women for whom it was almost anguish to make an advance without help searle eyed her with gentle wonder from head to foot and i could easily read his thoughts this then was his maidencousin prospective mistress of these hereditary treasures she was of some thirtyfive years of age taller than was then common and perhaps stouter than is now enjoined she had small kind grey eyes a considerable quantity of very lightbrown hair and a smiling wellformed mouth she was dressed in a lustreless black satin gown with a short train disposed about her neck was a blue handkerchief and over this handkerchief in many convolutions a string of amber beads her appearance was singular she was large yet somehow vague mature yet undeveloped her manner of addressing us spoke of all sorts of deep diffidences searle i think had prefigured to himself some proud cold beauty of fiveandtwenty he was relieved at finding the lady timid and not obtrusively fair he at once had an excellent tone  were distant cousins i believe im happy to claim a relationship which youre so good as to remember i hadnt counted on your knowing anything about me  perhaps ive done wrong and miss searle blushed and smiled anew but ive always known of there being people of our blood in america and have often wondered and asked about themwithout ever learning much today when this card was brought me and i understood a clement searle to be under our roof as a stranger i felt i ought to do something but you know i hardly knew what my brothers in london ive done what i think he would have done welcome as a cousin and with a resolution that ceased to be awkward she put out her hand  im welcome indeed if he would have done it half so graciously again searle taking her hand acquitted himself beautifully  youve seen what there is i think miss searle went on perhaps now youll have luncheon we followed her into a small breakfastroom where a deep bay window opened on the mossy flags of a terrace here for some moments she remained dumb and abashed as if resting from a measurable effort searle too had ceased to overflow so that i had to relieve the silence it was of course easy to descant on the beauties of park and mansion and as i did so i observed our hostess she had no arts no impulses nor gracesscarce even any manners she was queerly almost frowsily dressed yet she pleased me well she had an antique sweetness a homely fragrance of old traditions to be so simple among those complicated treasures so pampered and yet so fresh so modest and yet so placid told of just the spacious leisure in which searle and i had imagined human life to be steeped in such places as that this figure was to the sleeping beauty in the wood what a fact is to a fairytale an interpretation to a myth we on our side were to our hostess subjects of a curiosity not cunningly veiled  i should like so to go abroad she exclaimed suddenly as if she meant us to take the speech for an expression of interest in ourselves  have you never been one of us asked  only once three years ago my brother took me to switzerland we thought it extremely beautiful except for that journey ive always lived here i was born in this house its a dear old place indeed and i know it well sometimes one wants a change and on my asking her how she spent her time and what society she saw of course its very quiet she went on proceeding by short steps and simple statements in the manner of a person called upon for the first time to analyse to that extent her situation we see very few people i dont think there are many nice ones hereabouts at least we dont know them our own familys very small my brother cares for nothing but riding and books he had a great sorrow ten years ago he lost his wife and his only son a dear little boy who of course would have had everything do you know that that makes me the heir as theyve done somethingi dont quite know whatto the entail poor old me since his loss my brother has preferred to be quite alone im sorry hes away but you must wait till he comes back i expect him in a day or two she talked more and more as if our very strangeness led her on about her circumstances her solitude her bad eyes so that she couldnt read her flowers her ferns her dogs and the vicar recently presented to the living by her brother and warranted quite safe who had lately begun to light his altar candles pausing every now and then to gasp in selfsurprise yet in the quaintest way in the world keeping up her story as if it were a slow rather awkward oldtime dance a difficult pas seul in which she would have been better with more practice but of which she must complete the figure of all the old things i had seen in england this exhibited mind of miss searles seemed to me the oldest the most handed down and taken for granted fenced and protected as it was by convention and precedent and usage thoroughly acquainted with its subordinate place i felt as if i were talking with the heroine of a lastcentury novel as she talked she rested her dull eyes on her kinsman with wondering kindness at last she put it to him did you mean to go away without asking for us  i had thought it over miss searle and had determined not to trouble you youve shown me how unfriendly i should have been  but you knew of the place being ours and of our relationship  just so it was because of these things that i came down herebecause of them almost that i came to england ive always liked to think of them said my companion  you merely wished to look then we dont pretend to be much to look at  he waited her words were too strange you dont know what you are miss searle  you like the old place then  searle looked at her again in silence if i could only tell you he said at last  do tell me you must come and stay with us  it moved him to an oddity of mirth take care take carei should surprise you im afraid i should bore you i should never leave you  oh youd get homesickfor your real home  at this he was still more amused by the way tell miss searle about our real home he said to me and he stepped through the window out upon the terrace followed by two beautiful dogs a setter and a young staghound who from the moment we came in had established the fondest relation with him miss searle looked at him while he went as if she vaguely yearned over him it began to be plain that she was interested in her exotic cousin i suddenly recalled the last words i had heard spoken by my friends adviser in london and which in a very crude form had reference to his making a match with this lady if only miss searle could be induced to think of that and if one had but the tact to put it in a light to her something assured me that her heart was virginsoil that the flower of romantic affection had never bloomed there if i might just sow the seed there seemed to shape itself within her the perfect image of one of the patient wives of old  he has lost his heart to england i said he ought to have been born here  and yet he doesnt look in the least an englishman she still rather guardedly prosed  oh it isnt his looks poor fellow  of course looks arent everything i never talked with a foreigner before but he talks as i have fancied foreigners  yes hes foreign enough  is he married  his wifes dead and hes all alone in the world  has he much property  none to speak of  but he has means to travel  i meditated he has not expected to travel far i said at last you know hes in very poor health  poor gentleman so i supposed  but theres more of him to go on with than he thinks he came here because he wanted to see your place before he dies  dear mekind man and i imagined in the quiet eyes the hint of a possible tear and he was going away without my seeing him  hes very modest you see  hes very much the gentleman  i couldnt but smile hes all  at this moment we heard on the terrace a loud harsh cry its the great peacock said miss searle stepping to the window and passing out while i followed her below us leaning on the parapet stood our appreciative friend with his arm round the neck of the setter before him on the grand walk strutted the familiar fowl of gardensa splendid specimenwith ruffled neck and expanded tail the other dog had apparently indulged in a momentary attempt to abash the gorgeous biped but at searles summons had bounded back to the terrace and leaped upon the ledge where he now stood licking his new friends face the scene had a beautiful oldtime air the peacock flaunting in the foreground like the genius of stately places the broad terrace which flattered an innate taste of mine for all deserted walks where people may have sat after heavy dinners to drink coffee in old sevres and where the stiff brocade of womens dresses may have rustled over grass or gravel and far around us with one leafy circle melting into another the timbered acres of the park the very beasts have made him welcome i noted as we rejoined our companion  the peacock has done for you mr searle said his cousin what he does only for very great people a year ago there came here a great persona grand old ladyto see my brother i dont think that since then he has spread his tail as wide for any one elsenot by a dozen feathers  its not alone the peacock said searle just now there came slipping across my path a little green lizard the first i ever saw the lizard of literature and if youve a ghost broad daylight though it be i expect to see him here do you know the annals of your house miss searle  oh dear no you must ask my brother for all those things  you ought to have a collection of legends and traditions you ought to have loves and murders and mysteries by the roomful i shall be ashamed of you if you havent  oh mr searle weve always been a very wellbehaved family she quite seriously pleaded nothing out of the way has ever happened i think  nothing out of the way oh that wont do weve managed better than that in america why i myselfand he looked at her ruefully enough but enjoying too his idea that he might embody the social scandal or point to the darkest drama of the searles suppose i should turn out a better searle than youbetter than you nursed here in romance and extravagance come dont disappoint me youve some history among you all youve some poetry youve some accumulation of legend ive been famished all my days for these things dont you understand ah you cant understand tell me he rambled on something tremendous when i think of what must have happened here of the lovers who must have strolled on this terrace and wandered under the beeches of all the figures and passions and purposes that must have haunted these walls when i think of the births and deaths the joys and sufferings the young hopes and the old regrets the rich experience of life he faltered a moment with the increase of his agitation his humour of dismay at a threat of the commonplace in the history he felt about him had turned to a deeper reaction i began to fear however that he was really losing his head he went on with a wilder play to see it all called up there before me if the devil alone could do it id make a bargain with the devil ah miss searle he cried im a most unhappy man  oh dear oh dear she almost wailed while i turned half away  look at that window that dear little window i turned back to see him point to a small protruding oriel above us relieved against the purple brickwork framed in chiselled stone and curtained with ivy  its my little room she said  of course its a womans room think of all the dear facesall of them so mild and yet so proudthat have looked out of that lattice and of all the oldtime womens lives whose principal view of the world has been this quiet park every one of them was a cousin of mine and you dear lady youre one of them yet with which he marched toward her and took her large white hand she surrendered it blushing to her eyes and pressing her other hand to her breast youre a woman of the past youre nobly simple it has been a romance to see you it doesnt matter what i say to you you didnt know me yesterday youll not know me tomorrow let me today do a mad sweet thing let me imagine in you the spirit of all the dead women who have trod the terraceflags that lie here like sepulchral tablets in the pavement of a church let me say i delight in youhe raised her hand to his lips she gently withdrew it and for a moment averted her face meeting her eyes the next instant i saw the tears had come the sleeping beauty was awake  there followed an embarrassed pause an issue was suddenly presented by the appearance of the butler bearing a letter a telegram miss he announced  oh what shall i do cried miss searle i cant open a telegram cousin help me  searle took the missive opened it and read aloud i shall be home to dinner keep the american     iii  keep the american miss searle in compliance with the injunction conveyed in her brothers telegram with something certainly of telegraphic curtness lost no time in expressing the pleasure it would give her that our friend should remain really you must she said and forthwith repaired to the housekeeper to give orders for the preparation of a room  but how in the world did he know of my being here my companion put to me  i answered that he had probably heard from his solicitor of the others visit mr simmons and that gentleman must have had another interview since your arrival in england simmons for reasons of his own has made known to him your journey to this neighbourhood and mr searle learning this has immediately taken for granted that youve formally presented yourself to his sister hes hospitably inclined and wishes her to do the proper thing by you there may even i went on be more in it than that ive my little theory that hes the very phoenix of usurpers that he has been very much struck with what the experts have had to say for you and that he wishes to have the originality of making over to you your shareso limited after allof the estate  i give it up my friend mused come what come will  you of course said miss searle reappearing and turning to me are included in my brothers invitation ive told them to see about a room for you your luggage shall immediately be sent for  it was arranged that i in person should be driven over to our little inn and that i should return with our effects in time to meet mr searle at dinner on my arrival several hours later i was immediately conducted to my room the servant pointed out to me that it communicated by a door and a private passage with that of my fellow visitor i made my way along this passagea low narrow corridor with a broad latticed casement through which there streamed upon a series of grotesquely sculptured oaken closets and cupboards the vivid animating glow of the western sunknocked at his door and getting no answer opened it in an armchair by the open window sat my friend asleep his arms and legs relaxed and head dropped on his breast it was a great relief to see him rest thus from his rhapsodies and i watched him for some moments before waking him there was a faint glow of colour in his cheek and a light expressive parting of his lips something nearer to ease and peace than i had yet seen in him it was almost happiness it was almost health i laid my hand on his arm and gently shook it he opened his eyes gazed at me a moment vaguely recognised me then closed them again let me dream let me dream  what are you dreaming about  a moment passed before his answer came about a tall woman in a quaint black dress with yellow hair and a sweet sweet smile and a soft low delicious voice im in love with her  its better to see her than to dream about her i said get up and dress then well go down to dinner and meet her  dinnerdinner and he gradually opened his eyes again yes upon my word i shall dine  oh youre all right i declared for the twentieth time as he rose to his feet youll live to bury mr simmons he told me he had spent the hours of my absence with miss searlethey had strolled together half over the place you must be very intimate i smiled  shes intimate with me goodness knows what rigmarole ive treated her to they had parted an hour ago since when he believed her brother had arrived  the slowfading twilight was still in the great drawingroom when we came down the housekeeper had told us this apartment was rarely used there being others smaller and more convenient for the same needs it seemed now however to be occupied in my comrades honour at the furthest end rising to the roof like a royal tomb in a cathedral was a great chimneypiece of chiselled white marble yellowed by time in which a light fire was crackling before the fire stood a small short man with his hands behind him near him was miss searle so transformed by her dress that at first i scarcely knew her there was in our entrance and reception something remarkably chilling and solemn we moved in silence up the long room mr searle advanced slowly a dozen steps to meet us his sister stood motionless i was conscious of her masking her visage with a large white tinselled fan and that her eyes grave and enlarged watched us intently over the top of it the master of lackley grasped in silence the proffered hand of his kinsman and eyed him from head to foot suppressing i noted a start of surprise at his resemblance to sir joshuas portrait this is a happy day and then turning to me with an odd little sharp stare my cousins friend is my friend miss searle lowered her fan  the first thing that struck me in mr searles appearance was his very limited stature which was less by half a head than that of his sister the second was the preternatural redness of his hair and beard they intermingled over his ears and surrounded his head like a huge lurid nimbus his face was pale and attenuated the face of a scholar a dilettante a comparer of points and texts a man who lives in a library bending over books and prints and medals at a distance it might have passed for smooth and rather blankly composed but on a nearer view it revealed a number of wrinkles sharply etched and scratched of a singularly aged and refined effect it was the complexion of a man of sixty his nose was arched and delicate identical almost with the nose of my friend his eyes large and deepset had a kind of auburn glow the suggestion of a keen metal redhotor more plainly were full of temper and spirit imagine this physiognomygrave and solemn grotesquely solemn in spite of the bushy brightness which made a sort of frame for itset in motion by a queer quick defiant perfunctory preoccupied smile and you will have an imperfect notion of the remarkable presence of our host something better worth seeing and knowing i perceived as i quite breathlessly took him in than anything we had yet encountered how thoroughly i had entered into sympathy with my poor pickedup friend and how effectually i had associated my sensibilities with his own i had not suspected till within the short five minutes before the signal for dinner i became aware without his giving me the least hint of his placing himself on the defensive to neither of us was mr searle sympathetic i might have guessed from her attitude that his sister entered into our thoughts a marked change had been wrought in her since the morning during the hour indeedas i read in the light of the wondering glance he cast at herthat had elapsed since her parting with her cousin she had not yet recovered from some great agitation her face was pale and she had clearly been crying these notes of trouble gave her a new and quite perverse dignity which was further enhanced by something complimentary and commemorative in her dress  whether it was taste or whether it was accident i know not but the amiable creature as she stood there half in the cool twilight half in the arrested glow of the fire as it spent itself in the vastness of its marble cave was a figure for a painter she was habited in some faded splendour of seagreen crape and silk a piece of millinery which though it must have witnessed a number of dull dinners preserved still a festive air over her white shoulders she wore an ancient web of the most precious and venerable lace and about her rounded throat a single series of large pearls i went in with her to dinner and mr searle following with my friend took his arm as the latter afterwards told me and pretended jocosely to conduct him as dinner proceeded the feeling grew within me that a drama had begun to be played in which the three persons before me were actorseach of a really arduous part the character allotted to my friend however was certainly the least easy to represent with effect though i overflowed with the desire that he should acquit himself to his honour i seemed to see him urge his faded faculties to take their cue and perform the poor fellow tried to do himself credit more seriously than ever in his old best days with miss searle credulous passive and pitying he had finally flung aside all vanity and propriety and shown the bottom of his fantastic heart but with our host there might be no talking of nonsense nor taking of liberties there and then if ever sat a consummate conservative breathing the fumes of hereditary privilege and security for an hour accordingly i saw my poor protege attempt all in pain to meet a new decorum he set himself the task of appearing very american in order that his appreciation of everything mr searle represented might seem purely disinterested what his kinsman had expected him to be i know not but i made mr searle out as annoyed in spite of his exaggerated urbanity at finding him so harmless our host was not the man to show his hand but i think his best card had been a certain implicit confidence that so provincial a parasite would hardly have good manners  he led the conversation to the country we had left rather as if a leash had been attached to the collar of some lumpish and halfdomesticated animal the tendency of whose movements had to be recognised he spoke of it indeed as of some fabled planet alien to the british orbit lately proclaimed to have the admixture of atmospheric gases required to support animal life but not save under cover of a liberal afterthought to be admitted into ones regular conception of things i for my part felt nothing but regret that the spheric smoothness of his universe should be disfigured by the extrusion even of such inconsiderable particles as ourselves  i knew in a general way of our having somehow ramified over there mr searle mentioned but had scarcely followed it more than you pretend to pick up the fruit your longarmed pear tree may drop on the other side of your wall in your neighbours garden there was a man i knew at cambridge a very odd fellow a decent fellow too he and i were rather cronies i think he afterwards went to the middle states theyll be i suppose about the mississippi at all events there was that greatuncle of mine whom sir joshua painted he went to america but he never got there he was lost at sea you look enough like him to make one fancy he did get there and that youve kept him alive by one of those beastly processesi think you have em over there what do you call it putting up things if youre he youve not done a wise thing to show yourself here he left a bad name behind him theres a ghost who comes sobbing about the house every now and then the ghost of one to whom he did a wrong  oh mercy on us cried miss searle in simple horror  of course you know nothing of such things he rather dryly allowed youre too sound a sleeper to hear the sobbing of ghosts  im sure i should like immensely to hear the sobbing of a ghost said my friend the light of his previous eagerness playing up into his eyes why does it sob i feel as if that were what weve come above all to learn  mr searle eyed his audience a moment gaugingly he held the balance as to measure his resources he wished to do justice to his theme with the long fingernails of his left hand nervously playing against the tinkling crystal of his wineglass and his conscious eyes betraying that small and strange as he sat there he knew himself to his pleasure and advantage remarkably impressive he dropped into our untutored minds the sombre legend of his house mr clement searle from all i gather was a young man of great talents but a weak disposition his mother was left a widow early in life with two sons of whom he was the elder and the more promising she educated him with the greatest affection and care of course when he came to manhood she wished him to marry well his means were quite sufficient to enable him to overlook the want of money in his wife and mrs searle selected a young lady who possessed as she conceived every good gift save a fortunea fine proud handsome girl the daughter of an old friend an old lover i suspect of her own clement however as it appeared had either chosen otherwise or was as yet unprepared to choose the young lady opened upon him in vain the battery of her attractions in vain his mother urged her cause clement remained cold insensible inflexible mrs searle had a character which appears to have gone out of fashion in my family nowadays she was a great manager a maitressefemme a proud passionate imperious woman she had had immense cares and ever so many lawsuits they had sharpened her temper and her will she suspected that her sons affections had another object and this object she began to hate irritated by his stubborn defiance of her wishes she persisted in her purpose the more she watched him the more she was convinced he loved in secret if he loved in secret of course he loved beneath him he went about the place all sombre and sullen and brooding at last with the rashness of an angry woman she threatened to bring the young lady of her choicewho by the way seems to have been no shrinking blossomto stay in the house a stormy scene was the result he threatened that if she did so he would leave the country and sail for america she probably disbelieved him she knew him to be weak but she overrated his weakness at all events the rejected one arrived and clement searle departed on a dark december day he took ship at southampton the two women desperate with rage and sorrow sat alone in this big house mingling their tears and imprecations a fortnight later on christmas eve in the midst of a great snowstorm long famous in the country something happened that quickened their bitterness a young woman battered and chilled by the storm gained entrance to the house and making her way into the presence of the mistress and her guest poured out her tale she was a poor curates daughter out of some little hole in gloucestershire clement searle had loved herloved her all too well she had been turned out in wrath from her fathers house his mother at least might pity herif not for herself then for the child she was soon to bring forth hut the poor girl had been a second time too trustful the women in scorn in horror with blows possibly drove her forth again into the storm in the storm she wandered and in the deep snow she died her lover as you know perished in that hard winter weather at sea the news came to his mother late but soon enough were haunted by the curates daughter  mr searle retailed this anecdote with infinite taste and point the happiest art when he ceased there was a pause of some moments ah well we may be miss searle then mournfully murmured  searle blazed up into enthusiasm of course you knowwith which he began to blush violentlyi should be sorry to claim any identity with the poor devil my faithless namesake but i should be immensely gratified if the young ladys spirit deceived by my resemblance were to mistake me for her cruel lover shes welcome to the comfort of it what one can do in the case i shall be glad to do but can a ghost haunt a ghost i am a ghost  mr searle stared a moment and then had a subtle sneer i could almost believe you are  oh brotherand cousin cried miss searle with the gentlest yet most appealing dignity how can you talk so horribly the horrible talk however evidently possessed a potent magic for my friend and his imagination checked a while by the influence of his kinsman began again to lead him a dance from this moment he ceased to steer his frail bark to care what he said or how he said it so long as he expressed his passionate appreciation of the scene around him as he kept up this strain i ceased even secretly to wish he wouldnt i have wondered since that i shouldnt have been annoyed by the way he reverted constantly to himself but a great frankness for the time makes its own law and a great passion its own channel there was moreover an irresponsible indescribable effect of beauty in everything his lips uttered free alike from adulation and from envy the essence of his discourse was a divine apprehension a romantic vision free as the flight of ariel of the poetry of his companions situation and their contrasted general irresponsiveness  how does the look of age come he suddenly broke out at dessert does it come of itself unobserved unrecorded unmeasured or do you woo it and set baits and traps for it and watch it like the dawning brownness of a meerschaum pipe and make it fast when it appears just where it peeps out and light a votive taper beneath it and give thanks to it daily or do you forbid it and fight it and resist it and yet feel it settling and deepening about you as irresistible as fate  what the deuce is the man talking about said the smile of our host  i found a little grey hair this morning miss searle incoherently prosed  well then i hope you paid it every respect cried her visitor  i looked at it for a long time in my handglass she answered with more presence of mind  miss searle can for many years to come afford to be amused at grey hairs i interposed in the hope of some greater ease it had its effect ten years from last thursday i shall be fortyfour she almost comfortably smiled  well thats just what i am said searle if i had only come here ten years ago i should have had more time to enjoy the feast but i should have had less appetite i needed first to get famished  oh why did you wait for that his entertainer asked to think of these ten years that we might have been enjoying you at the vision of which waste and loss mr searle had a fine shrill laugh  well my friend explained i always had a notiona stupid vulgar notion if there ever was onethat to come abroad properly one had to have a pot of money my pot was too nearly empty at last i came with my empty pot  mr searle had a wait for delicacy but he proceeded youre reduced youreastraitened  our companions very breath blew away the veil reduced to nothing straitened to the clothes on my back  you dont say so said mr searle with a large vague gasp wellwellwell he added in a voice which might have meant everything or nothing and then in his whimsical way went on to finish a glass of wine his searching eye as he drank met mine and for a moment we each rather deeply sounded the other to the effect no doubt of a slight embarrassment and you he said by way of carrying this offhow about your wardrobe  oh his cried my friend his wardrobes immense he could dress up a regiment he had drunk more champagnei admit that the champagne was goodthan was from any point of view to have been desired he was rapidly drifting beyond any tacit dissuasion of mine he was feverish and rash and all attempt to direct would now simply irritate him as we rose from the table he caught my troubled look passing his arm for a moment into mine this is the great night he strangely and softly said the night and the crisis that will settle me  mr searle had caused the whole lower portion of the house to be thrown open and a multitude of lights to be placed in convenient and effective positions such a marshalled wealth of ancient candlesticks and flambeaux i had never beheld niched against the dusky wainscots casting great luminous circles upon the pendent stiffness of sombre tapestries enhancing and completing with admirable effect the variety and mystery of the great ancient house they seemed to people the wide rooms as our little group passed slowly from one to another with a dim expectant presence we had thus in spite of everything a wonderful hour of it mr searle at once assumed the part of cicerone andi had not hitherto done him justicemr searle became almost agreeable while i lingered behind with his sister he walked in advance with his kinsman it was as if he had said well if you want the old place you shall have itso far as the impression goes he spared us no thrilli had almost said no pangof that experience carrying a tall silver candlestick in his left hand he raised it and lowered it and cast the light hither and thither upon pictures and hangings and carvings and cornices he knew his house to perfection he touched upon a hundred traditions and memories he threw off a cloud of rich reference to its earlier occupants he threw off again in his easy elegant way a dozenhappily lighteranecdotes his relative attended with a brooding deference miss searle and i meanwhile were not wholly silent  i suppose that by this time you and your cousin are almost old friends i remarked  she trifled a moment with her fan and then raised her kind small eyes old friendsyet at the same time strangely new my cousin my cousinand her voice lingered on the wordit seems so strange to call him my cousin after thinking these many years that ive no one in the world but my brother but hes really so very odd  its not so much he aswell as his situation that deserves that name i tried to reason  im so sorry for his situation i wish i could help it in some way he interests me so much she gave a sweetsounding sigh i wish i could have known him soonerand better he tells me hes but the shadow of what he used to be  i wondered if he had been consciously practising on the sensibilities of this gentle creature if he had i believed he had gained his point but his position had in fact become to my sense so precarious that i hardly ventured to be glad his better self just now seems again to be taking shape i said it will have been a good deed on your part if you help to restore him to all he ought to be  she met my idea blankly dear me what can i do  be a friend to him let him like you let him love you i dare say you see in him now much to pity and to wonder at but let him simply enjoy a while the grateful sense of your nearness and dearness hell be a better and stronger man for it and then you can love him you can esteem him without restriction  she fairly frowned for helplessness its a hard part for poor stupid me to play  her almost infantine innocence left me no choice but to be absolutely frank did you ever play any part at all  she blushed as if i had been reproaching her with her insignificance never i think ive hardly lived  youve begun to live now perhaps youve begun to care for something else than your oldfashioned habits pardon me if i seem rather meddlesome you know we americans are very rough and ready its a great moment i wish you joy  i could almost believe youre laughing at me i feel more trouble than joy  why do you feel trouble  she paused with her eyes fixed on our companions my cousins arrivals a great disturbance she said at last  you mean you did wrong in coming to meet him in that case the faults mine he had no intention of giving you the opportunity  i certainly took too much on myself but i cant find it in my heart to regret it i never shall regret it i did the only thing i could heaven forgive me  heaven bless you miss searle is any harm to come of it i did the evil let me bear the brunt  she shook her head gravely you dont know my brother  the sooner i master the subject the better then i said i couldnt help relieving myselfat least by the tone of my voiceof the antipathy with which decidedly this gentleman had inspired me not perhaps that we should get on so well together after which as she turned away are you very much afraid of him i added  she gave me a shuddering sidelong glance hes looking at me  he was placed with his back to us holding a large venetian handmirror framed in chiselled silver which he had taken from a shelf of antiquities just at such an angle that he caught the reflexion of his sisters person it was evident that i too was under his attention and was resolved i wouldnt be suspected for nothing miss searle i said with urgency promise me something  she turned upon me with a start and a look that seemed to beg me to spare her oh dont ask meplease dont it was as if she were standing on the edge of a place where the ground had suddenly fallen away and had been called upon to make a leap i felt retreat was impossible however and that it was the greater kindness to assist her to jump  promise me i repeated  still with her eyes she protested oh what a dreadful day she cried at last  promise me to let him speak to you alone if he should ask youany wish you may suspect on your brothers part notwithstanding she coloured deeply you mean he has something so particular to say  something so particular  poor cousin  well poor cousin but promise me  i promise she said and moved away across the long room and out of the door  youre in time to hear the most delightful story searle began to me as i rejoined him and his host they were standing before an old sombre portrait of a lady in the dress of queen annes time whose illpainted fleshtints showed livid in the candlelight against her dark drapery and background this is mrs margaret searlea sort of beatrix esmondqui se passait ses fantaisies she married a paltry frenchman a penniless fiddler in the teeth of her whole family pretty mrs margaret you must have been a woman of courage upon my word she looks like miss searle but pray go on what came of it all  our companion watched him with an air of distaste for his boisterous homage and of pity for his crude imagination but he took up the tale with an effective dryness i found a year ago in a box of very old papers a letter from the lady in question to a certain cynthia searle her elder sister it was dated from paris and dreadfully illspelled it contained a most passionate appeal for pecuniary assistance she had just had a baby she was starving and dreadfully neglected by her husbandshe cursed the day she had left england it was a most dismal production i never heard she found means to return  so much for marrying a frenchman i said sententiously  our host had one of his waits this is the only lady of the family who ever was taken in by an adventurer  does miss searle know her history asked my friend with a stare at the rounded whiteness of the heroines cheek  miss searle knows nothing said our host with expression  she shall know at least the tale of mrs margaret their guest returned and he walked rapidly away in search of her  mr searle and i pursued our march through the lighted rooms youve found a cousin with a vengeance i doubtless awkwardly enough laughed  ah a vengeance my entertainer stiffly repeated  i mean that he takes as keen an interest in your annals and possessions as yourself  oh exactly so he tells me hes a bad invalid he added in a moment i should never have supposed it  within the past few hours hes a changed man your beautiful house your extreme kindness have refreshed him immensely mr searle uttered the vague ejaculation with which selfconscious britons so often betray the concussion of any especial courtesy of speech but he followed this by a sudden odd glare and the sharp declaration im an honest man i was quite prepared to assent but he went on with a fury of frankness as if it were the first time in his life he had opened himself to any one as if the process were highly disagreeable and he were hurrying through it as a task an honest man mind you i know nothing about mr clement searle i never expected to see him he has been to me aa and here he paused to select a word which should vividly enough express what for good or for ill his kinsman represented he has been to me an amazement ive no doubt hes a most amiable man youll not deny however that hes a very extraordinary sort of person im sorry hes ill im sorry hes poor hes my fiftieth cousin well and good im an honest man he shall not have it to say that he wasnt received at my house  he too thank heaven is an honest man i smiled  why the devil then cried mr searle turning almost fiercely on me has he put forward this underhand claim to my property  the question quite ringing out flashed backward a gleam of light upon the demeanour of our host and the suppressed agitation of his sister in an instant the jealous gentleman revealed itself for a moment i was so surprised and scandalised at the directness of his attack that i lacked words to reply as soon as he had spoken indeed mr searle appeared to feel he had been wanting in form pardon me he began afresh if i speak of this matter with heat but ive been more disgusted than i can say to hear as i heard this morning from my solicitor of the extraordinary proceedings of mr clement searle gracious goodness sir for what does the man take me he pretends to the lord knows what fantastic admiration for my place let him then show his respect for it by not taking too many liberties let him with his highflown parade of loyalty imagine a tithe of what i feel i love my estate its my passion my conscience my life am i to divide it up at this time of day with a beggarly foreignera man without means without appearance without proof a pretender an adventurer a chattering mountebank i thought america boasted having lands for all men upon my soul sir ive never been so shocked in my life  i paused for some moments before speaking to allow his passion fully to expend itself and to flicker up again if it chose for so far as i was concerned in the whole awkward matter i but wanted to deal with him discreetly your apprehensions sir i said at last your not unnatural surprise perhaps at the candour of our interest have acted too much on your nerves youre attacking a man of straw a creature of unworthy illusion though im sadly afraid youve wounded a man of spirit and conscience either my friend has no valid claim on your estate in which case your agitation is superfluous or he has a valid claim  mr searle seized my arm and glared at me his pale face paler still with the horror of my suggestion his great eyes of alarm glowing and his strange red hair erect and quivering a valid claim he shouted let him try itlet him bring it into court  we had emerged into the great hall and stood facing the main doorway the door was open into the portico through the stone archway of which i saw the garden glitter in the blue light of a full moon as the master of the house uttered the words i have just repeated my companion came slowly up into the porch from without bareheaded bright in the outer moonlight dark in the shadow of the archway and bright again in the lamplight at the entrance of the hall as he crossed the threshold the butler made an appearance at the head of the staircase on our left faltering visibly a moment at sight of mr searle after which noting my friend he gravely descended he bore in his hand a small silver tray on the tray gleaming in the light of the suspended lamp lay a folded note clement searle came forward staring a little and startled i think by some quick nervous prevision of a catastrophe the butler applied the match to the train he advanced to my fellow visitor all solemnly with the offer of his missive mr searle made a movement as if to spring forward but controlled himself tottenham he called in a strident voice  yes sir said tottenham halting  stand where you are for whom is that note  for mr clement searle said the butler staring straight before him and dissociating himself from everything  who gave it to you  mrs horridge sir this personage i afterwards learned was our friend the housekeeper  who gave it mrs horridge  there was on tottenhams part just an infinitesimal pause before replying  my dear sir broke in searle his equilibrium his ancient ease completely restored by the crisis isnt that rather my business  what happens in my house is my business and detestable things seem to be happening our host it was clear now so furiously detested them that i was afraid he would snatch the bone of contention without more ceremony bring me that thing he cried on which tottenham stiffly moved to obey  really this is too much broke out my companion affronted and helpless  so indeed it struck me and before mr searle had time to take the note i possessed myself of it if youve no consideration for your sister let a stranger at least act for her and i tore the disputed object into a dozen pieces  in the name of decency what does this horrid business mean my companion quavered  mr searle was about to open fire on him but at that moment our hostess appeared on the staircase summoned evidently by our highpitched contentious voices she had exchanged her dinnerdress for a dark wrapper removed her ornaments and begun to disarrange her hair a thick tress of which escaped from the comb she hurried down with a pale questioning face feeling distinctly that for ourselves immediate departure was in the air and divining mr tottenham to be a person of a few deepseated instincts and of much latent energy i seized the opportunity to request him sotto voce to send a carriage to the door without delay and put up our things i added  our host rushed at his sister and grabbed the white wrist that escaped from the loose sleeve of her dress what was in that note he quite hissed at her  miss searle looked first at its scattered fragments and then at her cousin did you read it  no but i thank you for it said searle  her eyes for an instant communicated with his own as i think they had never never communicated with any other source of meaning then she transferred them to her brothers face where the sense went out of them only to leave a dull sad patience but there was something even in this flat humility that seemed to him to mock him so that he flushed crimson with rage and spite and flung her away you always were an idiot go to bed  in poor searles face as well the gathered serenity had been by this time all blighted and distorted and the reflected brightness of his happy day turned to blank confusion have i been dealing these three hours with a madman he woefully cried  a madman yes if you will a man mad with the love of his home and the sense of its stability ive held my tongue till now but youve been too much for me who the devil are you and what and why and whence the terrible little man continued from what paradise of fools do you come that you fancy i shall make over to you for the asking a part of my property and my life im forsooth you ridiculous person to go shares with you prove your preposterous claim there isnt that in it and he kicked one of the bits of paper on the floor  searle received this broadside gaping then turning away he went and seated himself on a bench against the wall and rubbed his forehead amazedly i looked at my watch and listened for the wheels of our carriage  but his kinsman was too launched to pull himself up wasnt it enough that you should have plotted against my rights need you have come into my very house to intrigue with my sister  my friend put his two hands to his face oh oh oh he groaned while miss searle crossed rapidly and dropped on her knees at his side  go to bed you fool shrieked her brother  dear cousin she said its cruel youre to have so to think of us  oh i shall think of you as youd like he laid a hand on her head  i believe youve done nothing wrong she brought bravely out  ive done what i could mr searle went onbut its arrant folly to pretend to friendship when this abomination lies between us you were welcome to my meat and my wine but i wonder you could swallow them the sight spoiled my appetite cried the master of lackley with a laugh proceed with your trumpery case my people in london are instructed and prepared  i shouldnt wonder if your case had improved a good deal since you gave it up i was moved to observe to searle  oho you dont feign ignorance then and our insane entertainer shook his shining head at me its very kind of you to give it up perhaps youll also give up my sister  searle sat staring in distress at his adversary ah miserable mani thought we had become such beautiful friends  boh you hypocrite screamed our host  searle seemed not to hear him am i seriously expected he slowly and painfully pursued to defend myself against the accusation of any real indelicacyto prove ive done nothing underhand or impudent think what you please and he rose with an effort to his feet i know what you think he added to miss searle  the wheels of the carriage resounded on the gravel and at the same moment a footman descended with our two portmanteaux mr tottenham followed him with our hats and coats  good god our host broke out again youre not going awayan ejaculation that after all that had happened had the grandest comicality bless my soul he then remarked as artlessly of course youre going  its perhaps well said miss searle with a great effort inexpressibly touching in one for whom great efforts were visibly new and strange that i should tell you what my poor little note contained  that matter of your note madam her brother interrupted you and i will settle together  let me imagine all sorts of kind things searle beautifully pleaded  ah too much has been imagined she answered simply it was only a word of warning it was to tell you to go i knew something painful was coming  he took his hat the pains and the pleasures of this day he said to his kinsman i shall equally never forget knowing you and he offered his hand to miss searle has been the pleasure of pleasures i hoped something more might have come of it  a monstrous deal too much has come of it mr searle irrepressibly declared  his departing guest looked at him mildly almost benignantly from head to foot and then with closed eyes and some collapse of strength im afraid so i cant stand more he went on i gave him my arm and we crossed the threshold as we passed out i heard miss searle break into loud weeping  we shall hear from each other yet i take it her brother pursued harassing our retreat  my friend stopped turning round on him fiercely you very impossible man he cried in his face  do you mean to say youll not prosecute mr searle kept it up i shall force you to prosecute i shall drag you into court and you shall be beatenbeatenbeaten which grim reiteration followed us on our course  we drove of course to the little wayside inn from which we had departed in the morning so unencumbered in all broad england either with enemies or friends my companion as the carriage rolled along seemed overwhelmed and exhausted what a beautiful horrible dream he confusedly wailed what a strange awakening what a long long day what a hideous scene poor me poor woman when we had resumed possession of our two little neighbouring rooms i asked him whether miss searles note had been the result of anything that had passed between them on his going to rejoin her i found her on the terrace he said walking restlessly up and down in the moonlight i was greatly excitedi hardly know what i said i asked her i think if she knew the story of margaret searle she seemed frightened and troubled and she used just the words her brother had usedi know nothing for the moment somehow i felt as a man drunk i stood before her and told her with great emphasis how poor margaret had married a beggarly foreignerall in obedience to her heart and in defiance to her family as i talked the sheeted moonlight seemed to close about us so that we stood there in a dream in a world quite detached she grew younger prettier more attractivei found myself talking all kinds of nonsense before i knew it i had gone very far i was taking her hand and calling her margaret dear margaret she had said it was impossible that she could do nothing that she was a fool a child a slave then with a sudden senseit was odd how it came over me thereof the reality of my connexion with the place i spoke of my claim against the estate it exists i declared but ive given it up be generous pay me for my sacrifice for an instant her face was radiant if i marry you she asked will it make everything right of that i at once assured herin our marriage the whole difficulty would melt away like a raindrop in the great sea our marriage she repeated in wonder and the deep ring of her voice seemed to wake us up and show us our folly i love you but i shall never see you again she cried and she hurried away with her face in her hands i walked up and down the terrace for some moments and then came in and met you thats the only witchcraft ive used  the poor man was at once so roused and so shaken by the days events that i believed he would get little sleep conscious on my own part that i shouldnt close my eyes i but partly undressed stirred my fire and sat down to do some writing i heard the great clock in the little parlour below strike twelve one halfpast one just as the vibration of this last stroke was dying on the air the door of communication with searles room was flung open and my companion stood on the threshold pale as a corpse in his nightshirt shining like a phantom against the darkness behind him look well at me he intensely gasped touch me embrace me revere me you see a man who has seen a ghost  gracious goodness what do you mean  write it down he went on there take your pen put it into dreadful words how do i look am i human am i pale am i red am i speaking english a ghost sir do you understand  i confess there came upon me by contact a kind of supernatural shock i shall always feel by the whole communication of it that i too have seen a ghost my first movementi can smile at it nowwas to spring to the door close it quickly and turn the key upon the gaping blackness from which searle had emerged i seized his two hands they were wet with perspiration i pushed my chair to the fire and forced him to sit down in it then i got on my knees and held his hands as firmly as possible they trembled and quivered his eyes were fixed save that the pupil dilated and contracted with extraordinary force i asked no questions but waited there very curious for what he would say at last he spoke im not frightened but imoh excited this is life this is living my nervesmy heartmy brain theyre throbbingdont you feel it do you tingle are you hot are you cold hold me tighttighttight i shall tremble away into wavesinto surgesand know all the secrets of things and all the reasons and all the mysteries he paused a moment and then went on a womanas clear as that candle no far clearer in a blue dress with a black mantle on her head and a little black muff young and wonderfully pretty pale and ill with the sadness of all the women who ever loved and suffered pleading and accusing in her wetlooking eyes god knows i never did any such thing but she took me for my elder for the other clement she came to me here as she would have come to me there she wrung her hands and she spoke to me marry me she moaned marry me and put an end to my shame i sat up in bed just as i sit here looked at her heard herheard her voice melt away watched her figure fade away bless us and save us here i be  i made no attempt either to explain or to criticise this extraordinary passage its enough that i yielded for the hour to the strange force of my friends emotion on the whole i think my own vision was the more interesting of the two he beheld but the transient irresponsible spectrei beheld the human subject hot from the spectral presence yet i soon recovered my judgement sufficiently to be moved again to try to guard him against the results of excitement and exposure it was easily agreed that he was not for the night to return to his room and i made him fairly comfortable in his place by my fire wishing above all to preserve him from a chill i removed my bedding and wrapped him in the blankets and counterpane i had no nerves either for writing or for sleep so i put out my lights renewed the fuel and sat down on the opposite side of the hearth i found it a great and high solemnity just to watch my companion silent swathed and muffled to his chin he sat rigid and erect with the dignity of his adventure for the most part his eyes were closed though from time to time he would open them with a steady expansion and stare never blinking into the flame as if he again beheld without terror the image of the little woman with the muff his cadaverous emaciated face his tragic wrinkles intensified by the upward glow from the hearth his distorted moustache his extraordinary gravity and a certain fantastical air as the red light flickered over him all reenforced his fine likeness to the visionhaunted knight of la mancha when laid up after some grand exploit the night passed wholly without speech toward its close i slept for half an hour when i awoke the awakened birds had begun to twitter and searle unperturbed sat staring at me we exchanged a long look and i felt with a pang that his glittering eyes had tasted their last of natural sleep how is it are you comfortable i nevertheless asked  he fixed me for a long time without replying and then spoke with a weak extravagance and with such pauses between his words as might have represented the slow prompting of an inner voice you asked me when you first knew me what i was nothing i said nothing of any consequence nothing ive always supposed myself to be but ive wronged myselfim a great exception im a haunted man  if sleep had passed out of his eyes i felt with even a deeper pang that sanity had abandoned his spirit from this moment i was prepared for the worst there were in my friend however such confirmed habits of mildness that i found myself not in the least fearing he would prove unmanageable as morning began fully to dawn upon us i brought our curious vigil to a close searle was so enfeebled that i gave him my hands to help him out of his chair and he retained them for some moments after rising to his feet unable as he seemed to keep his balance well he said ive been once favoured but dont think i shall be favoured again i shall soon be myself as fit to appear as any of them i shall haunt the master of lackley it can only mean one thingthat theyre getting ready for me on the other side of the grave  when i touched the question of breakfast he replied that he had his breakfast in his pocket and he drew from his travellingbag a phial of morphine he took a strong dose and went to bed at noon i found him on foot again dressed shaved much refreshed poor fellow he said youve got more than you bargained fornot only a man with a grievance but a man with a ghost well it wont be for long it had of course promptly become a question whither we should now direct our steps as ive so little time he argued for this i should like to see the best the best alone i answered that either for time or eternity i had always supposed oxford to represent the english maximum and for oxford in the course of an hour we accordingly departed     iv  of that extraordinary place i shall not attempt to speak with any order or indeed with any coherence it must ever remain one of the supreme gratifications of travel for any american aware of the ancient pieties of race the impression it produces the emotions it kindles in the mind of such a visitor are too rich and various to be expressed in the halting rhythm of prose passing through the small oblique streets in which the long grey battered public face of the colleges seems to watch jealously for sounds that may break upon the stillness of study you feel it the most dignified and most educated of cities over and through it all the great corporate fact of the university slowly throbs after the fashion of some steady bass in a concerted piece or that of the mediaeval mystical presence of the empire in the old states of germany the plain perpendicular of the so mildly conventual fronts masking blest seraglios of culture and leisure irritates the imagination scarce less than the haremwalls of eastern towns within their arching portals however you discover more sacred and sunless courts and the dark verdure soothing and cooling to bookish eyes the greygreen quadrangles stand for ever open with a trustful hospitality the seat of the humanities is stronger in her own good manners than in a marshalled host of wardens and beadles directly after our arrival my friend and i wandered forth in the luminous early dusk we reached the bridge that underspans the walls of magdalen and saw the eightspired tower delicately fluted and embossed rise in temperate beautythe perfect prose of gothicwooing the eyes to the sky that was slowly drained of day we entered the low monkish doorway and stood in the dim little court that nestles beneath the tower where the swallows niche more lovingly in the tangled ivy than elsewhere in oxford and passed into the quiet cloister and studied the small sculptured monsters on the entablature of the arcade i rejoiced in every one of my unhappy friends responsive vibrations even while feeling that they might as direfully multiply as those that had preceded them i may say that from this time forward i found it difficult to distinguish in his company between the riot of fancy and the labour of thought or to fix the balance between what he saw and what he imagined he had already begun playfully to exchange his identity for that of the earlier clement searle and he now delivered himself almost wholly in the character of his oldtime kinsman  this was my college you know he would almost anywhere break out applying the words wherever we stoodthe sweetest and noblest in the whole place how often have i strolled in this cloister with my intimates of the other world they are all dead and buried but many a young fellow as we meet him dark or fair tall or short reminds me of the past age and the early attachment even as we stand here they say the whole thing feels about its massive base the murmurs of the tide of time some of the foundationstones are loosened some of the breaches will have to be repaired mine was the old unregenerate oxford the home of rank abuses of distinctions and privileges the most delicious and invidious what cared i who was a perfect gentleman and with my pockets full of money i had an allowance of a thousand a year  it was at once plain to me that he had lost the little that remained of his direct grasp on life and was unequal to any effort of seeing things in their order he read my apprehension in my eyes and took pains to assure me i was right im going straight down hill thank heaven its an easy slope coated with english turf and with an english churchyard at the foot the hysterical emotion produced by our late dire misadventure had given place to an unruffled calm in which the scene about us was reflected as in an oldfashioned mirror we took an afternoon walk through christchurch meadow and at the riverbank procured a boat which i pulled down the stream to iffley and to the slanting woods of nunehamthe sweetest flattest reediest streamside landscape that could be desired here of course we encountered the scattered phalanx of the young the happy generation clad in white flannel and blue muscular fairhaired magnificent fresh whether floated down the current by idle punts and lounging in friendly couples when not in a singleness that nursed ambitions or straining together in rhythmic crews and hoarsely exhorted from the near bank when to the exhibition of so much of the clearest joy of wind and limb we added the great sense of perfumed protection shed by all the enclosed lawns and groves and bowers we felt that to be young in such scholastic shades must be a double an infinite blessing as my companion found himself less and less able to walk we repaired in turn to a series of gardens and spent long hours sitting in their greenest places they struck us as the fairest things in england and the ripest and sweetest fruit of the english system locked in their antique verdure guarded as in the case of new college by gentle battlements of silvergrey outshouldering the matted leafage of undisseverable plants filled with nightingales and memories a sort of chorus of tradition with vaguelygenerous youths sprawling bookishly on the turf as if to spare it the injury of their bootheels and with the great conservative college countenance appealing gravely from the restless outer world they seem places to lie down on the grass in for ever in the happy faith that life is all a green old english garden and time an endless summer afternoon this charmed seclusion was especially grateful to my friend and his sense of it reached its climax i remember on one of the last of such occasions and while we sat in fascinated flanerie over against the sturdy back of saint johns the wide discreetlywindowed wall here perhaps broods upon the lawn with a more effective air of property than elsewhere searle dropped into fitful talk and spun his humour into golden figures any passing undergraduate was a peg to hang a fable every feature of the place a pretext for more embroidery  isnt it all a delightful lie he wanted to know mightnt one fancy this the very central point of the worlds heart where all the echoes of the general life arrive but to falter and die doesnt one feel the air just thick with arrested voices its well there should be such places shaped in the interest of factitious needs invented to minister to the bookbegotten longing for a medium in which one may dream unwaked and believe unconfuted to foster the sweet illusion that alls well in a world where so much is so damnable all right and rounded smooth and fair in this sphere of the rough and ragged the pitiful unachieved especially and the dreadful uncommenced the worlds madeworks over now for leisure englands safenow for theocritus and horace for lawn and sky what a sense it all gives one of the composite life of the country and of the essential furniture of its luckier minds thank heaven they had the wit to send me here in the other time im not much visibly the braver perhaps but think how im the happier the misty spires and towers seen far off on the level have been all these years one of the constant things of memory seriously what do the spires and towers do for these people are they wiser gentler finer cleverer my diminished dignity reverts in any case at moments to the naked background of our own education the deadly dry air in which we gasp for impressions and comparisons i assent to it all with a sort of desperate calmness i accept it with a dogged pride were nursed at the opposite pole naked come we into a naked world theres a certain grandeur in the lack of decorations a certain heroic strain in that young imagination of ours which finds nothing made to its hands which has to invent its own traditions and raise high into our morningair with a ringing hammer and nails the castles in which we dwell noblesse obligeoxford must damnably do so what a horrible thing not to rise to such examples if you pay the pious debt to the last farthing of interest you may go through life with her blessing but if you let it stand unhonoured youre a worse barbarian than we but for the better or worse in a myriad private hearts think how she must be loved how the youthful sentiment of mankind seems visibly to brood upon her think of the young lives now taking colour in her cloisters and halls think of the centuries tale of dead ladsdead alike with the end of the young days to which these haunts were a present world and the close of the larger lives which the general motherscene has dropped into less bottomless traps what are those two young fellows kicking their heels over on the grass there one of them has the saturday review the otherupon my soulthe other has artemus ward where do they live how do they live to what end do they live miserable boys how can they read artemus ward under those windows of elizabeth what do you think loveliest in all oxford the poetry of certain windows do you see that one yonder the second of those lesser bays with the broken cornice and the lattice that used to be the window of my bosom friend a hundred years ago remind me to tell you the story of that broken cornice dont pretend its not a common thing to have ones bosom friend at another college pray was i committed to common things he was a charming fellow by the way he was a good deal like you of course his cocked hat his long hair in a black ribbon his cinnamon velvet suit and his flowered waistcoat made a difference we gentlemen used to wear swords  there was really the touch of grace in my poor friends divagationsthe disheartened dandy had so positively turned rhapsodist and seer i was particularly struck with his having laid aside the diffidence and selfconsciousness of the first days of our acquaintance he had become by this time a disembodied observer and critic the shell of sense growing daily thinner and more transparent transmitted the tremor of his quickened spirit he seemed to pick up acquaintances in the course of our contemplations merely by putting out his hand if i left him for ten minutes i was sure to find him on my return in earnest conversation with some affable wandering scholar several young men with whom he had thus established relations invited him to their rooms and entertained him as i gathered with rather rash hospitality for myself i chose not to be present at these symposia i shrank partly from being held in any degree responsible for his extravagance partly from the pang of seeing him yield to champagne and an admiring circle he reported such adventures with less keen a complacency than i had supposed he might use but a certain method in his madness a certain dignity in his desire to fraternise appeared to save him from mischance if they didnt think him a harmless lunatic they certainly thought him a celebrity of the occident two things however grew evidentthat he drank deeper than was good for him and that the flagrant freshness of his young patrons rather interfered with his predetermined sense of the element of finer romance at the same time it completed his knowledge of the place making the acquaintance of several tutors and fellows he dined in hall in half a dozen colleges alluding afterwards to these banquets with religious unction one evening after a participation indiscreetly prolonged he came back to the hotel in a cab accompanied by a friendly undergraduate and a physician and looking deadly pale he had swooned away on leaving table and remained so rigidly unconscious as much to agitate his banqueters the following twentyfour hours he of course spent in bed but on the third day declared himself strong enough to begin afresh on his reaching the street his strength once more forsook him so that i insisted on his returning to his room he besought me with tears in his eyes not to shut him up its my last chancei want to go back for an hour to that garden of saint johns let me eat and drinktomorrow i die it seemed to me possible that with a bathchair the expedition might be accomplished the hotel it appeared possessed such a convenience which was immediately produced it became necessary hereupon that we should have a person to propel the chair as there was no one on the spot at liberty i was about to perform the office but just as my patient had got seated and wrappedhe now had a perpetual chillan elderly man emerged from a lurkingplace near the door and with a formal salute offered to wait upon the gentleman we assented and he proceeded solemnly to trundle the chair before him i recognised him as a vague personage whom i had observed to lounge shyly about the doors of the hotels at intervals during our stay with a depressed air of wanting employment and a poor semblance of finding it he had once indeed in a halfhearted way proposed himself as an amateur cicerone for a tour through the colleges and i now as i looked at him remembered with a pang that i had too curtly declined his ministrations since then his shyness apparently had grown less or his misery greater for it was with a strange grim avidity that he now attached himself to our service he was a pitiful image of shabby gentility and the dinginess of reduced circumstances he would have been i suppose some fifty years of age but his pale haggard unwholesome visage his plaintive drooping carriage and the irremediable disarray of his apparel seemed to add to the burden of his days and tribulations his eyes were weak and bloodshot his bold nose was sadly compromised and his reddish beard largely streaked with grey bristled under a months neglect of the razor in all this rusty forlornness lurked a visible assurance of our friends having known better days obviously he was the victim of some fatal depreciation in the market value of pure gentility there had been something terribly affecting in the way he substituted for the attempt to touch the greasy rim of his antiquated hat some such bow as one man of the world might make another exchanging a few words with him as we went i was struck with the decorum of his accent his fine whole voice should have been congruously cracked  take me by some long roundabout way said searle so that i may see as many collegewalls as possible  you know i asked of our attendant all these wonderful ins and outs  i ought to sir he said after a moment with pregnant gravity and as we were passing one of the colleges that used to be my place he added  at these words searle desired him to stop and come round within sight you say thats your college  the place might deny me sir but heaven forbid i should seem to take it ill of her if youll allow me to wheel you into the quad ill show you my windows of thirty years ago  searle sat staring his huge pale eyes which now left nothing else worth mentioning in his wasted face filled with wonder and pity if youll be so kind he said with great deference but just as this perverted product of a liberal education was about to propel him across the threshold of the court he turned about disengaged the mercenary hands with one of his own from the back of the chair drew their owner alongside and turned to me while were here my dear fellow he said be so good as to perform this service you understand i gave our companion a glance of intelligence and we resumed our way the latter showed us his window of the better time where a rosy youth in a scarlet smokingfez now puffed a cigarette at the open casement thence we proceeded into the small garden the smallest i believe and certainly the sweetest of all the planted places of oxford i pushed the chair along to a bench on the lawn turned it round toward the front of the college and sat down by it on the grass our attendant shifted mournfully from one foot to the other his patron eyeing him openmouthed at length searle broke out god bless my soul sir you dont suppose i expect you to stand theres an empty bench  thank you said our friend who bent his joints to sit  you english are really fabulous i dont know whether i most admire or most abominate you now tell me who are you what are you what brought you to this  the poor fellow blushed up to his eyes took off his hat and wiped his forehead with an indescribable fabric drawn from his pocket my names rawson sir beyond that its a long story  i ask out of sympathy said searle ive a fellowfeeling if youre a poor devil im a poor devil as well  im the poorer devil of the two said the stranger with an assurance for once presumptuous  possibly i suppose an english poor devils the poorest of all poor devils and then youve fallen from a height from a gentleman commoneris that what they called youto a propeller of bathchairs good heavens man the falls enough to kill you  i didnt take it all at once sir i dropped a bit one time and a bit another  thats me thats me cried searle with all his seriousness  and now said our friend i believe i cant drop any further  my dear fellowand searle clasped his hand and shook iti too am at the very bottom of the hole  mr rawson lifted his eyebrows well sir theres a difference between sitting in such a pleasant convenience and just trudging behind it  yestheres a shade but im at my last gasp mr rawson  im at my last penny sir  literally mr rawson  mr rawson shook his head with large loose bitterness ive almost come to the point of drinking my beer and buttoning my coat figuratively but i dont talk in figures  fearing the conversation might appear to achieve something like gaiety at the expense of mr rawsons troubles i took the liberty of asking him with all consideration how he made a living  i dont make a living he answered with tearful eyes i cant make a living ive a wife and three childrenand all starving sir you wouldnt believe what ive come to i sent my wife to her mothers who can ill afford to keep her and came to oxford a week ago thinking i might pick up a few halfcrowns by showing people about the colleges but its no use i havent the assurance i dont look decent they want a nice little old man with black gloves and a clean shirt and a silverheaded stick what do i look as if i knew about oxford sir  mercy on us cried searle why didnt you speak to us before  i wanted to half a dozen times ive been on the point of it i knew you were americans  and americans are rich cried searle laughing my dear mr rawson american as i am im living on charity  and im exactly not sir there it is im dying for the lack of that same you say youre a pauper but it takes an american pauper to go bowling about in a bathchair americas an easy country  ah me groaned searle have i come to the most delicious corner of the ancient world to hear the praise of yankeeland  delicious corners are very well and so is the ancient world said mr rawson but one may sit here hungry and shabby so long as one isnt too shabby as well as elsewhere youll not persuade me that its not an easier thing to keep afloat yonder than here i wish i were in yankeeland thats all he added with feeble force then brooding for a moment on his wrongs have you a bloated brother or you sir it matters little to you but it has mattered to me with a vengeance shabby as i sit here i can boast that advantageas he his five thousand a year being but a twelvemonth my elder he swaggers while i go thus theres old england for you a very pretty place for him  poor old england said searle softly  has your brother never helped you i asked  a fivepound note now and then oh i dont say there havent been times when i havent inspired an irresistible sympathy ive not been what i should i married dreadfully out of the way but the devil of it is that he started fair and i started foul with the tastes the desires the needs the sensibilities of a gentlemanand not another blessed tip i cant afford to live in england  this poor gentleman fancied a couple of months ago that he couldnt afford to live in america i fondly explained  id swapdo you call itchances with him and mr rawson looked quaintly rueful over his freedom of speech  searle sat supported there with his eyes closed and his face twitching for violent emotion and then of a sudden had a glare of gravity my friend youre a dead failure be judged dont talk about swapping dont talk about chances dont talk about fair starts and false starts im at that point myself that ive a right to speak it lies neither in ones chance nor ones start to make one a success nor in anything ones brotherhowever bloatedcan do or can undo it lies in ones character you and i sir have had no characterthats very plain weve been weak sir as weak as water here we are for itsitting staring in each others faces and reading our weakness in each others eyes were of no importance whatever mr rawson  mr rawson received this sally with a countenance in which abject submission to the particular affirmed truth struggled with the comparative propriety of his general rebellion against fate in the course of a minute a due selfrespect yielded to the warm comfortable sense of his being relieved of the cares of an attitude go on sir go on he said its wholesome doctrine and he wiped his eyes with what seemed his sole remnant of linen  dear dear sighed searle ive made you cry well we speak as from man to man i should be glad to think you had felt for a moment the sidelight of that great undarkening of the spirit which precedeswhich precedes the grand illumination of death  mr rawson sat silent a little his eyes fixed on the ground and his wellcut nose but the more deeply dyed by his agitation then at last looking up youre a very goodnatured man sir and youll never persuade me you dont come of a kindly race say what you please about a chance when a mans fiftydegraded penniless a husband and fathera chance to get on his legs again is not to be despised something tells me that my luck may be in your countrywhich has brought luck to so many i can come on the parish here of course but i dont want to come on the parish hang it sir i want to hold up my head i see thirty years of life before me yet if only by gods help i could have a real change of air its a fixed idea of mine ive had it for the last ten years its not that im a low radical oh ive no vulgar opinions old englands good enough for me but im not good enough for old england im a shabby man that wants to get out of a room full of staring gentlefolk im for ever put to the blush its a perfect agony of spirit everything reminds me of my younger and better self the thing for me would be a cooling cleansing plunge into the unknowing and the unknown i lie awake thinking of it  searle closed his eyes shivering with a longdrawn tremor which i hardly knew whether to take for an expression of physical or of mental pain in a moment i saw it was neither oh my country my country my country he murmured in a broken voice and then sat for some time abstracted and lost i signalled our companion that it was time we should bring our small session to a close and he without hesitating possessed himself of the handle of the bathchair and pushed it before him we had got halfway home before searle spoke or moved suddenly in the high street as we passed a chophouse from whose open doors we caught a waft of oldfashioned cookery and other restorative elements he motioned us to halt this is my last five poundsand he drew a note from his pocketbook do me the favour mr rawson to accept it go in there and order the best dinner they can give you call for a bottle of burgundy and drink it to my eternal rest  mr rawson stiffened himself up and received the gift with fingers momentarily irresponsive but mr rawson had the nerves of a gentleman i measured the spasm with which his poor dispossessed hand closed upon the crisp paper i observed his empurpled nostril convulsive under the other solicitation he crushed the crackling note in his palm with a passionate pressure and jerked a spasmodic bow i shall not do you the wrong sir of anything but the best the next moment the door swung behind him  searle sank again into his apathy and on reaching the hotel i helped him to get to bed for the rest of the day he lay without motion or sound and beyond reach of any appeal the doctor whom i had constantly in attendance was sure his end was near he expressed great surprise that he should have lasted so long he must have been living for a month on the very dregs of his strength toward evening as i sat by his bedside in the deepening dusk he roused himself with a purpose i had vaguely felt gathering beneath his stupor my cousin my cousin he said confusedly is she here it was the first time he had spoken of miss searle since our retreat from her brothers house and he continued to ramble i was to have married her what a dream that day was like a string of versesrhymed hours but the last verse is bad measure whats the rhyme to love above was she a simple woman a kind sweet woman or have i only dreamed it she had the healing gift her touch would have cured my madness i want you to do something write three lines three words goodbye remember me be happy and then after a long pause its strange a person in my state should have a wish why should one eat ones breakfast the day ones hanged what a creature is man what a farce is life here i lie worn down to a mere throbbing feverpoint i breathe and nothing more and yet i desire my desire lives if i could see her help me out with it and let me die  half an hour later at a venture i dispatched by post a note to miss searle your cousin is rapidly sinking he asks to see you i was conscious of a certain want of consideration in this act since it would bring her great trouble and yet no power to face the trouble but out of her distress i fondly hoped a sufficient force might be born on the following day my friends exhaustion had become so great that i began to fear his intelligence altogether broken up but toward evening he briefly rallied to maunder about many things confounding in a sinister jumble the memories of the past weeks and those of bygone years by the way he said suddenly ive made no will i havent much to bequeath yet i have something he had been playing listlessly with a large signetring on his left hand which he now tried to draw off i leave you thisworking it round and round vainlyif you can get it off what enormous knuckles there must be such knuckles in the mummies of the pharaohs well when im gone no i leave you something more precious than goldthe sense of a great kindness but ive a little gold left bring me those trinkets i placed on the bed before him several articles of jewellery relics of early foppery his watch and chain of great value a locket and seal some odds and ends of goldsmiths work he trifled with them feebly for some moments murmuring various names and dates associated with them at last looking up with clearer interest what has become he asked of mr rawson  you want to see him  how much are these things worth he went on without heeding me how much would they bring and he weighed them in his weak hands theyre pretty heavy some hundred or so oh im richer than i thought rawsonrawsonyou want to get out of this awful england  i stepped to the door and requested the servant whom i kept in constant attendance in our adjacent sittingroom to send and ascertain if mr rawson were on the premises he returned in a few moments introducing our dismal friend mr rawson was pale even to his nose and derived from his unaffectedly concerned state an air of some distinction i led him up to the bed in searles eyes as they fell on him there shone for a moment the light of a human message  lord have mercy gasped mr rawson  my friend said searle theres to be one american the lessso let there be at the same time one the more at the worst youll be as good a one as i foolish me take these battered relics you can sell them let them help you on your way theyre gifts and mementoes but this is a better use heaven speed you may america be kind to you be kind at the last to your own country  really this is too much i cant the poor man protested almost scared and with tears in his eyes do come round and get well and ill stop here ill stay with you and wait on you  no im booked for my journey you for yours i hope you dont mind the voyage  mr rawson exhaled a groan of helpless gratitude appealing piteously from so strange a windfall its like the angel of the lord who bids people in the bible to rise and flee  searle had sunk back upon his pillow quite used up i led mr rawson back into the sittingroom where in three words i proposed to him a rough valuation of our friends trinkets he assented with perfect goodbreeding they passed into my possession and a second banknote into his  from the collapse into which this wondrous exercise of his imagination had plunged him my charge then gave few signs of being likely to emerge he breathed as he had said and nothing more the twilight deepened i lighted the nightlamp the doctor sat silent and official at the foot of the bed i resumed my constant place near the head suddenly our patient opened his eyes wide shell not come he murmured amen shes an english sister five minutes passed he started forward shes come shes here he confidently quavered his words conveyed to my mind so absolute an assurance that i lightly rose and passed into the sittingroom at the same moment through the opposite door the servant introduced a lady a lady i say for an instant she was simply suchtall pale dressed in deep mourning the next instant i had uttered her namemiss searle she looked ten years older  she met me with both hands extended and an immense question in her face he has just announced you i said and then with a fuller consciousness of the change in her dress and countenance what has happened  oh death death she wailed you and i are left  there came to me with her words a sickening shock the sense of poetic justice somehow cheated defeated your brother i panted  she laid her hand on my arm and i felt its pressure deepen as she spoke he was thrown from his horse in the park he died on the spot six days have passed six months  she accepted my support and a moment later we had entered the room and approached the bedside from which the doctor withdrew searle opened his eyes and looked at her from head to foot suddenly he seemed to make out her mourning already he cried audibly and with a smile as i felt of pleasure  she dropped on her knees and took his hand not for you cousin she whispered for my poor brother  he started in all his deathly longitude as with a galvanic shock dead he dead life itself and then after a moment and with a slight rising inflexion youre free  free cousin too sadly free and nownowwith what use for freedom  he looked steadily into her eyes dark in the heavy shadow of her musty mourningveil for me wear colours  in a moment more death had come the doctor had silently attested it and she had burst into sobs  we buried him in the little churchyard in which he had expressed the wish to lie beneath one of the blackest and widest of english yews and the little tower than which none in all england has a softer and hoarier grey a year has passed miss searle i believe has begun to wear colours
