14671189	frondes agrestes    readings in modern painters    chosen at her pleasure   by the authors friend   the younger lady of the thwaite   coniston    spargit agrestes tibi silva frondes    thirtyeighth thousand    london george allen 156 charing cross road 1902    printed by ballantyne hanson  co   at the ballantyne press     preface   i have been often asked to republish the first book of mine which the public noticed and which hitherto remains their favourite in a more easily attainable form than that of its existing editions i am however resolved never to republish the book as a whole some parts of it being by the established fame of turner rendered unnecessary and others having been always useless in their praise of excellence which the public will never give the labour necessary to discern but finding lately that one of my dearest friends who in advanced age retains the cheerfulness and easily delighted temper of bright youth had written out for her own pleasure a large number of passages from modern painters it seemed to me certain that what such a person felt to be useful to herself could not but be useful also to a class of readers whom i much desired to please and who would sometimes enjoy in my early writings what i never should myself have offered them i asked my friend therefore to add to her own already chosen series any other passages she thought likely to be of permanent interest to general readers and i have printed her selections in absolute submission to her judgment merely arranging the pieces she sent me in the order which seemed most convenient for the reciprocal bearing of their fragmentary meanings and adding here and there an explanatory note or it may be a deprecatory one in cases where my mind had changed that she did me the grace to write every word with her own hands adds in my eyes and will i trust in the readers also to the possible claims of the little book on their sympathy and although i hope to publish some of the scientific and technical portions of the original volumes in my own large editions the selections here made by my friend under her quiet woods at conistonthe unterwalden of englandwill i doubt not bring within better reach of many readers for whom i am not now able myself to judge or choose such service as the book was ever capable of rendering in the illustration of the powers of nature and

taste is the faculty of receiving the greatest possible pleasure from those material sources which are attractive to our moral nature in its purity and perfection but why we receive pleasure from some forms and colours and not from others is no more to be asked or answered than why we like sugar and dislike wormwood   2 the temper by which right taste is formed is characteristically patient it dwells upon what is submitted to it it does not trample upon itlest it should be pearls even though it look like husks it is good ground penetrable retentive it does not send up thorns of unkind thoughts to choke the weak seed it is hungry and thirsty too and drinks all the dew that falls on it it is an honest and good heart that shows no too ready springing before the sun be up but fails not afterwards it is distrustful of itself so as to be ready to believe and to try all things and yet so trustful of itself that it will neither quit what it has tried nor take anything without trying and the pleasure which it has in things that it finds true and good is so great that it cannot possibly be led aside by any tricks of fashion or diseases of vanity it cannot be cramped in its conclusions by partialities and hypocrisies its visions and its delights are too penetratingtoo livingfor any whitewashed object or shallow fountain long to endure or supply it clasps all that it loves so hard that it crushes it if it be hollow   3 it is the common consent of men that whatever branch of any pursuit ministers to the bodily comforts and regards material uses is ignoble and whatever part is addressed to the mind only is noble and that geology does better in reclothing dry bones and revealing lost creations than in tracing veins of lead and beds of iron astronomy better in opening to us the houses of heaven than in teaching navigation botany better in displaying structure than in expressing juices surgery better in investigating organization than in setting limbsonly it is ordained that for our encouragement every step we make in the more exalted range of science adds something also to its practical applicabilities that all the great phenomena of nature the knowledge of which is desired by the angels only by us partly as it reveals to farther vision the being and the glory of him in whom they rejoice and we live dispense yet such kind influences and so much of material blessing as to be joyfully felt by all inferior creatures and to be desired by them with such single desire as the imperfection of their nature may admit that the strong torrents which in their own gladness fill the hills with hollow thunder and the vales with winding light have yet their bounden charge of field to feed and barge to bear that the fierce flames to which the alp owes its upheaval and the volcano its terror temper for us the metal vein and warm the quickening spring and that for our incitement i say not our rewardfor knowledge is its own rewardherbs have their healing stones their preciousness and stars their times   4 had it been ordained by the almighty1 that the highest pleasures of sight should be those of most difficult attainment and that to arrive at them it should be necessary to accumulate gilded palaces tower over tower and pile artificial mountains around insinuated lakes there would never have been a direct contradiction between the unselfish duties and the inherent desires of every individual but no such contradiction exists in the system of divine providence which leaving it open to us if we will as creatures in probation to abuse this sense like every other and pamper it with selfish and thoughtless vanities as we pamper the palate with deadly meats until the appetite of tasteful cruelty is lost in its sickened satiety incapable of pleasure unless caligula like it concentrates the labour of a million of lives into the sensation of an hourleaves it also open to us by humble and loving ways to make ourselves susceptible of deep delight which shall not separate us from our fellows nor require the sacrifice of any duty or occupation but which shall bind us closer to men and to god and be with us always harmonized with every action consistent with every claim unchanging and eternal  1 the reader must observe that having been thoroughly disciplined in the evangelical schools i supposed myself at fourandtwenty to know all about the ordinances of the almighty nevertheless the practical contents of the sentence are good if only they are intelligible which i doubt   5 a great idealist never can be egotistic the whole of his power depends upon his losing sight and feeling of his own existence and becoming a mere witness and mirror of truth and a scribe of visionsalways passive in sight passive in utterance lamenting continually that he cannot completely reflect nor clearly utter all he has seennot by any means a proud state for a man to be in but the man who has no invention is always setting things in order2 and putting the world to rights and mending and beautifying and pluming himself on his doings as supreme in all ways  2 i am now a comic illustration of this sentence myself i have not a ray of invention in all my brains but am intensely rational and orderly and have resolutely begun to set the world to rights   6 so far as education does indeed tend to make the senses delicate and the perceptions accurate and thus enables people to be pleased with quiet instead of gaudy colour and with graceful instead of coarse form and by long acquaintance with the best things to discern quickly what is fine from what is commonso far acquired taste is an honourable faculty and it is true praise of anything to say it is in good taste but3 so far as this higher education has a tendency to narrow the sympathies and harden the heart diminishing the interest of all beautiful things by familiarity until even what is best can hardly please and what is brightest hardly entertainso far as it fosters pride and leads men to found the pleasure they take in anything not on the worthiness of the thing but on the degree in which it indicates some greatness of their own as people build marble porticoes and inlay marble floors not so much because they like the colours of marble or find it pleasant to the foot as because such porches and floors are costly and separated in all human eyes from plain entrances of stone and timberso far as it leads people to prefer gracefulness of dress manner and aspect to value of substance and heart liking a wellsaid thing better than a true thing and a welltrained manner better than a sincere one and a delicatelyformed face better than a goodnatured oneand in all other ways and things setting custom and semblance above everlasting truthso far finally as it induces a sense of inherent distinction between class and class and causes everything to be more or less despised which has no social rank so that the affection pleasure and grief of a clown are looked upon as of no interest compared with the affection and grief of a wellbred manjust so far in all these several ways the feeling induced by what is called a liberal education is utterly adverse to the understanding of noble art  3 nobody need begin this second volume sentence unless they are breathed like the græme  right up ben ledi could he press and not a sob his toil confess   7 he who habituates himself in his daily life to seek for the stern facts in whatever he hears or sees will have these facts again brought before him by the involuntary imaginative power in their noblest associations and he who seeks for frivolities and fallacies will have frivolities and fallacies again presented to him in his dreams4  4 very good few people have any idea how much more important the government of the mind is than the force of its exertion nearly all the world flog their horses without ever looking where they are going   8 all the histories of the bible are yet waiting to be painted moses has never been painted elijah never david never except as a mere ruddy stripling deborah never gideon never isaiah never5 what single example does the reader remember of painting which suggested so much as the faintest shadow of their deeds strong men in armour or aged men with flowing beards he may remember who when he looked at his louvre or uffizi catalogue he found were intended to stand for david or moses but does he suppose that if these pictures had suggested to him the feeblest image of the presence of such men he would have passed on as he assuredly did to the next picture representing doubtless diana and actæon or cupid and the graces or a gambling quarrel in a pothousewith no sense of pain or surprise let him meditate over the matter and he will find ultimately that what i say is true and that religious art at once complete and sincere never yet has existed  5 i knew nothing when i wrote this passage of luini filippo lippi or sandro botticelli and had not capacity to enter into the deeper feelings even of the men whom i was chiefly studyingtintoret and fra angelico but the british public is at present as little acquainted with the greater florentines as i was then and the passage for them remains true     section ii  power and office of imagination   9 what are the legitimate uses of the imaginationthat is to say of the power of perceiving or conceiving with the mind things which cannot be perceived by the senses its first and noblest use is6 to enable us to bring sensibly to our sight the things which are recorded as belonging to our future state or invisibly surrounding us in this it is given us that we may imagine the cloud of witnesses in heaven and earth and sea as if they were now presentthe souls of the righteous waiting for us that we may conceive the great army of the inhabitants of heaven and discover among them those whom we most desire to be with for ever that we may be able to vision forth the ministry of angels beside us and see the chariots of fire on the mountains that gird us round but above all to call up the scenes and facts in which we are commanded to believe and be present as if in the body at every recorded event of the history of the redeemer its second and ordinary use is to empower us to traverse the scenes of all other history and to force the facts to become again visible so as to make upon us the same impression which they would have made if we had witnessed them and in the minor necessities of life to enable us out of any present good to gather the utmost measure of enjoyment by investing it with happy associations and in any present evil to lighten it by summoning back the images of other hours and also to give to all mental truths some visible type in allegory simile or personification which shall most deeply enforce them and finally when the mind is utterly outwearied to refresh it with such innocent play as shall be most in harmony with the suggestive voices of natural things permitting it to possess living companionship instead of silent beauty and create for itself fairies in the grass and naiads in the wave  6 i should be glad if the reader who is interested in the question here raised would read as illustrative of the subsequent statement the account of tintorets paradise in the close of my oxford lecture on michael angelo and tintoret which i have printed separately to make it generally accessible   10 yet because we thus reverence the power and art of imagination let none of us despise the power and art of memory  let the reader consider seriously what he would give at any moment to have the power of arresting the fairest scenes those which so often rise before him only to vanish to stay the cloud in its fading the leaf in its trembling and the shadows in their changing to bid the fitful foam be fixed upon the river and the ripples be everlasting upon the lake and then to bear away with him no darkness or feeble sunstain though even that is beautiful but a counterfeit which should seem no counterfeitthe true and perfect image of life indeed or rather for the full majesty of such a power is not thus sufficiently expressed let him consider that it would be in effect nothing less than a capacity of transporting himself at any moment into any scenea gift as great as can be possessed by a disembodied spirit and suppose also this necromancy embracing not only the present but the past and enabling us seemingly to enter into the very bodily presence of men long since gathered to the dust to behold them in act as they lived but with greater privilege than ever was granted to the companions of those transient acts of life to see them fastened at our will in the gesture and expression of an instant and stayed on the eve of some great deed in immortality of burning purposeconceive so far as is possible such power as this and then say whether the art which conferred it is to be spoken lightly of or whether we should not rather reverence as halfdivine a gift which would go so far as to raise us into the rank and invest us with the felicities of angels7  7 passage written in opposition to the vulgar notion that the mere imitation of nature is easy and useless   11 i believe the first test of a truly great man is his humility i do not mean by humility doubt of his own power or hesitation of speaking his opinions but a right understanding of the relation between what he can do and say and the rest of the worlds sayings and doings all great men not only know their business but usually know that they know it and are not only right in their main opinions but they usually know that they are right in them only they do not think much of themselves on that account arnolfo knows he can build a good dome at florence albert durer writes calmly to one who has found fault with his workit cannot be better done sir isaac newton knows that he has worked out a problem or two that would have puzzled anybody else only they do not expect their fellowmen therefore to fall down and worship them they have a curious undersense of powerlessness feeling that the greatness is not in them but through themthat they could not do or be anything else than god made them and they see something divine and godmade in every other man they meet and are endlessly foolishly incredibly merciful   12 as far as i can observe it is a constant law that the greatest men whether poets or historians live entirely in their own age and the greatest fruits of their work are gathered out of their own age dante paints italy in the thirteenth century chaucer england in the fourteenth masaccio florence in the fifteenth tintoret venice in the sixteenth all of them utterly regardless of anachronism and minor error of every kind but getting always vital truth out of the vital present if it be said that shakespeare wrote perfect historical plays on subjects belonging to the preceding centuries i answer that they are perfect plays just because there is no care about centuries in them but a life which all men recognise for the human life of all timeand this it is not because shakespeare sought to give universal truth but because painting honestly and completely from the men about him he painted that human nature which is indeed constant enougha rogue in the fifteenth century being at heart what a rogue is in the nineteenth and was in the twelfth and an honest or knightly man being in like manner very similar to other such at any other time and the work of these great idealists is therefore always universal not because it is not portrait but because it is complete portrait down to the heart which is the same in all ages and the work of the mean idealists is not universal not because it is portrait but because it is half portraitof the outside the manners and the dress not of the heart thus tintoret and shakespeare paint both of them simply venetian and english nature as they saw it in their time down to the root and it does for all time but as for any care to cast themselves into the particular ways and tones of thought or custom of past time in their historical work you will find it in neither of them8 nor in any other perfectly great man that i know of  8 what vestige of egyptian character is there for instance in cleopatraof athenian in theseus or timonof old english in imogen or cordeliaof old scottish in macbethor even of mediæval italian in petruchio the merchant of venice or desdemona and the roman plays appear definitely roman only because the strength of rome was the eternal strength of the worldpure family life sustained by agriculture and defended by simple and fearless manhood   13 i think it probable that many readers may be surprised at my calling scott the great representative of the mind of the age of literature those who can perceive the intense penetrative depth of wordsworth and the exquisite finish and melodious power of tennyson may be offended at my placing in higher rank that poetry of careless glance and reckless rhyme in which scott poured out the fancies of his youth and those who are familiar with the subtle analysis of the french novelists or who have in any wise submitted themselves to the influence of german philosophy may be equally indignant at my ascribing a principality to scott among the literary men of europe in an age which has produced de balzac and goethe9  9 i knew nothing of goethe when i put him with balzac but the intolerable dulness which encumbers the depth of wilhelm meister and the cruel reserve which conceals from all but the intensest readers the meaning of faust have made him in a great degree an evil influence in european literature and evil is always secondrate  but the mass of sentimental literature concerned with the analysis and description of emotion headed by the poetry of byron is altogether of lower rank than the literature which merely describes what it saw the true seer feels as intensely as any one else but he does not much describe his feelings he tells you whom he met and what they said leaves you to make out from that what they feel and what he feels but goes into little detail and generally speaking pathetic writing and careful explanation of passion are quite easy compared with this plain recording of what people said and did or with the right invention of what they are likely to say and do for this reason that to invent a story or admirably and thoroughly tell any part of a story it is necessary to grasp the entire mind of every personage concerned in it and know precisely how they would be affected by what happens which to do requires a colossal intellect but to describe a separate emotion delicately it is only needed that one should feel it oneself and thousands of people are capable of feeling this or that noble emotion for one who is able to enter into all the feelings of somebody sitting on the other side of the table even therefore where this sentimental literature is first rate as in passages of byron tennyson and keats it ought not to be ranked so high as the creative and though perfection even in narrow fields is perhaps as rare as in the wider and it may be as long before we have another in memoriam as another guy mannering i unhesitatingly receive as a greater manifestation of power the right invention of a few sentences spoken by pleydell and mannering across their suppertable than the most tender and passionate melodies of the selfexamining verse   14 fancy plays like a squirrel in its circular prison and is happy but imagination is a pilgrim on the earthand her home is in heaven shut her from the fields of the celestial mountains bear her from breathing their lofty sunwarmed air and we may as well turn upon her the last bolt of the tower of famine and give the keys to the keeping of the wildest surge that washes capraja and gorgona10  10 i leave this passage as my friend has chosen it but it is unintelligible without the contexts which show how all the emotions described in the preceding passages of this section are founded on trust in the beneficence and rule of an omnipotent spirit   15 in the highest poetry there is no word so familiar but a great man will bring good out of it or rather it will bring good to him and answer some end for which no other word would have done equally well a common person for instance would be mightily puzzled to apply the word whelp to anyone with a view of flattering him there is a certain freshness and energy in the term which gives it agreeableness but it seems difficult at first hearing it to use it complimentarily if the person spoken of be a prince the difficulty seems increased and when farther he is at one and the same moment to be called a whelp and contemplated as a hero it seems that a common idealist might well be brought to a pause but hear shakespeare do it                      awake his warlike spirit   and your great uncles edward the black prince   who on the french ground played a tragedy   making defeat on the full power of france   while his most mighty father on a hill   stood smiling to behold his lions whelp   forage in blood of french nobility   16 although in all lovely nature there is first an excellent degree of simple beauty addressed to the eye alone yet often what impresses us most will form but a very small portion of that visible beauty that beauty may for instance be composed of lovely flowers and glittering streams and blue sky and white clouds and yet the thing that impresses us most and which we should be sorriest to lose may be a thin grey film on the extreme horizon not so large in the space of the scene it occupies as a piece of gossamer on a nearathand bush nor in any wise prettier to the eye than the gossamer but because the gossamer is known by us for a little bit of spiders work and the other grey film is known to mean a mountain ten thousand feet high inhabited by a race of noble mountaineers we are solemnly impressed by the aspect of it and yet all the while the thoughts and knowledge which cause us to receive this impression are so obscure that we are not conscious of them   17 examine the nature of your own emotion if you feel it at the sight of the alps and you find all the brightness of that emotion hanging like dew on a gossamer on a curious web of subtle fancy and imperfect knowledge first you have a vague idea of its size coupled with wonder at the work of the great builder of its walls and foundations then an apprehension of its eternity a pathetic sense of its perpetualness and your own transientness as of the grass upon its sidethen and in very sadness a sense of strange companionship with past generations in seeing what they saw they did not see the clouds that are floating over your head nor the cottage wall on the other side of the field nor the road by which you are travelling but they saw that the wall of granite in the heavens was the same to them as to you they have ceased to look upon it you will soon cease to look also and the granite wall will be for others then mingled with these more solemn imaginations come the understandings of the gifts and glories of the alpthe fancying forth of all the fountains that well from its rocky walls and strong rivers that are born out of its ice and of all the pleasant valleys that wind between its cliffs and all the châlets that gleam among its clouds and happy farmsteads couched upon its pastures while together with the thoughts of these rise strange sympathies with all the unknown of human life and happiness and death signified by that narrow white flame of the everlasting snow seen so far in the morning sky these images and far more than these lie at the root of the emotion which you feel at the sight of the alps you may not trace them in your heart for there is a great deal more in your heart both of evil and good than you can ever trace but they stir you and quicken you for all that assuredly so far as you feel more at beholding the snowy mountain than any other object of the same sweet silvery grey these are the kind of images which cause you to do so and observe these are nothing more than a greater apprehension of the facts of the thing we call the power imagination because it imagines or conceives but it is only noble imagination if it imagines or conceives the truth and according to the degree of knowledge possessed and of sensibility to the pathetic or impressive character of the things known will be the degree of this imaginative delight   18 so natural is it to the human heart to fix itself in hope rather than in present possession and so subtle is the charm which the imagination casts over what is distant or denied that there is often a more touching power in the scenes which contain faraway promises of something greater than themselves than in those which exhaust the treasures and powers of nature in an unconquerable and excellent glory leaving nothing more to be by fancy pictured or pursued i do not know that there is a district in the world more calculated to illustrate this power of the expectant imagination than that which surrounds the city of fribourg in switzerland extending from it towards berne it is of grey sandstone considerably elevated but presenting no object of striking interest to the passing traveller so that as it is generally seen in the course of a hasty journey from the bernese alps to those of savoy it is rarely regarded with any other sensation than that of weariness all the more painful because accompanied with reaction from the high excitement caused by the splendour of the bernese oberland the travellerfootsore feverish and satiated with glacier and precipicelies back in the corner of the diligence perceiving little more than that the road is winding and hilly and the country through which it passes cultivated and tame let him however only do this tame country the justice of staying in it a few days until his mind has recovered its tone and take one or two long walks through its fields and he will have other thoughts of it it is as i said an undulating district of grey sandstone never attaining any considerable height but having enough of the mountain spirit to throw itself into continual succession of bold slope and dale elevated also just far enough above the sea to render the pine a frequent forest tree along its irregular ridges through this elevated tract the river cuts its way in a ravine some five or six hundred feet in depth which winds for leagues between the gentle hills unthought of until its edge is approached and then suddenly through the boughs of the firs the eye perceives beneath the green and gliding stream and the broad walls of sandstone cliff that form its banks hollowed out where the river leans against them at its turns into perilous overhanging and on the other shore at the same spots leaving little breadths of meadow between them and the water half overgrown with thicket deserted in their sweetness inaccessible from above and rarely visited by any curious wanderers along the hardly traceable footpath which struggles for existence beneath the rocks and there the river ripples and eddies and murmurs in an outer solitude it is passing through a thickly peopled country but never was a stream so lonely the feeblest and most faraway torrent among the high hills has its companions the goats browse beside it and the traveller drinks from it and passes over it with his staff and the peasant traces a new channel for it down to his millwheel but this stream has no companions it flows on in an infinite seclusion not secret nor threatening but a quietness of sweet daylight and open aira broad space of tender and deep desolateness drooped into repose out of the midst of human labour and life the waves plashing lowly with none to hear them and the wild birds building in the boughs with none to fray them away and the soft fragrant herbs rising and breathing and fading with no hand to gather themand yet all bright and bare to the clouds above and to the fresh fall of the passing sunshine and pure rain but above the brows of these scarped cliffs all is in an instant changed a few steps only beyond the firs that stretch their branches angular and wild and white like forks of lightning into the air of the ravineand we are in an arable country of the most perfect richness the swathes of its corn glowing and burning from field to field its pretty hamlets all vivid with fruitful orchards and flowery garden and goodly with steeproofed storehouse and barn its wellkept hard parklike roads rising and falling from hillside to hillside or disappearing among brown banks of moss and thickets of the wild raspberry and rose or gleaming through lines of tall trees half glade half avenue where the gate opens or the gateless path turns trustedly aside unhindered into the garden of some statelier house surrounded in rural pride with its golden hives and carved granaries and irregular domain of latticed and espaliered cottages gladdening to look upon in their delicate homelinessdelicate yet in some sort rude not like our english homestrim laborious formal irreproachable in comfortbut with a peculiar carelessness and largeness in all their detail harmonizing with the outlawed loveliness of their country for there is an untamed strength even in all that soft and habitable land it is indeed gilded with corn and fragrant with deep grass but it is not subdued to the plough or to the scythe it gives at its own free will it seems to have nothing wrested from it nor conquered in it it is not redeemed from desertness but unrestrained in fruitfulnessa generous land bright with capricious plenty and laughing from vale to vale in fitful fulness kind and wild nor this without some sterner element mingled in the heart of it for along all its ridges stand the dark masses of innumerable pines11 taking no part in its gladness asserting themselves for ever as fixed shadows not to be pierced or banished even in the intensest sunlight fallen flakes and fragments of the night stayed in their solemn squares in the midst of all the rosy bendings of the orchard boughs and yellow effulgence of the harvest and tracing themselves in black network and motionless fringes against the blanched blue of the horizon in its saintly clearness and yet they do not sadden the landscape but seem to have been set there chiefly to show how bright everything else is round them and all the clouds look of pure silver and all the air seems filled with a whiter and more living sunshine where they are pierced by the sable points of the pines and all the pastures look of more glowing green where they run up between the purple trunks and the sweet field footpaths skirt the edges of the forest for the sake of its shade sloping up and down about the slippery roots and losing themselves every now and then hopelessly among the violets and groundivy and brown sheddings of the fibrous leaves and at last plunging into some open aisle where the light through the distant stems shows that there is a chance of coming out again on the other side and coming out indeed in a little while from the scented darkness into the dazzling air and marvellous landscape which stretches still farther and farther in new wilfulness of grove and garden until at last the craggy mountains of the simmenthal rise out of it sharp into the rolling of the southern clouds  11 almost the only pleasure i have myself in rereading my old books is my sense of having at least done justice to the pine compare the passage in this book no 47   1912 although there are few districts of northern europe however apparently dull or tame in which i cannot find pleasure though the whole of northern france except champagne dull as it seems to most travellers is to me a perpetual paradise and putting lincolnshire leicestershire and one or two such other perfectly flat districts aside there is not an english county which i should not find entertainment in exploring the crossroads of foot by footyet all my best enjoyment would be owing to the imagination of the hills colouring with their faraway memories every lowland stone and herb the pleasant french coteau green in the sunshine delights me either by what real mountain character it has in itself for in extent and succession of promontory the flanks of the french valleys have quite the sublimity of true mountain distances or by its broken ground and rugged steps among the vines and rise of the leafage above against the blue sky as it might rise at vevay or como there is not a wave of the seine but is associated in my mind with the first rise of the sandstones and forest pines of fontainebleau and with the hope of the alps as one leaves paris with the horses heads to the southwest the morning sun flashing on the bright waves at charenton if there be no hope or association of this kind and if i cannot deceive myself into fancying that perhaps at the next rise of the road there may be the film of a blue hill in the gleam of sky at the horizon the landscape however beautiful produces in me even a kind of sickness and pain and the whole view from richmond hill or windsor terracenay the gardens of alcinous with their perpetual summeror of the hesperides if they were flat and not close to atlas golden apples and all i would give away in an instant for one mossy granite stone a foot broad and two leaves of lady fern  12 this and the following passage have nothing to do with the general statements in the book they occur with reference only to my own idiosyncrasy i was much surprised when i found first how individual it was by a preraphaelite painters declaring a piece of unwholesome reedy fen to be more beautiful than benvenue   20 i cannot find words to express the intense pleasure i have always in first finding myself after some prolonged stay in england at the foot of the old tower of calais church the large neglect the noble unsightliness of it the record of its years written so visibly yet without sign of weakness or decay its stern wasteness and gloom eaten away by the channel winds and overgrown with the bitter sea grasses its slates and tiles all shaken and rent and yet not falling its desert of brickwork full of bolts and holes and ugly fissures and yet strong like a bare brown rock its carelessness of what any one thinks or feels about it putting forth no claim having no beauty nor desirableness pride nor grace yet neither asking for pity not as ruins are useless and piteous feebly or fondly garrulous of better days but useful still going through its own daily workas some old fisherman beaten grey by storm yet drawing his daily nets so it stands with no complaint about its past youth in blanched and meagre massiveness and serviceableness gathering human souls together underneath it the sound of its bells for prayer still rolling through its rents and the grey peak of it seen far across the sea principal of the three that rise above the waste of surfy sand and hillocked shorethe lighthouse for life and the belfry for labour and thisfor patience and praise  i cannot tell the half of the strange pleasures and thoughts that come about me at the sight of that old tower for in some sort it is the epitome of all that makes the continent of europe interesting as opposed to new countries and above all it completely expresses that agedness in the midst of active life which binds the old and the new into harmony we in england have our new streets our new inn our green shaven lawn and our piece of ruin emergent from ita mere specimen of the middle ages put on a bit of velvet carpet to be shown and which but for its size might as well be on a museum shelf at once under coverbut on the continent the links are unbroken between the past and present and in such use as they can serve for the greyheaded wrecks are suffered to stay with men while in unbroken line the generations of spared buildings are seen succeeding each in its place and thus in its largeness in its permitted evidence of slow decline in its poverty in its absence of all pretence of all show and care for outside aspect that calais tower has an infinite of symbolism in it all the more striking because usually seen in contrast with english scenes expressive of feelings the exact reverse of these13  13 my friend wont write out the reverse our book is to be all jelly and no powder it seems well im very thankful she likes the jellyat any rate it makes me sure that it is well made     section iii  illustrative the sky   21 it is a strange thing how little in general people know about the sky it is the part of creation in which nature has done more for the sake of pleasing manmore for the sole and evident purpose of talking to him and teaching himthan in any other of her works and it is just the part in which we least attend to her there are not many of her other works in which some more material or essential purpose than the mere pleasing of man is not answered by every part of their organization but every essential purpose of the sky might so far as we know be answered if once in three days or thereabouts a great ugly black raincloud were brought up over the blue and everything well watered and so all left blue again till next time with perhaps a film of morning and evening mist for dewand instead of this there is not a moment of any day of our lives when nature is not producing scene after scene picture after picture glory after glory and working still upon such exquisite and constant principles of the most perfect beauty that it is quite certain14 it is all done for us and intended for our perpetual pleasure and every man wherever placed however far from other sources of interest or of beauty has this doing for him constantly the noblest scenes of the earth can be seen and known but by few it is not intended that man should live always in the midst of them he injures them by his presence he ceases to feel them if he is always with them but the sky is for all bright as it is it is not      too bright nor good   for human natures daily food  it is fitted in all its functions for the perpetual comfort and exalting of the heartfor soothing it and purifying it from its dross and dust sometimes gentle sometimes capricious sometimes awfulnever the same for two moments together almost human in its passions almost spiritual in its tenderness almost divine in its infinity its appeal to what is immortal in us is as distinct as its ministry of chastisement or of blessing to what is mortal is essential and yet we never attend to it we never make it a subject of thought but as it has to do with our animal sensations we look upon all by which it speaks to us more clearly than to brutes upon all which bears witness to the intentions of the supreme that we are to receive more from the covering vault than the light and the dew which we share with the weed and the worm as only a succession of meaningless and monotonous accident too common and too vain to be worthy of a moment of watchfulness or a glance of admiration if in our moments of utter idleness and insipidity we turn to the sky as a last resource which of its phenomena do we speak of one says it has been wet and another it has been windy and another it has been warm who among the whole chattering crowd can tell one of the forms and the precipices of the chain of tall white mountains that girded the horizon at noon yesterday who saw the narrow sunbeam that came out of the south and smote upon their summits until they melted and mouldered away in a dust of blue rain who saw the dance of the dead clouds when the sunlight left them last night and the west wind blew them before it like withered leaves all has passed unregretted as unseen or if the apathy be ever shaken off even for an instant it is only by what is gross or what is extraordinary and yet it is not in the broad and fierce manifestations of the elemental energies not in the clash of the hail nor the drift of the whirlwind that the highest characters of the sublime are developed god is not in the earthquake nor in the fire but in the still small voice they are but the blunt and the low faculties of our nature which can only be addressed through lampblack and lightning it is in quiet and subdued passages of unobtrusive majesty the deep and the calm and the perpetual that which must be sought ere it is seen and loved ere it is understood things which the angels work out for us daily and yet vary eternally which are never wanting and never repeated which are to be found always yet each found but onceit is through these that the lesson of devotion is chiefly taught and the blessing of beauty given  14 at least i thought so when i was fourandtwenty at fiveandfifty i fancy that it is just possible there may be other creatures in the universe to be pleased orit may bedispleased by the weather   22 we habitually think of the raincloud only as dark and grey not knowing that we owe to it perhaps the fairest though not the most dazzling of the hues of heaven often in our english mornings the rainclouds in the dawn form soft level fields which melt imperceptibly into the blue or when of less extent gather into apparent bars crossing the sheets of broader cloud above and all these bathed throughout in an unspeakable light of pure rosecolour and purple and amber and blue not shining but mistysoft the barred masses when seen nearer composed of clusters or tresses of cloud like floss silk looking as if each knot were a little swathe or sheaf of lighted rain   23 aqueous vapour or mist suspended in the atmosphere becomes visible exactly as dust does in the air of a room in the shadows you not only cannot see the dust itself because unillumined but you can see other objects through the dust without obscurity the air being thus actually rendered more transparent by a deprivation of light where a sunbeam enters every particle of dust becomes visible and a palpable interruption to the sight so that a transverse sunbeam is a real obstacle to the visionyou cannot see things clearly through it in the same way wherever vapour is illuminated by transverse rays there it becomes visible as a whiteness more or less affecting the purity of the blue and destroying it exactly in proportion to the degree of illumination but where vapour is in shade it has very little effect on the sky perhaps making it a little deeper and greyer than it otherwise would be but not itself unless very dense distinguishable or felt as mist   24 has the reader any distinct idea of what clouds are  15that mist which lies in the morning so softly in the valley level and white through which the tops of the trees rise as if through an inundationwhy is it so heavy and why does it lie so low being yet so thin and frail that it will melt away utterly into splendour of morning when the sun has shone on it but a few moments more those colossal pyramids huge and firm with outlines as of rocks and strength to bear the beating of the high sun full on their fiery flankswhy are they so light their bases high over our heads high over the heads of alps why will these melt away not as the sun rises but as he descends and leave the stars of twilight clear while the valley vapour gains again upon the earth like a shroud or that ghost of a cloud which steals by yonder clump of pines nay which does not steal by them but haunts them wreathing yet round them and yetand yetslowly now falling in a fair waved line like a womans veil now fading now gone we look away for an instant and look back and it is again there what has it to do with that clump of pines that it broods by them and weaves itself among their branches to and fro has it hidden a cloudy treasure among the moss at their roots which it watches thus or has some strong enchanter charmed it into fond returning or bound it fast within those bars of bough and yonder filmy crescent bent like an archers bow above the snowy summit the highest of all the hillsthat white arch which never forms but over the supreme cresthow is it stayed there repelled apparently from the snownowhere touching it the clear sky seen between it and the mountain edge yet never leaving itpoised as a white bird hovers over its nest or those war clouds that gather on the horizon dragoncrested tongued with firehow is their barbed strength bridled what bits are those they are champing with their vapourous lips flinging off flakes of black foam leagued leviathans of the sea of heavenout of their nostrils goeth smoke and their eyes are like the eyelids of the morning the sword of him that layeth at them cannot hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon where ride the captains of their armies where are set the measures of their march fierce murmurers answering each other from morning until eveningwhat rebuke is this which has awed them into peacewhat hand has reined them back by the way in which they came  15 this is a fifth volume bit and worth more attention  i know not if the reader will think at first that questions like these are easily answered so far from it i rather believe that some of the mysteries of the clouds never will be understood by us at all knowest thou the balancings of the clouds is the answer ever to be one of pride the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge is our knowledge ever to be so  for my own part i enjoy the mystery and perhaps the reader may i think he ought he should not be less grateful for summer rain or see less beauty in the clouds of morning because they come to prove him with hard questions to which perhaps if we look close at the heavenly scroll we may find also a syllable or two of answer illuminated here and there16  16 compare in sartor resartus the boys watching from the garden wall  and though the climates of the south and east may be comparatively clear they are no more absolutely clear than our own northern air intense clearness whether in the north after or before rain or in some moments of twilight in the south is always as far as i am acquainted with natural phenomena a notable thing mist of some sort or mirage or confusion of light or of cloud are the general facts the distance may vary in different climates at which the effects of mist begin but they are always present and therefore in all probability it is meant that we should enjoy them we surely need not wonder that mist and all its phenomena have been made delightful to us since our happiness as thinking beings must depend on our being content to accept only partial knowledge even in those matters which chiefly concern us if we insist upon perfect intelligibility and complete declaration in every moral subject we shall instantly fall into misery of unbelief our whole happiness and power of energetic action depend upon our being able to breathe and live in the cloud content to see it opening here and closing there rejoicing to catch through the thinnest films of it glimpses of stable and substantial things but yet perceiving a nobleness even in the concealment and rejoicing that the kindly veil is spread where the untempered light might have scorched us or the infinite clearness wearied and i believe that the resentment of this interference of the mist is one of the forms of proud error which are too easily mistaken for virtues to be content in utter darkness and ignorance is indeed unmanly and therefore we think that to love light and find knowledge must always be right yet as in all matters before observed wherever pride has any share in the work even knowledge and light may be ill pursued knowledge is good and light is good yet man perished in seeking knowledge and moths perish in seeking light and if we who are crushed before the moth will not accept such mystery as is needful to us we shall perish in like manner but accepted in humbleness it instantly becomes an element of pleasure and i think that every rightly constituted mind ought to rejoice not so much in knowing anything clearly as in feeling that there is infinitely more which it cannot know none but proud or weak men would mourn over this for we may always know more if we choose by working on but the pleasure is i think to humble people in knowing that the journey is endless the treasure inexhaustiblewatching the cloud still march before them with its summitless pillar and being sure that to the end of time and to the length of eternity the mysteries of its infinity will still open farther and farther their dimness being the sign and necessary adjunct of their inexhaustibleness i know there are an evil mystery and a deathful dimnessthe mystery of the great babylonthe dimness of the sealed eye and soul but do not let us confuse these with the glorious mystery of the things which the angels desire to look into or with the dimness which even before the clear eye and open soul still rests on sealed pages of the eternal volume   25 on some isolated mountain at daybreak17 when the night mists first rise from off the plain watch their white and lakelike fields as they float in level bays and winding gulfs about the islanded summits of the lower hills untouched yet by more than dawn colder and more quiet than a windless sea under the moon of midnight watch when the first sunbeam is sent upon the silver channels how the foam of their undulating surface parts and passes away and down under their depths the glittering city and green pastures lie like atlantis between the white paths of winding rivers the flakes of light falling every moment faster and broader among the starry spires as the wreathed surges break and vanish above them and the confused crests and ridges of the dark hills shorten their grey shadows upon the plain wait a little longer and you shall see those scattered mists rallying in the ravines and floating up towards you along the winding valleys till they crouch in quiet masses iridescent with the morning light upon the broad breasts of the higher hills whose leagues of massy undulation will melt back back into that robe of material light until they fade away lost in its lustre to appear again above in the serene heaven like a wild bright impossible dream foundationless and inaccessible their very bases vanishing in the unsubstantial and mocking blue of the deep lake below wait yet a little longer and you shall see those mists gather themselves into white towers and stand like fortresses along the promontories massy and motionless only piled with every instant higher and higher into the sky and casting longer shadows athwart the rocks and out of the pale blue of the horizon you will see forming and advancing a troop of narrow dark pointed vapours which will cover the sky inch by inch with their grey network and take the light off the landscape with an eclipse which will stop the singing of the birds and the motion of the leaves togetherand then you will see horizontal bars of black shadow forming under them and lurid wreaths create themselves you know not how among the shoulders of the hills you never see them form but when you look back to a place which was clear an instant ago there is a cloud on it hanging by the precipice as a hawk pauses over his preyand then you will hear the sudden rush of the awakened wind and you will see those watchtowers of vapour swept away from their foundations and waving curtains of opaque rain let down to the valley swinging from the burdened clouds in black bending fringes or pacing in pale columns along the lake level grazing its surface into foam as they go and then as the sun sinks you shall see the storm drift for an instant from off the hills leaving their broad sides smoking and loaded yet with snowwhite torn steamlike rags of capricious vapour now gone now gathered againwhile the smouldering sun seeming not far away but burning like a redhot ball beside you and as if you could reach it plunges through the rushing wind and rolling cloud with headlong fall as if it meant to rise no more dyeing all the air about it with bloodand then you shall hear the fainting tempest die in the hollow of the night and you shall see a green halo kindling on the summit of the eastern hills brighter brighter yet till the large white circle of the slow moon is lifted up among the barred clouds step by step line by line star after star she quenches with her kindling light setting in their stead an army of pale penetrable fleecy wreaths in the heaven to give light upon the earth which move together hand in hand company by company troop by troop so measured in their unity of motion that the whole heaven seems to roll with them and the earth to reel under them and then wait yet for one hour until the east again becomes purple and the heaving mountains rolling against it in darkness like waves of a wild sea are drowned one by one in the glory of its burning watch the white glaciers blaze in their winding paths about the mountains like mighty serpents with scales of fire watch the columnar peaks of solitary snow kindling downwards chasm by chasm each in itself a new morningtheir long avalanches cast down in keen streams brighter than the lightning sending each his tribute of driven snow like altarsmoke up to heaven the roselight of their silent domes flushing that heaven about them and above them piercing with purer light through its purple lines of lifted cloud casting a new glory on every wreath as it passes by until the whole heaven one scarlet canopy is interwoven with a roof of waving flame and tossing vault beyond vault as with the drifted wings of many companies of angels and then when you can look no more for gladness and when you are bowed down with fear and love of the maker and doer of this tell me who has best delivered this his message unto men  17 i forget now what all this is about it seems to be a recollection of the rigi with assumption that the enthusiastic spectator is to stand for a day and night in observation to suffer the effects of a severe thunderstorm and to get neither breakfast nor dinner i have seen such a storm on the rigi however and more than one such sunrise and i much doubt if its present visitors by rail will see more   2618 the account given of the stages of creation in the first chapter of genesis is in every respect clear and intelligible to the simplest reader except in the statement of the work of the second day i suppose that this statement is passed over by careless readers without any endeavour to understand it and contemplated by simple and faithful readers as a sublime mystery which was not intended to be understood but there is no mystery in any other part of the chapter and it seems to me unjust to conclude that any was intended here and the passage ought to be peculiarly interesting to us as being the first in the bible in which the heavens are named and the only one in which the word heaven allimportant as that word is to our understanding of the most precious promises of scripture receives a definite explanation let us therefore see whether by a little careful comparison of the verse with other passages in which the word occurs we may not be able to arrive at as clear an understanding of this portion of the chapter as of the rest in the first place the english word firmament itself is obscure and useless because we never employ it but as a synonym of heaven it conveys no other distinct idea to us and the verse though from our familiarity with it we imagine that it possesses meaning has in reality no more point nor value than if it were written god said let there be a something in the midst of the waters and god called the something heaven but the marginal reading expansion has definite value and the statement that god said let there be an expansion in the midst of the waters and god called the expansion heaven has an apprehensible meaning accepting this expression as the one intended we have next to ask what expansion there is between two waters describable by the term heaven milton adopts the term expanse but he understands it of the whole volume of the air which surrounds the earth whereas so far as we can tell there is no water beyond the air in the fields of space and the whole expression of division of waters from waters is thus rendered valueless now with respect to this whole chapter we must remember always that it is intended for the instruction of all mankind not for the learned reader only and that therefore the most simple and natural interpretation is the likeliest in general to be the true one an unscientific reader knows little about the manner in which the volume of the atmosphere surrounds the earth but i imagine that he could hardly glance at the sky when rain was falling in the distance and see the level line of the bases of the clouds from which the shower descended without being able to attach an instant and easy meaning to the words expansion in the midst of the waters and if having once seized this idea he proceeded to examine it more accurately he would perceive at once if he had ever noticed anything of the nature of clouds that the level line of their bases did indeed most severely and stringently divide waters from watersthat is to say divide water in its collective and tangible state from water in its aërial state or the waters which fall and flow from those which rise and float next if we try this interpretation in the theological sense of the word heaven and examine whether the clouds are spoken of as gods dwellingplace we find god going before the israelites in a pillar of cloud revealing himself in a cloud on sinai appearing in a cloud on the mercyseat filling the temple of solomon with the cloud when its dedication is accepted appearing in a great cloud to ezekiel ascending into a cloud before the eyes of the disciples on mount olivet and in like manner returning to judgment behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory while further the clouds and heavens are used as interchangeable words in those psalms which most distinctly set forth the power of god he bowed the heavens also and came down he made darkness pavilions round about him dark waters and thick clouds of the skies and again thy mercy o lord is in the heavens and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds and again his excellency is over israel and his strength is in the clouds and again the clouds poured out water the skies sent out a sound the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven again clouds and darkness are round about him righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne the heavens declare his righteousness and all the people see his glory in all these passages the meaning is unmistakable if they possess definite meaning at all we are too apt to take them merely for sublime and vague imagery and therefore gradually to lose the apprehension of their life and power the expression he bowed the heavens for instance is i suppose received by most readers as a magnificent hyperbole having reference to some peculiar and fearful manifestation of gods power to the writer of the psalm in which the words occur but the expression either has plain meaning or it has no meaning understand by the term heavens the compass of infinite space around the earth and the expression bowed the heavens however sublime is wholly without meaning infinite space cannot be bent or bowed but understand by the heavens the veil of clouds above the earth and the expression is neither hyperbolical nor obscure it is pure plain accurate truth and it describes god not as revealing himself in any peculiar way to david but doing what he is still doing before our own eyes day by day by accepting the words in their simple sense we are thus led to apprehend the immediate presence of the deity and his purpose of manifesting himself as near us whenever the stormcloud stoops upon its course while by our vague and inaccurate acceptance of the words we remove the idea of his presence far from us into a region which we can neither see nor know and gradually from the close realization of a living god who maketh the clouds his chariot we define and explain ourselves into dim and distant suspicion of an inactive god inhabiting inconceivable places and fading into the multitudinous formalisms of the laws of nature all errors of this kindand in the present day we are in constant and grievous danger of falling into themarise from the originally mistaken idea that man can by searching find out godfind out the almighty to perfectionthat is to say by help of courses of reasoning and accumulations of science apprehend the nature of the deity in a more exalted and more accurate manner than in a state of comparative ignorance whereas it is clearly necessary from the beginning to the end of time that gods way of revealing himself to his creatures should be a simple way which all those creatures may understand whether taught or untaught whether of mean capacity or enlarged it is necessary that communion with their creator should be possible to all and the admission to such communion must be rested not on their having a knowledge of astronomy but on their having a human soul in order to render this communion possible the deity has stooped from his throne and has not only in the person of the son taken upon him the veil of our human flesh but in the person of the father taken upon him the veil of our human thoughts and permitted us by his own spoken authority to conceive him simply and clearly as a loving father and friend a being to be walked with and reasoned with to be moved by our entreaties angered by our rebellion alienated by our coldness pleased by our love and glorified by our labour and finally to be beheld in immediate and active presence in all the powers and changes of creation this conception of god which is the childs is evidently the only one which can be universal and therefore the only one which for us can be true the moment that in our pride of heart we refuse to accept the condescension of the almighty and desire him instead of stooping to hold our hands to rise up before us into his glory we hoping that by standing on a grain of dust or two of human knowledge higher than our fellows we may behold the creator as he risesgod takes us at our word he rises into his own invisible and inconceivable majesty he goes forth upon the ways which are not our ways and retires into the thoughts which are not our thoughts and we are left alone and presently we say in our vain hearts there is no god  18 this passage to the end of the section is one of the last and best which i wrote in the temper of my youth and i can still ratify it thus far that the texts referred to in it must either be received as it explains them or neglected altogether  i would desire therefore to receive gods account of his own creation as under the ordinary limits of human knowledge and imagination it would be received by a simpleminded man and finding that the heavens and the earth are spoken of always as having something like equal relation to each other thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them i reject at once all idea of the term heavens being intended to signify the infinity of space inhabited by countless worlds for between those infinite heavens and the particle of sand which not the earth only but the sun itself with all the solar system is in relation to them no relation of equality or comparison could be inferred but i suppose the heavens to mean that part of creation which holds equal companionship with our globe i understand the rolling of these heavens together as a scroll to be an equal and relative destruction with the melting of the elements in fervent heat and i understand the making of the firmament to signify that so far as man is concerned most magnificent ordinance of the cloudsthe ordinance that as the great plain of waters was formed on the face of the earth so also a plain of waters should be stretched along the height of air and the face of the cloud answer the face of the ocean and that this upper and heavenly plain should be of waters as it were glorified in their nature no longer quenching the fire but now bearing fire in their own bosoms no longer murmuring only when the winds raise them or rocks divide but answering each other with their own voices from pole to pole no longer restrained by established shores and guided through unchanging channels but going forth at their pleasure like the armies of the angels and choosing their encampments upon the heights of the hills no longer hurried downwards for ever moving but to fall nor lost in the lightless accumulation of the abyss but covering the east and west with the waving of their wings and robing the gloom of the farther infinite with a vesture of diverse colours of which the threads are purple and scarlet and the embroideries flame  this i believe is the ordinance of the firmament and it seems to me that in the midst of the material nearness of these heavens god means us to acknowledge his own immediate presence as visiting judging and blessing us the earth shook the heavens also dropped at the presence of god he doth set his bow in the clouds and thus renews in the sound of every drooping swathe of rain his promises of everlasting love in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun whose burning ball which without the firmament would be seen but as an intolerable and scorching circle in the blackness of vacuity is by that firmament surrounded with gorgeous service and tempered by mediatorial ministries by the firmament of clouds the temple is built for his presence to fill with light at noon by the firmament of clouds the purple veil is closed at evening round the sanctuary of his rest by the mists of the firmament his implacable light is divided and its separated fierceness appeased into the soft blue that fills the depth of distance with its bloom and the flush with which the mountains burn as they drink the overflowing of the dayspring and in this tabernacling of the unendurable sun with men through the shadows of the firmament god would seem to set forth the stooping of his own majesty to men upon the throne of the firmament as the creator of all the worlds and the inhabiter of eternity we cannot behold him but as the judge of the earth and the preserver of men those heavens are indeed his dwellingplace swear not neither by heaven for it is gods throne nor by the earth for it is his footstool and all those passings to and fro of fruitful showers and grateful shade and all those visions of silver palaces built about the horizon and voices of moaning winds and threatening thunders and glories of coloured robe and cloven ray are but to deepen in our hearts the acceptance and distinctness and dearness of the simple words our father which art in heaven     section iv  illustrative streams and sea   27 of all inorganic substances acting in their own proper nature and without assistance and combination water is the most wonderful if we think of it as the source of all the changefulness and beauty which we have seen in cloudsthen as the instrument by which the earth we have contemplated was modelled into symmetry and its crags chiselled into gracethen as in the form of snow it robes the mountains it has made with that transcendent light which we could not have conceived if we had not seenthen as it exists in the foam of the torrent in the iris which spans it in the morning mist which rises from it in the deep crystalline pools which mirror its hanging shore in the broad lake and glancing riverfinally in that which is to all human minds the best emblem of unwearied unconquerable power the wild various fantastic tameless unity of the seawhat shall we compare to this mighty this universal element for glory and beauty or how shall we follow its eternal changefulness of feeling it is like trying to paint a soul   28 the great angel of the searain the angel observethe messenger sent to a special place on a special errand not the diffused perpetual presence of the burden of mist but the going and returning of the intermittent cloud all turns upon that intermittence soft moss on stone and rock cave fern of tangled glen wayside wellperennial patient silent clear stealing through its square font of roughhewn stone ever thus deep no morewhich the winter wreck sullies not the summer thirst wastes not incapable of stain as of declinewhere the fallen leaf floats undecayed and the insect darts undefiling cressed brook and evereddying river lifted even in flood scarcely over its stepping stonesbut through all sweet summer keeping tremulous music with harpstrings of dark water among the silver fingering of the pebbles far away in the south the strong river gods have all hasted and gone down to the sea wasted and burning white furnaces of blasting sand their broad beds lie ghastly and bare but here in the moss lands the soft wings of the sea angel droop still with dew and the shadows of their plumes falter on the hills strange laughings and glitterings of silver streamlets born suddenly and twined about the mossy heights in trickling tinsel answering to them as they wave   29 stand for half an hour beside the fall of schaffhausen on the north side where the rapids are long and watch how the vault of water first bends unbroken in pure polished velocity over the arching rocks at the brow of the cataract covering them with a dome of crystal twenty feet thick so swift that its motion is unseen except when a foam globe from above darts over it like a falling star and how the trees are lighted above it under all their leaves19 at the instant that it breaks into foam and how all the hollows of that foam burn with green fire like so much shattering chrysoprase and how ever and anon startling you with its white flash a jet of spray leaps hissing out of the fall like a rocket bursting in the wind and driven away in dust filling the air with light and how through the curdling wreaths of the restless crashing abyss below the blue of the water paled by the foam in its body shows purer than the sky through white raincloud while the shuddering iris stoops in tremulous stillness over all fading and flushing alternately through the choking spray and shattered sunshine hiding itself at last among the thick golden leaves which toss to and fro in sympathy with the wild watertheir dripping masses lifted at intervals like sheaves of loaded corn by some stronger gush from the cataract and bowed again upon the mossy rocks as its roar dies awaythe dew gushing from their thick branches through drooping clusters of emerald herbage and sparkling in white threads along the dark rocks of the shore feeding the lichens which chase and chequer them with purple and silver  19 well noticed the drawing of the fall of schaffhausen which i made at the time of writing this study was one of the very few either by other draughtsmen or myself which i have seen turner pause at with serious attention   30 close beside the path by which travellers ascend the montanvert from the valley of chamouni on the right hand where it first begins to rise among the pines there descends a small stream from the foot of the granite peak known to the guides as the aiguille charmoz it is concealed from the traveller by a thicket of alder and its murmur is hardly heard for it is one of the weakest streams of the valley but it is a constant stream fed by a permanent though small glacier and continuing to flow even to the close of summer when more copious torrents depending only on the melting of the lower snows have left their bedsstony channels in the sun the long drought which took place in the autumn of 1854 sealing every source of waters except these perpetual ones left the torrent of which i am speaking and such others in a state peculiarly favourable to observance of their least action on the mountains from which they descend they were entirely limited to their own ice fountains and the quantity of powdered rock which they brought down was of course at its minimum being nearly unmingled with any earth derived from the dissolution of softer soil or vegetable mould by rains at three in the afternoon on a warm day in september when the torrent had reached its average maximum strength for the day i filled an ordinary bordeaux wine flask with the water where it was least turbid from this quart of water i obtained twentyfour grains of sand and sediment more or less fine i cannot estimate the quantity of water in the stream but the runlet of it at which i filled the flask was giving about two hundred bottles a minute or rather more carrying down therefore about three quarters of a pound of powdered granite every minute this would be fortyfive pounds an hour but allowing for the inferior power of the stream in the cooler periods of the day and taking into consideration on the other side its increased power in rain we may i think estimate its average hours work at twentyeight or thirty pounds or a hundredweight every four hours by this insignificant runlet therefore rather more than two tons of the substance of the mont blanc are displaced and carried down a certain distance every week and as it is only for three or four months that the flow of the stream is checked by frost we may certainly allow eighty tons for the mass which it annually moves it is not worth while to enter into any calculation of the relation borne by this runlet to the great torrents which descend from the chain of mont blanc into the valley of chamouni20 i but take this quantity eighty tons as the result of the labour of a scarcely noticeable runlet at the side of one of them utterly irrespective of all sudden falls of stones and of masses of mountain a single thunderbolt will sometimes leave a scar on the flank of a soft rock looking like a trench for a railroad and we shall then begin to apprehend something of the operation of the great laws of change which are the conditions of all material existence however apparently enduring the hills which as compared with living beings seem everlasting are in truth as perishing as they its veins of flowing fountain weary the mountain heart as the crimson pulse does ours the natural force of the iron crag is abated in its appointed time like the strength of the sinews in a human old age and it is but the lapse of the longer years of decay which in the sight of its creator distinguishes the mountain range from the moth and the worm  20 i have slightly modified and abridged what follows being impatient of its prolixity as well as ashamed of what is truly called the ludicrous underestimate of the mass of the larger streams   31 few people comparatively have ever seen the effect on the sea of a powerful gale continued without intermission for three or four days and nights and to those who have not i believe it must be unimaginable not from the mere force or size of surge but from the complete annihilation of the limit between sea and air the water from its prolonged agitation is beaten not into mere creamy foam but into masses of accumulated yeast which hang in ropes and wreaths from wave to wave and where one curls over to break form a festoon like a drapery from its edge these are taken up by the wind not in dissipating dust but bodily in writhing hanging coiling masses which make the air white and thick as with snow only the flakes are a foot or two long each the surges themselves are full of foam in their very bodies underneath making them white all through as the water is under a great cataractand their masses being thus half water and half air are torn to pieces by the wind whenever they rise and carried away in roaring smoke which chokes and strangles like actual water add to this that when the air has been exhausted of its moisture by long rain the spray of the sea is caught by it as described above and covers its surface not merely with the smoke of finely divided water but with boiling mist imagine also the low rainclouds brought down to the very level of the sea as i have often seen them whirling and flying in rags and fragments from wave to wave and finally conceive the surges themselves in their utmost pitch of power velocity vastness and madness lifting themselves in precipices and peaks furrowed with their whirl of ascent through all this chaos and you will understand that there is indeed no distinction left between the sea and air that no object nor horizon nor any landmark or natural evidence of position is left that the heaven is all spray and the ocean all cloud and that you can see no farther in any direction than you could see through a cataract21  21 the whole of this was written merely to show the meaning of turners picture of the steamer in distress throwing up signals it is a good study of wild weather but separate from its aim utterly feeble in comparison to the few words by which any of the great poets will describe sea when they have got to do it i am rather proud of the short sentence in the harbours of england describing a great breaker against rockone moment a flint cavethe next a marble pillarthe next a fading cloud but there is nothing in seadescription detailed like dickens storm at the death of ham in david copperfield     section v  illustrative mountains   32 the words which marked for us the purpose of the clouds are followed immediately by those notable onesand god said let the waters which are under the heavens be gathered together into one place and let the dry land appear we do not perhaps often enough consider the deep signification of this sentence we are too apt to receive it as the description of an event vaster only in its extent not in its nature than the compelling of the red sea to draw back that israel might pass by we imagine the deity in like manner rolling the waves of the greater ocean together on an heap and setting bars and doors to them eternally but there is a far deeper meaning than this in the solemn words of genesis and in the correspondent verse of the psalm his hands prepared the dry land up to that moment the earth had been void for it had been without form the command that the waters should be gathered was the command that the earth should be sculptured the sea was not driven to its place in suddenly restrained rebellion but withdrawn to its place in perfect and patient obedience the dry land appeared not in level sands forsaken by the surges which those surges might again claim for their own but in range beyond range of swelling hill and iron rock for ever to claim kindred with the firmament and be companioned by the clouds of heaven  what space of time was in reality occupied by the day of genesis is not at present of any importance for us to consider by what furnaces of fire the adamant was melted and by what wheels of earthquake it was torn and by what teeth of glacier and weight of seawaves it was engraven and finished into its perfect form we may perhaps hereafter endeavour to conjecture but here as in few words the work is summed by the historian so in few broad thoughts it should be comprehended by us and as we read the mighty sentence let the dry land appear we should try to follow the finger of god as it engraved upon the stone tables of the earth the letters and the law of its everlasting form as gulf by gulf the channels of the deep were ploughed and cape by cape the lines were traced with divine foreknowledge of the shores that were to limit the nations and chain by chain the mountain walls were lengthened forth and their foundations fastened for ever and the compass was set upon the face of the depth and the fields and the highest part of the dust of the world were made and the right hand of christ first strewed the snow on lebanon and smoothed the slopes of calvary  it is not i repeat always needful in many respects it is not possible to conjecture the manner or the time in which this work was done but it is deeply necessary for all men to consider the magnificence of the accomplished purpose and the depth of the wisdom and love which are manifested in the ordinances of the hills for observe in order to bring the world into the form which it now bears it was not mere sculpture that was needed the mountains could not stand for a day unless they were formed of materials altogether different from those which constitute the lower hills and the surfaces of the valleys a harder substance had to be prepared for every mountain chain yet not so hard but that it might be capable of crumbling down into earth fit to nourish the alpine forest and the alpine flower not so hard but that in the midst of the utmost majesty of its enthroned strength there should be seen on it the seal of death and the writing of the same sentence that had gone forth against the human frame dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return and with this perishable substance the most majestic forms were to be framed that were consistent with the safety of man and the peak was to be lifted and the cliff rent as high and as steeply as was possible in order yet to permit the shepherd to feed his flocks upon the slopes and the cottage to nestle beneath their shadow and observe two distinct ends were to be accomplished in doing this it was indeed absolutely necessary that such eminences should be created in order to fit the earth in any wise for human habitation for without mountains the air could not be purified nor the flowing of the rivers sustained and the earth must have become for the most part plain or stagnant marsh but the feeding of the rivers and the purifying of the winds are the least of the services appointed to the hills to fill the thirst of the human heart for the beauty of gods workingto startle its lethargy with the deep and pure agitation of astonishmentare their higher missions they are as a great and noble architecture first giving shelter comfort and rest and covered also with mighty sculpture and painted legend it is impossible to examine in their connected system the features of even the most ordinary mountain scenery without concluding that it has been prepared in order to unite as far as possible and in the closest compass every means of delighting and sanctifying the heart of man as far as possiblethat is as far as is consistent with the fulfilment of the sentence of condemnation on the whole earth death must be upon the hills and the cruelty of the tempests smite them and the briar and thorn spring up upon them but they so smite as to bring their rocks into the fairest forms and so spring as to make the very desert blossom as the rose even among our own hills of scotland and cumberland though often too barren to be perfectly beautiful and always too low to be perfectly sublime it is strange how many deep sources of delight are gathered into the compass of their glens and vales and how down to the most secret cluster of their faraway flowers and the idlest leap of their straying streamlets the whole heart of nature seems thirsting to give and still to give shedding forth her everlasting beneficence with a profusion so patient so passionate that our utmost observance and thankfulness are but at last neglects of her nobleness and apathy to her love but among the true mountains of the greater orders the divine purpose of appeal at once to all the faculties of the human spirit becomes still more manifest inferior hills ordinarily interrupt in some degree the richness of the valleys at their feet the grey downs of southern england and treeless coteaux of central france and grey swells of scottish moor whatever peculiar charm they may possess in themselves are at least destitute of those which belong to the woods and fields of the lowlands but the great mountains lift the lowlands on their sides let the reader imagine first the appearance of the most varied plain of some richly cultivated country let him imagine it dark with graceful woods and soft with deepest pastures let him fill the space of it to the utmost horizon with innumerable and changeful incidents of scenery and life leading pleasant streamlets through its meadows strewing clusters of cottages beside their banks tracing sweet footpaths through its avenues and animating its fields with happy flocks and slow wandering spots of cattle and when he has wearied himself with endless imagining and left no space without some loveliness of its own let him conceive all this great plain with its infinite treasures of natural beauty and happy human life gathered up in gods hands from one edge of the horizon to the other like a woven garment and shaken into deep falling folds as the robes droop from a kings shoulders all its bright rivers leaping into cataracts along the hollows of its fall and all its forests rearing themselves aslant against its slopes as a rider rears himself back when his horse plunges and all its villages nestling themselves into the new windings of its glens and all its pastures thrown into steep waves of greensward dashed with dew along the edges of their folds and sweeping down into endless slopes with a cloud here and there lying quietly half on the grass half in the airand he will have as yet in all this lifted world only the foundation of one of the great alps and whatever is lovely in the lowland scenery becomes lovelier in this change the trees which grew heavily and stiffly from the level line of plain assume strange curves of strength and grace as they bend themselves against the mountain side they breathe more freely and toss their branches more carelessly as each climbs higher looking to the clear light above the topmost leaves of its brother tree the flowers which on the arable plain fall before the plough now find out for themselves unapproachable places where year by year they gather into happier fellowship and fear no evil and the streams which in the level land crept in dark eddies by unwholesome banks now move in showers of silver and are clothed with rainbows and bring health and life wherever the glance of their waves can reach  it may not therefore be altogether profitless or unnecessary to review briefly the nature of the three great offices which mountain ranges are appointed to fulfil in order to preserve the health and increase the happiness of mankind their first use is of course to give motion to water every fountain and river from the inchdeep streamlet that crosses the village lane in trembling clearness to the massy and silent march of the everlasting multitude of waters in amazon or ganges owe their play and purity and power to the ordained elevations of the earth gentle or steep extended or abrupt some determined slope of the earths surface is of course necessary before any wave can so much as overtake one sedge in its pilgrimage and how seldom do we enough consider as we walk beside the margins of our pleasant brooks how beautiful and wonderful is that ordinance of which every blade of grass that waves in their clear water is a perpetual signthat the dew and rain fallen on the face of the earth shall find no restingplace shall find on the contrary fixed channels traced for them from the ravines of the central crests down which they roar in sudden ranks of foam to the dark hollows beneath the banks of lowland pasture round which they must circle slowly among the stems and beneath the leaves of the lilies paths prepared for them by which at some appointed rate of journey they must evermore descend sometimes slow and sometimes swift but never pausing the daily portion of the earth they have to glide over marked for them at each successive sunrise the place which has known them knowing them no more and the gateways of guarding mountains opened for them in cleft and chasm none letting them in their pilgrimage and from afar off the great heart of the sea calling them to itself deep calleth unto deep i know not which of the two is the more wonderfulthat calm gradated invisible slope of the champaign land which gives motion to the stream or that passage cloven for it through the ranks of hill which necessary for the health of the land immediately around them would yet unless so supernaturally divided have fatally intercepted the flow of the waters from faroff countries when did the great spirit of the river first knock at these adamantine gates when did the porter open to it and cast his keys away for ever lapped in whirling sand i am not satisfiedno one should be satisfiedwith that vague answer the river cut its way not so the river found its way 22i do not see that rivers in their own strength can do much in cutting their way they are nearly as apt to choke their channels up as to carve them out only give a river some little sudden power in a valley and see how it will use it cut itself a bed not so by any means but fill up its bed and look for another in a wild dissatisfied inconsistent mannerany way rather than the old one will better please it and even if it is banked up and forced to keep to the old one it will not deepen but do all it can to raise it and leap out of it and although wherever water has a steep fall it will swiftly cut itself a bed deep into the rock or ground it will not when the rock is hard cut a wider channel than it actually needs so that if the existing river beds through ranges of mountains had in reality been cut by the streams they would be found wherever the rocks are hard only in the form of narrow and profound ravines like the wellknown channel of the niagara below the fall not in that of extended valleys and the actual work of true mountain rivers though often much greater in proportion to their body of water than that of the niagara is quite insignificant when compared with the area and depth of the valleys through which they flow so that although in many cases it appears that those larger valleys have been excavated at earlier periods by more powerful streams or by the existing stream in a more powerful condition still the great fact remains always equally plain and equally admirable that whatever the nature and duration of the agencies employed the earth was so shaped at first as to direct the currents of its rivers in the manner most healthy and convenient for man the valley of the rhone may have been in great part excavated in early times by torrents a thousand times larger than the rhone but it could not have been excavated at all unless the mountains had been thrown at first into two chains by which the torrents were set to work in a given direction and it is easy to conceive how under any less beneficent dispositions of their masses of hill the continents of the earth might either have been covered with enormous lakes as parts of north america actually are covered or have become wildernesses of pestiferous marsh or lifeless plains upon which the water would have dried as it fell leaving them for great part of the year desert such districts do exist and exist in vastness the whole earth is not prepared for the habitation of man only certain small portions are prepared for himthe houses as it were of the human race from which they are to look abroad upon the rest of the world not to wonder or complain that it is not all house but to be grateful for the kindness of the admirable building in the house itself as compared with the rest it would be as absurd to think it an evil that all the world is not fit for us to inhabit as to think it an evil that the globe is no larger than it is as much as we shall ever need is evidently assigned to us for our dwellingplace the rest covered with rolling waves or drifting sands fretted with ice or crested with fire is set before us for contemplation in an uninhabitable magnificence and that part which we are enabled to inhabit owes its fitness for human life chiefly to its mountain ranges which throwing the superfluous rain off as it falls collect it in streams or lakes and guide it into given places and in given directions so that men can build their cities in the midst of fields which they know will be always fertile and establish the lines of their commerce upon streams which will not fail  22 i attach great importance to the remaining contents of this passage and have had occasion to insist on them at great length in recent lectures at oxford  nor is this giving of motion to water to be considered as confined only to the surface of the earth a no less important function of the hills is in directing the flow of the fountains and springs from subterranean reservoirs there is no miraculous springing up of water out of the ground at our feet but every fountain and well is supplied from reservoirs among the hills so placed as to involve some slight fall or pressure enough to secure the constant flowing of the stream and the incalculable blessing of the power given to us in most valleys of reaching by excavation some point whence the water will rise to the surface of the ground in perennial flow is entirely owing to the concave dispositions of the beds of clay or rock raised from beneath the bosom of the valley into ranks of enclosing hills  the second great use of mountains is to maintain a constant change in the currents and nature of the air such change would of course have been partly caused by difference in soil and vegetation even if the earth had been level but to a far less extent than it is now by the chains of hills whichexposing on one side their masses of rock to the full heat of the sun increased by the angle at which the rays strike on the slope and on the other casting a soft shadow for leagues over the plains at their feetdivide the earth not only into districts but into climates and cause perpetual currents of air to traverse their passes in a thousand different states moistening it with the spray of their waterfalls sucking it down and beating it hither and thither in the pools of their torrents closing it within clefts and caves where the sunbeams never reach till it is as cold as november mists then sending it forth again to breathe lightly across the slopes of velvet fields or to be scorched among sunburnt shales and grassless crags then drawing it back in moaning swirls through clefts of ice and up into dewy wreaths above the snowfields then piercing it with strange electric darts and flashes of mountain fire and tossing it high in fantastic stormcloud as the dried grass is tossed by the mower only suffering it to depart at last when chastened and pure to refresh the faded air of the faroff plains  the third great use of mountains is to cause perpetual change in the soils of the earth without such provision the ground under cultivation would in a series of years become exhausted and require to be upturned laboriously by the hand of man but the elevations of the earths surface provide for it a perpetual renovation the higher mountains suffer their summits to be broken into fragments and to be cast down in sheets of massy rock full as we shall see presently of every substance necessary for the nourishment of plants these fallen fragments are again broken by frost and ground by torrents into various conditions of sand and claymaterials which are distributed perpetually by the streams farther and farther from the mountains base every shower that swells the rivulet enables their waters to carry certain portions of earth into new positions and exposes new banks of ground to be mined in their turn that turbid foaming of the angry waterthat tearing down of bank and rock along the flanks of its furyare no disturbances of the kind course of nature they are beneficent operations of laws necessary to the existence of man and to the beauty of the earth the process is continued more gently but not less effectively over all the surface of the lower undulating country and each filtering thread of summer rain which trickles through the short turf of the uplands is bearing its own appointed burden of earth to be thrown down on some new natural garden in the dingles beneath  i have not spoken of the local and peculiar utilities of mountains i do not count the benefit of the supply of summer streams from the moors of the higher rangesof the various medicinal plants which are nested among their rocksof the delicate pasturage which they furnish for cattleof the forests in which they bear timber for shippingthe stones they supply for building or the ores of metal which they collect into spots open to discovery and easy for working all these benefits are of a secondary or a limited nature but the three great functions which i have just described those of giving motion and change to water air and earth are indispensable to human existence they are operations to be regarded with as full a depth of gratitude as the laws which bid the tree bear fruit or the seed multiply itself in the earth and thus those desolate and threatening ranges of dark mountain which in nearly all ages of the world men have looked upon with aversion or with terror and shrunk back from as if they were haunted by perpetual images of death are in reality sources of life and happiness far fuller and more beneficent than all the bright fruitfulness of the plain the valleys only feed the mountains feed and guard and strengthen us we take our idea of fearlessness and sublimity alternately from the mountains and the sea but we associate them unjustly the seawave with all its beneficence is yet devouring and terrible but the silent wave of the blue mountain is lifted towards heaven in a stillness of perpetual mercy and the one surge unfathomable in its darkness the other unshaken in its faithfulness for ever bear the seal of their appointed symbolism  thy righteousness is like the great mountains  thy judgments are a great deep   33 mountains are to the rest of the body of the earth what violent muscular action is to the body of man the muscles and tendons of its anatomy are in the mountain brought out with force and convulsive energy full of expression passion and strength the plains and the lower hills are the repose and the effortless motion of the frame when its muscles lie dormant and concealed beneath the lines of its beautyyet ruling those lines in their every undulation this then is the first grand principle of the truth of the earth the spirit of the hills is action that of the lowlands repose and between these there is to be found every variety of motion and rest from the inactive plain sleeping like the firmament with cities for stars to the fiery peaks which with heaving bosoms and exulting limbs with the clouds drifting like hair from their bright foreheads lift up their titan heads to heaven saying i live for ever   34 where they are23 they seem to form the world no mere bank of a river here or of a lane there peeping out among the hedges or forests but from the lowest valley to the highest clouds all is theirsone adamantine dominion and rigid authority of rock we yield ourselves to the impression of their eternal unconquerable stubbornness of strength their mass seems the least yielding least to be softened or in anywise dealt with by external force of all earthly substance and behold as we look further into it it is all touched and troubled like waves by a summer breeze rippled far more delicately than seas or lakes are rippled they only undulate along their surfacesthis rock trembles through its every fibre like the chords of an eolian harp like the stillest air of spring with the echoes of a childs voice into the heart of all those great mountains through every tossing of their boundless crests and deep beneath all their unfathomable defiles flows that strange quivering of their substance other and weaker things seem to express their subjection to an infinite power only by momentary terrors as the weeds bow down before the feverish wind and the sound of the going in the tops of the taller trees passes on before the clouds and the fitful opening of pale spaces on the dark water as if some invisible hand were casting dust abroad upon it gives warning of the anger that is to come we may well imagine that there is a fear passing upon the grass and leaves and waters at the presence of some great spirit commissioned to let the tempest loose but the terror passes and their sweet rest is perpetually restored to the pastures and the waves not so to the mountains they which at first seem strengthened beyond the dread of any violence or change are yet also ordained to bear upon them the symbol of a perpetual fear the tremor which fades from the soft lake and gliding river is sealed to all eternity upon the rock and while things that pass visibly from birth to death may sometimes forget their feebleness the mountains are made to possess a perpetual memorial of their infancythat infancy which the prophet saw in his vision24i beheld the earth and lo it was without form and void and the heavens and they had no light i beheld the mountains and lo they trembled and all the hills moved lightly  23 passage written after i had got by some years cooler and wiser than when i wrote no 33 describing however the undulation of the gneiss rocks which where they are seem to form the world in terms more fanciful than i now like  24 utter misinterpretation of the passage it is the old age not the childhood of earth which jeremiah describes in this passage see its true interpretation in fors clavigera letter xlvi   35 the longer i stayed among the alps and the more closely i examined them the more i was struck by the one broad fact of there being a vast alpine plateau or mass of elevated land upon which nearly all the highest peaks stood like children set upon a table removed in most cases far back from the edge of the plateauas if for fear of their falling while the most majestic scenes in the alps are produced not so much by any violation of this law as by one of the great peaks having apparently walked to the edge of the table to look over and thus showing itself suddenly above the valley in its full height this is the case with the wetterhorn and eiger at grindelwald and with the grande jorasse above the col de ferret but the raised bank or table is always intelligibly in existence even in these apparently exceptional cases and for the most part the great peaks are not allowed to come to the edge of it but remain like the keeps of castles far withdrawn surrounded league beyond league by comparatively level fields of mountain over which the lapping sheets of glacier writhe and flow foaming about the feet of the dark central crests like the surf of an enormous seabreaker hurled over a rounded rock and islanding some fragment of it in the midst and the result of this arrangement is a kind of division of the whole of switzerland into an upper and lower mountain worldthe lower world consisting of rich valleys bordered by steep but easily accessible wooded banks of mountain more or less divided by ravines through which glimpses are caught of the higher alps the upper world reached after the first banks of 3000 or 4000 feet in height have been surmounted consisting of comparatively level but most desolate tracts of moor and rock half covered by glacier and stretching to the feet of the true pinnacles of the chain it can hardly be necessary to point out the perfect wisdom and kindness of this arrangement as a provision for the safety of the inhabitants of the high mountain regions if the great peaks rose at once from the deepest valleys every stone which was struck from their pinnacles and every snowwreath which slipped from their ledges would descend at once upon the inhabitable ground over which no year would pass without recording some calamity of earthslip or avalanche while in the course of their fall both the stones and the snow would strip the woods from the hillsides leaving only naked channels of destruction where there are now the sloping meadow and the chestnut glade besides this the masses of snow cast down at once into the warmer air would all melt rapidly in the spring causing furious inundation of every great river for a month or six weeks the snow being then all thawed except what lay upon the highest peaks in regions of nearly perpetual frost the rivers would be supplied during the summer only by fountains and the feeble tricklings on sunny days from the high snows the rhone under such circumstances would hardly be larger in summer than the severn and many swiss valleys would be left almost without moisture all these calamities are prevented by the peculiar alpine structure which has been described the broken rocks and the sliding snow of the high peaks instead of being dashed at once to the vales are caught upon the desolate shelves or shoulders which everywhere surround the central crests the soft banks which terminate these shelves traversed by no falling fragments clothe themselves with richest wood while the masses of snow heaped upon the ledge above them in a climate neither so warm as to thaw them quickly in the spring nor so cold as to protect them from all the power of the summer sun either form themselves into glaciers or remain in slowly wasting fields even to the close of the yearin either case supplying constant abundant and regular streams to the villages and pastures beneath and to the rest of europe noble and navigable rivers  now that such a structure is the best and wisest possible25 is indeed sufficient reason for its existence and to many people it may seem useless to question farther respecting its origin but i can hardly conceive any one standing face to face with one of these towers of central rock and yet not also asking himself is this indeed the actual first work of the divine master on which i gaze was the great precipice shaped by his finger as adam was shaped out of the dust were its clefts and ledges carved upon it by its creator as the letters were on the tables of the law and was it thus left to bear its eternal testimony to his beneficence among these clouds of heaven or is it the descendant of a long race of mountains existing under appointed laws of birth and endurance death and decrepitude there can be no doubt as to the answer the rock itself answers audibly by the murmur of some falling stone or rending pinnacle it is not as it was once those waste leagues around its feet are loaded with the wrecks of what it was on these perhaps of all mountains the characters of decay are written most clearly around these are spread most gloomily the memorials of their pride and the signs of their humiliation  25 of course i had seen every other tried before giving this favourable judgment  what then were they once the only answer is yet againbehold the cloud   36 there are many spots among the inferior ridges of the alps such as the col de ferret the col danterne and the associated ranges of the buet which though commanding prospects of great nobleness are themselves very nearly types of all that is most painful to the human mind vast wastes of mountain ground26 covered here and there with dull grey grass or moss but breaking continually into black banks of shattered slate all glistening and sodden with slow tricklings of clogged incapable streams the snowwater oozing through them in a cold sweat and spreading itself in creeping stains among their dust ever and anon a shaking here and there and a handful or two of their particles or flakes trembling down one sees not why into more total dissolution leaving a few jagged teeth like the edges of knives eaten away by vinegar projecting through the halfdislodged mass from the inner rock keen enough to cut the hand or foot that rests on them yet crumbling as they wound and soon sinking again into the smooth slippery glutinous heap looking like a beach of black scales of dead fish cast ashore from a poisonous sea and sloping away into foul ravines branched down immeasurable slopes of barrenness where the winds howl and wander continually and the snow lies in wasted and sorrowful fields covered with sooty dust that collects in streaks and stains at the bottom of all its thawing ripples  26 this is a fourth volume passageand i will venture to say of it as albert dürer when he was pleased with his workthat for what it has to do it cannot be much better done it is a study on the col de bon homme  i know of no other scenes so appalling as these in storm or so woful in sunshine where however these same rocks exist in more favourable positionsthat is to say in gentler banks and at lower elevationsthey form a ground for the most luxuriant vegetation and the valleys of savoy owe to them some of their loveliest solitudesexquisitely rich pastures interspersed with arable and orchard land and shaded by groves of walnut and cherry scenes of this kind and of that just described so singularly opposed and apparently brought together as foils to each other are however peculiar to certain beds of the slaty coherents which are both vast in elevation and easy of destruction in wales and scotland the same groups of rocks possess far greater hardness while they attain less elevation and the result is a totally different aspect of scenery the severity of the climate and the comparative durableness of the rock forbid the rich vegetation but the exposed summits though barren are not subject to laws of destruction so rapid and fearful as in switzerland and the natural colour of the rock is oftener developed in the purples and greys which mingled with the heather form the principal elements of the deep and beautiful distant blue of the british hills their gentler mountain streams also permit the beds of rock to remain in firm though fantastic forms along their banks and the gradual action of the cascades and eddies upon the slaty cleavage produces many pieces of foreground scenery to which higher hills can present no parallel   37 unlike chamouni aiguilles there is no aspect of destruction about the matterhorn cliffs they are not torn remnants of separating spires yielding flake by flake and band by band to the continual process of decay they are on the contrary an unaltered monument seemingly sculptured long ago the huge walls retaining yet the forms into which they were first engraven and standing like an egyptian templedelicately fronted softly coloured the suns of uncounted ages rising and falling upon it continually but still casting the same line of shadows from east to west still century after century touching the same purple stains on the lotus pillars while the desert sand ebbs and flows about their feet as those autumn leaves of rock lie heaped and weak about the base of the cervin  is not this a strange type in the very heart and height of these mysterious alpsthese wrinkled hills in their snowy cold greyhaired old age at first so silent then as we keep quiet at their feet muttering and whispering to us garrulously in broken and dreaming fits as it were about their childhoodis it not a strange type of the things which out of weakness are made strong if one of these little flakes of mica sand hurried in tremulous spangling along the bottom of the ancient river too light to sink too faint to float almost too small for sight could have had a mind given to it as it was at last borne down with its kindred dust into the abysses of the stream and laid might it not have been thought for a hopeless eternity in the dark ooze the most despised forgotten and feeble of all earths atoms incapable of any use or change not fit down there in the diluvial darkness so much as to help an earth wasp to build its nest or feed the first fibre of a lichen what would it have thought had it been told that one day knitted into a strength as of imperishable iron rustless by the air infusible by the flame out of the substance of it with its fellows the axe of god should hew that alpine towerthat against itpoor helpless mica flakethe wild north winds should rage in vain beneath itlowfallen mica flakethe snowy hills should lie bowed like flocks of sheep and the kingdoms of the earth fade away in unregarded blue and around itweak wavedrifted mica flakethe great war of the firmament should burst in thunder and yet stir it not and the fiery arrows and angry meteors of the night fall blunted back from it into the air and all the stars in the clear heaven should light one by one as they rose new cressets upon the points of snow that fringed its abidingplace on the imperishable spire     section vi  illustrative stones   38 there are no natural objects out of which more can be learned than out of stones they seem to have been created especially to reward a patient observer nearly all other objects in nature can be seen to some extent without patience and are pleasant even in being half seen trees clouds and rivers are enjoyable even by the careless but the stone under his foot has for carelessness nothing in it but stumbling no pleasure is languidly to be had out of it nor food nor good of any kind nothing but symbolism of the hard heart and the unfatherly gift and yet do but give it some reverence and watchfulness and there is bread of thought in it more than in any other lowly feature of all the landscape for a stone when it is examined will be found a mountain in miniature the fineness of natures work is so great that into a single block a foot or two in diameter she can compress as many changes of form and structure on a small scale as she needs for her mountains on a large one and taking moss for forests and grains of crystal for crags the surface of a stone in by far the plurality of instances is more interesting than the surface of an ordinary hill more fantastic in form and incomparably richer in colour   39 on a highland hillside are multitudinous clusters of fern and heather on an alpine one multitudinous groves of chestnut and pine the number of the things may be the same but the sense of infinity is in the latter case far greater because the number is of nobler things indeed so far as mere magnitude of space occupied on the field of the horizon is the measure of objects a bank of earth ten feet high may if we stoop to the foot of it be made to occupy just as much of the sky as that bank of mountain at villeneuve nay in many respects its little ravines and escarpments watched with some help of imagination may become very sufficiently representative to us of those of the great mountain and in classing all waterworn mountain ground under the general and humble term of banks i mean to imply this relationship of structure between the smallest eminences and the highest but in this matter of superimposed quantity the distinctions of rank are at once fixed the heap of earth bears its few tufts of moss or knots of grass the highland or cumberland mountain its honeyed heathers or scented ferns but the mass of the bank at martigny or villeneuve has a vineyard in every cranny of its rocks and a chestnut grove on every crest of them the minute mounds and furrows scattered up the side of that great promontory when they are actually approached after three or four hours climbing turn into independent hills with true parks of lovely pastureland enclosed among them and avenue after avenue of chestnuts walnuts and pines bending round their bases while in the deeper dingles populous villages literally bound down to the rock by enormous trunks of vine which first trained lightly over the loose stone roofs have in process of years cast their fruitful net over the whole village and fastened it to the ground under their purple weight and wayward coils as securely as ever human heart was fastened to earth by the net of the flatterer   40 when a rock of any kind has lain for some time exposed to the weather nature finishes it in her own way first she takes wonderful pains about its forms sculpturing it into exquisite variety of dent and dimple and rounding or hollowing it into contours which for fineness no human hand can follow then she colours it and every one of her touches of colour instead of being a powder mixed with oil is a minute forest of living trees glorious in strength and beauty and concealing wonders of structure   41 on the broken rocks in the foreground in the crystalline groups the mosses seem to set themselves consentfully and deliberately to the task of producing the most exquisite harmonies of colour in their power they will not conceal the form of the rock but will gather over it in little brown bosses like small cushions of velvet made of mixed threads of dark ruby silk and gold rounded over more subdued films of white and grey with lightly crisped and curled edges like hoar frost on fallen leaves and minute clusters of upright orange stalks with pointed caps and fibres of deep green and gold and faint purple passing into black all woven together and following with unimaginable fineness of gentle growth the undulation of the stone they cherish until it is charged with colour so that it can receive no more and instead of looking rugged or cold or stern or anything that a rock is held to be at heart it seems to be clothed with a soft dark leopards skin embroidered with arabesque of purple and silver   42 the colour of the white varieties of marble is of exquisite delicacy owing to the partial translucency of the pure rock and it has always appeared to me a most wonderful ordinanceone of the most marked pieces of purpose in the creationthat all the variegated kinds should be comparatively opaque so as to set off the colour on the surface while the white which if it had been opaque would have looked somewhat coarse as for instance common chalk does is rendered just translucent enough to give an impression of extreme purity but not so translucent as to interfere in the least with the distinctness of any forms into which it is wrought the colours of variegated marbles are also for the most part very beautiful especially those composed of purple amber and green with white and there seems something notably attractive to the human mind in the vague and veined labyrinths of their arrangements   43 i have often had occasion to allude to the apparent connection of brilliancy of colour with vigour of life or purity of substance this is preeminently the case in the mineral kingdom the perfection with which the particles of any substance unite in crystallization corresponds in that kingdom to the vital power in organic nature and it is a universal law that according to the purity of any substance and according to the energy of its crystallization is its beauty or brightness pure earths are white when in powder and the same earths which are the constituents of clay and sand form when crystallized the emerald ruby sapphire amethyst and opal   44 as we pass between the hills which have been shaken by earthquake and torn by convulsion we find that periods of perfect repose succeed those of destruction the pools of calm water lie clear beneath their fallen rocks the waterlilies gleam and the reeds whisper among their shadows the village rises again over the forgotten graves and its church tower white through the stormlight proclaims a renewed appeal to his protection in whose hand are all the corners of the earth and the strength of the hills is his also there is no loveliness of alpine valley that does not teach the same lesson it is just where the mountain falling cometh to nought and the rock is removed out of his place that in process of years the fairest meadows bloom between the fragments the clearest rivulets murmur from between their crevices among the flowers and the clustered cottages each sheltered beneath some strength of mossy stone now to be removed no more and with their pastured flocks around them safe from the eagles stoop and the wolfs ravin have written upon their fronts in simple words the mountaineers faith in the ancient promiseneither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee     section vii  illustrative plants and flowers   45 wonderful in universal adaptation to mans need desire and discipline gods daily

wave of oceanclothing with variegated everlasting films the peaks of the trackless mountains or ministering at cottage doors to every gentlest passion and simplest joy of humanity   46 if ever in autumn a pensiveness falls upon us as the leaves drift by in their fading may we not wisely look up in hope to their mighty monuments behold how fair how far prolonged in arch and aisle the avenues of the valleys the fringes of the hills so statelyso eternal the joy of man the comfort of all living creatures the glory of the earththey are but the monuments of those poor leaves that flit faintly past us to die let them not pass without our understanding their last counsel and example that we also careless of monument by the grave may build it in the worldmonument by which men may be taught to remember not where we died but where we lived   47 the pine magnificent nay sometimes almost terrible other trees tufting crag or hill yield to the form and sway of the ground clothe it with soft compliance are partly its subjects partly its flatterers partly its comforters but the pine rises in serene resistance selfcontained nor can i ever without awe stay long under a great alpine cliff far from all house or work of men looking up to its companies of pines as they stand on the inaccessible juts and perilous ledges of the enormous wall in quiet multitudes each like the shadow of the one beside itupright fixed spectral as troops of ghosts standing on the walls of hades not knowing each other dumb for ever you cannot reach them cannot cry to them those trees never heard human voice they are far above all sound but of the winds no foot ever stirred fallen leaf of theirs all comfortless they stand between the two eternities of the vacancy and the rock yet with such iron will that the rock itself looks bent and shattered beside themfragile weak inconsistent compared to their dark energy of delicate life and monotony of enchanted prideunnumbered unconquerable  then note farther their perfectness the impression on most peoples minds must have been received more from pictures than reality so far as i can judge so ragged they think the pine whereas its chief character in health is green and full roundness it stands compact like one of its own cones slightly curved on its sides finished and quaint as a carved tree in some elizabethan garden and instead of being wild in expression forms the softest of all forest scenery for other trees show their trunks and twisting boughs but the pine growing either in luxuriant mass or in happy isolation allows no branch to be seen summit behind summit rise its pyramidal ranges or down to the very grass sweep the circlets of its boughs so that there is nothing but green cone and green carpet nor is it only softer but in one sense more cheerful than other foliage for it casts only a pyramidal shadow lowland forest arches overhead and chequers the ground with darkness but the pine growing in scattered groups leaves the glades between emeraldbright its gloom is all its own narrowing into the sky it lets the sunshine strike down to the dew and if ever a superstitious feeling comes over me among the pine glades it is never tainted with the old german forest fear but it is only a more solemn tone of the fairy enchantment that haunts our english meadows so that i have always called the prettiest pineglade in chamouni fairies hollow it is in the glen beneath the steep ascent above pont pelissier and may be reached by a little winding path which goes down from the top of the hill27being indeed not truly a glen but a broad ledge of moss and turf leaning in a formidable precipice which however the gentle branches hide over the arve an almost isolated rock promontory many coloured rises at the end of it on the other sides it is bordered by cliffs from which a little cascade falls literally down among the pines for it is so light shaking itself into mere showers of seed pearl in the sun that the pines dont know it from mist and grow through it without minding underneath there is only the mossy silence and above for ever the snow of the nameless aiguille  27 the new road to chamouni has been carried right through it a cascade on the right as you ascend marks the place spoken of in the textonce as lonely as corrienanshian  other trees rise against the sky in dots and knots but this in fringes you never see the edges of it so subtle are they and for this reasonit alone of trees so far as i know is capable of the fiery change which has been noticed by shakespeare when the sun rises behind a ridge crested with pine provided the ridge be at a distance of about two miles and seen clear all the trees for about three or four degrees on each side of the sun become trees of light seen in clear flame against the darker sky and dazzling as the sun itself i thought at first this was owing to the actual lustre of the leaves but i believe now it is caused by the clouddew upon themevery minutest leaf carrying its diamond it seems as if these trees living always among the clouds had caught part of their glory from them and themselves the darkest of vegetation could yet add splendour to the sun itself   48 the swiss have certainly no feelings respecting their mountains in anywise correspondent with ours it was rather as fortresses of defence than as spectacles of splendour that the cliffs of the rothslock bare rule over the destinies of those who dwelt at their feet and the training for which the mountain children had to thank the slopes of the muottathal was in soundness of breath and steadiness of limb far more than in elevation of idea but the point which i desire the reader to note is that the character of the scene which if any appears to have been impressive to the inhabitant is not that which we ourselves feel when we enter the district it was not from their lakes nor their cliffs nor their glaciersthough these were all peculiarly their possessionsthat the three venerable cantons received their name they were not called the states of the rock nor the states of the lake but the states of the forest and the one of the three which contains the most touching record of the spiritual power of swiss religion in the name of the convent of the hill of angels has for its own none but the sweet childish name of under the woods  and indeed you may pass under them if leaving the most sacred spot in swiss history the meadow of the three fountains you bid the boatman row southward a little way by the shore of the bay of uri steepest there on its western side the walls of its rocks ascend to heaven far in the blue of evening like a great cathedral pavement lies the lake in its darkness and you may hear the whisper of innumerable falling waters return from the hollows of the cliff like the voices of a multitude praying under their breath from time to time the beat of a wave slow lifted where the rocks lean over the black depth dies heavily as the last note of a requiem opposite green with steep grass and set with châlet villages the fronalp rises in one solemn glow of pastoral light and peace and above against the clouds of twilight ghostly on the gray precipice stand myriad by myriad the shadowy armies of the unterwalden pine   49 it had been wild weather when i left rome and all across the campagna the clouds were sweeping in sulphurous blue with a clap of thunder or two and breaking gleams of sun along the claudian aqueduct lighting up the infinity of its arches like the bridge of chaos but as i climbed the long slope of the alban mount the storm swept finally to the north and the noble outline of the domes of albano and graceful darkness of its ilex grove rose against pure streaks of alternate blue and amber the upper sky gradually flushing through the last fragments of raincloud in deep palpitating azure half æther and half dew the noonday sun came slanting down the rocky slopes of la riccia and their masses of entangled and tall foliage whose autumnal tints were mixed with the wet verdure of a thousand evergreens were penetrated with it as with rain i cannot call it colourit was conflagration purple and crimson and scarlet like the curtains of gods tabernacle the rejoicing trees sank into the valley in showers of light every separate leaf quivering with buoyant and burning life each as it turned to reflect or to transmit the sunbeam first a torch and then an emerald far up into the recesses of the valley the green vistas arched like the hollows of mighty waves of some crystalline sea with the arbutus flowers dashed along their banks for foam and silver flakes of orange spray tossed into the air around them breaking over the grey walls of rock into a thousand separate stars fading and kindling alternately as the weak wind lifted and let them fall every glade of grass burned like the golden floor of heaven opening in sudden gleams as the foliage broke and closed above it as sheetlightning opens in a cloud at sunset the motionless masses of dark rock dark though flushed with scarlet lichen casting their quiet shadows across its restless radiance the fountain underneath them filling its marble hollow with blue mist and fitful sound and over all the multitudinous bars of amber and rosethe sacred clouds that have no darkness and only exist to illuminewere seen in fathomless intervals between the solemn and orbed repose of the stone pines passing to lose themselves in the last white blinding lustre of the measureless line where the campagna melted into the blaze of the sea   50 flowers seem intended for the solace of ordinary humanity children love them quiet contented ordinary people love them as they grow luxurious and disorderly people rejoice in them gathered they are the cottagers treasure and in the crowded town mark as with a little broken fragment of rainbow the windows of the workers in whose hearts rests the covenant of peace   51 yet few people really care about flowers many indeed are fond of finding a new shape of blossom caring for it as a child cares about a kaleidoscope many also like a fair service of flowers in the greenhouse as a fair service of plate on the table many are scientifically interested in them though even these in the nomenclature rather than the flowers and a few enjoy their gardens but the blossoming time of the year being principally spring i perceive it to be the mind of most people during that period to stay in towns a year or two ago a keensighted and eccentricallyminded friend of mine having taken it into his head to violate this national custom and go to the tyrol in spring was passing through a valley near landech with several similarly headstrong companions a strange mountain appeared in the distance belted about its breast with a zone of blue like our english queen was it a blue cloud a blue horizontal bar of the air that titian breathed in youth seen now far away which mortal might never breathe again was it a miragea meteor would it stay to be approachedten miles of winding road yet between them and the foot of the mountainsuch questioning had they concerning it my keensighted friend alone maintained it to be substantialwhatever it might be it was not air and would not vanish the ten miles of road were overpast the carriage left the mountain climbed it stayed patiently expanding still into richer breath and heavenlier glowa belt of gentians such things may verily be seen among the alps in spring and in spring only which being so i observe most people prefer going in autumn   52 perhaps few people have ever asked themselves why they admire a rose so much more than all other flowers if they consider they will find first that red is in a delicately gradated state the loveliest of all pure colours and secondly that in the rose there is no shadow except what is composed of colour all its shadows are fuller in colour than its lights owing to the translucency and reflective power of the leaves   53 has the reader ever considered the relations of commonest forms of volatile substance the invisible particles which cause the scent of a roseleaf how minute how multitudinous passing richly away into the air continually   54 in the range of inorganic nature i doubt if any object can be found more perfectly beautiful than a fresh deep snowdrift seen under warm light its curves are of inconceivable perfection and changefulness its surface and transparency alike exquisite its light and shade of inexhaustible variety and inimitable finishthe shadows sharp pale and of heavenly colour the reflected lights intense and multitudinous and mingled with the sweet occurrences of transmitted light if passing to the edge of a sheet of it upon the lower alps early in may we find as we are nearly sure to find two or three little round openings pierced in it and through these emergent a slender pensive fragile flower28 whose small dark purplefringed bell hangs down and shudders over the icy cleft that it has cloven as if partly wondering at its own recent grave and partly dying of very fatigue after its hardwon victory we shall be or we ought to be moved by a totally different impression of loveliness from that which we receive among the dead ice and the idle clouds there is now uttered to us a call for sympathy now offered to us an image of moral purpose and achievement which however unconscious or senseless the creature may indeed be that so seems to call cannot be heard without affection nor contemplated without worship by any of us whose heart is rightly turned or whose mind is clearly and surely sighted  28 soldanella alpina i think it is the only alpine flower which actually pierces snow though i have seen gentians filling thawed hoofprints crocuses are languid till they have had sun for a day or two but the soldanella enjoys its snow at first and afterwards its fields i have seen it make a pasture look like a large lilac silk gown   55 it has been well shown by dr herbert that many plants are found alone on a certain soil or subsoil in a wild state not because such soil is favourable to them but because they alone are capable of existing on it and because all dangerous rivals are by its inhospitality removed now if we withdraw the plant from this position which it hardly endures and supply it with the earth and maintain about it the temperature that it delights in withdrawing from it at the same time all rivals which in such conditions nature would have thrust upon it we shall indeed obtain a magnificently developed example of the plant colossal in size and splendid in organization but we shall utterly lose in it that moral ideal which is dependent on its right fulfilment of its appointed functions it was intended and created by the deity for the covering of those lonely spots where no other plant could live it has been thereto endowed with courage and strength and capacities of endurance its character and glory are not therefore in the gluttonous and idle feeding of its own over luxuriance at the expense of other creatures utterly destroyed and rooted out for its good alone but in its right doing of its hard duty and forward climbing into those spots of forlorn hope where it alone can bear witness to the kindness and presence of the spirit that cutteth out rivers among the rocks as he covers the valleys with corn and there in its vanward place and only there where nothing is withdrawn for it nor hurt by it and where nothing can take part of its honour nor usurp its throne are its strength and fairness and price and goodness in the sight of god to be truly esteemed the first time i saw the soldanella alpina before spoken of it was growing of magnificent size on a sunny alpine pasture among bleating of sheep and lowing of cattle associated with a profusion of geum montanum and ranunculus pyrenæus i noticed it only because new to menor perceived any peculiar beauty in its cloven flower some days after i found it alone among the rack of the higher clouds and howling of glacier winds and as i described it piercing through an edge of avalanche which in its retiring had left the new ground brown and lifeless and as if burnt by recent fire the plant was poor and feeble and seemingly exhausted with its effortsbut it was then that i comprehended its ideal character and saw its noble function and order of glory among the constellations of the earth   56 grassesminute granular feathery or downy seedvessels mingling quaint brown punctuation and dusty tremors of dancing grain with the bloom of the nearer fields and casting a gossamered grayness and softness of plumy mist along their surfaces far away mysterious evermore not only with dew in the morning or mirage at noon but with the shaking threads of fine arborescence each a little belfry of grainbells all achime   57 gather a single blade of grass and examine for a minute quietly its narrow swordshaped strip of fluted green nothing as it seems there of notable goodness or beauty a very little strength and a very little tallness and a few delicate long lines meeting in a pointnot a perfect point neither but blunt and unfinished by no means a creditable or apparently muchcaredfor example of natures workmanship made only to be trodden on today and tomorrow to be cast into the ovenand a little pale and hollow stalk feeble and flaccid leading down to the dull brown fibres of roots and yet think of it well and judge whether of all the gorgeous flowers that beam in summer air and of all strong and goodly trees pleasant to the eyes or good for foodstately palm and pine strong ash and oak scented citron burdened vinethere be any by man so deeply loved by god so highly graced as that narrow point of feeble green and well does it fulfil its mission consider what we owe merely to the meadow grass to the covering of the dark ground by that glorious enamel by the companies of those soft and countless and peaceful spears the fields follow forth but for a little time the thoughts of all that we ought to recognise in these words all spring and summer is in themthe walks by silent scented pathsthe rests in noonday heatthe joy of herds and flocksthe power of all shepherd life and meditationthe life of sunlight upon the world falling in emerald streaks and falling in soft blue shadows where else it would have struck upon the dark mould or scorching dust pastures beside the pacing brooks soft banks and knolls of lowly hills thymy slopes of down overlooked by the blue line of lifted sea crisp lawns all dim with early dew or smooth in evening warmth of barred sunshine dinted by happy feet and softening in their fall the sound of loving voicesall these are summed in those simple words and these are not all we may not measure to the full the depth of this heavenly gift in our own land though still as we think of it longer the infinite of that meadow sweetness shakespeares peculiar joy would open on us more and more yet we have it but in part go out in the springtime among the meadows that slope from the shores of the swiss lakes to the roots of their lower mountains there mingled with the taller gentians and the white narcissus the grass grows deep and free and as you follow the winding mountain path beneath arching boughs all veiled with blossompaths that for ever droop and rise over the green banks and mounds sweeping down in scented undulation steep to the blue water studded here and there with newmown heaps filling all the air with fainter sweetnesslook up towards the higher hills where the waves of everlasting green roll silently into their long inlets among the shadows of the pines and we may perhaps at last know the meaning of those quiet words of the 147th psalm he maketh grass to grow upon the mountains  assembling the images we have traced and adding the simplest of all from isaiah xl 6 we find the grass and flowers are types in their passing of the passing of human life and in their excellence of the excellence of human life and this in twofold way first by their beneficence and then by their endurancethe grass of the earth in giving the seed of corn and in its beauty under tread of foot and stroke of scythe and the grass of the waters in giving its freshness for our rest and in its bending before the wave but understood in the broad human and divine sense the herb yielding seedas opposed to the fruit tree yielding fruitincludes a third family of plants and fulfils a third office to the human race it includes the great family of the lints and flaxes and fulfils thus the three offices of giving food raiment and rest follow out this fulfilment consider the association of the linen garment and the linen embroidery with the priestly office and the furniture of the tabernacle and consider how the rush has been to all time the first natural carpet thrown under the human foot then next observe the three virtues definitely set forth by the three families of plantsnot arbitrarily or fancifully associated with them but in all the three cases marked for us by scriptural words 1st cheerfulness or joyful serenity in the grass for food and beautyconsider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin 2nd humility in the grass for resta bruised reed shall he not break 3rd love in the grass for clothing because of its swift kindlingthe smoking flax shall he not quench and then finally observe the confirmation of these last two images in i suppose the most important prophecy relating to the future state of the christian church which occurs in the old testament namely that contained in the closing chapters of ezekiel the measures of the temple of god are to be taken and because it is only by charity and humility that those measures ever can be taken the angel has a line of flax in his hand and a measuring reed the use of the line was to measure the land and of the reed to take the dimensions of the buildings so the buildings of the church or its labours are to be measured by humility and its territory or land by love   58 leaves motionless the strong pines wave above them and the weak grasses tremble beside them but the blue stars rest upon the earth with a peace as of heaven and far along the ridges of iron rock moveless as they the rubied crests of alpine rose flush in the low rays of morning   59 mossesmeek creatures the first mercy of the earth veiling with hushed softness its dintless rocks creatures full of pity covering with strange and tender honour the scarred disgrace of ruin laying quiet finger on the trembling stones to teach them rest no words that i know of will say what these mosses are none are delicate enough none perfect enough none rich enough how is one to tell of the rounded bosses of furred and beaming greenthe starred divisions of rubied bloom finefilmed as if the rock spirits could spin porphyry as we do glassthe traceries of intricate silver and fringes of amber lustrous arborescent burnished through every fibre into fitful brightness and glossy traverses of silken change yet all subdued and pensive and framed for simplest sweetest offices of grace they will not be gathered like the flowers for chaplet or lovetoken but of these the wild bird will make its nest and the wearied child his pillow  and as the earths first mercy so they are its last gift to us when all other service is vain from plant and tree the soft mosses and gray lichen take up their watch by the headstone the woods the blossoms the giftbearing grasses have done their parts for a time but these do service for ever trees for the builders yard flowers for the brides chamber corn for the granary moss for the grave   60 lichensas in one sense the humblest in another they are the most honoured of the earthchildren unfading as motionless the worm frets them not and the autumn wastes not strong in loveliness they neither blanch in heat nor pine in frost to them slowfingered constanthearted is entrusted the weaving of the dark eternal tapestries of the hills to them slowpencilled irisdyed the tender framing of their endless imagery sharing the stillness of the unimpassioned rock they share also its endurance and while the winds of departing spring scatter the white hawthorn blossom like drifted snow and summer dims on the parched meadow the drooping of its cowslip goldfar above among the mountains the silver lichen spots rest starlike on the stone and the gathering orange stain upon the edge of yonder western peak reflects the sunsets of a thousand years     section viii  education   61 the most helpful and sacred work which can at present be done for humanity is to teach people chiefly by example as all best teaching must be done not how to better themselves but how to satisfy themselves it is the curse of every evil nature and evil creature to eat and not be satisfied the words of blessing are that they shall eat and be satisfied and as there is only one kind of water which quenches all thirst so there is only one kind of bread which satisfies all hungerthe bread of justice or righteousness which hungering after men shall always be filled that being the bread of heaven but hungering after the bread or wages of unrighteousness shall not be filled that being the bread of sodom and in order to teach men how to be satisfied it is necessary fully to understand the art of joy and humble lifethis at present of all arts or sciences being the one most needing study humble life that is to say proposing to itself no future exaltation but only a sweet continuance not excluding the idea of foresight but wholly of foresorrow and taking no troublous thought for coming days so also not excluding the idea of providence or provision but wholly of accumulationthe life of domestic affection and domestic peace full of sensitiveness to all elements of costless and kind pleasuretherefore chiefly to the loveliness of the natural world   62 we shall find that the love of nature wherever it has existed has been a faithful and sacred element of feeling that is to say supposing all the circumstances otherwise the same with respect to two individuals the one who loves nature most will be always found to have more capacity for faith in god than the other natureworship will be found to bring with it such a sense of the presence and power of a great spirit as no mere reasoning can either induce or controvert and where that natureworship is innocently pursuedie with due respect to other claims on time feeling and exertion and associated with the higher principles of religionit becomes the channel of certain sacred truths which by no other means can be conveyed   63 instead of supposing the love of nature necessarily connected with the faithlessness of the age i believe it is connected properly with the benevolence and liberty29 of the age that it is precisely the most healthy element which distinctively belongs to us and that out of it cultivated no longer in levity or ignorance but in earnestness and as a duty results will spring of an importance at present inconceivable and lights arise which for the first time in mans history will reveal to him the true nature of his life the true field for his energies and the true relations between him and his maker  29 i forget now what i meant by liberty in this passage but i often used the word in my first writings in a good sense thinking of scotts moorland rambles and the like it is very wonderful to me now to see what hopes i had once but turner was alive then and the sun used to shine and rivers to sparkle   64 to any person who has all his senses about him a quiet walk over not more than ten or twelve miles of road a day is the most amusing of all travelling and all travelling becomes dull in exact proportion to its rapidity  going by railroad i do not consider as travelling at all it is merely being sent to a place and very little different from becoming a parcel   65 i believe an immense gain in the bodily health and happiness of the upper classes would follow on their steadily endeavouring however clumsily to make the physical exertion they now necessarily exert in amusements definitely serviceable it would be far better for instance that a gentleman should mow his own fields than ride over other peoples   66 in order to define what is fairest you must delight in what is fair and i know not how few or how many there may be who take such delight once i could speak joyfully about beautiful things thinking to be understood now i cannot any more for it seems to me that no one regards them wherever i look or travel in england or abroad i see that men wherever they can reach destroy all beauty they seem to have no other desire or hope but to have large houses and be able to move fast every perfect and lovely spot which they can touch they defile thus the railroad bridge over the fall of schaffhausen and that round the clarens shore of the lake of geneva have destroyed the power of two pieces of scenery of which nothing can ever supply the place in appeal to the higher ranks of european mind   67 the first thing which i remember as an event in life was being taken by my nurse to the brow of friars crag on derwentwater the intense joy mingled with awe that i had in looking through the hollows in the mossy roots over the crag into the dark lake has associated itself more or less with all twining roots of trees ever since two other things i remember as in a sort beginnings of lifecrossing shapfells being let out of the chaise to run up the hills and going through glenfarg near kinross on a winters morning when the rocks were hung with icicles these being culminating points in an early life of more travelling than is usually indulged to a child in such journeyings whenever they brought me near hills and in all mountain ground and scenery i had a pleasure as early as i can remember and continuing till i was eighteen or twenty infinitely greater than any which has been since possible to me in anything   68 a fool always wants to shorten space and time a wise man wants to lengthen both a fool wants to kill space and time a wise man first to gain them then to animate them   69 i suspect that systemmakers in general are not of much more use each in his own domain than in that of pomona the old women who tie cherries upon sticks for the more portableness of the same to cultivate well and choose well your cherries is of some importance but if they can be had in their own wild way of clustering about their crabbed stalks it is a better connection for them than any others and if they cannot then so that they be not bruised it makes to a boy of practical disposition not much difference whether he gets them by handfuls or in beaded symmetry on the exalting stick   70 every great man is always being helped by everybody for his gift is to get good out of all things and all persons   71 god appoints to every one of his creatures a separate mission and if they discharge it honourably if they quit themselves like men and faithfully follow the light which is in them withdrawing from it all cold and quenching influence there will assuredly come of it such burning as in its appointed mode and measure shall shine before men and be of service constant and holy degrees infinite of lustre there must always be but the weakest among us has a gift however seemingly trivial which is peculiar to him and which worthily used will be a gift also to his race for ever   72 there is not any matter nor any spirit nor any creature but it is capable of a unity of some kind with other creatures and in that unity is its perfection and theirs and a pleasure also for the beholding of all other creatures that can behold so the unity of spirits is partly in their sympathy and partly in their giving and taking and always in their love and these are their delight and their strength for their strength is in their coworking and army fellowship and their delight is in their giving and receiving of alternate and perpetual good their inseparable dependency on each others being and their essential and perfect depending on their creators and so the unity of earthly creatures is their power and their peace not like the dead and cold peace of undisturbed stones and solitary mountains but the living peace of trust and the living power of support of hands that hold each other and are still30  30 a long affected and obscure second volume sentence written in imitation of hooker one short sentence from ecclesiastes is the sum of it how can one be warm alone   73 it is good to read of that kindness and humbleness of st francis of assisi who spoke never to bird nor to cicada nor even to wolf and beasts of prey but as his brotherand so we find are moved the minds of all good and mighty men as in the lesson that we have from the mariner of coleridge and yet more truly and rightly taught in the hartleap well    never to blend our pleasure or our pride   with sorrow of the meanest thing that feels  and again in the white doe of rylstone with the added teaching that anguish of our own    is tempered and allayed by sympathies   aloft ascending and descending deep   even to the inferior kinds  so that i know not of anything more destructive of the whole theoretic faculty not to say of the christian character and human intellect31 than those accursed sports in which man makes of himself cat tiger leopard and alligator in one and gathers into one continuance of cruelty for his amusement all the devices that brutes sparingly and at intervals use against each other for their necessities  31 i am more and more grieved as i reread this and other portions of the most affected and weak of all my books written in a moulting time of my lifethe second volume of modern paintersat its morbid violence of passion and narrowness of thought yet at heart the book was like my others honest and in substance it is mostly good but all boiled to rags   74 he who loves not god nor his brother cannot love the grass beneath his feet nor the creatures which live not for his uses filling those spaces in the universe which he needs not while on the other hand none can love god nor his human brother without loving all things which his father loves nor without looking upon them every one as in that respect his brethren also and perhaps worthier than he if in the under concords they have to fill their part is touched more truly32  32 morbidly franciscan again and i am really compelled to leave out one little bit my friend likedas all kindly and hopeful women wouldabout everything turning out right and being to some good end for we have no business whatever with the ends of things but with their beings and their beings are often entirely bad   75 things may always be seen truly by candid people though never completely no human capacity ever yet saw the whole of a thing but we may see more and more of it the longer we look every individual temper will see something different in it but supposing the tempers honest all the differences are there every advance in our acuteness of perception will show us something new but the old and firstdiscerned thing will still be there not falsified only modified and enriched by the new perceptions becoming continually more beautiful in its harmony with them and more approved as a part of the infinite truth     section ix  moralities   76 when people read the law came by moses but grace and truth by christ do they suppose it means that the law was ungracious and untrue the law was given for a foundation the grace or mercy and truth for fulfilmentthe whole forming one glorious trinity of judgment mercy and truth33 and if people would but read the text of their bibles with heartier purpose of understanding it instead of superstitiously they would see that throughout the parts which they are intended to make most personally their own the psalms it is always the law which is spoken of with chief joy the psalms respecting mercy are often sorrowful as in thought of what it cost but those respecting the law are always full of delight david cannot contain himself for joy in thinking of ithe is never weary of its praise how love i thy law it is my meditation all the day thy testimonies are my delight and my counsellors sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb  33 a great deal of the presumption and narrowness caused by my having been bred in the evangelical schools and which now fill me with shame and distress in rereading modern painters is to my present mind atoned for by the accurate thinking by which i broke my way through to the great truth expressed in this passage which all my later writings without exception have been directed to maintain and illustrate   77 i suppose there is no event in the whole life of christ to which in hours of doubt or fear men turn with more anxious thirst to know the close facts of it or with more earnest and passionate dwelling upon every syllable of its recorded narrative than christs showing himself to his disciples at the lake of galilee there is something preeminently open natural full fronting our disbelief in this manifestation the others recorded after the resurrection were sudden phantomlike occurring to men in profound sorrow and wearied agitation of heart not it might seem safe judges of what they saw but the agitation was now over they had gone back to their daily work thinking still their business lay netwards unmeshed from the literal rope and drag simon peter saith unto them i go afishing they say unto him we also go with thee true words enough and having far echo beyond those galilean hills that night they caught nothing but when the morning came in the clear light of it behold a figure stood on the shore they were not thinking of anything but their fruitless hauls they had no guess who it was it asked them simply if they had caught anything they say no and it tells them to cast again and john shades his eyes from the morning sun with his hand to look who it is and though the glistening of the sea too dazzles him he makes out who it is at last and poor simon not to be outrun this time tightens his fishers coat about him and dashes in over the nets one would have liked to see him swim those hundred yards and stagger to his knees upon the beach  well the others get to the beach too in time in such slow way as men in general do get in this world to its true shore much impeded by that wonderful dragging the net with fishes but they get thereseven of them in all first the denier and then the slowest believer and then the quickest believer and then the two throneseekers and two more we know not who  they sit down on the shore face to face with him and eat their broiled fish as he bids and then to peter all dripping still shivering and amazed staring at christ in the sun on the other side of the coalfirethinking a little perhaps of what happened by another coalfire when it was colder and having had no word changed with him by his master since that look of histo him so amazed comes the question simon lovest thou me try to feel that a little and think of it till it is true to you and then take up that infinite monstrosity and hypocrisyraphaels cartoon of the charge to peter note first the bold fallacythe putting all the apostles there a mere lie to serve the papal heresy of the petric supremacy by putting them all in the background while peter receives the charge and making them all witnesses to it note the handsomely curled hair and neatly tied sandals of the men who had been out all night in the seamists and on the slimy decks note their convenient dresses for going afishing with trains that lie a yard along the ground and goodly fringesall made to matchan apostolic fishing costume note how peter especially whose chief glory was in his wet coat girt about him and naked limbs is enveloped in folds and fringes so as to kneel and hold his keys with grace no fire of coals at all nor lonely mountain shore but a pleasant italian landscape full of villas and churches and a flock of sheep to be pointed at and the whole group of apostles not round christ as they would have been naturally but straggling away in a line that they may be shown the simple truth is that the moment we look at the picture we feel our belief of the whole thing taken away there is visibly no possibility of that group even having existed in any place or on any occasion it is all a mere mythic absurdity and faded concoction of fringes muscular arms and curly heads of greek philosophers   78 among the children of god there is always that fearful and bowed apprehension of his majesty and that sacred dread of all offence to him which is called the fear of god yet of real and essential fear there is not any but clinging of confidence to him as their rock fortress and deliverer and perfect love and casting out of fear so that it is not possible that while the mind is rightly bent on him there should be dread of anything earthly or supernatural and the more dreadful seems the height of his majesty the less fear they feel that dwell in the shadow of it of whom shall i be afraid   79 if for every rebuke that we utter of mens vices we put forth a claim upon their hearts if for every assertion of gods demands from them we could substitute a display of his kindness to them if side by side with every warning of death we could exhibit proofs and promises of immortality if in fine instead of assuming the being of an awful deity which men though they cannot and dare not deny are always unwilling sometimes unable to conceive we were to show them a near visible inevitable but all beneficent deity whose presence makes the earth itself a heaven i think there would be fewer deaf children sitting in the marketplace   80 if not by sympathy discovered it is not in words explicable with what divine lines and light the exercise of godliness and charity will mould and gild the hardest and coldest countenance neither to what darkness their departure will consign the loveliest for there is not any virtue the exercise of which even momentarily will not impress a new fairness upon the features   81 the love of the human race is increased by their individual differences and the unity of the creature made perfect by each having something to bestow and to receive bound to the rest by a thousand various necessities and various gratitudes humility in each rejoicing to admire in his fellow that which he finds not in himself and each being in some respect the complement of his race   82 they who are as the angels of god in heaven yet cannot be conceived as so assimilated that their different experiences and affections upon earth shall then be forgotten and effectless the child taken early to his place cannot be imagined to wear there such a body nor to have such thoughts as the glorified apostle who had finished his course and kept the faith on earth and so whatever perfections and likeness of love we may attribute to either the tried or the crowned creatures there is the difference of the stars in glory among them yet differences of original gifts though not of occupying till their lord come different dispensations of trial and of trust of sorrows and support both in their own inward variable hearts and in their positions of exposure or of peace of the gourd shadow and the smiting sun of calling at heat of day or eleventh hour of the house unroofed by faith or the clouds opened by revelation differences in warning in mercies in sickness in signs in time of calling to account alike only they all are by that which is not of them but the gift of gods unchangeable mercy i will give unto this last even as unto thee   83 the desire of rest planted in the heart is no sensual no unworthy one but a longing for renovation and for escape from a state whose every phase is mere preparation for another equally transitory to one in which permanence shall have become possible through perfection hence the great call of christ to men that call on which st augustine fixed as the essential expression of christian hope is accompanied by the promise of rest and the death bequest of christ to men is peace   84 he who has once stood beside the grave to look back upon the companionship which has been for ever closed feeling how impotent there are the wild love and the keen sorrow to give one instants pleasure to the pulseless heart or atone in the lowest measure to the departed spirit for the hour of unkindness will scarcely for the future incur that debt to the heart which can only be discharged to the dust but the lessons which men receive as individuals they do not learn as nations again and again they have seen their noblest descend into the grave and have thought it enough to garland the tombstone when they had not crowned the brow and to pay the honour to the ashes which they had denied to the spirit let it not displease them that they are bidden amidst the tumult and the dazzle of their busy life to listen for the few voices and watch for the few lamps which god has toned and lighted to charm and to guide them that they may not learn their sweetness by their silence nor their light by their decay   85 in the cathedral of lucca near the entrance door of the north transept there is a monument by jacopo della quercia to ilaria di caretto the wife of paolo guinigi i name it not as more beautiful or perfect than other examples of the same period but as furnishing an instance of the exact and right mean between the rigidity and rudeness of the earlier monumental effigies and the morbid imitation of life sleep or death of which the fashion has taken place in modern times she is lying on a simple couch with a hound at her feet not on the side but with the head laid straight and simply on the hard pillow in which let it be observed there is no effort at deceptive imitation of pressureit is understood as a pillow but not mistaken for one the hair is bound in a flat braid over the fair brow the sweet and arched eyes are closed the tenderness of the loving lips is set and quiet there is that about them which forbids breath something which is not death nor sleep but the pure image of both the hands are not lifted in prayer neither folded but the arms are laid at length upon the body and the hands cross as they fall the feet are hidden by the drapery and the form of the limbs concealed but not their tenderness   86 i do not know any district possessing a more pure or uninterrupted fulness of mountain character and that of the highest order or which appears to have been less disturbed by foreign agencies than that which borders the course of the trient between valorsine and martigny the paths which lead to it out of the valley of the rhone rising at first in steep circles among the walnut trees like winding stairs among the pillars of a gothic tower retire over the shoulders of the hills into a valley almost unknown but thickly inhabited by an industrious and patient population along the ridges of the rocks smoothed by old glaciers into long dark billowy swellings like the backs of plunging dolphins the peasant watches the slow colouring of the tufts of moss and roots of herb which little by little gather a feeble soil over the iron substance then supporting the narrow slip of clinging ground with a few stones he subdues it to the spade and in a year or two a little crest of corn is seen waving upon the rocky casque the irregular meadows run in and out like inlets of lake among these harvested rocks sweet with perpetual streamlets that seem always to have chosen the steepest places to come down for the sake of the leaps scattering their handfuls of crystal this way and that as the wind takes them with all the grace but with none of the formalism of fountains dividing into fanciful change of dash and spring yet with the seal of their granite channels upon them as the lightest play of human speech may bear the seal of past toil and closing back out of their spray to lave the rigid angles and brighten with silver fringes and glassy films each lower and lower step of sable stone until at last gathered altogether againexcept perhaps some chance drops caught on the apple blossom where it has budded a little nearer the cascade than it did last springthey find their way down to the turf and lose themselves in that silently with quiet depth of clear water furrowing among the grassblades and looking only like their shadows but presently emerging again in little startled gushes and laughing hurries as if they had remembered suddenly that the day was too short for them to get down the hill green field and glowing rock and glancing streamlet all slope together in the sunshine towards the brows of ravines where the pines take up their own dominion of saddened shade and with everlasting roar in the twilight the stronger torrents thunder down pale from the glaciers filling all the chasms with enchanted cold beating themselves to pieces against the great rocks that they have themselves cast down and forcing fierce way beneath their ghastly poise the mountain paths stoop to those glens in forky zigzags leading to some grey and narrow arch all fringed under its shuddering curve with the ferns that fear the light a cross of roughhewn pine ironbound to its parapet standing dark against the lurid fury of the foam far up the glen as we pause beside the cross the sky is seen through the openings in the pines thin with excess of light and in its clear consuming flame of white space the summits of the rocky mountains are gathered into solemn crowns and circlets all flushed in that strange faint silence of possession by the sunshine which has in it so deep a melancholy full of power yet as frail as shadows lifeless like the walls of a sepulchre yet beautiful in tender fall of crimson folds like the veil of some sea spirit that lives and dies as the foam flashes fixed on a perpetual throne stern against all strength lifted above all sorrows and yet effaced and melted utterly into the air by that last sunbeam that has crossed to them from between the two golden clouds  high above all sorrow yes but not unwitnessing to it the traveller on his happy journey as his foot springs from the deep turf and strikes the pebbles gaily over the edge of the mountain road sees with a glance of delight the clusters of nutbrown cottages that nestle along those sloping orchards and glow beneath the boughs of the pines here it may well seem to him if there be sometimes hardship there must be at least innocence and peace and fellowship of the human soul with nature it is not so the wild goats that leap along those rocks have as much passion of joy in all that fair work of god as the men that toil among themperhaps more enter the street of one of those villages and you will find it foul with that gloomy foulness that is suffered only by torpor or by anguish of soul here it is torpornot absolute sufferingnot starvation or disease but darkness of calm enduring the spring known only as the time of the scythe and the autumn as the time of the sickle and the sun only as a warmth the wind as a chill and the mountains as a danger they do not understand so much as the name of beauty or of knowledge they understand dimly that of virtue love patience hospitality faiththese things they know to glean their meadows side by side so happier to bear the burden up the breathless mountain flank unmurmuringly to bid the stranger drink from their vessel of milk to see at the foot of their low deathbeds a pale figure upon a cross dying also patientlyin this they are different from the cattle and from the stones but in all this unrewarded as far as concerns the present life for them there is neither hope nor passion of spirit for them neither advance nor exultation black bread rude roof dark night laborious day weary arm at sunset and life ebbs away no books no thoughts no attainments no restexcept only sometimes a little sitting in the sun under the church wall as the bell tolls thin and far in the mountain air a pattering of a few prayers not understood by the altarrails of the dimly gilded chapeland so back to the sombre home with the cloud upon them still unbrokenthat cloud of rocky gloom born out of the wild torrents and ruinous stones and unlightened even in their religion except by the vague promise of some better thing unknown mingled with threatening and obscured by an unspeakable horrora smoke as it were of martyrdom coiling up with the incense and amidst the images of tortured bodies and lamenting spirits in hurtling flames the very cross for them dashed more deeply than for others with gouts of blood   87 a highland scene is beyond doubt pleasant enough in its own way but looked close at has its shadows34 here for instance is the very fact of oneas pretty as i can rememberhaving seen many it is a little valley of soft turf enclosed in its narrow oval by jutting rocks and broad flakes of nodding fern from one side of it to the other winds serpentine a clear brown stream drooping into quicker ripple as it reaches the end of the oval field and then first islanding a purple and white rock with an amber pool it dashes away into a narrow fall of foam under a thicket of mountain ash and alder the autumn sun low but clear shines on the scarlet ashberries and on the golden birchleaves which fallen here and there when the breeze has not caught them rest quiet in the crannies of the purple rock beside the rock in the hollow under the thicket the carcase of a ewe drowned in the last flood lies nearly bare to the bone its white ribs protruding through the skin raventorn and the rags of its wool still flickering from the branches that first stayed it as the stream swept it down a little lower the current plunges roaring into a circular chasm like a well surrounded on three sides by a chimneylike hollowness of polished rock down which the foam slips in detached snowflakes round the edges of the pool beneath the water circles slowly like black oil a little butterfly lies on its back the wings glued to one of the eddies its limbs feebly quivering a fish arises and it is gone lower down the stream i can see over a knoll the green and damp turf roofs of four or five hovels built at the edge of a morass which is trodden by the cattle into a black slough of despond at their doors and traversed by a few illset stepping stones with here and there a flat slab on the tops where they have sunk out of sightand at the turn of the brook i see a man fishing with a boy and a doga picturesque and pretty group enough certainly if they had not been there all day starving i know them and i know the dogs ribs also which are nearly as bare as the dead ewes and the childs wasted shoulders cutting his old tartan jacket through so sharp are they  34 passage written to be opposed to an exuberant description by an amiable scottish pastor of everything flattering to scotchmen in the highlands i have put next to it a little study of the sadness of italy   88 perhaps there is no more impressive scene on earth than the solitary extent of the campagna of rome under evening light let the reader imagine himself for a moment withdrawn from the sounds and motion of the living world and sent forth alone into this wild and wasted plain the earth yields and crumbles beneath his foot tread he never so lightly for its substance is white hollow and carious like the dusty wreck of the bones of men the long knotted grass waves and tosses feebly in the evening wind and the shadows of its motion shake feverishly along the banks of ruin that lift themselves to the sunlight hillocks of mouldering earth heave around him as if the dead beneath were struggling in their sleep scattered blocks of black stone foursquare remnants of mighty edifices not one left upon another lie upon them to keep them down a dull purple poisonous haze stretches level along the desert veiling its spectral wrecks of massy ruins on whose rents the red light rests like dying fire on defiled altars the blue ridge of the alban mount lifts itself against a solemn space of green clear quiet sky watchtowers of dark clouds stand steadfastly along the promontories of the apennines from the plain to the mountains the shattered aqueducts pier beyond pier melt into the darkness like shadowy and countless troops of funeral mourners passing from a nations grave   89 i was coming down one evening from the rochers de naye above montreux having been at work among the limestone rocks where i could get no water and both weary and thirsty coming to a spring at the turn of the path conducted as usual by the herdsmen into a hollowed pine trunk i stooped to it and drank deeply as i raised my head drawing breath heavily some one behind me said celui qui boira de cette eauci aura encore soif i turned not understanding for a moment what was meant and saw one of the hill peasants probably returning to his châlet from the market place at vevay or villeneuve as i looked at him with an uncomprehending expression he went on with the verse mais celui qui boira de leau que je lui donnerai naura jamais soif   90 it may perhaps be permitted me35 to mark the significance of the earliest mention of mountains in the mosaic books at least of those in which some divine appointment or command is stated respecting them they are first brought before us as refuges for gods people from the two judgments of water and fire the ark rests upon the mountains of ararat and man having passed through the great baptism unto death kneels upon the earth first where it is nearest heaven and mingles with the mountain clouds the smoke of his sacrifice of thanksgiving again from the midst of the first judgment by fire the command of the deity to his servant is escape to the mountain and the morbid fear of the hills which fills any human mind after long stay in places of luxury and sin is strangely marked in lots complaining reply i cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me the third mention in way of ordinance is a far more solemn one abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off the place the mountain of myrrh or of bitterness chosen to fulfil to all the seed of abraham far off and near the inner meaning of promise regarded in that vow i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh mine help and the fourth is the delivery of the law on sinai it seemed then to the monks that the mountains were appointed by their maker to be to man refuges from judgment signs of redemption and altars of sanctification and obedience and they saw them afterwards connected in the manner the most touching and gracious with the death after his task had been accomplished of the first anointed priest the death in like manner of the first inspired lawgiver and lastly with the assumption of his office by the eternal priest lawgiver and saviour  35 with reference to the choice of mountain dwellings by the greater monastic orders  observe the connection of these three events although the time of the deaths of aaron and moses was hastened by gods displeasure we have not it seems to me the slightest warrant for concluding that the manner of their deaths was intended to be grievous or dishonourable to them far from this it cannot i think be doubted that in the denial of the permission to enter the promised land the whole punishment of their sin was included and that as far as regarded the manner of their deaths it must have been appointed for them by their master in all tenderness and love and with the full purpose of ennobling the close of their service upon the earth it might have seemed to us more honourable that both should have been permitted to die beneath the shadow of the tabernacle the congregation of israel watching by their side and all whom they loved gathered together to receive the last message from the lips of the meek lawgiver and the last blessing from the prayer of the anointed priest but it was not thus they were permitted to die try to realize that going forth of aaron from the midst of the congregation he who had so often done sacrifice for their sin going forth now to offer up his own spirit he who had stood among them between the dead and the living and had seen the eyes of all that great multitude turned to him that by his intercession their breath might yet be drawn a moment more going forth now to meet the angel of death face to face and deliver himself into his hand try if you cannot walk in thought with those two brothers and the son as they passed the outmost tents of israel and turned while yet the dew lay round about the camp towards the slopes of mount hor talking together for the last time as step by step they felt the steeper rising of the rocks and hour after hour beneath the ascending sun the horizon grew broader as they climbed and all the folded hills of idumea one by one subdued showed amidst their hollows in the haze of noon the windings of that long desert journey now at last to close but who shall enter into the thoughts of the high priest as his eye followed those paths of ancient pilgrimage and through the silence of the arid and endless hills stretching even to the dim peak of sinai the whole history of those forty years was unfolded before him and the mystery of his own ministries revealed to him and that other holy of holies of which the mountain peaks were the altars and the mountain clouds the veil the firmament of his fathers dwelling opened to him still more brightly and infinitely as he drew nearer his deathuntil at last on the shadeless summit from him on whom sin was to be laid no more from him on whose heart the names of sinful nations were to press their graven fire no longer the brother and the son took breastplate and ephod and left him to his rest there is indeed a secretness in this calm faith and deep restraint of sorrow into which it is difficult for us to enter but the death of moses himself is more easily to be conceived and had in it circumstances still more touching as regards the influence of the external scene for forty years moses had not been alone the care and burden of all the people the weight of their woe and guilt and death had been upon him continually the multitude had been laid upon him as if he had conceived them their tears had been his meat night and day until he had felt as if god had withdrawn his favour from him and he had prayed that he might be slain and not see his wretchedness and now at last the command came get thee up into this mountain the weary hands that had been so long stayed up against the enemies of israel might lean again upon the shepherds staff and fold themselves for the shepherds prayerfor the shepherds slumber not strange to his feet though forty years unknown the roughness of the bare mountain path as he climbed from ledge to ledge of abarim not strange to his aged eyes the scattered clusters of the mountain herbage and the broken shadows of the cliffs indented far across the silence of uninhabited ravines scenes such as those among which as now with none beside him but god he had led his flocks so often and which he had left how painfully taking upon him the appointed power to make of the fenced city a wilderness and to fill the desert with songs of deliverance it was not to embitter the last hours of his life that god restored to him for a day the beloved solitudes he had lost and breathed the peace of the perpetual hills around him and cast the world in which he had laboured and sinned far beneath his feet in that mist of dying blueall sin all wandering soon to be forgotten for ever the dead seaa type of gods anger understood by him of all men most clearly who had seen the earth open her mouth and the sea his depth to overwhelm the companies of those who contended with his masterlaid waveless beneath him and beyond it the fair hills of judah and the soft plains and banks of jordan purple in the evening light as with the blood of redemption and fading in their distant fulness into mysteries of promise and of love there with his unabated strength his undimmed glance lying down upon the utmost rocks with angels waiting near to contend for the spoils of his spirit he put off his earthly armour we do deep reverence to his companion prophet for whom the chariot of fire came down from heaven but was his death less noble whom his lord himself buried in the vales of moab keeping in the secrets of the eternal counsels the knowledge of a sepulchre from which he was to be called in the fulness of time to talk with that lord upon hermon of the death that he should accomplish at jerusalem  and lastly let us turn our thoughts for a few moments to the cause of the resurrection of these two prophets we are all of us too much in the habit of passing it by as a thing mystical and inconceivable taking place in the life of christ for some purpose not by us to be understood or at the best merely as a manifestation of his divinity by brightness of heavenly light and the ministering of the spirits of the dead intended to strengthen the faith of his three chosen apostles and in this as in many other events recorded by the evangelists we lose half the meaning and evade the practical power upon ourselves by never accepting in its fulness the idea that our lord was perfect mantempted in all things like as we are our preachers are continually trying in all manner of subtle ways to explain the union of the divinity with the manhoodan explanation which certainly involves first their being able to describe the nature of deity itself or in plain words to comprehend god they never can explain in any one particular the union of the natures they only succeed in weakening the faith of their hearers as to the entireness of either the thing they have to do is precisely the contrary of thisto insist upon the entireness of both we never think of christ enough as god never enough as man the instinctive habit of our minds being always to miss of the divinity and the reasoning and enforced habit to miss of the humanity we are afraid to harbour in our own hearts or to utter in the hearing of others any thought of our lord as hungering tired sorrowful having a human soul a human will and affected by events of human life as a finite creature is and yet one half of the efficiency of his atonement and the whole of the efficiency of his example depend on his having been this to the full consider therefore the transfiguration as it relates to the human feelings of our lord it was the first definite preparation for his death he had foretold it to his disciples six days before then takes with him the three chosen ones into an high mountain apart from an exceeding high mountain at the first taking on him the ministry of life he had beheld and rejected the kingdoms of the earth and their glory now on a high mountain he takes upon him the ministry of death peter and they that were with him as in gethsemane were heavy with sleep christs work had to be done alone  the tradition is that the mount of transfiguration was the summit of tabor but tabor is neither a high mountain nor was it in any sense a mountain apart being in those years both inhabited and fortified all the immediately preceding ministries of christ had been at cesarea philippi there is no mention of travel southward in the six days that intervened between the warning given to his disciples and the going up into the hill what other hill could it be than the southward slope of that goodly mountain hermon which is indeed the centre of all the promised land from the entering in of hamath unto the river of egypt the mount of fruitfulness from which the springs of jordan descended to the valleys of israel along its mighty forest avenues until the grass grew fair with the mountain lilies his feet dashed in the dew of hermon he must have gone to pray his first recorded prayer about death and from the steep of it before he knelt could see to the south all the dwellings of the people that had sat in darkness and seen the great light the land of zabulon and of naphtali galilee of the nationscould see even with his human sight the gleam of that lake by capernaum and chorazin and many a place loved by him and vainly ministered to whose house was now left unto them desolate and chief of all far in the utmost blue the hills above nazareth sloping down to his old home hills on which yet the stones lay loose that had been taken up to cast at him when he left them for ever  and as he prayed two men stood by him among the many ways in which we miss the help and hold of scripture none is more subtle than our habit of supposing that even as man christ was free from the fear of death how could he then have been tempted as we aresince among all the trials of the earth none spring from the dust more terrible than that fear it had to be borne by him indeed in a unity which we can never comprehend with the foreknowledge of victoryas his sorrow for lazarus with the consciousness of his power to restore him but it had to be borne and that in its full earthly terror and the presence of it is surely marked for us enough by the rising of those two at his side when in the desert he was girding himself for the work of life angels of life came and ministered to him now in the fair world when he is girding himself for the work of death the ministrants come to him from the grave but from the grave conquered one from that tomb under abarim which his own hand had sealed long ago the other from the rest into which he had entered without seeing corruption there stood by him moses and elias and spake of his decease then when the prayer is ended the task accepted first since the star paused over him at bethlehem the full glory falls upon him from heaven and the testimony is borne to his everlasting sonship and power hear ye him  if in their remembrance of these things and in their endeavour to follow in the footsteps of their master religious men of bygone days closing themselves in the hill solitudes forgot sometimes and sometimes feared the duties they owed to the active world we may perhaps pardon them more easily than we ought to pardon ourselves if we neither seek any influence for good nor submit to it unsought in scenes to which thus all the men whose writings we receive as inspired together with their lord retired whenever they had any task or trial laid upon them needing more than their usual strength of spirit nor perhaps should we have unprofitably entered into the mind of the earlier ages if among our other thoughts as we watch the chains of the snowy mountains rise on the horizon we should sometimes admit the memory of the hour in which their creator among their solitudes entered on his travail for the salvation of our race and indulge the dream that as the flaming and trembling mountains of the earth seem to be the monuments of the manifesting of his terror on sinai these pure and white hills near to the heaven and sources of all good to the earth are the appointed memorials of that light of his mercy that fell snowlike on the mount of transfiguration   finis  printed by
