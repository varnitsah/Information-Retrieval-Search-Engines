88716099	the plays of j m barrie  alice sitbythefire      i  one would like to peep covertly into amys diary octavo with the word amy in gold letters wandering across the soft brown leather covers as if it was a long word and in amys opinion rather a dear to take such a liberty and allow the reader to look over our shoulders as they often invite you to do in novels which however are much more coquettish things than plays would be very helpful to us we should learn at once what sort of girl amy is and why today finds her washing her hair we should also get proof or otherwise that we are interpreting her aright for it is our desire not to record our feelings about amy but merely amys feelings about herself not to tell what we think happened but what amy thought happened the book to be sure is padlocked but we happen to know where it is kept in the lower drawer of that handpainted escritoire sometimes in the night amy waking up wonders whether she did lock her diary and steals downstairs in white to make sure on these occasions she undoubtedly lingers among the pages rereading the peculiarly delightful bit she wrote yesterday so we could peep over her shoulder while the reader peeps over ours then why dont we do it is it because this would be a form of eavesdropping and that we cannot be sure our hands are clean enough to turn the pages of a young girls thoughts it cannot be that because the novelists do it it is because in a play we must tell nothing that is not revealed by the spoken words you must find out all you want to know from them there is no weather even in plays nowadays except in melodrama the novelist can have sixteen chapters about the heros grandparents but we cannot even say he had any unless he says it himself there can be no rummaging in the past for us to show what sort of people our characters are we are allowed only to present them as they toe the mark then the handkerchief falls and off they go  so now we know why we must not spy into amys diary perhaps we have not always been such sticklers for the etiquette of the thing but we are always sticklers on thursdays and this is a thursday  as you are to be shown amys room we are permitted to describe it though not to tell which would be much more interesting why a girl of seventeen has as her very own the chief room of a house the moment you open the door of this room and please you are not to look consciously at the escritoire as if you knew the diary was in it you are aware though amy may not be visible that there is an uncommonly clever girl in the house the door does not always open easily because attached thereto is a curtain which frequently catches in it and this curtain is handsewn extinct animals indeed a gifted womans touch is everywhere if you are not handsewn you are almost certainly handpainted but incompletely for amy in her pursuit of the arts has often to drop one in order to keep pace with another some of the chairs have escaped as yet but their time will come the tablecover and the curtains are of a lovely pink perforated ingeniously with many tiny holes which when you consider them against a dark background gradually assume the appearance of something pictorial such as a basket of odd flowers the fender stool is in brown velvet and there are words on it that invite you to sit down some of the letters of this message have been burned away there are artistic white bookshelves hanging lopsidedly here and there and they also have pink curtains no larger than a dolls garments these little curtains are for covering the parts where there are no books as yet the pictures on the walls are mostly studies done at school and include the wellknown windmill and the equally popular old lady by the shore their frames are of fircones glued together or of straws which have gone limp and droop like streaks of macaroni there is a cosy corner also a milkingstool but no cow the lampshades have had ribbons added to them and from a distance look like ladies of the ballet the flowerpot also is in a skirt near the door is a large screen such as people hide behind in the more ordinary sort of play it will be interesting to see whether we can resist the temptation to hide some one behind it  a few common weeds rear their profane heads in this innocent garden for instance a cruetstand a basket of cutlery and a triangular dish of the kind in which the correct confine cheese they have not strayed here they live here indeed this is among other things the dining room of a modest little house in brompton made beautiful or nearly so by a girl who has a soul above food and conceals its accessories as far as possible from view in drawers even in the wastepaper basket not a dish not a spoon not a fork is handpainted a sufficient indication of her contempt for them  amy is present but is not seen to the best advantage for she has been washing her hair and is now drying it by the fire notable among her garments are a dressingjacket and a towel and her head is bent so far back over the fire that we see her face nearly upsidedown this is no position in which we can do justice to her undoubted facial charm seated near her is her brother cosmo a boy of thirteen in naval uniform cosmo is a cadet at osborne and properly proud of his station but just now he looks proud of nothing he is plunged in gloom the cause of his woe is a telegram which he is regarding from all points of the compass as if in hopes of making it send him better news at last he gives expression to his feelings all i can say he sums up in the first words of the play is that if father tries to kiss me i shall kick him  if amy makes any reply the words arrive upsidedown and are unintelligible the maid announces miss dunbar then amy rises brings her head to the position in which they are usually carried and she and ginevra look into each others eyes they always do this when they meet though they meet several times a day and it is worth doing for what they see in those pellucid pools is love eternal thus they loved at school in their last two terms and thus they will love till the grave encloses them these thoughts and others even more beautiful are in their minds as they gaze at each other now no man will ever be able to say amy or to say ginevra with such a trill as they are saying it  ginevra my beloved  my amy my better self  my other me  there is something almost painful in love like this  are you well ginevra  quite well amy  heavens the joy of amy because ginevra is quite well  how did my amy sleep  i had a good night  how happy is ginevra because amy has had a good night all this time they have been slowly approaching each other drawn by a power stronger than themselves their intention is to kiss they do so cosmo snorts and betakes himself to some other room his bedroom probably where a man may be alone with mannish things his razor for instance the maidens do not resent his rudeness they know that poor cosmos time will come and they are glad to be alone for they have much to say that is for no other mortal ears some of it is sure to go into the diary indeed if we were to put our ear to the drawer where the diary is we could probably hear its little heart ticking in unison with theirs  it is ginevra who speaks first she is indeed the bolder of the two she grips amys hand and says quite firmly amy shall we go to another tonight this does not puzzle amy she is prepared for it her honest grey eyes even tell that she has wanted it but now that it is come she quails a little another theatre she murmurs ginevra that would be five in one week  ginevra does not blanch yes she says recklessly but it is also only eight in seventeen years  isnt it says amy comforted and they have taught us so much havent they until monday dear when we went to our first real play we didnt know what life is  we were two raw unbleached schoolgirls amyabsolutely unbleached  it is such a phrase as this that gives ginevra the moral ascendancy in their discussions  of course amy ventures looking perhaps a little unbleached even now of course i had my diary dear and i do think that even before monday there were things in it of a not wholly ordinary kind  nothing persists ginevra cruelly that necessitated your keeping it locked  no i suppose not sadly enough you are quite right ginevra but we have made up for lost time every night since monday including the matinee has been a revelation  she closes her eyes so that she may see the revelations more clearly so does ginevra  amy that heartgripping scene when the lovemaddened woman visited the man in his chambers  she wasnt absolutely lovemaddened ginevra she really loved her husband best all the time  not till the last act darling  please dont say it ginevra she was most foolish especially in the crepe de chine but we know that she only went to the mans chambers to get back her letters how i trembled for her then  i was strangely calm says ginevra the stony hearted  oh ginevra i had such a presentiment that the husband would call at those chambers while she was there and he did ginevra you remember his knock upon the door surely you trembled then  ginevra knits her lips triumphantly  not even then amy somehow i felt sure that in the nick of time her lady friend would step out from somewhere and say that the letters were hers  nobly compromising herself ginevra  amy how i love that bit where she says so unexpectedly with noble selfrenunciation he is my affianced husband  isnt it glorious strange ginevra that it happened in each play  that was because we always went to the thinking theatres amy real plays are always about a lady and two men and alas only one of them is her husband that is life you know it is called the odd odd triangle  yes i know appealingly ginevra i hope it wasnt wrong of me to go a month ago i was only a schoolgirl  we both were  yes but you are now an art student in lodgings with a latchkey of your own you have no one dependent on you while i have a brother and sister toto form  you must leave it to the navy dear to form cosmo if it can and as the sister is only a baby time enough to form her when she can exit from her pram  i am in a mothers place for the time being ginevra  even mothers go to thinking theatres  whether mine does ginevra i dont even know this is a very strange position i am in awaiting the return from india of parents i have not seen since i was twelve years old i dont even know if they will like the house the rent is what they told me to give but perhaps my scheme of decoration wont appeal to them they may think my housekeeping has been defective and may not make allowance for my being so new to it  ginevra takes amy in her arms my ownest amy if they are not both on their knees to you for the noble way in which you have striven to prepare this house for them  darling ginevra all i ask is to be allowed to do my duty  listen then amy your duty is to be able to help your parents in every way when they return your mother having been so long in india can know little about life how sweet then for you to be able to place your knowledge at her feet  i had thought of that dearest  then amy it would be simply wrong of us not to go to another theatre tonight i have three and ninepence so that if you can scrape together one and threepence  generous girl it cant be  why not amy  the return of cosmo handling the telegram more pugnaciously than ever provides the answer  cosmo show miss dunbar the telegram  miss dunbar reads boat arrived southampton this morning  a day earlier than they expected amy explains  its the other bit i am worrying about cosmo says darkly the other bit proves to be hope to reach our pets this afternoon kisses from both to all deliriously excited mummy and dad  now we see why cosmo has been in distress  pets kisses he cries what can the telegraph people think  surely amy says you want to kiss your mother  im going to kiss her he replies stoutly i mean to do it its father i am worrying about with his kisses to both from all all i can say is that if father comes slobbering over me ill surprise him  here the outer door slams and the three start to their feet as if philippi had dawned to cosmo the slam sounds uncommonly like a fathers kiss he immediately begins to rehearse the greeting which is meant to ward off the fatal blow how are you father im glad to see you father its a long journey from india wont you sit down  amy is the first to recover how silly of us she says it is only nurse with baby  presumably what we hear is a perambulator backing into its stall in the passage then nurse is distinctly heard in the adjoining room and we may gather that this is for the nonce the nursery of the house though to most occupants it would be the back diningroom there is a door between the two rooms and cosmo peeping through a chink in it sounds to his fellowconspirators the alls well  poor nurse amy says with a kind sigh i suppose i had better show her the telegram she is sure to cry she looks upon mother as a thief who has come to steal baby from her  ginevra wags her head to indicate that this is another slice of life and nurse being called in is confronted with the telegram she runs a gamut of emotion without words implies that she is nobody and must submit nods humbly sets her teeth is both indignant and servile and finally bursts into tears amy tries to comfort her but gets this terrible answer theyll be bringing a black woman to nurse hera yahyah they call them  amy signs to ginevra and ginevra signs to amy these two souls perfectly understand each other and the telegraphy means that it will be better for dear ginevra to retire for a time to dear amys sweet little bedroom amy slips the diary into the hand of ginevra who pops upstairs with it to read the latest instalment nurse rambles on i have had her for seventeen months she was just two months old the angel when they sent her to england and she has been mine ever since the most of them has one look for their mammas and one look for their nurse but she knew no better than to have both looks for me she returns to the nursery wailing my reign is over  do you think molly will chuck nurse for mother asks cosmo to whom this is a new thought  it is the way of children the more experienced amy tells him  shabby little beasts the man says  you mustnt say that cosmo but still it is hard on nurse of course with swimming eyes in a sense its hard on all of usi mean to be expecting parents in these circumstances there must be almost the same feeling of strangeness in the house as when it is a baby that is expected  i suppose it is a bit like that cosmo says gloomily he goes to her as the awfulness of this sinks into him great scott amy it cant be quite so bad as that  amy who is of a very affectionate nature is glad to have the comfort of his hand  what do we really know about mother cosmo she says darkly  they are perhaps a touching pair  there are her letters amy  can one know a person by letters does she know you cosmo by your letters to her saying that your motto is something attempted something done to earn a nights repose and so on  well i thought that would please her  perhaps in her letters she says things just to please us  cosmo wriggles  this is pretty low of you damping a fellow when he was trying to make the best of it  all i want you to feel amy says getting closer to him is that as brother and sister we are allies you knowagainst the unknown  yes amy cosmo says and gets closer to her  this so encourages her that she hastens to call him dear  i want to say dear that im very sorry i used to shirk bowling to you  thats nothing i know what girls are amy its all right i really am fond of you  i have tried to be a sort of mother to you cosmo  my socks and thingsi know returning anxiously to the greater question amy do we know anything of them at all  we know some cold facts of course we know that father is much older than mother  i cant understand why such an old chap should be so keen to kiss me  mother is forty amy says in a low voice  i thought she was almost more than forty cosmo says in a still lower voice  amy shudders dont be so ungenerous cosmo but she has to add of course we must be prepared to see her look older  why  she will be rather yellow coming from india you know they will both be a little yellow  they exchange forlorn glances but cosmo says manfully we shant be any the less fond of them for that amy  no indeed  they clasp hands on it and cosmo has an inspiration  do you think we should have these yellow flowers in the room they might feeleh  how thoughtful of you dear i shall remove them at once after all cosmo we seem to know a good deal about them and then we know some other things by heredity  heredity thats drink isnt it  she who has been to so many theatres smiles at him no you boy its something in a play it means that if we know ourselves well we know our parents also from thinking of myself cosmo i know mother in her youth she was one who did not love easily but when she loved once it was for aye a nature very difficult to understand but profoundly interesting i can feel her within me as she was when she walked down the aisle on that strong arm to honour and obey him henceforth for aye what cared they that they had to leave their native land they were together for aye and so her face is flushed cosmo interrupts selfishly  what about father  very nice unless you mention rupees to him you see the pensions of all indian officers are paid in rupees which means that for every 2s due to them they get only 1s 4d if you mention rupees to any one of them he flares up like a burning paper  i know i shall take care but what would you say he was like by heredity  quiet unassuming yet of an intensely proud nature one who if he was deceived would never face his fellowcreatures but would bow his head before the wind and die a strong man  do you mean amy that he takes all that from me  i mean that is the sort of man my mother would love  cosmo nods yes but he is just as likely to kiss me as ever  the return of ginevra makes him feel that this room is no place for him  i think he says ill go and walk up and down outside and have a look at them as theyre getting out of the cab my plan you see is first to kiss mother then ive made up four things to say to father and its after ive said them that the awkward time will come so then i say i wonder what is in the evening papers and out i slip and when i come back you will all have settled down to ordinary life same as other people thats my plan he goes off not without hope and ginevra shrugs her shoulders forgivingly  how strange boys are she reflects have you any plan amy  only this dear ginevra to leap into my mothers arms  ginevra lifts what can only be called a trouser leg because that is what it is though they are very seldom seen alone what is this my busy bee is making  its a gentlemans leg amy explains not without a sweet blush you handsew them and stretch them over a tin cylinder and they are then used as umbrella stands art in the home says they are all the rage  oh amy boudoir gossip says they have quite gone out  again every art decoration i try goes out before i have time to finish it  she remembers the diary  did my ginevra like my new page  dearest that is what i came down to speak about you forgot to give me the key  ginevra can you ever forgive me let us go up and read it together  with arms locked they seek the seclusion of amys bedroom cosmo rushes in to tell them that there is a suspiciouslooking cab coming down the street but finding the room empty he departs again to reconnoitre a cab draws up a bell rings and soon we hear the voice of colonel grey he can talk coherently to fanny he can lend a hand in dumping down his luggage in the passage he can select from a handful of silver wherewith to pay his cabman all impossible deeds to his alice who would drop the luggage on your toes and cast all the silver at your face rather than be kept another minute from her darlings where are they she has evidently cried just before we see her and fanny has made a heartless response for it is a dejected alice that appears in the doorway of the room  all out she echoes wofully eveneven baby  yes maam  the poor mother who had entered the house like a whirlwind subsides into a chair her arms fall empty by her side a moment ago she had six of them a pair for each child she cries a little and when alice cries which is not often for she is more given to laughter her face screws up like mollys rather than like amys she is very unlike the sketch of her lately made by the united fancies of her son and daughter and she will dance them round the room many times before they know her better amy will never be so pretty as her mother cosmo will never be so gay and it will be years before either of them is as young but it is quite a minute before we suspect this we must look the other way while the colonel dries her tears he is quite a grizzled veteran and is trying hard to pretend that having done without his children for so many years a few minutes more is no great matter his adorable alice is this mans one joke some of those furrows in his brow have come from trying to understand her he owes the agility of his mind to trying to keep up with her the humorous twist in his mouth is the result of chuckling over her  she flutters across the room robert she says thrilling i daresay my amy painted that table  yes maam she did says fanny  robert amys table  yes but keep cool memsahib  i suppose maam im to take my orders from you now the hardhearted fanny inquires  i suppose so alice says so timidly that fanny is encouraged to be bold  the poor miss it will be a bit trying for her just at first  alice is taken aback  i hadnt thought of that robert  robert thinks it time to take command  fiddlededee bring your mistress a cup of tea my girl  yes sir here is the teacaddy maam i cant take the responsibility but this is the key  robert alice says falteringly i darent break into amys caddy she mightnt like it i can wait  rubbish give me the key even fanny cannot but admire the colonel as he breaks into the caddy  that makes me feel im master of my own house already dont stare at me girl as if i was a housebreaker  i feel that is just what we both are his wife says but as soon as they are alone she cries its home home india done home begun  he is as glad as she  home memsahib and weve never had a real one before thank god im able to give it you at last  she darts impulsively from one object in the room to another  look these pictures im sure they are all amys work they are splendid with perhaps a moments misgiving arent they  i couldnt have done them the colonel says guardedly he considers the handpainted curtains she seems to have stopped everything in the middle still i couldnt have done them i expect this is what is called a cosy corner  but alice has found something more precious she utters little cries of rapture  what is it  oh robert a babys shoe my baby she presses it to her as if it were a dove then she is appalled robert if i had met my baby coming along the street i shouldnt have known her from other peoples babies  yes you would the colonel says hurriedly dont break down now just think alice after today you will know your baby anywhere  oh joy joy joy  then the expression of her face changes to oh woe woe woe  what is it now alice  perhaps she wont like me  impossible  perhaps none of them will like me  my dear alice children always love their mother whether they see much of her or not its an instinct  who told you that  you goose it was yourself  ive lost faith in it  he thinks it wise to sound a warning note of course you must give them a little time  robert robert not another minute thats not the way people ever love me they mustnt think me over first or anything of that sort if they do im lost they must love me at once  a good many have done that robert says surveying her quizzically as if she were one of amys incompleted works  you are not implying robert that i ever if i ever did i always told you about it afterwards didnt i and i certainly never did it until i was sure you were comfortable  you always wrapped me up first he admits  they were only boys robertpoor lonely boys what are you looking so solemn about robert  i was trying to picture you as you will be when you settle down  she is properly abashed not settled down yetwith a girl nearly grown up and yet its true its the tragedy of alice grey she pulls his hair oh husband when shall i settle down  i can tell you exactlyin a year from today alice when i took you away to that humdrummy indian station i was already quite a middleaged bloke i chuckled over your gaiety but it gave me lumbago to try to be gay with you poor old girl you were like an only child who has to play alone when for one month in the twelve we went totowhere the boys were it was like turning you loose in a sweetstuff shop  robert darling what nonsense you do talk  he makes rather a wry face i didnt always like it memsahib but i knew my dear and could trust her and i often swore to myself when i was shaving i wont ask her to settle down until i have given her a year in england a year from today you harumscarum by that time your daughter will be almost grownup herself and it wouldnt do to let her pass you  robert here is an idea she and i shall come of age together i promise or i shall try to keep one day in front of her like the schoolmistresses when they are teaching boys latin dearest you havent been disappointed in me as a whole have you i havent paid you for all your dear kindnesses to mein rupees have i  his answer is of no consequence for at this moment there arrives a direct message from heaven it comes by way of the nursery and is a childs cry the heart of alice grey stops beating for several seconds then it says my molly the nurse appears starts and is at once on the defensive  nurse is itmrs grey  alice hastily yes is mychild in there  nurse yes maam  colonel ready to catch her if she falls alice be calm  alice falteringly may i go in nurse  nurse coldheartedly shes sleeping maam and i have made it a rule to let her wake up naturally but i daresay its a bad rule  alice her hands on her heart im sure its a good rule i shant wake her nurse  colonel showing the stuff he is made of gad i will its the least she can do to let herself be wakened  alice admiring the effrontery of the man dont interfere robert  colonel sleeping why she cried just now  nurse that is why i came outto see who was making so much noise  an implacable woman this and yet when she is alone with molly a very bundle of delight  im vexed when she criesi daresay its oldfashioned of me not being a yahyah im at a disadvantage  alice swelling after all she is my child  colonel firmly come along alice  alice i would prefer to go alone dear  colonel all right but break it to her that im kicking my heels outside  alice gets as far as the door the nurse discharges a last duty  nurse you wont touch her maam she doesnt like to be touched by strangers  alice strangers  colonel really nurse  alice its quite true  nurse shes an angel if you have the right way with her  alice robert if i shouldnt have the right way with her  colonel you  but the woman has scored again  alice willing to go on her knees nurse what sort of a way does she like from strangers  nurse shes not fond of a canoodlin way  alice faintly is she not  she departs to face her child and the natural enemy follows her after giving colonel grey a moment in which to discharge her if he dares that is if he wishes to see his baby wither and die one may as well say here that nurse weathered this and many another gale and remained in the house for many years to be its comfort and its curse  fanny with the teatray comes and goes without the colonels being aware of her presence he merely knows that he has waved someone away the fact is that the colonel is engrossed in a rather undignified pursuit he is listening avidly at the nursery door and is thus discovered by another member of his family who has entered cautiously this is master cosmo who observing the teatray has the happy notion of interposing it between himself and his fathers possible osculatory intentions he lifts the tray and thus armed introduces himself  cosmo hullo father  his father leaves the door and strides to him  colonel is itits cosmo  cosmo with the tray well to the fore im awfully glad to see youits a long way from india  colonel put that down my boy and let me get hold of you  cosmo ingratiatingly have some tea father  colonel put it down  cosmo does so and prepares for the worst the colonel takes both his hands  lets have a look at you so this is you  he waggles his head wellpleased while cosmo backs in a gentlemanly manner  cosmo implying that this first meeting is now an affair of the past has mother gone to lie down  colonel lie down shes in there  cosmo steals to the nursery door and softly closes it  why do you do that  cosmo i dont know i thought it would bebest in a burst of candour this is not the way i planned it you see  colonel our meeting so youve been planning it my dear fellow i was planning it too and my plan he is certainly coming closer  cosmo hurriedly yes i know now thats overour first meeting i mean now we settle down  colonel not yet come here my boy  he draws him to a chair he evidently thinks that a father and his boy of thirteen can sit in the same chair cosmo is burning to be nice to him but of course there are limits  cosmo look here father of course you seeways change i daresay they did it when you were a boy but it isnt done now  colonel what isnt done you dear fellow  cosmo ohwelland then taking both hands and saying dear fellowits gone out you know  the colonel chuckles and forbears im uncommon glad you told me cosmo not having been a father for so long you see im rather raw at it  cosmo relieved thats all right youll soon get the hang of it  colonel if you could give me any other tips  cosmo becoming confidential well theres my beastly name of course you didnt mean any harm when you christened me cosmo buti always sign myself c greyto make the fellows think im charles  colonel do they call you that  cosmo lord no they call me grey  colonel and do you want me to call you grey  cosmo magnanimously no i dont expect that but i thought that before people you know you neednt call me anything if you want to attract my attention you could just say hstlike that  colonel right you are but you wont make your mother call you hst  cosmo sagaciously oh noof course women are different  colonel youll be very nice to her cosmo she had to pinch and save more than i should have allowedto be able to send you into the navy we are poor people you know  cosmo ive been planning how to be nice to her  colonel good lad good lad  cosmo remembers his conversation with amy and thoughtfully hides the yellow flowers behind a photograph this may be called one of his plans for being nice to mother  cosmo you dont have your medals here father  colonel no i dont carry them about but your mother does the goose they are not very grand ones cosmo  cosmo true blue yes they are  an awkward silence falls the colonel has so much to say that he can only look it he looks it so eloquently that cosmos fears return he summons the plan to his help  i wonder what is in the evening papers if you dont mind ill cut out and get one  before he can cut out however alice is in the room the picture of distress no wonder for even we can hear the baby howling  alice tragically my baby robert listen that is how i affect her  cosmo cowers unseen  colonel no no darling it isnt you who have made her cry sheshe is teething its her teeth isnt it he barks at the nurse who emerges looking not altogether woeful say its her teeth woman  nurse taking this as a reflection on her charge she had her teeth long ago  alice the forlorn the better to bite me with  nurse complacently i dont understand it she is usually the besttempered lambas you may see for yourself sir  it is an imitation that the colonel is eager to accept but after one step toward the nursery he is true to alice  colonel i decline to see her i refuse to have anything to do with her till she comes to a more reasonable frame of mind  the nurse retires to convey possibly this ultimatum to her charge  alice in the noblest spirit of selfabnegation go robert perhaps shewill like you better  colonel shes a contemptible child  but that nursery door does draw him strongly he finds himself getting nearer and nearer to it ill show her with a happy pretence that his object is merely to enforce discipline the forgotten cosmo pops up again the colonel introduces him with a gesture and darts off to his baby  alice entranced my son  cosmo forgetting all plans mother she envelops him in her arms worshipping him and he likes it  alice oh cosmohow splendid you are  cosmo soothingly thats all right mother  alice say it again  cosmo thats all right  alice no the other word  cosmo mother  alice again  cosmo mothermother when she has come to are you better now  alice he is my son and he is in uniform  cosmo aware that allowances must be made yes i know  alice are you glad to see your mother cosmo  cosmo rather will you have some tea  alice no no i feel i can do nothing for the rest of my life but hug my glorious boy  cosmo of course i have my work  alice his work do the officers love you cosmo  cosmo degraded love me i should think not  alice i should like to ask them all to come and stay with us  cosmo appalled great scott mother you cant do things like that  alice cant i are you very studious cosmo  cosmo neatly my favourite authors are william shakespeare and william milton they are grand dont you think  alice im only a woman you see and im afraid they sometimes bore me especially william milton  cosmo with relief do they me too  alice on the verge of tears again but not half so much as i bore my baby  cosmo anxious to help her what did you do to her  alice appealingly i couldnt help wanting to hold her in my arms could i cosmo  cosmo full of consideration no of course you couldnt he reflects how did you take hold of her  alice i suppose in some clumsy way  cosmo not like this was it  alice gloomily i dare say  cosmo you should have done it this way  he very kindly shows her how to carry a baby  alice with becoming humility thank you cosmo  he does not observe the gleam in her eye and is in the high good humour that comes to any man when any woman asks him to show her how to do anything  cosmo if you like ill show you with a cushion you see thisscoops it upis wrong but thishe does a little sleight of handis right another way is this with their head hanging over your shoulder and you holding on firmly to their legs you wouldnt think it was comfortable but they like it  alice adoring him i see cosmo she practises diligently with the cushion first this waythen this  cosmo thats firstclass its just a knack youll soon pick it up  alice practising on him instead of the cushion you darling boy  cosmo i think i hear a boy calling the evening papers  alice clinging to him dont go there can be nothing in the evening papers about what my boy thinks of his mother  cosmo good lord no he thinks quickly you havent seen amy yet it isnt fair of amy she should have been here to take some of it off me  alice cosmo you dont mean that i bore you too  he is pained it is now he who boldly encircles her but his words though well meant are not so happy as his action i love you mother and i dont think youre so yellow  alice the belle of many stations yellow her brain reels cosmo do you think me plain  cosmo gallantly no i dont im not one of the kind who judge people by their looks the soul you know is what i judge them by  alice plain me  cosmo the comforter of course its all right for girls to bother about being pretty he lures her away from the subject i can tell you a funny thing about that we had theatricals at osborne one night and we played a thing called the royal boots  alice clapping her hands i played in that too last year  cosmo you  alice yes why shouldnt i  cosmo but we did it for fun  alice so did we  cosmo his views on the universe crumbling you

wellington boots  cosmo blinking mother i played the girl in the wellington boots  alice happily my sonthis ought to bring us closer together  cosmo who has not yet learned to leave well alone but the reason i did it was that we were all boys were there no young ladies where you did it mother  alice cosmo she is not a tamed mother yet and in sudden wrath she flips his face with her hand he accepts it as a smack the colonel foolishly chooses this moment to make his return he is in high goodhumour and does not observe that two of his nearest relatives are glaring at each other  colonel purring offensively its all right now alice she took to me at once  alice tartly oh did she  colonel gurgled at mepulled my moustache  alice i hope you got on with our dear son as well  colonel isnt he a fine fellow  alice i have just been smacking his face she sits down and weeps while her son stands haughtily at attention  colonel with a groan hst i think you had better go and get that evening paper  cosmo departs with his flag flying and the bewildered husband seeks enlightenment  smacked his face but why alice  alice he infuriated me  colonel he seems such a good boy  alice the lowly no doubt he is it must be very trying to have me for a mother  colonel perhaps you were too demonstrative  alice i daresay a woman he doesnt know no wonder i disgusted him  colonel i cant make it out  alice abjectly its quite simple he saw through me at once so did baby  the colonel flings up his hands he hears whisperings outside the door he peeps and returns excitedly  colonel alice theres a girl there with cosmo  alice on her feet with a cry amy  colonel trembling i suppose so  alice gripping him robert if she doesnt love me i shall die  colonel she will she will but he has grown nervous dont be too demonstrative dearest  alice i shall try to be cold oh amy love me  amy comes her hair up and is at once in her fathers arms then she wants to leap into the arms of the mother who craves for her but alice is afraid of being too demonstrative and restrains herself she presses amys hands only  alice it is you amy how are you dear she ventures at last to kiss her it is a great pleasure to your father and me to see you again  amy damped thank you motherof course i have been looking forward to this meeting very much also  alice shuddering it is very sweet of you to say so  oh how cold they are both thinking while the colonel regards them uncomfortably amy turns to him she knows already that there is safe harbourage there  amy would you have known me father  colonel i wonder shes not like you alice  alice no i used to be demonstrative amy  amy eagerly were you  alice hurriedly oh i grew out of it long ago  amy disappointed but sympathetic the wear and tear of life  alice wincing no doubt  amy making conversation you have seen cosmo  alice yes  amy with pardonable curiosity what did you think of him  alice heseemed a nice boy  amy hurt and baby  alice yesoh yes  amy isnt she fat  alice is she  the nurses head intrudes  nurse if you please siri think baby wants you again  the colonels face exudes complacency but he has the grace to falter  colonel what do you think alice  alice broken under the blow by all means go  colonel wont you come also perhaps if i am with you  alice after giving him an annihilating look no ii had quite a long time with her  the colonel tiptoes off to his babe with a countenance of foolish rapture and mother and daughter are alone  amy wishing her father would come back you cant have been very long with baby mother  alice quite long enough  amy oh some seconds elapse before she can speak again you will have some tea wont you  alice thank you dear they sit down to a chilly meal  amy merely a hostess both milk and sugar  alice merely a guest no sugar  amy i hope you will like the house mother  alice i am sure you have chosen wisely i see you are artistic  amy the decoration isnt finished i havent quite decided what this room is to be like yet  alice one never can tell  amy making conversation did you notice that there is a circular drive to the house  alice no i didnt notice  amy that would be because the cab filled it but you can see it if you are walking  alice i shall look out for it grown desperate amy have you nothing more important to say to me  amy faltering you meanthe keys here they are all with labels on them and here are the tradesmens books they are all paid up to wednesday she sadly lets them go they lie disregarded in her mothers lap  alice is there nothing else  amy with a flash of pride perhaps you have noticed that my hair is up  alice it so took me aback amy when you came into the room how long have you had it up  amy with large eyes not very long ii began only today  alice imploringly dear put it down again you are not grown up  amy almost sternly i feel i am a woman now  alice abject a womanyou am i never to know my daughter as a girl  amy you were married before you were eighteen  alice ah but i had no mother and even at that age i knew the world  amy smiling sadly oh mother not so well as i know it  alice sharply what can you know of the world  amy shuddering more i hope mother than you will ever know  alice alarmed my child seizing her amy tell me what you know  amy dont ask me please i have sworn not to talk of it  alice sworn to whom  amy to another  alice with a sinking pounces on her daughters engagement finger but it is unadorned  alice tell me amy who is that other  amy bravely it is our secret  alice amy i beg you  amy a heroic figure dear mother i am so sorry i must decline  alice you defy me she takes hold of her daughters shoulders amy you drive me frantic if you dont tell me at once i shall insist on your father oh you  it is not to be denied that she is shaking amy when the colonel once more intrudes  colonel aghast good heavens alice again amy what does this mean  amy as she runs insulted and in tears from the room it means father that i love you very much  colonel badgered wont you explain alice  alice robert i am in terror about amy  colonel why  alice dont ask me dearnot nownot till i have spoken to her again she clings to her husband robert there cant be anything in it  colonel if you mean anything wrong with our girl there isnt memsahib what great innocent eyes she has  alice eagerly yes yes hasnt she robert  colonel alls well with amy dear  alice of course it is it was silly of memy amy  colonel and mine  alice but she seems to me hard to understand with her head on his breast i begin to feel robert that i should have come back to my children long agoor i shouldnt have come back at all  the colonel is endeavouring to soothe her when stephen rollo is shown in he is very youngtoo young to be a villain too roundfaced but he is all the villain we can provide for amy his entrance is less ostentatious than it might be if he knew of the role that has been assigned to him he thinks indeed sometimes with a sigh that he is a very good young man and the colonel and alice without the sigh think so too after warm greetings  steve alice i daresay you wish me at jericho but its six months since i saw you and i couldnt wait till tomorrow  alice giving him her cheek i believe theres someone in this house glad to see me at last and you may kiss me for that steve  steve who has found the cheek wet you are not telling me they dont adore her  colonel i cant understand it  steve but by all the little gods of india you know everyone has always adored alice  alice plaintively thats why i take it so ill steve  steve can i do anything see here if the house is upside down and you would like to get rid of the colonel for an hour or two suppose he dines with me tonight im dying to hear all the news of the punjab since i left  colonel with an eye on the nursery door no steve ithe fact isi have an engagement  alice vindictively he means he cant leave the baby  steve it has taken to him  colonel swaggering enormously  alice whimpering they all have he has stolen them from me he has taken up his permanent residence in the nursery  colonel pooh fiddlededee i shall probably come round tonight to see you after dinner steve and bring memsahib with me in the meantime  alice whose mind is still misgiving her about amy in the meantime i want to have a word with steve alone robert  colonel very good stealing towards the nursery then i shall pop in here again how is the tea business prospering in london steve glad you left india  steve i dont have half the salary i had in india but my health is better how are rupees  colonel stop it he is making a doll of his handkerchief for the further subjugation of molly he sees his happy face in a lookingglass and is ashamed of it alice i wish it was you they loved  alice with withering scorn oh go back to your baby  as soon as the colonel has gone she turns anxiously to steve  steve tell me candidly what you think of my girl  steve but i have never set eyes on her  alice oh i was hoping you knew her well she goes sometimes to the deans and the rawlingsall our old indian friends  steve so do i but we never happened to be there at the same time they often speak of her though  alice what do they say  steve they are enthusiastican ideal sweet girl  alice relieved im so glad now you can go steve  steve its odd to think of the belle of the punjab as a mother of a big girl  alice dont or i shall begin to think its absurd myself  steve surely the boy felt the spell she shakes her head but the boys always did  alice wryly they were older boys  steve i believe i was the only one you never flirted with  alice smiling no one could flirt with you steve  steve pondering i wonder why the problem has troubled him occasionally for years  alice i wonder  steve i suppose theres some sort of want in me  alice perhaps thats it no its because you were always such a good boy  steve wincing i dont know sometimes when i saw you all flirting i wanted to do it too but i could never think of how to begin with a sigh i feel sure theres something pleasant about it  alice youre a dear old donkey steve but im glad you came it has made the place seem more like home all these years i was looking forward to home and now i feel that perhaps it is the place i have left behind me the joyous gurgling of molly draws them to the nursery door and there they are observed by amy and ginevra who enter from the hall the screen is close to the two girls and they have so often in the last week seen stage figures pop behind screens that mechanically as it were they pop behind this one  steve who little knows that he is now entering on the gay career listen to the infant  alice isnt it horrid of robert to get on with her so well steve say roberts a brute  steve as he bids her good afternoon of course he is a selfish beast  alice theres another kiss to you for saying so the doomed woman presents her cheek again  steve and youll come to me after dinner tonight alice here ill leave my card im not half a mile from this street  alice i maynt be able to get away it will depend on whether my silly husband wants to stay with his wretch of a baby ill see you to the door steve youre much nicer than robert  with these dreadful words she and the libertine go amy and ginevra emerge white to the lips or at least they feel as white as that  amy clinging to the screen for support he kissed her  ginevra sternly he called her alice  amy she is going to his house tonight an assignation  ginevra they will be chambers amythey are always chambers and after dinner he saidso hes stingy too here is his card mr stephen rollo  amy i have heard of him they said he was a nice man  ginevra the address is kensington west thats the new name for west kensington  amy my poor father it would kill him  ginevra the master mind he must never know  amy ginevra whats to be done  ginevra thank heaven we know exactly what to do it rests with you to save her  amy trembling you mean i must goto his chambers  ginevra firmly at any cost  amy evening dress  ginevra it is always evening dress and dont be afraid of his man dear they always have a man  amy oh ginevra  ginevra first try fascination you remember how they fling back their cloaklike this dear if that fails threaten him you must get back the letters there are always letters  amy if father should suspect and follow they usually do  ginevra then you must sacrifice yourself for her does my dearest falter  amy pressing ginevras hand i will do my duty oh ginevra what things there will be to put in my diary tonight    ii  night has fallen and amy is probably now in her bedroom fully arrayed for her dreadful mission she says goodbye to her diaryperhaps for aye she steals from the houseto a very different scene which if one were sufficiently daring would represent a mans chambers at midnight there is no really valid excuse for shirking this scene which is so popular that every theatre has it stowed away in readiness it is capable of setting itself should the stagehands forget to do so  it should be a handsome sombre room in oak and dark red with sinister easy chairs and couches great curtains discreetly drawn a door to enter by a door to hide by a carelessly strewn table on which to write a letter reluctantly to dictation another table exquisitely decorated for supper for two champagne in an icebucket many rows of books which on close examination will prove to be painted wood the stage lotharios not being really reading men the lamps shed a diffused light and one of them is slightly odd in construction because it is for knocking over presently in order to let the lady escape unobserved through this room moves occasionally the mans man sleek imperturbable announcing the lady the ladys husband the woman friend who is to save them he says little but is responsible for all the arrangements going right before the curtain rises he may be conceived trying the lamp and making sure that the lady will not stick in the door  that is how it ought to be that is how amy has seen it several times in the past week and now that we come to the grapple we wish we could give you what you want for you do want it you have been used to it and you will feel that you are looking at a strange middle act without it but steve cannot have such a room as this he has only two hundred and fifty pounds a year including the legacy from his aunt besides though he is to be a lothario in so far as we can manage it he is not at present aware of this and has made none of the necessary arrangements if one of his lamps is knocked over it will certainly explode and there cannot be a secret door without its leading into the adjoining house theatres keep special kinds of architects to design their rooms there is indeed a little cupboard where his crockery is kept and if amy is careful she might be able to squeeze in there we cannot even make the hour midnight it is eightthirty quite late enough for her to be out alone  steve has just finished dinner in his comfortable lodgings he is not even in evening dress but he does wear a lounge jacket which we devoutly hope will give him a rakish air to amys eyes he would undoubtedly have put on evening dress if he had known she was coming his man richardson is waiting on him when we wrote that we deliberated a long time it has an air and with a little low cunning we could make you think to the very end that richardson was a male but if the play is acted and you go to see it you would be disappointed steve the wretched fellow never had a man and richardson is only his landladys slavey aged about fifteen and wistful at sight of food we introduce her gazing at steves platter as if it were a fairy tale steve has often caught her with this rapt expression on her face and sometimes as now an engaging game ensues  richardson blinking are you finished sir to those who know the game this means are you to leave the other chopthe one sitting lonely and lovely beneath the dishcover  steve yes in the game this is merely a tantaliser  richardson almost sure that he is in the right mood and sending out a feeler then am i to clear  steve no this is intended to puzzle her but it is a move he has made so often that she understands its meaning at once  richardson in entranced giggles he he he  steve vacating his seat sit down  richardson again  steve sit down and clear the enemy out of that dish  by the enemy he means the other chop what a name for a chop steve plays the part of butler he brings her a plate from the little cupboard  dinner is served madam  richardson who will probably be a great duchess some day i dont mind if i does have a snack she places herself at the table after what she conceives to be the manner of the genteelly gluttonous then she quakes a little if missis was to catch me she knows that missis is probably sitting downstairs with her arms folded hopeful of the chop for herself  steve you tuck in and ill keep watch  he goes to the door to peer over the banisters it is all part of the game richardson promptly tucks in with horrid relish  richardson what makes you so good to me sir  steve a gentleman is always good to a lady  richardson preening a lady go on  steve and when i found that at my dinner hour you were subject to growing pains i remembered my own youth potatoes madam  richardson neatly if quite convenient  the kindly young man surveys her for some time in silence while she has various happy adventures  steve can i smoke richardson  richardson of course you can smoke i have often seen you smoking  steve little aware of what an evening the sex is to give him but have i your permission  richardson youre at your tricks again  steve severely have you forgotten already how i told you a true lady would answer  richardson i minds but it makes me that shy she has however a try at it do smoke mr rollo i loves the smell of it  steve lights his pipe no real villain smokes a pipe  steve smoking is a blessed companion to a lonely devil like myself  richardson yes sir sharply would you say devil to a real lady sir  steve it may be hoped is properly confused but here the little idyll of the chop is brought to a close by the tinkle of a bell richardson springs to attention  that will be the friends you are expecting  steve i was only half expecting them but i daresay you are right have you finished richardson  richardson thereabouts would a real lady lick the bonein company i mean  steve you know i hardly think so  richardson then im finished  steve disappearing say ill be back in a jiffy i need brushing richardson  richardson no longer in company is about to hold a last friendly communion with the bone when there is a knock at the door followed by the entrance of a mysterious lady you could never guess who the lady is so we may admit at once that it is miss amy grey amy is in evening dressher only evening dressand over it is the cloak which she is presently to fling back with staggering effect just now her pale face is hiding behind the collar of it for she is quaking inwardly though strung up to a terrible ordeal the room is not as she expected but she knows that men are cunning  amy frowning are these mr rollos chambers the woman told me to knock at this door  she remembers with a certain satisfaction that the woman had looked at her suspiciously  richardson the tray in her hand to give her confidence yes maam he will be down in a minute maam he is expecting you maam  expecting her is he amy smiles the bitter smile of knowledge  amy we shall see she looks about her sharply where is his man  richardson with the guilt of the chop on her conscience what man  amy brushing this subterfuge aside his man they always have a man  richardson with spirit he is a man himself  amy come girl who waits on him  richardson me  amy rather daunted no man very strange fortunately she sees the two plates stop her eyes glisten two persons have been dining here richardson begins to tremble why do you look so scared was the other a gentleman  richardson oh maam  amy triumphantly it was not but her triumph gives way to bewilderment for she knows that when she left the house her mother was still in it then who can the visitor have been why are you trying to hide that plate was it a lady girl tell me was it a lady  richardson at bay hehe calls her a lady  amy the omniscient but you know better  richardson of course i know she aint a real lady  amy another woman and not even a lady she has no mercy on the witness tell me is this the first time she has dined here  richardson fixed by amys eye no maami meant no harm maam  amy i am not blaming you can you remember how often she has dined here  richardson well can i remember three times last week  amy three times in one week monstrous  richardson with her gown to her eyes yes maam i see it now  amy considering and pouncing do you think she is an adventuress  richardson whats that  amy does she smoke cigarettes  richardson rather spiritedly no she dont  amy taken aback not an adventuress  she wishes ginevra were here to help her she draws upon her stock of knowledge can she be secretly married to him a wife of the past turned up to blackmail him thats very common  richardson oh maam you are terrifying me  amy i wasnt talking to you you may go stop how long had she been here before i came  richardson sheher what you are speaking about  amy come i must know the terrible admission refuses to pass richardsons lips and of a sudden amy has a dark suspicion has she gone is she here now  richardson it was just a chop what makes you so grudging of a chop  amy i dont care what they ate has she gone  richardson oh maam  the little maid bearing the dishes backs to the door opens it with her foot and escapes from this terrible visitor the drawn curtains attract amys eagle eye and she looks behind them there is no one there she pulls open the door of the cupboard and says firmly come out no one comes she peeps into the cupboard and finds it empty a cupboard and no one in it how strange she sits down almost in tears wishing very much for the counsel of ginevra thus steve finds her when he returns  steve im awfully glad alice that you  he stops abruptly at sight of a strange lady as for amy the word alice brings her to her feet  amy sir a short remark but withering  steve i beg your pardon i thoughtthe fact is that i expectedyou see you are a stranger to memy name is rolloyou are not calling on me are you amy inclines her head in a way that ginevra and she have practised then she flings back her cloak as suddenly as an expert may open an umbrella having done this she awaits results steve however has no knowledge of how to play his part he probably favours musical comedy he says lamely i still think there must be some mistake  amy in italics there is no mistake  steve then is there anything i can do for you  amy ardently you can do so much  steve perhaps if you will sit down  amy decides to humour him so far she would like to sit in the lovely stage way when they know so precisely where the chair is that they can sit without a glance at it but she dare not though ginevra would have risked it steve is emboldened to say by the way you have not told me your name  amy nervously if you please do you mind my not telling it  steve oh very well first he thinks there is something innocent about her request and then he wonders if innocent is the right word well your business please he demands like the man of the world he hopes some day to be  amy why are you not in evening dress  steve taken aback does that matter  amy though it still worries her i suppose not  steve with growing stiffness your business if you will be so good  amy advances upon him she has been seated in any case as long as they ever do sit on the stage on the same chair  amy stephen rollo the game is up  she likes this she will be able to go on now  steve recoiling guiltily or so she will describe it to ginevra what on earth  amy suffering from a determination from the mouth of phrases she has collected in five theatres a chance discovery mr stephen rollo has betrayed your secret to me  steve awed my secret what is it he rushes rapidly through a wellspent youth  amy risking a good deal it is this that woman is your wife  steve what woman  amy the woman who dined with you here this evening  steve with me  amy icily this is useless as i have already said the game is up  steve glancing in a mirror to make sure he is still the same person you look a nice girl but dash it all whom can you be taking me for tell me some more about myself  amy please desist i know everything and in a way i am sorry for you all these years you have kept the marriage a secret for she is a horrid sort of woman and now she has come back to blackmail you that however is not my affair  steve with unexpected power of irony oh i wouldnt say that  amy i do say it mr stephen rollo i shall keep your secret  steve ought you  amy on one condition and on one condition only that you return me the letters  steve the letters  amy the letters  steve walks the length of his room regarding her sideways  steve look here honestly i dont know what you are talking about you know i could be angry with you but i feel sure you are sincere  amy indeed i am  steve well then i assure you on my word of honour that no lady was dining with me this evening and that i have no wife  amy blankly no wife you are sure oh think  steve i swear it  amy i am very sorry she sinks dispiritedly into a chair  steve sorry i have no wife she nods through her tears dont cry how could my having a wife be a boon to you  amy plaintively it would have put you in the hollow of my hands  steve idiotically and they are nice hands too  amy with a consciousness that he might once upon a time have been saved by a good woman i suppose that is how you got round her  steve stamping his foot havent i told you that she doesnt exist  amy i dont mean heri mean her  he decides that she is a little crazy  steve soothingly come now we wont go into that again it was just a mistake and now that it is all settled and done with ill tell you what we shall do you will let me get you a cab she shakes her head i promise not to listen to the address and after you have had a good night youyou will see things differently  amy ashamed of her momentary weakness and deciding not to enter it in the diary you are very clever mr stephen rollo but i dont leave this house without the letters  steve groaning are they your letters  amy how dare you they are the letters written to you as you well know by  steve eagerly yes  amy by a certain lady spare me the pain if you are a gentleman of having to mention her name  steve sulkily oh all right  amy she is to pass out of your life tonight tomorrow you go abroad for a long time  steve with excusable warmth oh do i where am i going  amy we thought  steve we  amy a friend and i who have been talking it over we thought of africato shoot big game  steve humouring her you must be very fond of this lady  amy i would die for her  steve feeling that he ought really to stick up a little for himself after all am i so dreadful why shouldnt she love me  amy a married woman  steve gratified married  amy how can you play with me so sir she is my mother  steve your mother fond of me  amy how dare you look pleased  steve im noti didnt mean to i say i wish you would tell me who you are  amy as if you didnt know  steve in a dream fond of me i cant believe it rather wistfully how could she be  amy it was all your fault such men as youpitiless menyou made her love you  steve still elated do you think i am that kind of man  amy oh sir let her go you are strong and she is weak think of her poor husband and give me back the letters  steve on my word of honour here arrives richardson so anxious to come that she is propelled into the room like a ball what is it  richardson a gentleman downstairs sir wanting to see you  amy saying the right thing at once he must not find me here my reputation  steve i can guess who it is let me think he is really glad of the interruption see here ill keep him downstairs for a moment richardson take this lady to the upper landing until i have brought him in then show her out  richardson oh lor  amy rooting herself to the floor the letters  steve as he goes write to me write to me i must know more of this  richardson come quick miss  amy fixing her you are not deceiving me you are sure it isnt a lady  richardson yes misshe said his name was colonel grey  ginevra would have known that it must be the husband but for the moment amy is appalled  amy quivering can he suspect  richardson who has her own troubles about the chop  amy if she should come while he is here  richardson come along miss whats the matter  amy i cant go away i am not going  she darts into the cupboard it is as if she had heard ginevra cry amy the cupboard  richardson tugging at the closed door come out of that i promised to put you on the upper landing you cant go hiding in there lady  amy peeping out i can and i will let go the door i came here expecting to have to hide  she closes the door as her father enters with steve the colonel is chatting but his host sees that richardson is in distress  steve who thinks that the lady has been got rid of what is it  richardson would you speak with me a minute sir  steve pointedly go away you have some work to do on the stair go and do it im sorry colonel that you didnt bring alice with you  colonel she is coming on later  steve good  colonel i have come from pall mall wanted to look in at the club once more so i had a chop there  richardson with the old sinking a chop she departs with her worst suspicions confirmed  steve as they pull their chairs nearer to the fire is alice coming on from home  colonel yes thats it he stretches out his legs steve home is the best club in the world such jolly fellows all the members  steve you havent come here to talk about your confounded baby again have you  colonel apologetically if you dont mind  steve i do mind  colonel but if you feel you can stand it  steve you are my guest so go ahead  colonel she fell asleep steve holding my finger  steve which finger  colonel this one as alice would say soldiering done baby begun  steve poor old chap  colonel i have been through a good deal in my time steve but that is the biggest thing i have ever done  steve have a cigar  colonel brute thanks  here amy who cannot hear when the door is closed opens it slightly the colonel is presently aware that steve is silently smiling to himself the colonel makes a happy guess thinking of the ladies steve  steve blandly to tell the truth i was thinking of one  colonel she seems to be a nice girl  steve she is not exactly a girl  colonel twinkling very fond of you steve  steve i have the best of reasons for knowing that she is we may conceive amys feelings though we cannot see her on my soul colonel i think it is the most romantic affair i ever heard of i have waited long for a romance to come into my life but by javers it has come at last  colonel graters steve does her family like it  steve cheerily no they are furious  colonel but why  steve judiciously a womans secret colonel  colonel ah the plot thickens do i know her  steve not you  colonel i mustnt ask her name  steve with presence of mind i have a very good reason for not telling you her name  colonel so and she is not exactly young twice your age steve  steve with excusable heat not at all but she is of the age when a woman knows her own mindwhich makes the whole affair extraordinarily flattering with undoubtedly a shudder of disgust amy closes the cupboard door steve continues to behave in the most gallant manner you must not quiz me colonel for her circumstances are such that her partiality for me puts her in a dangerous position and i would go to the stake rather than give her away  colonel quite so he makes obeisance to the beauty of the sentiment and then proceeds to an examination of the hearthrug  steve what are you doing  colonel trying to find out for myself whether she comes here  steve how can you find that out by crawling about my carpet  colonel i am looking for hairpinstriumphantly holding up a ladys gloveand i have found one  they have been too engrossed to hear the bell ring but now voices are audible  steve there is some one coming up  colonel perhaps it is she steve no that is alices voice catch you scoundrel and he tosses him the glove alice is shown in and is warmly acclaimed she would not feel so much at ease if she knew who hand on heart has recognised her through the pantry keyhole  steve as he makes alice comfortable by the fire how did you leave them at home  alice relapsing into gloom all hating me  steve this man says that home is the most delightful club in the world  alice i am not a member i have been blackballed by my own baby robert i dined in state with cosmo and he was so sulky that he ate his fish without salt rather than ask me to pass it  colonel where was amy  alice amy said she had a headache and went to bed i spoke to her through the door before i came out but she wouldnt answer  colonel why didnt you go in memsahib  alice i did venture to think of it but she had locked the door robert i really am worried about amy she seems to me to behave oddly there cant be anything wrong  colonel of course not aliceeh steve  steve bless you no  alice smiling its much steve knows about women  steve im not so unattractive to women alice as you think  alice listen to him robert  colonel what he means my dear is that you should see him with elderly ladies  alice steve this to people who know you here something happens to amys skirt she has opened the door to hear then in alarm shut it leaving a fragment of skirt caught in the door there unseen it bides its time  steve darkly dont be so sure you know me alice  colonel enjoying himself let us tell her steve i am dying to tell her  steve grandly no no  colonel we mustnt tell you alice because it is a womans secreta poor little fond elderly woman our friend is very proud of his conquest see how he is ruffling his feathers i shouldnt wonder you know though you and i are in the way tonight  but alices attention is directed in another direction to a little white object struggling in the clutches of a closed door at the back of the room steve turns to see what she is looking at and at the same moment the door opens sufficiently to allow a pretty hand to obtrude seize the kitten or whatever it was and softly reclose the door for one second alice did think it might be a kitten but she knows now that it is part of a womans dress as for steve thus suddenly acquainted with his recent visitors whereabouts his mouth opens wider than the door he appeals mutely to alice not to betray his strange secret to the colonel  alice with dancing eyes may i look about me steve i have been neglecting your room shamefully  steve alarmed for he knows the woman dont get up alice there is really nothing to see but she is already making the journey of the room and drawing nearer to the door  alice playing with him i like your clock  steve it is my landladys nearly all the things are hers do come back to the fire  alice dont mind me what does this door lead into  steve only a cupboard  alice what do you keep in it  steve merely crockerythat sort of thing  alice i should like to see your crockery steve not one little bit of china may i peep in  colonel who is placidly smoking with his back to the scene of the drama dont mind her steve she never could see a door without itching to open it  alice opens the door and sees amy standing there with her finger to her lips just as they stood in all the five plays ginevra could not have posed her better  well have you found anything memsahib  it has been the great shock of alices life and she sways but she shuts the door before answering him  alice with a terrible look at steve just a dark little cupboard  steve not aware that it is her daughter who is in there wonders why the lighter aspect of the incident has ceased so suddenly to strike her she returns to the fire but not to her chair she puts her arms round the neck of her husband a great grief for him is welling up in her breast  colonel so long used to her dear impulsive ways hullo we mustnt let on that we are fond of each other before company  steve meaning well though he had better have held his tongue i dont count i am such an old friend  alice slowly such an old friend her husband sees that she is struggling with some emotion  colonel worrying about the children still alice  alice glad to break down openly yes yes i cant help it robert  colonel petting her there there you foolish woman joy will come in the morning i never was surer of anything would you like me to take you home now  alice home but yes ilet us go home  colonel can we have a cab steve  steve ill go down and whistle one alice im awfully sorry that youthat i  alice please a cab  but though she is alone with her husband now she does not know what she wants to say to him she has a passionate desire that he should not learn who is behind that door  colonel pulling her toward him i think it is about amy that you worry most  alice why should i robert  colonel not a jot of reason  alice say again robert that everything is sure to come right just as we planned it would  colonel of course it will  alice robert there is something i want to tell you you know how dear my children are to me but amy is the dearest of all she is dearer to me robert than you yourself  colonel very well memsahib  alice robert dear amy has come to a time in her life when she is neither quite a girl nor quite a woman there are dark places before us at that age through which we have to pick our way without much help i can conceive dead mothers haunting those places to watch how their child is to fare in them very frightened ghosts robert i have thought so long of how i was to be within hail of my girl at this time holding her handmy amy my child  colonel that is just how it is all to turn out my alice  alice shivering yes isnt it isnt it  colonel you dear excitable of course it is  alice like one defying him but even though it were not though i had come back too late though my daughter had become a woman without a mothers guidance though she were a bad woman  colonel alice  alice though some cur of a manrobert it wouldnt affect my love for her i should love her more than ever if all others turned from her if you turned from her roberthow i should love her then  colonel alice dont talk of such things  but she continues to talk of them for she sees that the door is ajar and what she says now is really to comfort amy every word of it is a kiss for amy  alice smiling through her fears i was only telling you that nothing could make any difference in my love for amy that was all and of course if she has ever been a little foolish lightheadedat that age one often iswhy a mother would soon put all that right she would just take her girl in her arms and they would talk it over and the poor childs troubles would vanish still for amys comfort and do you think i should repeat any of amys confidences to you robert gaily not a word sir she might be sure of that  colonel a pretty way to treat a father but you will never persuade me that there is any serious flaw in amy  alice ill never try dear  colonel as for this little tantrum of locking herself into her room however we must have it out with her  alice the first thing tomorrow  colonel not a bit of it the first thing the moment we get home  alice now up against a new danger you forget dear that she has gone to bed  colonel well soon rout her out of bed  alice robert you forget that she has locked the door  colonel sulky little darling i daresay she is crying her eyes out for you already but if she doesnt open that door pretty smartly ill force it  alice you wouldnt do that  colonel wouldnt i oh yes i would  thus alice has another problem to meet when steve returns from his successful quest for a cab  thank you steve you will excuse us running off i know alice is all nerves tonight come along dear  alice signing to the puzzled steve that he must somehow get the lady out of the house at once there is no such dreadful hurry is there she is suddenly interested in some photographs on the wall are you in this group steve  steve yes it is an old school eleven  alice let us see if we can pick steve out robert  colonel here he is the one with the ball  alice oh no that cant be steve surely isnt this one more like him come over here under the light  steve has his moment at the door but it is evident from his face that the hidden one scorns his blandishments so he signs to alice  colonel this is you isnt it steve  steve yes the one with the ball  colonel i found you at once now alice your cloak  alice i feel so comfy where i am one does hate to leave a fire doesnt one she hums gaily a snatch of a song  colonel the woman doesnt know her own mind  alice you remember we danced to that once on my birthday at simla  she shows him how they danced at simla  colonel to steve who is indeed the more bewildered of the two and a few minutes ago i assure you she was weeping on my shoulder  alice you were so nice to me that evening roberti gave you a dance she whirls him gaily round  colonel you flibberty jibbet you make me dizzy  alice shall we sit out the rest of the dance  colonel not i come along you unreasonable thing  alice unreasonable robert i have a reason i want to see whether amy will come  colonel come  steve come here  alice i didnt tell you before robert because i had so little hope but i called to her through the door that i was coming here to meet you and i said i dont believe you have a headache amy i believe you have locked yourself in there because you hate the poor mother who loves you and i begged her to come with me i said if you wont come now come after me and make me happy  colonel but what an odd message alice so unlike you  alice was it i dont know i always find it so hard robert to be like myself  colonel but my dear a young girl  alice she could have taken a cab i gave her the address dont be so hard robert i am teaching you to dance she is off with him again  colonel steve the madcap  he falls into a chair but sees the room still going round it is alices chance she pounces upon amys hand whirls her out of the hiding place and seems to greet her at the other door  alice amy  colonel jumping up not really hallo i never for a momentit was true then amy you are a good little girl to come  amy to whom this is a not unexpected step in the game dear father  steve to whom it is a very unexpected step indeed amy is thisyour daughter alice  alice wondering at the perfidy of the creature i forgot that you dont know her steve  steve but ifif this is your daughteryou are the mother  alice the mother  colonel jovially well thought out steve he is a master mind alice  steve butbut  mercifully amy has not lost her head she is here to save them all  amy introduce me father  colonel he is astounded at our having such a big girl  steve thankfully yes thats it  colonel amy my old friend steve rollosteve this is our rosebud  steve blinking how do you do  amy sternly how do you do  colonel but bless me amy you are a swell  amy flushing it is only evening dress  colonel i bet she didnt dress for us alice it was all done for steve  alice yes for steve  colonel but dont hang in me chicken hang in your mother steve why are you staring at alice  we know why he is staring at alice but of course he is too gallant a gentleman to tell besides his astonishment has dazed him  steve was i  alice with her arms extended amy dont be afraid of me  amy going into them contemptuously im not  colonel badgered then kiss and make it up  amy bestows a cold kiss upon her mother alice weeps this is too much just wait till i get you home are you both ready  it is then that amy makes her first mistake the glove that the colonel has tossed to steve is lying on a chair and she innocently begins to put it on her father stares at her his wife does not know why  alice we are ready robert why dont you come robert what is it  colonel darkening steve knows what it is amy doesnt as yet the simple soul has given herself away so innocently that it is almost a shame to take notice of it but i must steve come man it cant be difficult to explain  in this steve evidently differs from him  alice robert you frighten me  colonel still tonguetied steve before you came here alice i found a ladys glove on the floor  alice quickly that isnt our affair robert  colonel yes ill tell you why amy has just put on that glove  alice it isnt hers dear  colonel do you deny that it is yours amy amy has no answer to this is it unreasonable steve to ask you when my daughter with whom you profess to be unacquainted gave you that token of her esteem  steve helpless alice  colonel what has alice to do with it  amy to the rescue nothing nothing i swear  colonel has there been something going on that i dont understand are you in it alice as well as they why has steve been staring at you so  amy knowing so well that she alone can put this matter right mother dont answer  steve if i could see alice alone for a moment colonel  alice yes  colonel no good heavens what are you all concealing is amymy amyyour elderly lady steve was that some tasteful little joke you were playing on your old friend her father  steve colonel i  amy preparing for the great sacrifice i forbid him to speak  colonel you forbid him  alice robert robert let me explain steve  amy mother you must not you dare not  grandly let all fall on me it is not true father that mr rollo and i were strangers when you introduced us  alice wailing amy amy  amy with a touch of the sublime it is my glove but it had a right to be here he is my affianced husband  perhaps but it is an open question steve is the one who is most surprised to hear this he seems to want to say something on the subject but a look of entreaty from alice silences him  colonel alice did you hear her  alice surely you dont mean robert that you are not glad  colonel incredulous is that how you take it  alice heartbroken how i take it i am overjoyed dont you see how splendid it is our old friend steve  colonel glaring at him our old friend steve  as for amy that palefaced lily for the moment she stands disregarded never mind ginevra will yet do her justice  alice oh happy day brazenly she takes steves two hands robert he is to be our son  colonel you are very clever alice but do you really think i believe that this is no shock to you oh woman why has this deception not struck you to the ground  alice deception amy steve i do believe he thinks that this is as much a surprise to me as it is to him why robert i have known about it ever since i saw amy alone this afternoon she told me at once then in came steve and he  colonel is it as bad as that  alice as what dear  colonel that my wife must lie to me  alice oh robert  colonel i am groping only but i can see now that you felt there was something wrong from the first how did you find out  alice imploringly robert they are engaged to be married it was foolish of them not to tell you but oh my dear leave it at that  colonel why did you ask amy to follow us here  alice so that we could all be together when we broke it to you dear  colonel another lie my shoulders are broad why shouldnt i have it to bear as well as you  alice there is nothing to bear but just a little folly  colonel folly and neither of them able to say a word  indeed they are very cold lovers amys lip is curled at steve to make matters worse the cupboard door which has so far had the decency to remain quiet now presumes to have its say it opens of itself a few inches creaking guiltily three people are so startled that a new suspicion is roused in the fourth  alice who can read his face so well she wasnt there robert she wasnt  colonel my god i understand now she didnt follow us she hid there when i came  alice no robert no  he goes into the cupboard and returns with something in his hand which he gives to amy  colonel your other glove amy  alice i cant keep it from you any longer robert i have done my best she goes to amy to protect her but amy is still my child  what a deceiver amy is thinking  colonel well sir still waiting for that interview with my wife before you can say anything  steve a desperate fellow yes  alice you will have every opportunity of explaining steve many opportunities but in the meantimejust now please go leave us alone stamping her foot go please  steve has had such an evening of it that he clings dizzily to the one amazing explanation that alice loves him not wisely but too well never will he betray her never  steve with a meaning that is lost on her but is very evident to the other lady present  anything you ask me to do alice anything i shall go upstairs only so that if you want me  alice oh go he goes wondering whether he is a villain or a hero which is perhaps a pleasurable state of mind  colonel you are wondrous lenient to him i shall have more to say as for this girllook at her standing there she seems rather proud of herself  alice it isnt really hardness robert it is because she thinks that you are hard robert dear i want you to go away too and leave amy to me go home robert we shall follow soon  colonel after a long pause if you wish it  alice leave her to her mother  when he has gone amy leans across the top of a chair sobbing her little heart away alice tries to take herthe whole of herin her arms but is rebuffed with a shudder  amy i wonder you can touch me  alice the more you ask of your mother the more she has to give it is my love you need amy and you can draw upon it and draw upon it  amy pray excuse me  alice how can you be so hard my child i am not saying one harsh word to you i am asking you only to hide your head upon your mothers breast  amy i decline  alice take care amy or i shall begin to believe that your father was right what do you think would happen if i were to leave you to him  amy poor father  alice poor indeed with such a daughter  amy he has gone mother so do you really think you need keep up this pretence before me  alice amy what you need is a whipping  amy you ought to know what i need  the agonised mother again tries to envelop her unnatural child  alice amy amy it was all steves fault  amy struggling as with a boa constrictor you neednt expect me to believe that  alice no doubt you thought at the beginning that he was a gallant gentleman  amy not at all i knew he was depraved from the moment i set eyes on him  alice my amy then howhow  amy ginevra knew too  alice she knew  amy we planned it togetherto treat him in the same way as sir harry paskill and ralph devereux  alice amy you are not in your senses you dont mean that there were others  amy there was majormajori forget his name but he was another  alice shaking her wretched girl  amy leave go  alice how did you get to know them  amy to know them they are characters in plays  alice bereft characters in plays plays  amy we went to five last week  wild hopes spring up in alices breast  alice amy tell me quickly when did you see steve for the first time  amy when you were saying goodbye to him this afternoon  alice can it be true  amy perhaps we shouldnt have listened but they always listen when there is a screen  alice listened what did you hear  amy everything mother we saw him kiss you and heard you make an assignation to meet him here  alice i shall whip you directly but go on darling  amy childishly you shant whip me then once more heroic as in a flash ginevra and i saw that there was only one way to save you i must go to his chambers and force him to return the letters  alice inspired my letters  amy of course he behaved at first as they all dopretended that he did not know what i was talking about at that moment a visitor i knew at once that it must be the husband it always is it was i hid again a visitor i knew it must be you it was oh the agony to me in there i was wondering when he would begin to suspect for i knew the time would come and i stood ready to emerge and sacrifice myself to save you  alice as you have done amy  amy as i have done  once more the arms go round her  i want none of that  alice forgive me a thought comes to alice that enthralls her steve does he know what you thinkabout me  amy i had to be open with him  alice and steve believes it he thinks that iialice greyoh ecstasy  amy you need not pretend  alice what is to be done  amy though i abhor him i must marry him for aye ginevra is to be my only bridesmaid we are both to wear black  alice sharply you are sure you dont rather like him amy  amy mother  alice amy werent you terrified to come alone to the rooms of a man you didnt even know some men  amy i was not afraid i am a soldiers daughter and ginevra gave me this  she produces a tiny dagger this is altogether too much for alice  alice my darling  she does have the babe in her arms at last and now amy clings to her this is very sweet to alice but she knows that if she tells amy the truth at once its first effect will be to make the dear one feel ridiculous how can alice hurt her amy so amy who has such pride in having saved her you do love me a little amy dont you  amy yes yes  alice you dont think i have been really bad dear  amy oh no only foolish  alice thank you amy  amy nestling still closer what are we to do now dear dear mother  alice has a happy idea but that as the novelists say deserves a chapter to itself    iii  we are back in the room of the diary the diary itself is not visible it is tucked away in the drawer taking a nap while it may for it has much to chronicle before cockcrow cosmo also is asleep on an ingenious arrangement of chairs ginevra is sitting bolt upright a book on her knee but she is not reading it she is seeing visions in which amy plays a desperate part the hour is late every one ought to be in bed  cosmo is perhaps dreaming that he is back at osborne for he calls out as if in answer to a summons that he is up and nearly dressed he then raises his head and surveys ginevra  cosmo hullo youve been asleep  ginevra how like a man  cosmo i say i thought you were the one who had stretched herself out and that i was sitting here very quiet so as not to waken you  ginevra let us leave it at that  cosmo huffy arent you have they not come back yet  ginevra not they and halfpast eleven has struck i oughtnt to stay any longer as it is i dont know what my landlady will say  she means that she does know  cosmo ill see you to your place whenever you like my uniform will make it all right for you  ginevra you child but i simply cant go till i know what has happened where oh where can they be  cosmo thats all right father told you he had a message from mother saying that they had gone to the theatre  ginevra but why  cosmo yes it seemed to bother him too  ginevra the theatre that is what she said  here cosmo takes up a commanding position on the hearthrug it could not be bettered unless with a cigar in the mouth  cosmo look here miss dunbar it may be that i have a little crow to pick with mother when she comes back but i cannot allow anyone else to say a word against her comprenez  ginevras reply is lost to the world because at this moment amys sparkling eyes show round the door how softly she must have crossed the little hall  ginevra amy at last  amy sh she speaks to some one unseen there are only ginevra and cosmo here  thus encouraged alice enters despite her demeanour they would see if they knew her better that she has been having a good time and is in hopes that it is not ended yet she comes in as it were under amys guidance ginevra is introduced and alice then looks to amy for instructions what to do next  amy encouragingly sit down mother  alice where shall i sit dear amy gives her the nicest chair in the room thank you amy she is emboldened to address her son where is your father cosmo  cosmo remembers his slap and that he has sworn to converse with her no more he indicates however that his father is in the room overhead alice meekly accepts the rebuff shall i go to him amy  amy considerately if you think you feel strong enough mother  alice you have given me strength  amy i am so glad she strokes her mother soothingly what will you tell him  alice all amyall all  amy brave mother  alice who could not be brave with such a daughter on reflection and with such a son  helped by encouraging words from amy she departs on her perilous enterprise the two conspirators would now give a handsome competence to cosmo to get him out of the room he knows it and sits down  cosmo i say what is she going to tell father  amy with a despairing glance at ginevra oh nothing  ginevra with a clever glance at amy cosmo you promised to see me home  cosmo the polite right o  ginevra but you havent got your boots on  cosmo i wont be a minute he pauses at the door i say i believe youre trying to get rid of me look here i wont budge till you tell me what mother is speaking about to father  amy it is about the drawingroom curtains  cosmo good lord as soon as he has gone they rush at each other they dont embrace they stop when their noses are an inch apart and then talk this is the stage way for lovers it is difficult to accomplish without rubbing noses but they have both been practising  ginevra quick amy did you get the letters  amy there are no letters  ginevra is so taken aback that her nose bobs otherwise the two are absolutely motionless she cleverly recovers herself  ginevra no letters how unlike life you are quite sure  amy i have my mothers word for it  ginevra is that enough  amy and you now have mine  ginevra then it hadnt gone far  amy no merely a painful indiscretion but if father had known ityou know what husbands are  ginevra yes indeed did he follow her  amy nods did you hide amy nods again  amy worse than that ginevra to deceive him i had to pretend that i was the woman and nowginevra can you guess here they have to leave off doing noses on the stage it can be done for ever so much longer but only by those who are paid accordingly  ginevra you dont mean  amy i think i do but what do you mean  ginevra i meanthe great thing  amy then it is yes ginevra i am affianced to the man steve ginevra could here quickly drink a glass of water if there was one in the room  ginevra wandering round her old friend you seem the same amy yet somehow different  amy rather complacently that is just how i feel but i must not think of myself they are overhead ginevra there is an awful scene taking placeup there she is telling father all  ginevra confessing  amy everythingin a noble attempt to save me from a widowed marriage  ginevra but i thought she was such a hard woman  amy not really to the world perhaps but i have softened her all she needed ginevra to bring out her finer qualities was a strong nature to lean upon and she says that she has found it in me at the theatre and all the way home  ginevra then you did go to the theatre why  amy feeling that ginevra is very young need you ask oh ginevra to see if we could find a happy ending it was mothers idea  ginevra which theatre  amy i dont know but the erring wife confessed allin one of those mousselines de soie that are so fashionable this year and mother and i satclasping each others hands praying it might end happily though we didnt see how it could  ginevra how awful for you what did the husband do  amy he was very calm and white he went out of the room for a moment and came back so white then he sat down by the fire and nodded his head three times  ginevra i think i know now which theatre it was  amy he asked her coldlybut always the perfect gentleman  ginevra oh that theatre  amy he asked her whether he was to go or she  ginevra they must part  amy yes she went on her knees to him and said are we never to meet again and he replied huskily never then she turned and went slowly towards the door  ginevra clutching her amy was that the end  amy the audience sat still as death listening for the awful click that brings the curtain down  ginevra shivering i seem to hear it  amy at that moment  ginevra yes yes  amy the door opened and ginevra their little childcame inin her nightgown  ginevra quick  amy she came toddling down the stairsshe was barefootedshe took in the whole situation at a glanceand running to her father she said daddy if mother goes away what is to become of me amy gulps and continues and then she took a hand of each and drew them together till they fell on each others breasts and thenoh ginevra thenclickand the curtain fell  ginevra when they are more composed how old was the child  amy five she looked more  ginevra her brows knitted molly is under two isnt she  amy she is not quite twenty months  ginevra she couldnt possibly do it  amy no i thought of that but she couldnt you know even though she was held up mother couldnt help thinking the scene was a good omen though they both look at the ceiling again how still they are  ginevra perhaps she hasnt had the courage to tell  amy if so i must go on with it  ginevra feeling rather small beside amy marry him  amy yes i must dree my weird is it dree your weird or weird your dree  ginevra i think they both do she does not really care nobler thoughts are surging within her amy why cant i make some sacrifice as well as you  amy seems about to make a somewhat grudging reply but the unexpected arrival of the man who has so strangely won her seals her lips  amy you with a depth of meaning oh sir  steve the most nervous of the company i felt i must come miss grey i am in the greatest distress as the unhappy cause of all this trouble  amy coldly you should have thought of that before  steve it was dense of me not to understand soonervery dense he looks at her with wistful eyes must i marry you miss grey  amy curling her lip ah that is what you are sorry for  steve yeshorribly sorry hastily not for myself to tell you the truth id beprecious glad to risk iti think  amy with a glance at ginevra you would  steve but very sorry for you it seems such a shame to youso young and attractiveand the little you know of me sounfortunate  amy you mean you could never love me  steve i dont mean that at all  amy ginevra  indeed ginevra feels that she has been obliterated quite long enough  ginevra with a touch of testiness in her tone amyintroduce me  amy mr stephen rollomiss dunbar miss dunbar knows all  ginevra makes a movement that the cynical might describe as brushing amy aside  ginevra may i ask mr rollo what are your views about woman  steve really i  ginevra is she in your opinion her husbands equal or is she his chattel  steve honestly i am so beside myself  ginevra you evade the question  amy he means chattel ginevra  ginevra mr rollo i am the friend till death of amy grey let that poor child go sir and i am prepared to take her place beside youyes at the altars mouth  amy ginevra  ginevra making that movement again understand i can neither love nor honour youat least at firstbut i will obey you  amy ginevra you take too much upon yourself  ginevra i will make a sacrificei will  amy you shall not  ginevra i feel that i understand this gentleman as no other woman can it is my mission amy the return of alice is what prevents steves seizing his hat and flying it might not have had this effect had he seen the ladys face just before she opened the door  alice putting her hand to her poor heart you have come here steve oh no it is not possible  steve looking things unutterable how could i help coming  amy to the rescue mother have youdid you  alice meekly i have told him all  steve the colonel  alice bows her bruised head  amy conducting her to a seat brave brave what has he decided  alice he hasnt decided yet he is thinking out what it will be best to do  steve he knows then i am no longer his unfinished sentence seems to refer to amy  amy proudly yes sir as he knows you are as far as i am concerned now free  ginevra in a murmur its almost a pity she turns to her amy at least amy this makes you and me friends again we have never quite been able to understand what this meant but amy knows for she puts ginevras hand to her sweet lips  alice who somehow could do without ginevra tonight cosmo is waiting for you miss dunbar to see you home  ginevra with a disquieting vision of her landlady i must go she gives her hand in the coldest way to mrs grey then with a curtsey to steve that he can surely never forget mr rollo i am sure there is much good in you darling amy i shall be round first thing in the morning  steve now that she has gone can wehave a talk  alice looking down yes steve  amy gently mother what was that you called him  alice dear amy i forgot yes mr rollo  steve then alice  amy this ladys name if i am not greatly mistaken is mrs grey is it not so mother  alice yes amy  steve as you will but it is most important that i say certain things to her at once  alice oh mr rollo what do you think dear  amy reflecting if it be clearly understood that this is goodbye i consent please be as brief as possible  somehow they think that she is moving to the door but she crosses only to the other side of the room and sits down with a book one of them likes this very much  steve who is not the one but i want to see her alone  amy the dearest of little gaolers that i am afraid i cannot permit it is not that i have not perfect confidence in you mother but you must see i am acting wisely  alice yes amy  steve to his alice what has come over you you dont seem to be the same woman  amy that is just it she is not  alice i see now only through amys eyes  amy they will not fail you mother proceed sir  steve has to make the best of it  steve you told him then about your feelings for me  alice studying the carpet he knows now exactly what are my feelings for you  steve huskily how did he take it  alice need you ask  steve poor old boy i suppose he wishes me to stay away from your house now  alice is it unreasonable  steve no of course not but  alice will it be terribly hard to you stmr rollo  steve it isnt that you see im fond of the colonel i really am and it hurts me to think he thinks that iit wasnt my fault was it  amy ungenerous  alice he quite understands that it was i who lost my head  steve is much moved by the generosity of this he lowers his voice  steve of course i blame myself now but i assure you honestly i had no idea of it until tonight i had thought you were only my friend it dazed me but as i ransacked my mind many little things came back to me i remembered what i hadnt noticed at the time  amy louder please  steve i remembered  amy is this necessary  alice please amy let me know what he remembered  steve i remembered that your voice was softer to me than when you were addressing other men  alice let me look long at you mr rollo she looks long at him  amy mother enough  alice what more do you remember  steve it is strange to me now that i didnt understand your true meaning today when you said i was the only man you couldnt flirt with you meant that i aroused deeper feelings  alice how you know me  amy not the best of you mother  alice no not the best amy  steve i can say that i never thought of myself as possessing dangerous qualities i thought i was utterly unattractive to women  alice you must have known about your eyes  steve eagerly my eyes on my soul i didnt  amy wonders if this can be true alice rises she feels that she cannot control herself much longer  alice steve if you dont go away at once i shall scream  steve really unhappy is it as bad as that  amy rising you heard what mrs grey said this is very painful to her will you please say goodbye  in the novel circumstances he does not quite know how this should be carried out  alice also shy how shall we do it amy on the brow  amy no motherwith the hand  they do it with the hand and it is thus that the colonel finds them he would be unable to keep his countenance were it not for a warning look from alice  colonel one of the men who have a genius for saying the right thing ha  steve i am going colonel i am very sorry that youat the same time i wish you to understand that the fault is entirely mine  colonel guardedly ha  amy putting an arm round her mother who hugs it father he came only to say goodbye he is not a bad man and mother has behaved magnificently  colonel cleverly ha  amy you must not you shall not be cruel to her  alice darling amy  colonel truculently oh mustnt i we shall see about that  steve come come colonel  colonel doing better than might have been expected hold your tongue sir  amy i know mother as no other person can know her i begin to think that you have no proper appreciation of her father  alice basely dear dear amy  amy i daresay she has often suffered in the past  alice oh amy oh  amy by youryour callousnessyour want of sympathyyour neglect  alice my beloved child  colonel uneasily alice tell her it isnt so  alice you hear what he says my pet  amy but you dont deny it  colonel deny it woman  alice robert robert  amy and please not to call my mother woman in my presence  colonel iii he looks for help from alice but she gives him only a twinkle of triumph he barks child go to your room  amy her worst fears returning but what are you going to do  colonel that is not your affair  steve i must say i dont see that  amy gratefully thank you mr rollo  colonel go to your room  she has to go but not till she has given her mother a kiss that is a challenge to the world then to the bewilderment of steve two human frames are rocked with laughter  alice oh robert look at him he thinks i worship him  colonel steve you colossal puppy  steve ehwhatwhy  alice steve tell robert about my voice being softer to you than to other men tell him steve about your eyes  the unhappy youth gropes mentally and physically  steve good heavens was there nothing in it  colonel my boy ill never let you hear the end of this  steve but if theres nothing in it how could your daughter have thought  colonel she saw you kiss alice here this afternoon you scoundrel and as she thought make an assignation with you there it all came out of that she is a sentimental lady is our amy and she has been too often to the theatre  steve let me think  colonel here is a chair for the very purpose now think hard  steve butbutthen why did you pretend before her alice  alice because she thinks that she has saved me and it makes her so happy amy has a passionate desire to be of some use in this world she knows so well and she already sees her sphere steve it is to look after me i am not to be her chaperone it is she who is to be mine i have submitted you see  colonel fidgeting she seems to have quite given me up for you  alice blandly oh yes robert quite  steve gloomily you will excuse my thinking only of myself what an ass ive been  alice is it a blow steve  steve its a come down ass ass ass but i say alice im awfully glad its i who have been the ass and not you i really am colonel you see the tragedy of my life is im such an extraordinarily ordinary sort of fellow that though every man i know says some lady has loved him there never in all my unromantic life was a woman who cared a christmas card for me it often makes me lonely and so when i thought such a glorious woman as you alicei lost touch of earth altogether but now ive fallen back on it with a whack but im gladyes im glad you two kindest people steve rollo has ever knownoh i say goodnight i suppose you cant overlook it alice  alice oh yes you goose i can we are both fond of youmr rollo  colonel come in

to admire your orbs but you mustnt come hereuntil amy thinks it is safe for me when he has gone she adds until i think it is safe for amy  colonel when will that be  alice not for some time  colonel he isnt a bad sort steve  alice oh noshe might even do worse some day but she is to be my little girl for a long time first  colonel this will give him a sort of glamour to her you know  alice you are not really thinking robert that my amy is to fall asleep tonight before she hears the whole true story could i sleep until she knows everything  colonel stupid of me i am a little like steve in one way though i dont understand why you have kept it up so long  alice it isnt the first time you have thought me a harumscarum  colonel it isnt  alice the sheer fun of it robert went to my head i suppose and then you see the more amy felt herself to be my protectress the more she seemed to love me i am afraid i have a weakness for the short cuts to being loved  colonel im afraid you have the one thing you didnt think of is that the more she loves you the less love she seems to have for me  alice how selfish of you robert  colonel suspiciously or was that all part of the plan  alice there was no plan there wasnt time for one but you were certainly rather horrid robert in the way you gloated over me when you saw them take to you i have been gloating a little perhaps in taking them from you  colonel them you are going a little too fast my dear i have still got cosmo and molly  alice for the moment  colonel woman  alice remember amy said you must not call me that  he laughs as he takes her by the shoulders  yes shake me i deserve it  colonel you do indeed and he shakes her with a ferocity that would have startled any sudden visitor no wonder then that it is a shock to cosmo who comes blundering in alice is the first to see him and she turns the advantage to unprincipled account  alice robert dont hurt me oh if cosmo were to see you  cosmo cosmo does see him he says it in a terrible voice probably cosmo has been to a theatre or two himself  alice you here cosmo  she starts back from her assailant  colonel feeling a little foolish i didnt hear you come in  cosmo grimly no im sure you didnt  colonel testily no heroics my boy  cosmo take care father he stands between them which makes his father suddenly grin laugh on sir i dont know what this rows about buthere his arm encircles an undeserving ladythis lady is my mother and i wont have her bullied whats a father compared to a mother  alice cosmo darling cosmo  colonel becoming alarmed my boy it was only a jest alice tell him it was only a jest  alice he says it was only a jest cosmo  cosmo you are a trump to shield him mother he kisses her openly conscious that he is a bit of a trump himself in which view alice most obviously concurs  colonel to his better half you serpent  cosmo sir this language wont do  colonel exasperated you go to bed too  alice he has sent amy to bed already try to love your father cosmo placing many kisses on the spot where he had been slapped try for my sake and try to get amy and molly to do it too sweetly to her husband they will love you in time robert at present they can think only of me darling ill come and see you in bed  cosmo i dont like to leave you with him  alice go my own i promise to call out if i need you  on these terms cosmo departs the longsuffering husband arms folded surveys his unworthy spouse  colonel you are a hussy  alice meekly i suppose i am  colonel mind you i am not going to stand cosmos thinking this of me  alice as if i would allow it for another hour you wont see much of me tonight robert if i sleep at all it will be in amys room  colonel lugubriously you will be taking molly from me tomorrow  alice i feel hopeful that molly too will soon be taking care of me she goes to him in her cajoling way with so many chaperones robert i ought to do well oh my dear dont think that i have learnt no lesson tonight  colonel smiling going to reform at last  alice the most serious of women yes robert the alice you have known is come to an end tomorrow  colonel if she is different tomorrow ill disown her  alice its summer done autumn begun farewell summer we dont know you any more my girl and i are like the little figures in the weatherhouse when amy comes out alice goes in alice sitbythefire henceforth the moon is full tonight robert but it isnt looking for me any more taxis farewelladvance fourwheelers i had a beautiful husband once black as the raven was his hair  colonel stop it  alice pretty robert farewell farewell alice that was its all over my dear i always had a weakness for you but now you must really go make way there for the old lady  colonel woman youll make me cry go to your amy  alice robert  colonel go go go  as he roars it amy peeps in anxiously she is in her nightgown and her hair is down and her feet are bare and she does not look so very much more than five alice is unable to resist the temptation  alice wailing must i go robert  amy going away mother father if mother goes away what is to become of me  she draws them together until their hands clasp there is now a beatific smile on her face the curtain sees that its time has come it clicks and falls  the end
