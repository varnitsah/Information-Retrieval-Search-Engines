brother you must go to him immediately  servant  mr fouldes his valet is in the all will your ladyship speak with him  lady mereston  mr fouldes is more difficult to see than a cabinet minister send his servant to me  servant  very good miladi  exit servant and presently thompson mr fouldes man comes in  thompson  your ladyship wished to see me  lady mereston  good evening thompson i hope you had a comfortable journey  thompson  yes my lady mr fouldes always has a comfortable journey  lady mereston  was the sea calm when you crossed  thompson  yes my lady mr fouldes would look upon it as a great liberty if the sea was not calm  lady mereston  will you tell mr fouldes that i should like to see him at once  thompson  looking at his watch excuse me my lady but mr fouldes said no one was to disturb him till ten oclock its more than my place is worth to go to him at five minutes to  lady mereston  but what on earths he doing  thompson  i dont know at all my lady  lady mereston  how long have you been with mr fouldes  thompson  twentyfive years my lady  lady mereston  i should have thought you knew how he spent every minute of his day  paradine comes in he is a very welldressed man of fortyodd selfpossessed worldly urbane he is never at a loss or put out of countenance he overhears lady merestons last words  fouldes  when i engaged thompson i told him the first thing he must learn was the very difficult feat of keeping his eyes open and shut at one and the same time  lady mereston  my dear paradine ive been waiting to see you for the last two hours how tiresome you are  fouldes  you may give me a kiss maud but dont be rough  lady mereston  kissing his cheek you ridiculous creature you really might have come to see me at once  fouldes  my dear you cannot grudge me a little repose after a long and tedious journey i had to repair the ravages to my person caused by twentyseven hours in the train  lady mereston  dont be so absurd im sure your person is never ravished  fouldes  ravaged my dear ravaged i should look upon it as an affectation at my age if i were not a little upset by the journey from london to monte carlo  lady mereston  ill be bound you ate a very hearty dinner  fouldes  thompson did i eat any dinner at all  thompson  stolidly soup sir  fouldes  i remember looking at it  thompson  fish sir  fouldes  i trifled with a fried sole  thompson  bouchées à la reine sir  fouldes  they have left absolutely no impression upon me  thompson  tournedos à la splendide  fouldes  they were distinctly tough thompson you must lodge a complaint in the proper quarter  thompson  roast pheasant sir  fouldes  yes yes now you mention it i do remember the pheasant  thompson  chocolate ice sir  fouldes  it was too cold thompson it was distinctly too cold  lady mereston  my dear paradine i think you dined uncommonly well  fouldes  i have reached an age when love ambition and wealth pale into insignificance beside a really wellgrilled steak thatll do thompson  thompson  very well sir              he goes out  lady mereston  its too bad of you paradine to devour a substantial meal when im eating out my very heart with anxiety  fouldes  it seems to agree with you very well ive not seen you look better for years  lady mereston  for heavens sake be serious and listen to me  fouldes  i started immediately i got your telegram pray tell me what i can do for you  lady mereston  my dear paradine charlies head over ears in love  fouldes  its not altogether an unexpected condition for a young man of twentytwo if the ladys respectable marry him and resign yourself to being a dowager if shes not give her five hundred pounds and pack her off to paris or london or wherever else she habitually practises her arts and graces  lady mereston  i wish i could but who dyou think it is  fouldes  my dear theres nothing i detest more than riddles i can imagine quite a number of fair ladies who would look without disdain upon a young marquess with fifty thousand a year  lady mereston  lady frederick berolles  fouldes  by jupiter  lady mereston  shes fifteen years older than he is  fouldes  then shes not old enough to be his mother which is a distinct advantage  lady mereston  she dyes her hair  fouldes  she dyes it uncommonly well  lady mereston  she paints  fouldes  much better than a royal academician  lady mereston  and poor charlies simply infatuated he rides with her all the morning motors with her all the afternoon and gambles with her half the night i never see him  fouldes  but why should you think lady frederick cares two straws for him  lady mereston  dont be ridiculous paradine every one knows she hasnt a penny and shes crippled with debts  fouldes  one has to keep up appearances in this world life nowadays for the woman of fashion is a dilemma of which one horn is the bankruptcy court and the otherdear sir francis jeune  lady mereston  i wish i knew how she manages to dress so beautifully its one of the injustices of fate that clothes only hang on a woman really well when shes lost every shred of reputation  fouldes  my dear you must console yourself with the thought that shell probably frizzle for it hereafter  lady mereston  i hope im not wicked paradine but to wear draperies and wings in the next world offers me no compensation for looking dowdy in a paquin gown in this  fouldes  i surmised she was on the verge of bankruptcy when i heard shed bought a new motor and you seriously think charlie wants to marry her  lady mereston  im sure of it  fouldes  and what dyou want me to do  lady mereston  good heavens i want you to prevent it after all he has a magnificent position hes got every chance of making a career for himself theres no reason why he shouldnt be prime ministerits not fair to the boy to let him marry a woman like that  fouldes  of course you know lady frederick  lady mereston  my dear paradine were the greatest friends you dont suppose im going to give her the advantage of quarrelling with me i think i shall ask her to luncheon to meet you  fouldes  women have such an advantage over men in affairs of this sort theyre troubled by no scruples and like george washington never hesitate to lie  lady mereston  i look upon her as an abandoned creature and i tell you frankly i shall stop at nothing to save my son from her clutches  fouldes  only a thoroughly good woman could so calmly announce her intention of using the crookedest ways to gain her ends  lady mereston  looking at him there must be some incident in her career which she wouldnt like raked up if we could only get hold of that  fouldes  blandly how dyou imagine i can help you  lady mereston  a reformed burglar is always the best detective  fouldes  my dear i wish you could be frank without being sententious  lady mereston  youve run through two fortunes and if we all got our deserts you would be starving now instead of being richer than ever  fouldes  my second cousins have a knack of dying at the psychological moment  lady mereston  youve been a horrid dissipated wretch all your life and heaven knows the disreputable people whove been your bosom friends  fouldes  with my knowledge of the world and your entire lack of scruple we should certainly be a match for one defenceless woman  lady mereston  looking at him sharply common report says that at one time you were very much in love with her  fouldes  common report is an ass whose long ears only catch its own braying  lady mereston  i was wondering how far things went if you could tell charlie of the relations between you  fouldes  my good maud there were no relationsunfortunately  lady mereston  poor george was very uneasy about you at the time  fouldes  your deceased husband being a strictly religious man made a point of believing the worst about his neighbours  lady mereston  dont paradine i know you didnt like one another but remember that i loved him with all my heart i shall never get over his death  fouldes  my dear girl you know i didnt mean to wound you  lady mereston  after all it was largely your fault he was deeply religious and as the president of the broad church union he couldnt countenance your mode of life  fouldes  with great unction thank god in my day ive been a miserable sinner  lady mereston  laughing youre quite incurable paradine but you will help me now since his fathers death the boy and i have lived a very retired life and now were quite helpless it would break my heart if charlie married that woman  fouldes  ill do my best i think i can promise you that nothing will come of it       the door is flung open and lady frederick enters followed by      mereston a young boyish man of twentytwo by her brother sir      gerald omara a handsome fellow of sixandtwenty by captain      montgomerie admiral carlisle and rose his daughter lady      frederick is a handsome irish woman of thirty to thirtyfive      beautifully dressed she is very vivacious and lighthearted she      has all the irish recklessness and unconcern for the morrow      whenever she wants to get round anybody she falls into an irish      brogue and then as she knows very well she is quite      irresistible captain montgomerie is a polished wellgroomed man      of thirtyfive with suave manners the admiral is bluff and      downright rose is a pretty ingénue of nineteen  lady mereston  here they are  lady frederick  enthusiastically going to him with open arms paradine paradine paradine  mererston  oh my prophetic soul mine uncle  fouldes  shaking hands with lady frederick i heard you were at the casino  lady frederick  charlie lost all his money so i brought him away  lady mereston  i wish you wouldnt gamble charlie dear  mererston  my dear mother ive only lost ten thousand francs  lady frederick  to paradine fouldes i see youre in your usual robust health  fouldes  you neednt throw it in my face i shall probably be very unwell tomorrow  lady frederick  dyou know admiral carlisle this is my brother gerald  fouldes  shaking hands how dyou do  lady frederick  introducing captain montgomerie  captain montgomerie  i think weve met before  fouldes  im very pleased to hear it how dyou do to mererston are you having a good time in monte carlo charles  mererston  a 1 thanks  fouldes  and what do you do with yourself  mererston  oh hang about generally you knowand theres always the tables  fouldes  thats right my boy im glad to see that you prepare yourself properly for your duties as a hereditary legislator  mererston  laughing oh shut it uncle paradine  fouldes  i rejoice also to find that you have already a certain command of the vernacular  mererston  well if you can browbeat a london cabby and hold your own in repartee with a barmaid it oughtnt to be difficult to get on all right in the house of lords  fouldes  but let me give you a solemn warning you have a magnificent chance dear boy with all the advantages of wealth and station i beseech you not to throw it away by any exhibition of talent the field is clear and the british people are waiting for a leader but remember that the british people like their leaders dull capacity they mistrust versatility they cannot bear and wit they utterly abhor look at the fate of poor lord parnaby his urbanity gained him the premiership but his brilliancy overthrew him how could the fortunes of the nation be safe with a man whose speeches were pointed and sparkling whose mind was so quick so agile that it reminded you of a fencers play every one is agreed that lord parnaby is flippant and unsubstantial we doubt his principles and we have grave fears about his morality take warning my dear boy take warning let the sprightly epigram never lighten the long periods of your speech nor the attic salt flavour the roast beef of your conversation be careful that your metaphors show no imagination and conceal your brains as you would a discreditable secret above all if you have a sense of humour crush it crush it  mereston  my dear uncle you move me very much i will be as stupid as an owl  fouldes  theres a good brave boy  mereston  i will be heavy and tedious  fouldes  i see already the riband of the garter adorning your shirtfront remember theres no damned merit about that  mereston  none shall listen to my speeches without falling into a profound sleep  fouldes  seizing his hand the premiership itself is within your grasp  lady mereston  dear paradine let us take a stroll on the terrace before we go to bed  fouldes  and you shall softly whisper all the latest scandal in my ear              he puts on her cloak and they go out  lady frederick  may i speak to you admiral  admiral  certainly certainly what can i do for you              while lady frederick and the admiral talk             the others go slowly out through the             conversation she uses her irish brogue  lady frederick  are you in a good temper  admiral  fairly fairly  lady frederick  im glad of that because i want to make you a proposal of marriage  admiral  my dear lady frederick you take me entirely by surprise  lady frederick  laughing not on my own behalf you know  admiral  oh i see  lady frederick  the fact is my brother gerald has asked your daughter to marry him and she has accepted  admiral  rose is a minx lady frederick and shes much too young to marry  lady frederick  now dont fly into a passion

buying a place in ireland you couldnt want anything nicer than geraldsgravel soil you know and you simply dote on elizabethan architecture  admiral  i cant bear it  lady frederick  how fortunate then that the house was burnt down in the eighteenth century and rebuilt in the best georgian style  admiral  ugh  lady frederick  and youd love to have little grandsons to dandle on your knee  admiral  how do i know they wouldnt be girls  lady frederick  oh its most unusual in our family  admiral  i tell you i wont hear of it  lady frederick  you know its not bad to have the oldest baronetcy in the country but one  admiral  i suppose i shall have to pack rose off to england  lady frederick  and break her heart  admiral  womens hearts are like old china none the worse for a break or two  lady frederick  did you ever know my husband admiral  admiral  yes  lady frederick  i was married to him at seventeen because my mother thought it a good match and i was desperately in love with another man before wed been married a fortnight he came home blind drunk and i had never seen a drunken man before then i found out he was a confirmed tippler i was so ashamed if you only knew what my life was for the ten years i lived with him ive done a lot of foolish things in my time but my god i have suffered  admiral  yes i know i know  lady frederick  and believe me when two young things love one another its better to let them marry love is so very rare in this world one really ought to make the most of it when its there  admiral  im very sorry but ive made up my mind  lady frederick  ah but wont you alter itlike nelson dont be hard on rose shes really in love with gerald do give them a chance wont you ah dotheres a dear  admiral  i dont want to hurt your feelings but sir gerald is about the most ineligible young man that ive ever come across  lady frederick  triumphantly there i knew we should agree thats precisely what i told him this morning  admiral  i understand his place is heavily mortgaged  lady frederick  no one will lend a penny more on it if they would gerald would borrow it at once  admiral  hes got nothing but his pay to live upon  lady frederick  and his tastes are very extravagant  admiral  hes a gambler  lady frederick  yes but then hes so good looking  admiral  eh  lady frederick  im glad that we agree so entirely about him now theres nothing left but to call the young things in join their hands and give them our united blessing  admiral  before i consent to this marriage madam ill see your brother  lady frederick  damned  admiral  yes madam damned  lady frederick  now listen to me quietly will you  admiral  i should warn you lady frederick that when i once make up my mind about a thing i never change it  lady frederick  now that is what i really admire i like a man of character you know ive always been impressed by your strength and determination  admiral  i dont know about that but when i say a thing i do it  lady frederick  yes i know and in five minutes youre going to say that gerald may marry your pretty rose  admiral  no no no  lady frederick  now look here dont be obstinate i dont like you when youre obstinate  admiral  im not obstinate im firm  lady frederick  after all gerald has lots of good qualities hes simply devoted to your daughter hes been a little wild but you know you wouldnt give much for a young man who hadnt  admiral  gruffly i dont want a milksop for a soninlaw  lady frederick  as soon as hes married hell settle into a model country squire  admiral  well hes a gambler and i cant get over that  lady frederick  shall he promise you never to play cards again now dont be horrid you dont want to make me utterly wretched do you  admiral  unwillingly well ill tell you what ill dothey shall marry if he doesnt gamble for a year  lady frederick  oh you duck she impulsively throws her arms round his neck and kisses him he is a good deal taken aback i beg your pardon i couldnt help it  admiral  i dont altogether object you know  lady frederick  upon my word in some ways youre rather fascinating  admiral  dyou think so really  lady frederick  i do indeed  admiral  i rather wish that proposal of marriage had been on your own behalf  lady frederick  ah with me dear admiral experience triumphs over hope i must tell the children calling gerald come here rose              gerald and rose come in  lady frederick  i always knew your father was a perfect darling rose  rose  oh papa you are a brick  admiral  i thoroughly disapprove of the marriage my dear butits not easy to say no to lady frederick  gerald  its awfully good of you admiral and ill do my best to make rose a ripping husband  admiral  not so fast young man not so fast theres a condition  rose  oh father  lady frederick  gerald is to behave himself for a year and then you may marry  rose  but wont gerald grow very dull if he behaves himself  lady frederick  i have no doubt of it but dullness is the first requisite of a good husband  admiral  now you must pack off to bed my dear im going to smoke my pipe before turning in  rose  kissing lady frederick goodnight dearest ill never forget your kindness  lady frederick  youd better not thank me till youve been married a few years  rose  holding out her hand to gerald goodnight  gerald  taking it and looking at her goodnight  admiral  gruffly you may as well do it in front of my face as behind my back  rose  lifting up her lips goodnight  he kisses her and the admiral and rose go out  lady frederick  oh lord i wish i were eighteen  she sinks into a chair and an expression of utter weariness comes over her face  gerald  i say whats up  lady frederick  starting i thought youd gone nothing  gerald  come out with it  lady frederick  oh my poor boy if you only knew im so worried that i dont know what on earth to do  gerald  money  lady frederick  last year i made a solemn determination to be economical and its ruined me  gerald  my dear how could it  lady frederick  i cant make it out it seems very unfair the more i tried not to be extravagant the more i spent  gerald  cant you borrow  lady frederick  laughing i have borrowed thats just it  gerald  well borrow again  lady frederick  ive tried to but no ones such a fool as to lend me a penny  gerald  did you say id sign anything they liked  lady frederick  i was so desperate i said wed both sign

laughter by george dont i know it  lady frederick  for heavens sake dont lets talk of my affairs theyre in such a state that if i think of them at all i shall have a violent fit of hysterics  gerald  but look here what dyou really mean  lady frederick  well if you want iti owe my dressmaker seven hundred pounds and last year i signed two horrid bills one for fifteen hundred and the other for two thousand they fall due the day after tomorrow and if i cant raise the money i shall have to go through the bankruptcy court  gerald  by george thats serious  lady frederick  its so serious that i cant help thinking something will happen whenever ive got in a really tight fix something has turned up and put me on my legs again last time aunt elizabeth had an apoplectic fit but of course it wasnt really very profitable because mourning is so desperately expensive  gerald  why dont you marry  lady frederick  oh my dear gerald you know im always unlucky at games of chance  gerald  charlie merestons awfully gone on you  lady frederick  that must be obvious to the meanest intelligence  gerald  well why dont you have him  lady frederick  good heavens im old enough to be his mother  gerald  nonsense youre only ten years older than he is and nowadays no nice young man marries a woman younger than himself  lady frederick  hes such a good fellow i couldnt do him a nasty turn like that  gerald  how about montgomerie he simply stinks of money and hes not a bad sort  lady frederick  surprised my dear boy i hardly know him  gerald  well im afraid it means marriage or bankruptcy  lady frederick  heres charlie take him away theres a dear i want to talk to paradine              enter paradine fouldes with mereston  fouldes  what still here lady frederick  lady frederick  as large as

fouldes  goodnaturedly all i wanted dear boy theres no one so transparent as the person who thinks hes devilish deep by the way whats the time  gerald  about eleven isnt it  fouldes  ah how old are you charlie  mereston  twentytwo  fouldes  then its high time you went to bed  lady frederick  charlies not going to bed till i tell him are you  mereston  of course not  fouldes  has it escaped your acute intelligence my friend that i want to talk to lady frederick  mereston  not at all but i have no reason to believe that lady frederick wants to talk to you  gerald  lets go and have a game of pills charlie  mereston  dyou want to be left alone with the old villain  fouldes  you show no respect for my dyed hairs young man  lady frederick  ive not seen him for years you know  mereston  oh

afternoon  mereston  to lady frederick thatll suit me a 1 i had an engagement but it was quite unimportant  lady frederick  then thats settled goodnight  mereston  goodnight              he goes out with gerald lady frederick             turns and goodhumouredly scrutinises             paradise fouldes  lady frederick  well  fouldes  well  lady frederick  you wear excellently paradine  fouldes  thanks  lady frederick  how do you manage it  fouldes  by getting up late and never going to bed early by eating whatever i like and drinking whenever im thirsty by smoking strong cigars taking no exercise and refusing under any circumstances to be bored  lady frederick  im sorry you had to leave town in such a hurry were you amusing yourself  fouldes  i come to the riviera every year  lady frederick  i daresay but not so early  fouldes  ive never surrendered so far to middle age as to make habits  lady frederick  my dear paradine the day before yesterday lady mereston quite distracted went to the post office and sent you the following wire come at once your help urgently needed charlie in toils designing female maud am i right  fouldes  i never admit even to myself that a welldressed woman is mistaken  lady frederick  so you started posthaste bent upon protecting your nephew and were infinitely surprised to learn that the designing female was no other than your humble servant  fouldes  youd be irresistible lady frederick if you didnt know you were so clever  lady frederick  and now what are you going to do  fouldes  my dear lady im not a police officer but a very harmless inoffensive old bachelor  lady frederick  with more wiles than the mother of many daughters and the subtlety of a company promoter  fouldes  maud seems to think that as ive racketted about a little in my time im just the sort of man to deal with you set a thief to catch a thief dont you know shes rather fond of proverbs  lady frederick  she should have thought rather of when greek meets greek then comes the tug of war i hear lady mereston has been saying the most agreeable things about me  fouldes  ah thats womens fault they always show their hand youre the only woman i ever knew who didnt  lady frederick  with a brogue you should have avoided the blarney stone when you went to ireland  fouldes  look here dyou want to marry charlie  lady frederick  why should i  fouldes  because hes got fifty thousand a year and youre head over ears in debt youve got to raise something like four thousand pounds at once or you go under youve got yourself a good deal talked about during the last ten years but people have stood you because you had plenty of money if you go broke theyll drop you like a hot potato and i daresay it wouldnt be inconvenient to change lady frederick berolles into lady mereston my sister has always led me to believe that it is rather attractive to be a marchioness  lady frederick  unlike a duchess its cheap without being gaudy  fouldes  you asked me why you might want to marry a boy from ten to fifteen years younger than yourself and ive told you  lady frederick  and now perhaps youll tell me why youre going to interfere in my private concerns  fouldes  well you see his mother happens to be my sister and im rather fond of her its true her husband was the most sanctimonious prig ive ever met in my life  lady frederick  i remember him well he was president of the broad church union and wore sidewhiskers  fouldes  but she stuck to me through thick and thin ive been in some pretty tight places in my day and shes always given me a leg up when i wanted it ive got an idea it would just about break her heart if charlie married you  lady frederick  thanks  fouldes  you know i dont want to be offensive but i think it would be a pity myself and besides unless im much mistaken ive got a little score of my own that i want to pay off  lady frederick  have you  fouldes  youve got a good enough memory not to have forgotten that you made a blithering fool of me once i swore id get even with you and by george i mean to do it  lady frederick  laughing and how do you propose to stop me if i make up my mind that im going to accept charlie  fouldes  well hes not proposed yet has he  lady frederick  not yet but ive had to use every trick and device i can think of to prevent him  fouldes  look here im going to play this game with my cards on the table  lady frederick  then i shall be on my guard youre never so dangerous as when you pretend to be frank  fouldes  im sorry you should think so badly of me  lady frederick  i dont only it was a stroke of genius when nature put the soul of a jesuit priest into the body of a yorkshire squire  fouldes  i wonder what youre paying me compliments for you must be rather afraid of me              they look at one another for a moment  lady frederick  well lets look at these cards  fouldes  first of all theres this money youve got to raise  lady frederick  well  fouldes  this is my sisters suggestion  lady frederick  that means you dont much like it  fouldes  if youll refuse the boy and clear outwell give you forty thousand pounds  lady frederick  i suppose youd be rather surprised if i boxed your ears  fouldes  now look here between you and me high falutins rather absurd dont you think so youre in desperate want of money and i dont suppose it would amuse you much to have a young hobbledehoy hanging about your skirts for the rest of your life  lady frederick  very well well have no high falutin you may tell lady mereston that if i really wanted the money i shouldnt be such an idiot as to take forty thousand down when i can have fifty thousand a year for the asking  fouldes  i told her that  lady frederick  you showed great perspicacity now for the second card  fouldes  my dear its no good getting into a paddy over it  lady frederick  ive never been calmer in my life  fouldes  you always had the very deuce of a temper i suppose youve not given charlie a sample of it yet have you  lady frederick  laughing not yet  fouldes  well the second cards your reputation  lady frederick  but i havent got any i thought that such an advantage  fouldes  you see charlie is a young fool he thinks you a paragon of all the virtues and its never occurred to him that youve rather gone the pace in your time  lady frederick  its one of my greatest consolations to think that even a hundred horsepower racing motor couldnt be more rapid than ive been  fouldes  still itll be rather a shock to charlie when he hears that this modest flower whom he trembles to adore has  lady frederick  very nearly eloped with his own uncle but you wont tell him that story because you hate looking a perfect ass  fouldes  madam when duty calls paradine fouldes consents even to look ridiculous but i was thinking of the bellingham affair  lady frederick  ah of course theres the bellingham affair id forgotten it  fouldes  nasty little business that eh  lady frederick  horrid  fouldes  dont you think it would choke him off  lady frederick  i think it very probable  fouldes  well hadnt you better cave in  lady frederick  ringing the bell ah but youve not seen my cards yet a servant enters tell my servant to bring down the despatchbox which is on my writingtable  servant  yes miladi              exit  fouldes  whats up now  lady frederick  well four or five years ago i was staying at this hotel and mimi la bretonne had rooms here  fouldes  i never heard of the lady but her name suggests that she had an affectionate nature  lady frederick  she was a little singer at the folies bergères and she had the loveliest emeralds i ever saw  fouldes  but you dont know mauds  lady frederick  the late lord mereston had a passion for emeralds he always thought they were such pure stones  fouldes  quickly i beg your pardon  lady frederick  well mimi fell desperately ill and there was no one to look after her of course the pious english ladies in the hotel wouldnt go within a mile of her so i went and did the usual thing dont you know              lady fredericks man comes in with a small             despatchbox which he places on a table he             goes out lady frederick as she talks             unlocks it  fouldes  thank god im a bachelor and no ministering angel ever smoothes my pillow when i particularly want to be left alone  lady frederick  i nursed her more or less through the whole illness and afterwards she fancied she owed me her worthless little life she wanted to give me the precious emeralds and when i refused was so heartbroken that i said id take one thing if i might  fouldes  and what was that  lady frederick  a bundle of letters id seen the address on the back of the envelope and then i recognised the writing i thought theyd be much safer in my hands than in hers she takes them out of the box and hands them to paradine here they are              he looks and starts violently  fouldes  89 grosvenor square its merestons writing you dont mean what ah ah ah he bursts into a shout of laughter the old sinner and mereston wouldnt have me in the house if you please because i was a dissolute libertine and he was the president of the broad church union good lord how often have i heard him say gentlemen i take my stand on the morality the cleanliness and the purity of english family life oh oh oh  lady frederick  ive often noticed that the religious temperament is very susceptible to the charms of my sex  fouldes  may i look  lady frederick  well i dont know i suppose so  fouldes  reading hearts delight and he signs himself your darling chickabiddy the old ruffian  lady frederick  she was a very pretty little thing  fouldes  i daresay but thank heaven i have some sense of decency left and it outrages all my susceptibilities that a man in sidewhiskers should call himself anybodys chickabiddy  lady frederick  protestations of undying affection are never ridiculous when they are accompanied by such splendid emeralds  fouldes  starting and growing suddenly serious and what about maud  lady frederick  well  fouldes  poor girl itd simply break her heart he preached at her steadily for twenty years and she worshipped the very ground he trod on shed have died of grief at his death except she felt it her duty to go on with his work  lady frederick  i know  fouldes  by jove its a good card you were quite right to refuse the emeralds these letters are twice as valuable  lady frederick  would you like to burn them  fouldes  betsy  lady frederick  theres the stove put them in              he takes them up in both hands and hurries to             the stove but he stops and brings them             back he throws them on the sofa  fouldes  no i wont  lady frederick  why not  fouldes  its too dooced generous ill fight you tooth and nail but its not fair to take an advantage over me like that youll bind my hands with fetters  lady frederick  very well youve had your chance  fouldes  but by jove you must have a good hand to throw away a card like that what have you gota straight flush  lady frederick  i may be only bluffing you know  fouldes  lord it does me good to hear your nice old irish brogue again  lady frederick  faith and does it  fouldes  i believe you only put it on to get over people  lady frederick  smiling begorrah its not easy to get over you  fouldes  lord i was in love with you once wasnt i  lady frederick  not more than lots of other people have been  fouldes  and you did treat me abominably  lady frederick  ah thats what they all said but you got over it very well  fouldes  i didnt my digestion was permanently impaired by your brutal treatment  lady frederick  is that why you went to carlsbad afterwards instead of the rocky mountains  fouldes  you may laugh but the fact remains that ive only been in love once and that was with you  lady frederick  smiling as she holds out her hand goodnight  fouldes  for all that im going to fight you now for all im worth  lady frederick  im not frightened of you paradine  fouldes  goodnight              as he goes out captain montgomerie enters  lady frederick  yawning and stretching her arms oh im so sleepy  captain montgomerie  im sorry for that i wanted to have a talk with you  lady frederick  smiling i daresay i can keep awake for five minutes you knowespecially if you offer me a cigarette  captain montgomerie  here you are              he hands her his case and lights her cigarette  lady frederick  with a sigh oh what a comfort  captain montgomerie  i wanted to tell you i had a letter this morning from my solicitor to say that hes just bought crowley castle on my behalf  lady frederick  really but its a lovely place you must ask me to come and stay  captain montgomerie  i should like you to stay there indefinitely  lady frederick  with a quick look thats charming of you but i never desert my london long  captain montgomerie  smiling i have a very nice house in portman square  lady frederick  surprised really  captain montgomerie  and im thinking of going into parliament at the next election  lady frederick  it appears to be a very delightful pastime to govern the british nation dignified without being laborious  captain montgomerie  lady frederick although ive been in the service i have rather a good head for business and i hate beating about the bush i wanted to ask you to marry me  lady frederick  its nice of you not to make a fuss about it im very much obliged but im afraid i cant  captain montgomerie  why not  lady frederick  well you see i dont know you  captain montgomerie  we could spend the beginning of our married life so usefully in making one anothers acquaintance  lady frederick  it would be rather late in the day then to come to the conclusion that we couldnt bear the sight of one another  captain montgomerie  shall i send my bankers book so that you may see that my antecedents are respectable and my circumstancessuch as to inspire affection  lady frederick  i have no doubt it would be very interestingbut not to me              she makes as if to go  captain montgomerie  ah dont go yet wont you give me some reason  lady frederick  if you insist im not in the least in love with you  captain montgomerie  dyou think that much matters  lady frederick  youre a friend of geralds and he says youre a very good sort but i really cant marry every one that gerald rather likes  captain montgomerie  he said hed put in a good word for me  lady frederick  if i ever marry again it shall be to please myself not to please my brother  captain montgomerie  i hope i shall induce you to alter your mind  lady frederick  im afraid i can give you no hope of that  captain montgomerie  you know when i determine to do a thing i generally do it  lady frederick  that sounds very like a threat  captain montgomerie  you may take it as such if you please  lady frederick  and youve made up your mind that youre going to marry me  captain montgomerie  quite  lady frederick  well ive made up mine that you shant so were quits  captain montgomerie  why dont you talk to your brother about it  lady frederick  because its no business of his  captain montgomerie  isnt it ask him  lady frederick  what do you mean by that  captain montgomerie  ask him goodnight  lady frederick  goodnight he goes out lady frederick goes to the french window that leads to the terrace and calls gerald  gerald  hulloa              he appears and comes into the room  lady frederick  did you know that captain montgomerie was going to propose to me  gerald  yes  lady frederick  is there any reason why i should marry him  gerald  only that i owe him nine hundred pounds  lady frederick  aghast oh why didnt you tell me  gerald  you were so worried i couldnt oh ive been such a fool i tried to make a coup for roses sake  lady frederick  is it a gambling debt  gerald  yes  lady frederick  ironically what they call a debt of honour  gerald  i must pay it the day after tomorrow without fail  lady frederick  but thats the day my two bills fall due and if you dont  gerald  i shall have to send in my papers and i shall lose rosie and then i shall blow out my silly brains  lady frederick  but who is the man  gerald  hes the son of aaron levitzki the moneylender  lady frederick  halfcomic halfaghast oh lord   end of the first act     the second act        the scene is the same as in act i admiral carlisle is sleeping      in an armchair with a handkerchief over his face rose is sitting      on a grandfathers chair and gerald is leaning over the back   rose  isnt papa a perfectly adorable chaperon              the admiral snores  gerald  perfectly              a pause  rose  ive started fifteen topics of conversation in the last quarter of an hour gerald  gerald  smiling have you  rose  you always agree with me and theres an end of it so i have to rack my brains again  gerald  all you say is so very wise and sensible of course i agree  rose  i wonder if youll think me sensible and wise in ten years  gerald  im quite sure i shall  rose  why then im afraid we shant cultivate any great brilliancy of repartee  gerald  be good sweet maid and let who will be clever  rose  oh dont say that when a mans in love he at once makes a pedestal of the ten commandments and stands on the top of them with his arms akimbo when a womans in love she doesnt care two straws for thou shalt and thou shalt not  gerald  when a womans in love she can put her heart on the slide of a microscope and examine how it beats when a mans in love what do you think he cares for science and philosophy and all the rest of it  rose  when a mans in love he can only write sonnets to the moon when a womans in love she can still cook his dinner and darn her own stockings  gerald  i wish you wouldnt cap all my observations              she lifts up her face and he kisses her lips  rose  im beginning to think youre rather nice you know  gerald  thats reassuring at all events  rose  but no one could accuse you of being a scintillating talker  gerald  have you ever watched the lovers in the park sitting on the benches hour after hour without saying a word  rose  why  gerald  because ive always thought that they must be bored to the verge of tears now i know theyre only happy  rose  youre certainly my soldier so i suppose im your nurserymaid  gerald  you know when i was at trinity college dublin  rose  interrupting were you there i thought you went to oxford  gerald  no why  rose  only all my people go to magdalen  gerald  yes  rose  and ive decided that if i ever have a son he shall go there too              the admiral starts and pulls the handkerchief             off his face the others do not notice him             he is aghast and astounded at the conversation             lady frederick comes in later and             stands smiling as she listens  gerald  my darling you know i hate to thwart you in any way but ive quite made up my mind that my son shall go to dublin as i did  rose  im awfully sorry gerald but the boy must be educated like a gentleman  gerald  there i quite agree rose but first of all hes an irishman and its right that he should be educated in ireland  rose  darling gerald a mothers love is naturally the safest guide in these things  gerald  dearest rose a fathers wisdom is always the most reliable  lady frederick  pardon my interfering butarent you just a little previous  admiral  bursting out did you ever hear such a conversation in your life between a young unmarried couple  rose  my dear papa we must be prepared for everything  admiral  in my youth young ladies did not refer to things of that sort  lady frederick  well i dont suppose theyre any the worse for having an elementary knowledge of natural history personally i doubt whether ignorance is quite the same thing as virtue and im not quite sure that a girl makes a better wife because shes been brought up like a perfect fool  admiral  i am oldfashioned lady frederick and my idea of a modest girl is that when certain topics are mentioned she should swoon swoon madam swoon they always did it when i was a lad  rose  well father ive often tried to faint when i wanted something that you wouldnt give me and ive never been able to manage it so im sure i couldnt swoon  admiral  and with regard to this ridiculous discussion as to which university your son is to be sent you seem to forget that i have the right to be consulted  gerald  my dear admiral i dont see how it can possibly matter to you  admiral  and before we go any further i should like you to know that the very day rose was born i determined that her son should go to cambridge  rose  my dear papa i think gerald and i are far and away the best judges of our sons welfare  admiral  the boy must work rose i will have no goodfornothing as my grandson  gerald  exactly and that is why im resolved he shall go to dublin  rose  the important thing is that he should have really nice manners and that they teach at oxford if they teach nothing else  lady frederick  well dont you think youd better wait another twenty years or so before you discuss this  admiral  there are some matters which must be settled at once lady frederick  lady frederick  you know young things are fairly independent nowadays i dont know what theyll be in twenty years time  gerald  the first thing the boy shall learn is obedience  rose certainly theres nothing so hateful as a disobedient child  admiral  i cant see my grandson venturing to disobey me  lady frederick  then youre all agreed so thats settled i came to tell you your carriage was ready  admiral  go and put on your bonnet rose to lady frederick are you coming with us  lady frederick  im afraid i cant au revoir  admiral  a tout à lheure              he and rose go out  gerald  have you ever seen in your life any one so entirely delightful as rose  lady frederick  laughing only when ive looked in the glass  gerald  my dear elizabeth how vain you are  lady frederick  youre very happy my gerald  gerald  its such a relief to have got over all the difficulties i thought it never would come right you are a brick elizabeth  lady frederick  i really think i am rather  gerald  the moment you promised to arrange things i felt as safe as a house  lady frederick  i said id do my best didnt i and i told you not to worry  gerald  turning round suddenly isnt it all right  lady frederick  no its about as wrong as it can possibly be i knew cohen was staying here and i thought i could get him to hold the bills over for a few days  gerald  and wont he  lady frederick  he hasnt got them any more  gerald  startled what  lady frederick  theyve been negotiated and he swears he doesnt know who has them  gerald  but who could have been such a fool  lady frederick  i dont know thats just the awful part of it it was bad enough before i knew the worst cohen could do but now it couldnt be paradine  gerald  and then theres montgomerie  lady frederick  i shall see him today  gerald  what are you going to say to him  lady frederick  i havent an idea im rather frightened of him  gerald  you know dear if the worst comes to the worst  lady frederick  whatever happens you shall marry rose i promise you that              paradine fouldes appears  fouldes  may i come in  lady frederick  gaily its a public room i dont see how we can possibly prevent you  gerald  im just going to take a stroll  lady frederick  do              he goes out  fouldes  well how are things going  lady frederick  quite well thank you  fouldes  ive left charlie with his mother i hope you can spare him for a couple of hours  lady frederick  i told him he must spend the afternoon with her i dont approve of his neglecting his filial duty  fouldes  ah i saw dick cohen this morning  lady frederick  quickly did you  fouldes  it seems to interest you  lady frederick  not at all why should it  fouldes  smiling nice little man isnt he  lady frederick  good humouredly i wish i had something to throw at you  fouldes  with a laugh well i havent got the confounded bills i was too late  lady frederick  did you try  fouldes  ohyes i thought it would interest charlie to know how extremely needful it was for you to marry him  lady frederick  then who on earth has got them  fouldes  i havent an idea but they must make you very uncomfortable three thousand five hundred eh  lady frederick  dont say it all at once it sounds so much  fouldes  you wouldnt like to exchange those letters of merestons for seven thousand pounds would you  lady frederick  laughing no  fouldes  ah by the way dyou mind if i tell charlie the full story of yourrelations with me  lady frederick  why should i its not i wholl look ridiculous  fouldes  thanks i may avail myself of your permission  lady frederick  i daresay youve noticed that charlie has a very keen sense of humour  fouldes  if youre going to be disagreeable to me i shall go he stops i say are you quite sure theres nothing else that can be brought up against you  lady frederick  laughing quite sure thanks  fouldes  my sisters very jubilant today what about the bellingham affair  lady frederick  merely scandal my friend  fouldes  well look out shes a woman and shell stick at nothing  lady frederick  i wonder why you warn me  fouldes  for the sake of old times my dear  lady frederick  youre growing sentimental paradine its the punishment which the gods inflict on a cynic when he grows old  fouldes  it may be but for the life of me i cant forget that once  lady frederick  interrupting my dear friend dont rake up my lamentable past  fouldes  i dont think ive met any one so entirely devoid of sentiment as you are  lady frederick  let us agree that i have every vice under the sun and have done with it              a servant comes in  servant  madame claude wishes to see your ladyship  lady frederick  oh my dressmaker  fouldes  another bill  lady frederick

polite to people whose bills one cant pay  lady frederick  show her in  servant  yes miladi              exit servant  fouldes  is it a big one  lady frederick  oh no only seven hundred pounds

 fouldes  and youve got a footman  lady frederick  ive always had a footman and my mother always had a footman i couldnt live a day without him  fouldes  what does he do for you  lady frederick  he inspires confidence in tradesmen  fouldes  and you have the most expensive suite of rooms in the hotel  lady frederick  im in such a dreadful mess if i hadnt got nice rooms i should brood over it  fouldes  then as if that werent enough you fling your money away at the tables  lady frederick  when youre as poor as i am a few louis more or less can make absolutely no difference  fouldes  with a laugh youre quite incorrigible  lady frederick  its really not my fault i do try to be economical but money slips through my fingers like water i cant help it  fouldes  you want a sensible sort of a man to look after you  lady frederick  i want a very rich sort of a man to look after me  fouldes  if you were my wife i should advertise in the papers that i wasnt responsible for your debts  lady frederick  if you were my husband id advertise immediately underneath that i wasnt responsible for your manners  fouldes  i wonder why youre so reckless  lady frederick  when my husband was alive i was so utterly wretched and afterwards when i looked forward to a little happiness my boy died then i didnt care any more i did everything i could to stupefy myself i squandered money as other women take morphiathats all  fouldes  its the same dear scatterbrained goodhearted betsy that i used to know  lady frederick  youre the only person who calls me betsy now to all the others im only elizabeth

good deal of money  captain montgomerie  its a mere trifle  lady frederick  you must be very rich to call nine hundred pounds that  captain montgomerie  i am  lady frederick  with a laugh all the same its extremely good of you to give him plenty of time  captain montgomerie  i told gerald he could have till tomorrow  lady frederick  obviously he wants to settle with you as soon as ever he can  captain montgomerie  quietly i often wonder why gambling debts are known as debts of honour  lady frederick  looking at him steadily of course i realise that if you choose to press for the money and gerald cant payhell have to send in his papers  captain montgomerie  lightly you may be quite sure i have no wish to bring about such a calamity by the way have you thought over our little talk of last night  lady frederick  no  captain montgomerie  you would have been wise to do so  lady frederick  my dear captain montgomerie you really cant expect me to marry you because my brother has been so foolish as to lose more money at poker than he can afford  captain montgomerie  did you ever hear that my father was a moneylender  lady frederick  a lucrative profession i believe  captain montgomerie  he found it so he was a polish jew called aaron levitzki he came to this country with three shillings in his pocket he lent halfacrown of it to a friend on the condition that he should be paid back seven and six in three days  lady frederick  im not good at figures but the interest sounds rather high  captain montgomerie  it is that was one of my fathers specialities from these humble beginnings his business grew to such proportions that at his death he was able to leave me the name and arms of the great family of montgomerie and something over a million of money  lady frederick  the result of thrift industry and good fortune  captain montgomerie  my father was able to gratify all his ambitions but one he was eaten up with the desire to move in good society and this he was never able to achieve his dying wish was that i should live in those circles which he knew only  lady frederick  across the counter  captain montgomerie  precisely but my poor father was a little ignorant in these matters to him one lord was as good as another he thought a marquess a finer man than an earl and a viscount than a baron he would never have understood that a penniless irish baronet might go into better society than many a belted earl  lady frederick  and what is the application of this  captain montgomerie  i wanted to explain to you one of the reasons which emboldened me last night to make you a proposal of marriage  lady frederick  but surely you know some very nice people i saw you lunching the other day with the widow of a city knight  captain montgomerie  many very excellent persons are glad to have me to dine with them but i know quite well that theyre not the real article im as far off as ever from getting into those houses which you have been used to all your life im not content with thirdrate earls and rather seedy dowagers  lady frederick  forgive my frankness butarent you rather a snob  captain montgomerie  my father aaron levitzki married an english woman and i have all the english virtues  lady frederick  but im not quite sure that people would swallow you even as my husband  captain montgomerie  theyd make a face but theyd swallow me right enough and when i asked them down to the best shoot in england theyd come to the conclusion that i agreed with them very well  lady frederick  still rather amused your offer is eminently businesslike but you see im not a business woman it doesnt appeal to me  captain montgomerie  i only ask you to perform such of the duties of a wife as are required by society they are few enough in all conscience i should wish you to entertain largely and receive my guests be polite to me at least in public and go with me to the various places people go to otherwise i leave you entire freedom you will find me generous and heedful to all your wishes  lady frederick  captain montgomerie i dont know how much of all that you have said is meant seriously but surely youre not choosing the right time to make such a proposal when my brother owes you so much money that if you care to be hard you can ruin him  captain montgomerie  why not  lady frederick  dyou mean to say   captain montgomerie  i will be quite frank with you i should never have allowed gerald to lose so much money which there was no likelihood of his being able to pay if i had not thought it earned me some claim upon your gratitude  lady frederick  shortly gerald will pay every penny he owes you tomorrow  captain montgomerie  blandly where dyou suppose hell get it  lady frederick  i have no doubt i shall be able to manage something  captain montgomerie  have you not tried this morning entirely without success  lady frederick  startled what  captain montgomerie  you do not forget that you have sundry moneys of your own which are payable tomorrow  lady frederick  how dyou know that  captain montgomerie  i told you that when i took a thing in hand i carried it through you went to dick cohen and he told you hed parted with the bills didnt you guess that only one man could have the least interest in taking them over  lady frederick  you  captain montgomerie  yes  lady frederick  oh god  captain montgomerie  come come dont be worried over it theres nothing to be alarmed about im a very decent chapif youd accepted me right away you would never have known that those bills were in my possession think it over once more im sure we should get on well together i can give you what you most need money and the liberty to fling it away as recklessly as you choose you can give me the assured and fixed position on whichmy fathers heart was set  lady frederick  and if i dont accept youll make me a bankrupt and youll ruin gerald  captain montgomerie  i refuse to consider that very unpleasant alternative  lady frederick  oh i cant i cant  captain montgomerie  laughing but you must you must when shall i come for your answer tomorrow ill come with the bills and geralds iou in my pocket and you shall burn them yourself goodbye              he kisses her hand and goes out lady             frederick remains staring in front of             her mereston enters followed by lady             mereston and paradine  mereston  going to her eagerly hulloa i wondered what on earth had become of you  lady frederick  with a laugh its only two hours since i chased you away from me  mereston  im afraid i bore you to death  lady frederick  dont be so silly you know you dont  mereston  where are you going now  lady frederick  i have rather a headache im going to lie down  mereston  im so sorry              lady frederick goes out mereston stares             after her anxiously and makes a step             towards the door  lady mereston  sharply where are you going charlie  mereston  i never asked lady frederick if i could do anything  lady mereston  good heavens there are surely plenty of servants in the hotel to get her anything she wants  mereston  dont you think a drive in the motor would do her good  lady mereston  unable to control herself oh i have no patience with you i never saw such a ridiculous infatuation in my life  paradine  steady old girl steady  mereston  what on earth dyou mean mother  lady mereston  presumably youre not going to deny that youre in love with that woman  mereston  growing pale would you mind speaking of her as lady frederick  lady mereston  you try me very much charlie please answer my question  mereston  i dont want to seem unkind to you mother but i think you have no right to ask about my private affairs  fouldes  if youre going to talk this matter over youre more likely to come to an understanding if you both keep your tempers  mereston  theres nothing i wish to discuss  lady mereston  dont be absurd charlie youre with lady frederick morning noon and night she can never stir a yard from the hotel but you go flying after you pester her with your ridiculous attentions  fouldes  blandly ones relations have always such an engaging frankness like a bad lookingglass they always represent you with a crooked nose and a cast in your eye  lady mereston  to mereston i have certainly a right to know what you mean by all this and what is going to come of it  mereston  i dont know what will come of it  fouldes  the question that excites our curiosity is this are you going to ask lady frederick to marry you  mereston  i refuse to answer that it seems to me excessively impertinent  fouldes  come come my boy youre too young to play the heavy father were both your friends hadnt you better make a clean breast of it after all your mother and i are interested in nothing so much as your welfare  lady mereston  imploring charlie  mereston  of course id ask her to marry me if i thought for a moment that shed accept but im so terrified that shell refuse and then perhaps i shall never see her again  lady mereston  the boys stark staring mad  mereston  i dont know what i should do if she sent me about my business id rather continue in this awful uncertainty than lose all hope for ever  fouldes  by george youre pretty far gone my son the lover whos diffident is in a much worse way than the lover who protests  lady mereston  with a little laugh i must say it amuses me that lady frederick should have had both my brother and my son dangling at her skirts your respective passions are separated by quite a number of years  mereston  lady frederick has already told me of that incident  fouldes  with the usual indiscretion of her sex  mereston  it appears that she was very unhappy and you with questionable taste made love to her  fouldes  do your best not to preach at me dear boy it reminds me of your lamented father  mereston  and at last she promised to go away with you you were to meet at waterloo station  fouldes  such a draughty place for an assignation  mereston  your train was to start at nine and you were going to take the boat over to the channel isles  fouldes  lady frederick has a very remarkable memory i remember hoping the sea wouldnt be rough  mereston  and just as the train was starting her eye fell on the clock at that moment her child was coming down to breakfast and would ask for her before you could stop her shed jumped out of the carriage the train was moving and you couldnt get out so you were taken on to weymouthalone  lady mereston  you must have felt a quite egregious ass paradine  fouldes  i did but you need not rub it in  lady mereston  doesnt it occur to you charlie that a woman who loves so easily cant be very worthy of your affection  mereston  but my dear mother dyou think she cared for my uncle  fouldes  what the dickens dyou mean  mereston  dyou suppose if she loved you she would have hesitated to come dyou know her so little as that she thought of her child only because she was quite indifferent to you  fouldes  crossly you know nothing about it and youre an impertinent young jackanapes  lady mereston  my dear paradine what can it matter if lady frederick was in love with you or not  fouldes  calming down of course it doesnt matter a bit  lady mereston  i have no doubt you mistook wounded vanity for a broken heart  fouldes  acidly my dear you sometimes say things which explain to me why my brotherinlaw so frequently abandoned his own fireside for the platform of exeter hall  mereston  it may also interest you to learn that i am perfectly aware of lady fredericks financial difficulties i know she has two bills falling due tomorrow  fouldes  shes a very clever woman  mereston  ive implored her to let me lend her the money and she absolutely refuses you see shes kept nothing from me at all  lady mereston  my dear charlie its a very old dodge to confess what doesnt matter in order to conceal what does  mereston  what do you mean mother  lady mereston  lady frederick has told you nothing of the bellingham affair  mereston  why should she  lady mereston  it is surely expedient you should know that the woman you have some idea of marrying escaped the divorce court only by the skin of her teeth  mereston  i dont believe that mother  fouldes  remember that youre talking to your respected parent my boy  mereston  im sorry that my mother should utter base and contemptible libels onmy greatest friend  lady mereston  you may be quite sure that i say nothing which i cant prove  mereston  i wont listen to anything against lady frederick  lady mereston  but you must  mereston  are you quite indifferent to the great pain you cause me  lady mereston  i cant allow you to marry a woman whos hopelessly immoral  mereston  mother how dare you say that  fouldes  this isnt the sort of thing i much like but hadnt you better hear the worst at once  mereston  very well but if my mother insists on saying things she must say them in lady fredericks presence  lady mereston  that im quite willing to do  mereston  good              he rings the bell a servant enters  fouldes  youd better take care maudie lady fredericks a dangerous woman to play the fool with  mereston  to the servant go to lady frederick berolles and say lord mereston is extremely sorry to trouble her ladyship but would be very much obliged if shed come to the drawingroom for two minutes  servant  very well my lord              exit  fouldes  what are you going to do maud  lady mereston  i knew there was a letter in existence in lady fredericks handwriting which proved all ive said about her ive moved heaven and earth to get hold of it and it came this morning  fouldes  dont be such a fool youre not going to use that  lady mereston  i am indeed  fouldes  your blood be upon your own head unless im vastly mistaken youll suffer the greatest humiliation that you can imagine  lady mereston  thats absurd i have nothing to fear  lady frederick comes in  mereston  im so sorry to disturb you i hope you dont mind  lady frederick  not at all i knew you wouldnt have sent for me in that fashion without good cause  mereston  im afraid youll think me dreadfully impertinent  lady mereston  really you need not apologise so much charlie  mereston  my mother has something to say against you and i think it right that she should say it in your presence  lady frederick  thats very nice of you charliethough i confess i prefer people to say horrid things of me only behind my back especially if theyre true  fouldes  look here i think all this is rather nonsense weve most of us got something in our past history that we dont want raked up and wed all better let bygones be bygones  lady frederick  im waiting lady mereston  lady mereston  its merely that i thought my son should know that lady frederick had been the mistress of roger bellingham lady frederick turns quickly and looks at her then bursts into a peal of laughter lady mereston springs up angrily and hands her a letter is this in your handwriting  lady frederick  not at all disconcerted dear me how did you get hold of this  lady mereston  you see that i have ample proof lady frederick  lady frederick  handing the letter to mereston would you like to read it you know my writing well enough to be able to answer lady merestons question              he reads it through and looks at her in dismay  mereston  good god what does it mean  lady frederick  pray read it aloud  mereston  i cant  lady frederick  then give it to me she takes it from him its addressed to my brotherinlaw peter berolles the kate to whom it refers was his wife reads dear peter im sorry you should have had a row with kate about roger bellingham you are quite wrong in all you thought there is absolutely nothing between them i dont know where kate was on tuesday night but certainly she was not within a hundred miles of roger this i know because  mereston  interrupting for gods sake dont go on              lady frederick looks at him and shrugs her             shoulders  lady frederick  its signed elizabeth berolles and theres a postscript you may make what use of this letter you like  mereston  what does it mean what does it mean  lady mereston  surely its very clear you cant want a more explicit confession of guilt  lady frederick  i tried to make it as explicit as possible  lady mereston  wont you say something im sure there must be some explanation  lady frederick  i dont know how you got hold of this letter lady mereston i agree with you it is compromising but kate and peter are dead now and theres nothing to prevent me from telling the truth              paradine fouldes takes a step forward and             watches her  lady frederick  my sisterinlaw was a meek and mild little person as demure as you can imagine and no one would have suspected her for a moment of kicking over the traces well one morning she came to me in floods of tears and confessed that she and roger bellingham with a shrug had been foolish her husband suspected that something was wrong and had kicked up a row  fouldes  drily there are men who will make a scene on the smallest provocation  lady frederick  to shield herself she told the first lie that came into her head she said to peter that roger bellingham was my loverand she threw herself on my mercy she was a poor weak little creature and if thered been a scandal shed have gone to the dogs altogether it had only been a momentary infatuation for roger and the scare had cured her at the bottom of her heart she loved her husband still i was desperately unhappy and i didnt care much what became of me she promised to turn over a new leaf and all that sort of thing i thought id better give her another chance of going straight i did what she wanted i wrote that letter taking all the blame on myself and kate lived happily with her husband till she died  mereston  it was just like you  lady mereston  but lord and lady peter are dead  lady frederick  yes  lady mereston  and roger bellingham  lady frederick  hes dead too  lady mereston  then how can you prove your account of this affair  lady frederick  i cant  lady mereston  and does this convince you charlie  mereston  of course  lady mereston  impatiently good heavens the boys out of his senses paradine for heavens sake say something  fouldes  well much as it may displease you my dear im afraid i agree with charlie  lady mereston  you dont mean to say you believe this cockandbull story  fouldes  i do  lady mereston  why  fouldes  well you see lady fredericks a very clever woman she would never have invented such an utterly improbable tale which cant possibly be proved if shed been guilty shed have had ready at least a dozen proofs of her innocence  lady mereston  but thats absurd  fouldes  besides ive known lady frederick a long time and she has at least a thousand faults  lady frederick  with flashing eyes thanks  fouldes  but theres something i will say for her shes not a liar if she tells me a thing i dont hesitate for a moment to believe it  lady frederick  its not a matter of the smallest importance if any of you believe me or not be so good as to ring charlie  mereston  certainly              he rings and a servant immediately comes in  lady frederick  tell my servant that hes to come here at once and bring the despatchbox which is in my dressingroom  servant  yes miladi              exit  fouldes  quickly i say what are you going to do  lady frederick  that is absolutely no business of yours  fouldes  be a brick betsy and dont give her those letters  lady frederick  i think ive had enough of this business im proposing to finish with it  fouldes  temper temper  lady frederick  stamping her foot dont say temper to me paradine              she walks up and down angrily paradine             sits at the piano and with one finger strums             rule britannia  mereston  shut up              he takes a book flings it at his head and             misses  fouldes  good shot sir  lady frederick  i often wonder how you got your reputation for wit paradine  fouldes  by making a point of laughing heartily at other peoples jokes              the footman enters with the despatchbox             which lady frederick opens she takes             a bundle of letters from it  fouldes  betsy

stove and             throws them in one by one  lady mereston  what on earth is she doing  lady frederick  i have some letters here which would ruin the happiness of a very worthless woman i know im burning them so that i may never have the temptation to use them  fouldes  i never saw anything so melodramatic  lady frederick  hold your tongue paradine turning to mereston my dear charlie i came to

theres a pot of rouge and a powder puff in the world she rubs grease paint all over her face  mereston  what are you doing  lady frederick  i wish i were an actress they have such an advantage they only have to make up to look well behind the footlights but i have to expose myself to that beastly sun  mereston  nervously yes of course  lady frederick  is your mother dreadfully annoyed with you and paradine must be furious i shall call him uncle paradine next time i see him itll make him feel so middleaged charlie you dont know how grateful i am for what you did yesterday you acted like a real brick  mereston  its awfully good of you to say so  lady frederick  turning do i look a fright  mereston  oh no not at all  lady frederick  i love this powder it plays no tricks with you once i put on a new powder that i bought in paris and as soon as i went into artificial light it turned a bright mauve i was very much annoyed you wouldnt like to go about with a mauve face would you  mereston  no not at all  lady frederick  fortunately i had a green frock on and mauve and green were very fashionable that year still id sooner it hadnt been on my face there i think thatll do as a foundation im beginning to feel younger already now for the delicate soft bloom of youth the great difficulty you know is to make both your cheeks the same colour turning to him charlie youre not bored are you  mereston  no no  lady frederick  i always think my observations have a peculiar piquancy when i have only one cheek rouged i remember once i went out to dinner and as soon as i sat down i grew conscious of the fact that one of my cheeks was much redder than the other  mereston  by george that was awkward  lady frederick  charlie you are a goodlooking boy i had no idea you were so handsome and you look so young and fresh its quite a pleasure to look at you  mereston  laughing awkwardly dyou think so what did you do when you discovered your predicament  lady frederick  well by a merciful interposition of providence i had a foreign diplomatist on my right side which bloomed like a rose and a bishop on my left which was white like the lily the diplomatist told me risky stories all through dinner so it was quite natural that this cheek should blush fiery red and as the bishop whispered in my left ear harrowing details of distress in the east end it was only decent that the other should exhibit a becoming pallor meanwhile she has been rouging her cheeks now look carefully charlie and youll see how i make the cupids bow which is my mouth i like a nice healthy colour on the lips dont you  mereston  isnt it awfully uncomfortable to have all that stuff on  lady frederick  ah my dear boy its womans lot to suffer in this world but its a great comfort to think that one is submitting to the decrees of providence and at the same time adding to ones personal attractiveness but i confess i sometimes wish i neednt blow my nose so carefully smile charlie i dont think youre a very ardent lover you know  mereston  im sorry what would you like me to do  lady frederick  i should like you to make me impassioned speeches  mereston  im afraid theyd be so hackneyed  lady frederick  never mind that ive long discovered that under the influence of profound emotion a man always expresses himself in the terms of the family herald  mereston  you must remember that im awfully inexperienced  lady frederick  well ill let you off this timebecause i like your curly hair she sighs amorously now for the delicate arch of my eyebrows i dont know what i should do without this ive got no eyebrows at all really have you ever noticed that dark line under the eyes which gives such intensity to my expression  mereston  yes often  lady frederick  holding out the pencil well here it is ah my dear boy in this pencil you have at will roguishness and languor tenderness and indifference sprightliness passion malice what you will now be very quiet for one moment if i overdo it my whole day will be spoilt you mustnt breathe even whenever i do this i think how true those lines are      the little more and how much it is     the little less and what worlds away  there now just one puff of powder and the whole worlds kind looking at herself in the glass and sighing with satisfaction ah i feel eighteen i think its a success and i shall have a happy day oh betsy betsy i think youll do you know youre not unattractive my dear not strictly beautiful perhaps but then i dont like the chocolatebox sort of woman ill just go and take off this dressinggown mereston gets up no dont move ill go into my bedroom i shall only be one moment lady frederick goes through the curtains angélique              the maid enters  maid  yes miladi  lady frederick  just clear away those things on the dressingtable  maid  doing so very well miladi  lady frederick  you may have a cigarette charlie  mereston  thanks my nerves are a bit dicky this morning  lady frederick  oh blow the thing angélique come and help me  maid  yes miladi              she goes out  lady frederick  at last              she comes in having changed the kimono for             a very beautiful dressinggown of silk and             lace  lady frederick  now are you pleased  mereston  of course im pleased  lady frederick  then you may make love to me  mereston  you say such disconcerting things  lady frederick  laughing well charlie youve found no difficulty in doing it for the last fortnight youre not going to pretend that youre already at a loss for pretty speeches  mereston  when i came here i had a thousand things to say to you but youve driven them all out of my head wont you give me an answer now  lady frederick  what to  mereston  youve not forgotten that i asked you to marry me  lady frederick  no but you asked me under very peculiar circumstances i wonder if you can repeat the offer now in cold blood  mereston  of course what a cad you must think me  lady frederick  are you sure you want to marry me stillafter having slept over it  mereston  yes  lady frederick  you are a good boy and im a beast to treat you so abominably its awfully nice of you  mereston  well what is the answer  lady frederick  my dear ive been giving it you for the last halfhour  mereston  how  lady frederick  you dont for a moment suppose i should have let you into those horrible mysteries of my toilette if id had any intention of marrying you give me credit for a certain amount of intelligence and good feeling i should have kept up the illusion at all events till after the honeymoon  mereston  are you going to refuse me  lady frederick  arent you rather glad  mereston  no no no  lady frederick  putting her arm through his now let us talk it over sensibly youre a very nice boy and im awfully fond of you but youre twentytwo and heaven only knows my age you see the church in which i was baptized was burnt down the year i was born so i dont know how old i am  mereston  smiling where was it burnt  lady frederick  in ireland  mereston  i thought so  lady frederick  just at present i can make a decent enough show by taking infinite pains and my hand is not so heavy that the innocent eyes of your sex can discover how much of me is due to art but in ten years youll only be thirtytwo and then if i married you my whole life would be a mortal struggle to preserve some semblance of youth havent you seen those old hags whove never surrendered to anno domini with their poor thin wrinkled cheeks covered with paint and the dreadful wigs that hide a hairless pate rather cockeyed dont you know and invariably flaxen youve laughed at their ridiculous graces and youve been disgusted too oh im so sorry for them poor things and i should become just like that for i should never have the courage to let my hair be white so long as yours was brown but if i dont marry you i can look forward to the white hairs fairly happily the first i shall pluck out and the second i shall pluck out but when the third comes ill give in and ill throw my rouge and my poudre de riz and my pencils into the fire  mereston  but dyou think i should ever change  lady frederick  my dear boy im sure of it cant you imagine what it would be to be tied to a woman who was always bound to sit with her back to the light and sometimes you might want to kiss me  mereston  i think it very probable  lady frederick  well you couldntin case you disarranged my complexion mereston sighs deeply dont sigh charlie i daresay i was horrid to let you fall in love with me but im only human and i was desperately flattered  mereston  was that all  lady frederick  and rather touched that is why i want to give a cure with my refusal  mereston  but you break my heart  lady frederick  my dear men have said that to me ever since i was fifteen but ive never noticed that in consequence they ate their dinner less heartily  mereston  i suppose you think it was only calflove  lady frederick  im not such a fool as to imagine a boy can love any less than a man if id thought your affection ridiculous i shouldnt have been so flattered  mereston  it doesnt hurt any the less because the wounds you make are clean cut  lady frederick  but theyll soon heal and youll fall in love with a nice girl of your own age whose cheeks flush with youth and not with rouge and whose eyes sparkle because they love you and not because theyre carefully made up  mereston  but i wanted to help you youre in such an awful scrape and if youll only marry me it can all be set right  lady frederick  oh my dear dont go in for selfsacrifice you must leave that to women theyre so much more used to it  mereston  isnt there anything i can do for you  lady frederick  no dear i shall get out of the mess somehow i always do you really need not worry about me  mereston  you know you are a brick  lady frederick  then its all settled isnt it and youre not going to be unhappy  mereston  ill try not to be  lady frederick  id like to imprint a chaste kiss on your forehead only im afraid it would leave a mark              the footman comes in and announces paradine             fouldes  footman  mr paradine fouldes              exit  fouldes  do i disturb  lady frederick  not at all weve just finished our conversation  fouldes  well  mereston  if any one wants to know who the best woman in the world is send em to me and ill tell them  lady frederick  taking his hand you dear goodbye  mereston  goodbye and thanks for being so kind to me              he goes out  fouldes  do i see in front of me my prospective niece  lady frederick  why dyou ask uncle paradine  fouldes  singularly enough because i want to know  lady frederick  well it so happensyou dont  fouldes  youve refused him  lady frederick  i have  fouldes  then will you tell me why youve been leading us all such a devil of a dance  lady frederick  because you interfered with me and i allow no one to do that  fouldes  hoitytoity  lady frederick  you werent really so foolish as to imagine i should marry a boy who set me up on a pedestal and vowed he was unworthy to kiss the hem of my garment  fouldes  why not  lady frederick  my dear paradine i dont want to commit suicide by sheer boredom theres only one thing in the world more insufferable than being in love  fouldes  and what is that pray  lady frederick  why having some one in love with you  fouldes  ive suffered from it all my life  lady frederick  think of living up to the ideal charlie has of me my hair would turn a hydrogen yellow in a week and then to be so desperately adored as all thatoh its so dull i should have to wear a mask all day long i could never venture to be natural in case i shocked him and notwithstanding all my efforts i should see the illusions tumbling about his ears one by one till he realised i was no ethereal goddess but a very ordinary human woman neither better nor worse than anybody else  fouldes  your maxim appears to be marry any one you like except the man thats in love with you  lady frederick  ah but dont you think i might find a man who loved me though he knew me through and through id far rather that he saw my faults and forgave them than that he thought me perfect  fouldes  but how dyou know youve choked the boy off for good  lady frederick  i took good care i wanted to cure him if it had been possible i would have shown him my naked soul but i couldnt do that so i let him see  fouldes  interrupting what  lady frederick  laughing no not quite i had a dressinggown on and other paraphernalia but i made him come here when i wasnt made up and he sat by while i rouged my cheeks  fouldes  and the young fool thought there was nothing more in you than a carefully prepared complexion  lady frederick  he was very nice about it but i think he was rather relieved when i refused him  there is a knock at the door  gerald  outside may we come in  lady frederick  yes do  enter gerald and rose and the admiral  gerald  excitedly i say its all right the admirals come down like a real brick ive told him everything  lady frederick  what do you mean goodmorning dear admiral  admiral  goodmorning  gerald  ive made a clean breast of it i talked it over with rosie  rose  and we went to papa together  gerald  and told him that i owed montgomerie nine hundred pounds  rose  and we thought papa would make an awful scene  gerald  raise cain dont you know  rose  but he never said a word  gerald  he was simply ripping over it  lady frederick  putting her hands to her ears oh oh oh for heavens sake be calm and coherent  gerald  my dear you dont know what a relief it is  rose  i saw gerald was dreadfully worried and i wormed it out of him  gerald  im so glad to be out of the clutches of that brute  rose  now were going to live happily ever afterwards  all the while the admiral has been trying to get a word in but each time he is about to start one of the others has broken in  admiral  silence he puffs and blows i never saw such a pair in my life  lady frederick  now do explain it all admiral i cant make head or tail out of these foolish creatures  admiral  well they came and told me that montgomerie had an iou of geralds for nine hundred pounds and was using it to blackmail you  fouldes  is that a fact  lady frederick  yes  admiral  i never liked the mans face and when they said his terms were that you were to marry him or gerald would have to send in his papers i said   fouldes  damn his impudence  admiral  how did you know  fouldes  because id have said it myself  gerald  and the admiral stumped up like a man he gave me a cheque for the money and ive just this moment sent it on to montgomerie  lady frederick  taking both his hands its awfully good of you and im sure youll never regret that you gave gerald a chance  admiral  may i have a few words private conversation with you  lady frederick  of course to the others make yourselves scarce  fouldes  well go on the balcony shall we  admiral  im sorry to trouble you but itll only take three minutes  gerald and rose and fouldes go on to the balcony  lady frederick  when theyve gone there  admiral  well what i wanted to say to you was this i like gerald but i think he wants guiding dyou follow me  lady frederick  im sure he will take your advice always  admiral  its a womans hand that he wants now if you and i were to join forces we could keep him out of mischief couldnt we  lady frederick  oh ill come and stay with you whenever you ask me i love giving good advice when im quite sure it wont be taken  admiral  i was thinking of a more permanent arrangement look here why dont you marry me  lady frederick  my dear admiral  admiral  i dont think an attractive woman like you ought to live alone shes bound to get in a scrape  lady frederick  its awfully good of you but  admiral  you dont think im too old do you  lady frederick  of course not youre in the very prime of life  admiral  theres life in the old dog yet i can tell you  lady frederick  i feel sure of that i never doubted it for a moment  admiral  then what have you got against me  lady frederick  you wouldnt like to commit polygamy would you  admiral  eh  lady frederick  you see its not a question of marrying me only but all my tradespeople  admiral  i hadnt thought of that  lady frederick  besides youre roses father and im geralds sister if we married i should be my brothers motherinlaw and my stepdaughter would be my sister your daughter would be your sisterinlaw and your brother would just snap his fingers at your fatherly advice  admiral  confused eh  lady frederick  i dont know if the prayerbook allows things like that but if it does i think its hopelessly immoral  admiral  well shall i tell them ive changed my mind and they cant marry  lady frederick  then thered be no reason for us tocommit the crime would there  admiral  i hadnt thought of that i suppose not  lady frederick  youre not cross with me are you im very much flattered and i thank you from the bottom of my heart  admiral  not at all not at all i only thought it might save trouble  lady frederick  calling gerald come along they come in weve had our little talk  gerald  everything satisfactory  lady frederick  with a look at the admiral quite  admiral  gruffly quite  lady fredericks footman enters  footman  captain montgomerie wishes to know if he may see your ladyship  lady frederick  id forgotten all about him  gerald  let me go to him shall i  lady frederick  no im not afraid of him any longer he cant do anything to you and as far as im concerned it doesnt matter  gerald  then ill tell him to go to the devil  lady frederick  no im going to tell him that myself to the footman ask captain montgomerie to come here  footman  yes miladi              exit  lady frederick  walking up and down furiously im going to tell him that myself  fouldes  now keep calm betsy  lady frederick  very deliberately i shall not keep calm  fouldes  remember that youre a perfect lady  lady frederick  dont interfere with me i ate humble pie yesterday and it didnt agree with me at all  footman enters to announce captain montgomerie who follows him and immediately withdraws  footman  captain montgomerie  captain montgomerie  how dyou do  he is obviously surprised to see the others  lady frederick  pleasantly quite a party arent we  captain montgomerie  yes a pause i hope you dont mind my coming so early  lady frederick  not at all you made an appointment for halfpast ten  captain montgomerie  i trust you have good news for me  lady frederick  captain montgomerie every one here knows the circumstances that have brought you  captain montgomerie  i should have thought it wiser for both our sakes not to make them too public  lady frederick  very amiably i dont see why you should be ashamed because you made me a proposal of marriage  captain montgomerie  im sorry you should think it a laughing matter lady frederick  lady frederick  i dont i never laugh at an impertinence  captain montgomerie  taken aback i beg your pardon  lady frederick  surely the receipt of my brothers letter was sufficient answer for you after that you must have guessed there was no likelihood that i should change my mind  captain montgomerie  what letter i dont understand  gerald  i sent you a note this morning enclosing a cheque for the money i lost to you  captain montgomerie  ive not received it  gerald  it must be waiting for you at the hotel              captain montgomerie pauses and looks meditatively             at the assembled company  lady frederick  i think theres nothing for which i need detain you longer  captain montgomerie  smiling i dont think ive quite finished yet has it slipped your memory that the two bills fall due today allow me to present them              he takes them out of his pocketbook  lady frederick  im very sorry i cant pay themat present  captain montgomerie  i regret that i cant wait you must pay them  lady frederick  i tell you its impossible  captain montgomerie  then i shall get an order against you  lady frederick  that you may do to your hearts content  captain montgomerie  you realise the consequences its not very nice to be an undischarged bankrupt  lady frederick  much nicer than to marry a rascally moneylender  fouldes  may i look at these interesting documents  captain montgomerie  certainly blandly i havent the least wish to be offensive  fouldes  taking them you fail lamentably in achieving your wish three thousand five hundred pounds in all it seems hardly worth while to make a fuss about so small a sum  captain montgomerie  im in urgent need of money  fouldes  ironically so rich a man as you  captain montgomerie  even a rich man may be temporarily embarrassed  fouldes  then be so good as to wait for one moment he sits down at a table and writes a cheque no sight is more affecting than that of a millionaire in financial straits  lady frederick  paradine  fouldes  handing the cheque now sir i think that settles it will you exchange my cheque for those bills  captain montgomerie  damn you i forgot you  fouldes  you may not be aware that its unusual to swear in the presence of ladies  captain montgomerie  looking at the cheque i suppose its all right              paradine goes to the door and opens it  fouldes  there is the window and here is the door which will you choose              captain montgomerie looks at him without             answering shrugs his shoulders and goes             out  lady frederick  oh paradine you are a brick  gerald  i say its awfully good of you  fouldes  nonsense ive got a strong sense of effect and i always cultivate the dramatic situation  lady frederick  i shall never be able to pay you back paradine  fouldes  my dear im not entirely devoid of intelligence  admiral  well well i must be off to take my constitutional  lady frederick  and rose and gerald must take care of you we shall all meet at luncheon  admiral  yes yes  the admiral rose and gerald go out lady frederick goes up to paradine and takes his hands  lady frederick  thanks awfully you are a good friend  fouldes  by george how your eyes glitter  lady frederick  its only belladonna you know  fouldes  im not such a fool as my nephew my dear  lady frederick  why did you do it  fouldes  dyou know what gratitude is  lady frederick  thanks for past favours and a lively sense of benefits to come  fouldes  well yesterday you had my sister in the hollow of your hand she gave you great provocation and you burnt those confounded letters  lady frederick  my dear paradine i cant get over my own magnanimity and what are the benefits to come  fouldes  well it might be five per cent on the capital  lady frederick  i dont know why you should squeeze my hands all the time  fouldes  but it isnt look here dont you get awfully tired of racketting about  lady frederick  oh my dear friend im sick to death of it ive got half a mind to retire from the world and bury myself in a hermitage  fouldes  so have i and ive bought the lease of a little house in norfolk street park lane  lady frederick  just the place for a hermitagefashionable without being vulgar  fouldes  and i propose to live there quite quietly and i shall just subsist on a few dried herbs dont you know  lady frederick  but do have them cooked by a really good french chef it makes such a difference  fouldes  and what dyou say to joining me  lady frederick  i  fouldes  you  lady frederick  oh i am a success today thats another proposal of marriage  fouldes  it sounds very much like it  lady frederick  ive already had three this morning  fouldes  then i should think youve said no quite often enough  lady frederick  come at ten oclock tomorrow and you shall see me make up  fouldes  dyou think that would choke me off dyou suppose i dont know that behind that very artificial complexion theres a dear little woman called betsy whos genuine to the bottom of her soul  lady frederick  oh dont be so sentimental or i shall cry  fouldes  well what is it to be  lady frederick  her voice breaking dyou like me still paradine after all these years  fouldes  yes she looks at him her lips quivering he stretches out his arms and she breaking down hides her face on his shoulder now dont be an ass betsy i know youll say in a minute im the only man you ever loved  lady frederick  looking up with a laugh i shant but what will your sister say  fouldes  ill tell her there was only one way in which i could save charlie from your clutches  lady frederick  what  fouldes  by marrying you myself  lady frederick  putting up her face monster  he kisses her lips   the end                                          the explorer   by

drawingroom in mayfair at the back is a      window leading on to a balcony on the right a door leads to the      staircase and on the left is another door it is the sumptuous      room of a rich woman       lady kelsey is seated dressed in black she is a woman of fifty      kind emotional and agitated she is drying her eyes mrs      crowley a pretty little woman of twentyeight very beautifully      dressed vivacious and gesticulative is watching her quietly the      rev james carbery a young curate tall and impressive in      appearance ponderous and selfimportant is very immaculate in a      silk waistcoat and a large gold cross   carbery  i cannot tell you how sincerely i feel for you in this affliction lady kelsey  lady kelsey  youre very kind every one has been very kind but i shall never get over it i shall never hold up my head again  mrs crowley  nonsense you talk as if the whole thing werent perfectly monstrous surely you dont for a moment suppose that your brotherinlaw wont be able to explain everything away  lady kelsey  god forbid but still its dreadful to think that at this very moment my poor sisters husband is standing in the felons dock  carbery  dreadful dreadful  lady kelsey  if you only knew the agonies ive suffered since fred was arrested at first i couldnt believe it i wouldnt believe it if id only known such a thing was possible id have done anything to help him  carbery  but had you any idea he was in difficulties  lady kelsey  he came to me and said he must have three thousand pounds at once but id given him money so often since my poor sister died and every one said i oughtnt to give him any more after all someone must look after his children and if i dont hoard my money a little george and lucy will be penniless  mrs crowley  oh you were quite right to refuse  lady kelsey  i thought it would only go in senseless extravagances as all the rest has gone and when he said it was a matter of life and death i couldnt believe it hed said that so often  carbery  its shocking to think a man of his position and abilities should have come to such a pass  mrs crowley  dear mr carbery dont draw the very obvious moral were all quite wretched enough as it is  lady kelsey  and two days later lucy came to me with a white face to say that he had been arrested for forging a cheque  carbery  i only met him once and im bound to say i thought him a most charming man  lady kelsey  ah thats what ruined him he was always so entirely delightful he could never say no to any one but theres not an atom of harm in him im quite certain hes never done anything criminal he may have been foolish but wicked never  mrs crowley  of course hell be able to clear himself theres not the least doubt about that  lady kelsey  but think of the disgrace of it a public trial and fred allerton of all people the allertons were always so proud of their family it was almost a mania with them  mrs crowley  for centuries theyve cherished the firm belief that there was no one in the county fit to black their boots  carbery  pride goeth before a fall  mrs crowley  smiling and proverbs before a clergyman  lady kelsey  they wouldnt give him bail so hes remained in prison till now of course i made lucy and george come here  mrs crowley  youve been quite charming lady kelsey as every one knew youd be but dont think of these wretched weeks of suspense think only that mr allerton has got his chance at last why the trial may be over now and he may this very minute be on his way to this house  carbery  what will he do when its over the position will be surely a little unpleasant  lady kelsey  ive talked it over with lucy andive made it possible for them all to go abroad theyll need rest and quiet poor things poor things  carbery  i suppose miss allerton and george are at the old bailey  lady kelsey  no their father begged them to stay away theyve been in all day waiting for the papers  mrs crowley  but who is going to bring you the news surely youre not going to wait for the papers  lady kelsey  oh no dick lomas is coming hes one of the witnesses for fred and my nephew bobby boulger  mrs crowley  and what about mr mackenzie he told me he would be there  carbery  is that the great traveller i thought i saw in the paper that hed already started for africa  lady kelsey  not yet hes going at the beginning of the month oh hes been so good to us during this time all our friends have been good to us  carbery  i shouldnt have thought there was much of the milk of human kindness to overflow in alexander mackenzie by all accounts he dealt with the slavetraders in africa with a good deal of vigour  mrs crowley  the slavetraders must be quaking in their shoes if they know hes starting out again for hes made up his mind to exterminate them and when alec mackenzie makes up his mind to do a thing he appears to do it  lady kelsey  he has the reputation of a hard man but no one could be more delightful than he has been to me  mrs crowley  i dont think i like him but hes certainly a strong man and in england just now every ones so weak and floppy its rather a relief to come across somebody whos got a will of iron and nerves of steel              george allerton comes in he is a very             young man goodlooking though at the             moment pale and haggard with a rather             weak face  george  i thought lucy was here to carbery and mrs crowley how dyou do have you seen lucy  mrs crowley  i went to her room for a moment  george  what is she doing  mrs crowley  reading  george  i wish i could take it as calmly as she does an outsider would think there was nothing the matter at all oh its too awful  lady kelsey  my dear you must bear up we must all hope for the best  george  but there is no best whatever happens it means disgrace and dishonour how could he how could he  lady kelsey  no one knows your father as i do george im sure hes never been anything but thoughtless and foolish  george  of course hes not been actually criminal thats absurd but its bad enough as it is  mrs crowley  you mustnt take it too much to heart in another halfhour at the utmost your father will be here with everything cleared up and youll be able to go back to oxford with a clear conscience  george  dyou think i can go to oxford again when my father has been tried for forgery no no no no id rather shoot myself  lady kelsey  my poor boy where have you been all day  george  heaven knows ive walked through the streets till im dogtired oh the suspense is too awful my feet carried me to the old bailey and i would have given anything to go in and see how things were going but id promised the pater i wouldnt  lady kelsey  how did he look this morning  george  he was most awfully worn and ill i dont believe hell ever get over it i saw his counsel before the case began they told me it was bound to come all right  mrs crowley  is there anything in the evening papers  george  i havent dared to look the placards are awful  carbery  why what do they say  george  cant you imagine gentleman charged with forgery county gentleman at the old bailey and all the rest of it damn them damn them  lady kelsey  it may be all over by now  george  i feel that i shall never sleep again i couldnt close my eyes last night to think that ones own father  lady kelsey  for goodness sake be quiet  george  starting theres a ring at the bell  lady kelsey  ive given orders that no one is to be admitted but dick lomas and bobbie  mrs crowley  it must be finished by now its one or the other of them come to tell you the result  lady kelsey  oh im so frightfully anxious  george  aunt you dont think  lady kelsey  no no of course not they must find him not guilty              the butler enters followed by dick lomas             a cleanshaven dapper man with a sharp             face and goodnatured smile he is between             thirtyfive and forty but slim and youthful             with him comes sir robert boulger             lady kelseys nephew a goodlooking             spruce youth of twentytwo  butler  mr lomas sir robert boulger  george  excitedly well well for gods sake tell us quickly  dick  my dear people i have nothing to tell  george  oh              he staggers with sudden faintness and falls             to the floor  dick  hulloa whats this  mrs crowley  poor boy              they crowd round him  george  its all right what a fool i am i was so strung up  dick  youd better come to the window              he and boulger take the boys arms and lead             him to the window george leans against             the balcony  carbery  im afraid i must go away every wednesday at four i read little lord fauntleroy to forty charwomen  lady kelsey  goodbye and thanks so much for coming  mrs crowley  shaking hands with him goodbye a clergyman always helps one so much to bear other peoples misfortunes              carbery goes out and in a moment robert             boulger comes back into the room  lady kelsey  is he better  boulger  oh much hell be all right in a minute lady kelsey goes to the window and he turns to mrs crowley you are a brick to come here today when theyre all in such awful trouble  mrs crowley  with a little hesitation did you really come away before the trial was ended  boulger  why of course what did you think you dont imagine theyll convict him  mrs crowley  its too dreadful  boulger  where is lucy i was hoping to get a glimpse of her  mrs crowley  i wouldnt trouble her today if i were you i think she most wants to be left alone  boulger  i wanted to tell her that if i could do anything at all she had only to command  mrs crowley  i think she knows that but ill give her the message if you like youre very devoted  boulger  ive been madly in love with her ever since i was ten  mrs crowley  take care then theres nothing so tedious as the constant lover              dick comes into the room and speaks to             robert boulger  dick  george is quite well now he wants you to smoke a cigarette with him  boulger  certainly              he goes on to the balcony  dick  when boulger is gone at least he will the moment he sees you  mrs crowley  what do you mean by that  dick  merely that i wanted to talk to you and robert boulger being a youth of somewhat limited intelligence seemed in the way  mrs crowley  why did you leave the old bailey  dick  my dear lady i couldnt stand it you dont know what it is to sit there and watch a man tortured a man youve known all your life whom youve dined with times out of number in whose house youve stayed he had just the look of a hunted beast and his face was grey with terror  mrs crowley  how was the case going  dick  i couldnt judge i could only see those haggard despairing eyes  mrs crowley  but youre a barrister you must have heard his answers what did he reply to all the questions  dick  he seemed quite dazed i dont think he took in the gist of his crossexamination  mrs crowley  but the mans innocent  dick  yes we all hope that  mrs crowley  what dyou mean there can be no doubt about that when he was arrested lucy went to him and begged him to tell her the exact truth he swore that he wasnt guilty  dick  poor lucy shes borne up wonderfully shell stick to her father through thick and thin  mrs crowley  abruptly mr lomas youre trying to put me off its not fair to let lucy buoy herself up with false hopes shes absolutely convinced that her father will be acquitted  dick  well in another halfhour we shall all know when i left the judge was just going to sum up  mrs crowley  mr lomas what is your opinion              he looks at her steadily for a moment  dick  were you very much surprised when you heard fred allerton was arrested  mrs crowley  good heavens i was overwhelmed  dick  dryly ah  mrs crowley  if you aggravate me i shall box your ears  dick  when first i knew fred he was a very rich man you know that the allertons are one of the oldest families in cheshire  mrs crowley  yes i think lucys only failing is an inordinate pride in her family she thinks it very snobbish to have any particular respect for a peer of the realm but only natural to look up to persons of good family  dick  ah you see you and i who have a quite indecent lack of ancestors cant realise what the cult of family may be there are families in the remote parts of englandnot very rich not very clever and not very goodlookingwho would look askance at a belted earl who came to demand their daughters hand in marriage they have a natural conviction that theyre the salt of the earth and in their particular corner they rule more absolutely than half the monarchs in europe the allertons were like that but fred somehow seemed to belong to a different stock the first thing he did was to play ducks and drakes with his fortune  mrs crowley  but men ought to be extravagant thats what theyre there for  dick  women always took his side because he had an irresistible charm of manner  mrs crowley  i think george has too a little  dick  i hope for lucys sake he will turn out a different man from his father i wish he werent so like him in appearance at last fred allerton had squandered every penny and he married lady kelseys sister one of the three rich daughters of a liverpool merchant but he ran through her money too gambling racing and so forth and she died of a broken heartadoring him still  mrs crowley  youre as well informed as an encyclopædia mr lomas  dick  you see i was made the trustee for the poor remains of mrs allertons fortune and i know how lucy has managed to keep all their heads above water shes wonderful ever since she was a child shes held the reins in her own hands shes stuck to her father though lady kelsey implored her to leave him to his own foolish ways she saw that george was decently educated she hid from the world all the little shifts and devices to which she had to resort in order to keep up an appearance of decency  mrs crowley  i suppose you too think fred allerton little better than a scamp  dick  my dear lady when a man has had to leave his club because he plays cards too well its at least permissible to suppose that theres something odd about him  mrs crowley  heres lady kelsey for heavens sake try and amuse her a little  lady kelsey comes back into the room  lady kelsey  oh dick im so full of my own troubles i forgot to ask about yours im so sorry to hear that youre ill  dick  on the contrary im in the very best of health  lady kelsey  but i saw in the papers that you were going to give up your seat in the house owing to illhealth  dick  of course id forgotten my heart is seriously deranged  mrs crowley  how dreadful what is the matter with it  dick  can you ask ive banged it about at your feet so long that its functions are excessively impaired and its beaten all my waistcoats out of shape  mrs crowley  dont be so foolish i was quite alarmed  dick  im going to retire  lady kelsey  from the bar as well  dick  from the bar as well henceforth i shall cultivate only such arts and graces as are proper to the man of leisure my fellow men are a great deal too strenuous and i propose to offer them the spectacle of a complete idler who demands from the world neither honours nor profit but only entertainment  mrs crowley  dyou mean to say youre going to give up a large practice and a position which may be very important merely to gratify a foolish whim  dick  i havent time to work life is so much too short a little while ago it occurred to me that i was nearly forty to mrs crowley dyou know the feeling  mrs crowley  no of course not dont be so uncivil  dick  by the way how old are you  mrs crowley  twentynine  dick  nonsense theres no such age  mrs crowley  i beg your pardon upper parlourmaids are always twentynine  dick  for years ive spent eight hours a day meddling with silly persons silly quarrels and eight hours more governing the nation ive never been able to spend more than half my income im merely working myself to death in order to leave a fortune to my nieces two desperately plain girls with red noses  lady kelsey  but what are you going to do  dick  oh i dont know perhaps ill try my hand at big game shooting if alec will take me on this expedition of his ive always thought shooting would be an agreeable pastime if partridges were the size of wellgrown sheep and pheasants a little larger than a cow  mrs crowley  then the breakdown in your health is all humbug  dick  absolute humbug if i were to tell the truth people would shut me up in a lunatic asylum ive come to the conclusion that theres only one game in the world worth playing and thats the game of life im rich enough to devote myself to it entirely  mrs crowley  but youll get bored to death  dick  not i why im growing younger every day my dear mrs crowley i dont feel a day more than eighteen  mrs crowley  you certainly look quite twentyfive  dick  i havent a white hair in my head  mrs crowley  i suppose your servant plucks them out every morning  dick  oh very rarely one a month at the outside  mrs crowley  i think i see one on the left temple  dick  really how careless of charles i must speak to him  mrs crowley  let me pluck it out  dick  i shall allow you to do nothing so familiar              george comes hurriedly into the room  george  theres alec mackenzie hes just driven up in a cab  dick  he must have come from the trial then its all over  lady kelsey  quick go to the stairs or miller wont let him up              george runs across the room and opens the door  george  calling miller miller mr mackenzies to come up  lucy allerton hearing a commotion comes in she is older than george a tall girl white now with eyes heavy from want of sleep she has lived in the country all her life and has brought up to london a sort of remoteness from the world she is beautiful in a very english manner and her clearcut features are an index to a character in which the moral notions are peculiarly rigid selfcontrol is a quality which she possesses in a marked degree and one which she enormously admires in others  lucy  who is it  george  its alec mackenzie hes come from the trial  lucy  then its finished at last she shakes hands with dick its so good of you to come  boulger  youre perfectly wonderful lucy how can you be so calm  lucy  because im quite sure of the result dyou imagine id doubt my father for a moment  dick  oh lucy for heavens sake dont be so sure you must be prepared for everything  lucy  oh no i know my father dyou think ive not studied him during these years that ive looked after him hes a child with all a childs thoughtlessness and simplicity and god knows hes weak i know his faults better than any one but it would be impossible for him to do anything criminal              the butler enters followed by alec mackenzie             alec is a tall wiry man wellknit             with dark hair and a small red             moustache and beard cut close to the face             he is about fiveandthirty he has great             ease of manner and there is about him an             air as though he were accustomed that             people should do as he told them  butler  mr mackenzie  george  is it finished for gods sake tell us quickly old man  lucy  why didnt father come with you is he following  alec  yes its all over  lady kelsey  thank goodness the suspense was really too dreadful  george  i knew theyd acquit him thank god  dick  looking at alecs face take care george              suddenly lucy goes up to alec and looks at             him an expression of horror distorts her             features  mrs crowley  lucy what is it  alec  i dont know how i am going to tell you  lucy  you say the trial was over when you came away  alec  yes  lucy  the jury had given their verdict  george  lucy what are you driving at you dont think   alec  your father asked me to come and break it to you  george  hes not dead  alec  perhaps it would be better if he were  lucy  they found him guilty  alec  yes  george  with a groan of despair oh but its impossible  lucy  putting her hand on his arm ssh  lady kelsey  my god my god im thankful that his wife is dead  lucy  im awfully stupid but if he was innocent how could they find him guilty i dont know what you mean  alec  i am afraid its very clear  lucy  there must be some horrible mistake  alec  i wish there were  george  breaking down into tears and sinking into a chair oh god what shall i do  lucy  dont do that george we want all our calmness now  george  dont you see they all expected it it was only you and i who believed in his innocence  lucy  to alec did you hear the evidence  alec  yes  lucy  and you followed it carefully  alec  very  lucy  what impression did it leave on your mind  alec  what can it matter how it affected me  lucy  i want to know  dick  lucy youre torturing us all  lucy  if you had been on the jury would your verdict have been the same as theirs  alec  i should have been obliged to judge according to my conscience  lucy  i see and you have no doubt that he was guilty  alec  dont ask me these horrible questions  lucy  but its very important i know that you are a perfectly honest and upright man if you think he was guilty there is nothing more to be said  alec  the case was so plain that the jury were not out of the box for more than ten minutes  lucy  did the judge say anything  alec  hesitatingly he said there could be no doubt about the justice of the verdict  lucy  what else he looks at her without answering you had better tell me now i shall see it in the papers tomorrow  alec  as though the words were dragged out of him he called it a very mean and shameful crime worse than another mans because your father was a gentleman of ancient family and bore a name of great honour  dick  to mrs crowley these judges have a weakness for pointing a moral  lucy  and what was the sentence a pause well  alec  seven years penal servitude  george  oh god  dick  my dear girl i cant tell you how sorry i am  lady kelsey  lucy what is it you frighten me  lucy  try and bear up george we want all the strength weve got you and i  mrs crowley puts her arms round lucy and kisses her  mrs crowley  oh my dear my dear  lucy  disengaging herself youre all very kind and i know you sympathise with me  mrs crowley  interrupting her you know that well do everything we can to help you  lucy  its so good of you theres really nothing that any one can do would you all mind leaving me alone with george we must talk this over by ourselves  mrs crowley  very well mr lomas will you put me into a cab  dick  certainly to lucy goodbye dear and god bless you  lucy  shaking hands with him dont worry too much about me if theres anything i want ill let you know  dick  thanks              he goes out with mrs crowley  alec  may i speak to you for a few minutes alone  lucy  not now mr mackenzie i dont want to seem rude but   alec  interrupting i know and i wouldnt insist unless it were a matter of the most urgent importance  lucy  very well george will you take aunt alice to her room i shall want you in a moment  george  yes  lucy  to lady kelsey wont you lie down and try and sleep a little you must be dreadfully exhausted  lady kelsey  ah dont think of me now dear think of yourself  lucy  smiling its purely selfish it eases me a little to fuss about you  george  ill wait in the smokingroom lucy  lucy  do  george and lady kelsey go out  alec  i think your selfcommand is wonderful ive never admired you more than at this moment  lucy  you make me feel such a prig its not really very strange if i keep my head because ive had an immensely long training since i was fifteen ive been alone to care for george and my father wont you sit down  alec  i can say what i want in a very few words you know that in a week i start for mombassa to take charge of the expedition in northeast africa i may be away for three or four years and i shall be exposed to a certain amount of danger when i left africa last time to gather supplies i determined i would crush those wretched slavetraders and now i think i have the means to do it  lucy  i think you are engaged on a very great work  alec  i dont know whether you ever noticed thatthat i cared more for you than for any one in the world but with the long journey in front of me i didnt think it was right to say anything to you it wasnt fair to ask you to bind yourself during my long absence and there was always the risk that a stray bullet might put an end to me i made up my mind that i must wait till i returned but things have changed now lucy i love you with all my heart will you marry me before i go  lucy  no i cant do that its very generous of you but i couldnt  alec  why not dont you know that i love you it would help me so much if i knew that you were waiting for me at home  lucy  i must look after my father i shall go and live near theprison so that i can see him whenever its possible  alec  you can do that as well if youre my wife you have before you a very difficult and trying time wont you let me help you  lucy  i couldnt heaven knows im grateful to you for offering to marry me on this day of my bitter humiliation i shall never forget your great kindness but i must stand alone i must devote myself to my father when hes released i must have a home to bring him to and i must tend him and care for him ah now he wants me more than ever  alec  youre very proud  lucy  giving him her hand dear friend dont think hardly of me i think i love you as much as its possible for a woman to love a man  alec  lucy  lucy  with a smile did you want me to tell you that in so many words i admire you and i trust you i should be very happy if george could grow into so brave and honest a man as you  alec  theyre very modest crumbs with which you want me to be satisfied  lucy  i know in your heart you think im right you would never seek to dissuade me from what im convinced is my duty  alec  cant i do anything for you at all  she looks at him for a moment intently she rings the bell  lucy  yes you can do me the greatest possible service  alec  im so glad what is it you mean  lucy  wait and ill tell you the butler enters ask mr george to come here please  butler  very well miss              he goes out  lucy  i want you to help me              george comes in  george  yes lucy  lucy  i want to give into your charge what i love most in the world george have you thought at all what youre going to do now im afraid you cant go back to oxford  george  no i dont know whats to become of me i wish i were dead  lucy  an idea has just come to me im going to ask mr mackenzie to take you with him to africa will you go  george  yes yes id do anything to get away from england i darent face my friendsim too ashamed  lucy  ah but its not to hide yourself that i want you to go mr mackenzie i daresay you know that weve always been very proud of our name and now its hopelessly dishonoured  george  lucy for gods sake   lucy  turning to him now our only hope is in you you have the opportunity of achieving a great thing you can bring back the old name to its old honour oh i wish i were a man i can do nothing but wait and watch if i could only fill you with my courage and with my ambition mr mackenzie you asked if you could do anything for me you can give george the chance of wiping out the shame of our family  alec  do you know that he will have to suffer every sort of danger and privation that often he will be parched by the heat and often soaked to the skin for days together sometimes hell not have enough to eat and hell have to work harder than a navvy  lucy  do you hear george are you willing to go  george  ill do anything you want me to lucy  alec  and you know that he may get killed there may be a good deal of fighting  lucy  if he dies a brave mans death i have nothing more to ask  alec  to george very well come with me and ill do my best for you  lucy  ah thanks you are really my friend  alec  and when i come back  lucy  then if you still care ask your question again  alec  and the answer  lucy  with a little smile the answer perhaps will be different   end of the first act     the second act        scene alec mackenzies tent in northeast africa it is night      the place is dimly lighted there is a little camp bed in one      corner with a mosquito net over it there are two or three folding      chairs some tin cases and a table on this a gun is lying       dick is seated with his head on his hands leaning on the table      fast asleep dr adamson the surgeon of the expedition comes      in he is a largeboned brawny fellow with a scotch accent he      looks at dick and smiles   doctor  hulloa there dick starts up and seizes the gun the doctor laughs all right dont shoot its only me  dick  with a laugh why the dickens did you wake me up i was dreamingdreaming of a highheeled boot and a neat ankle and the swish of a white lace petticoat  doctor  i thought id just have a look at your arm  dick  its one of the most æsthetic sights i know  doctor  your arm  dick  a pretty woman crossing piccadilly at swan and edgars you are a savage my good doctor and a barbarian you dont know the care and forethought the hours of anxious meditation it has needed for her to hold up that wellmade skirt with the elegant grace which enchants you  doctor  im afraid youre a very immoral man lomas  dick  ah my dear fellow at my time of life i have to content myself with condemning the behaviour of the younger generation even a camp bed in a stuffy tent with mosquitoes buzzing all around me has allurements greater than those of youth and beauty and i declare for all women to hear that i am proof against their wiles give me a comfortable bed to sleep in plenty to eat tobacco to smoke and amaryllis may go hang  doctor  well lets look at this wound of yours has it been throbbing at all  dick  oh its not worth bothering about itll be all right tomorrow  doctor  ill put a clean dressing on all the same  dick  all right he takes off his coat and rolls up his sleeve his arm is bandaged and during the next speeches the doctor puts on a dressing and a clean bandage you must be pretty well done up arent you  doctor  just about dropping but ive got a deuce of a lot more work before i turn in  dick  the thing that amuses me is to remember that i came to africa thinking i was going to have a rattling good time  doctor  you couldnt exactly describe it as a picnic could you but i dont suppose any of us knew it would be such a tough job as its turned out  dick  my friend if ever i return to my native land i will never be such a crass and blithering idiot as to give way again to a spirit of adventure  doctor  with a laugh youre not the sort of chap whom one would expect to take to african work why the blazes did you come  dick  thats precisely what ive been asking myself ever since we landed in this godforsaken swamp  doctor  the wound looks healthy enough itll hardly even leave a scar  dick  im glad that my fatal beauty wont be injured you see alecs about the oldest friend i have and then theres young allerton ive known him ever since he was a kid  doctor  thats an acquaintance that most of us wouldnt boast about  dick  i had an idea id like bond street all the better when i got back i never knew that i should be eaten alive by every kind of disgusting animal by night and day i say doctor do you ever think of a rump steak  doctor  when  dick  with a wave of the hand sometimes when were marching under a sun that just about takes the roof of your head off and weve had the scantiest and most uncomfortable breakfast possible i have a vision  doctor  dyou mind only gesticulating with one arm  dick  i see the diningroom of my club and myself sitting at a little table by the window looking out on piccadilly and theres a spotless tablecloth and all the accessories are spick and span an obsequious servant brings me a rump steak grilled to perfection and so tender that it melts in the mouth and he puts by my side a plate of crisp fried potatoes cant you smell them  doctor  laughing shut up  dick  and then another obsequious servant brings me a pewter tankard and into it he pours a bottle a large bottle mind you of foaming ale  doctor  youve certainly added considerably to our cheerfulness  dick  with a shrug of the shoulders ive often been driven to appease the pangs of raging hunger with a careless epigram and by the laborious composition of a limerick i have sought to deceive a most unholy thirst  doctor  well last night i thought youd made your last joke old man and that i had given my last dose of quinine  dick  we were in rather a tight corner werent we  doctor  this is the third expedition ive gone with mackenzie against the slaveraiders and i promise you ive never been so certain that all was over with us  dick  funny thing death is you know when you think of it beforehand it makes you squirm in your shoes but when youve just got it face to face it seems so obvious that you forget to be afraid its one of my principles never to be impressed by a platitude  doctor  its only by a miracle we escaped if those arabs hadnt hesitated to attack us just those ten minutes we should have been wiped out  dick  alec was splendid wasnt he  doctor  yes by jove he thought we were done for  dick  what makes you think that  doctor  well you see i know him pretty well hes been a pal of yours for twenty years in england but ive been with him out here three times and i tell you theres not much about a man that you dont know then  dick  well  doctor  well when things are going smoothly and everythings flourishing hes apt to be a bit irritable he keeps rather to himself and he doesnt say much unless you do something he doesnt approve of  dick  and then by jove he comes down on one like a thousand of bricks its not for nothing the natives call him thunder and lightning  doctor  but when things begin to look black his spirits go up like one oclock and the worse they are the more cheerful he is  dick  its one of his most irritating characteristics  doctor  when every one is starving with hunger and dead tired and soaked to the skin mackenzie fairly bubbles over with goodhumour  dick  when im in a bad temper i much prefer every one else to be in a bad temper too  doctor  these last few days hes been positively hilarious yesterday he was cracking jokes with the natives  dick  dryly scotch jokes i daresay they sound funny in an african dialect  doctor  ive never seen him more cheerful i said to myself by the lord harry the chief thinks were in a devil of a bad way  dick  thank heaven its all over now weve none of us had any sleep for three days and when i once get off i dont mean to wake up for a week  doctor  i must go and see the rest of my patients perkins has got a bad dose of fever this time he was quite delirious a while ago  dick  by jove id almost forgotten how one changes out here here am i feeling happy and comfortable and inclined to make a little jest or two and ive forgotten already that poor richardson is dead and lord knows how many natives  doctor  poor chap we could ill spare him the fates never choose the right man  dick  what do you mean by that  doctor  if we had to lose some one it would have been a damned sight better if that young cub had got the bullet which killed poor richardson  dick  george allerton  doctor  he wouldnt have been much loss would he  dick  no im afraid he wouldnt  doctor  mackenzie has been very patient with him i wonder he didnt send him back to the coast months ago when he sacked macinnery  dick  poor george everything has been against him  doctor  some men have got natures so crooked that with every chance in the world to go straight they cant manage it the only thing is to let them go to the devil as best they may  dick  alec was bound to give him another chance alec mackenzie comes in hulloa alec where have you been  alec  ive been going the round of the outlying sentries  dick  all serene  alec  yes ive just seen a native messenger that mindabi sent to me  doctor  anything important  alec  curtly yes hows the arm dick  dick  oh thats nothing its only a scratch  alec  youd better not make too light of it the smallest wound has a way of being troublesome in this country  doctor  hell be all right in a day or two  alec  how are the others  doctor  theyre going on pretty well on the whole perkins of course will be down for some days longer and some of the natives are rather badly hurt those devils have got explosive bullets  alec  any one in great danger  doctor  no i dont think so there are two men who are in rather a bad way but all they want is rest  alec  i see  dick  i say have you had anything to eat lately  alec  with a laugh good lord i quite forgot i wonder when the dickens i had some food last  dick  smiling youve had nothing today have you  alec  no i dont think so those arabs kept us so confoundedly busy  dick  you must be devilish hungry  alec  now you mention it i think i am and thirsty by jove i wouldnt give my thirst for an elephant tusk  dick  and to think theres nothing but tepid water to drink  doctor  ill go and tell the boy to bring you some food its a rotten game to play tricks with your digestion like that  alec  gaily stern man the doctor isnt he it wont hurt me once in a way and i shall enjoy it all the more now  doctor  calling selim  alec  no dont trouble the poor chaps just turned in dropping with sleep i told him he might till i called him i dont want much and i can easily get it myself he goes to a case and takes out a tin of meat and some ships biscuits its rather a nuisance that weve not been able to get any game lately              he sets the food down before him sits down             and begins to eat  dick  ironically appetising isnt it  alec  splendid  dick  you have all the instincts of the primeval savage alec it enrages and disgusts me  alec  with a laugh why  dick  you take food for the gross and bestial purpose of appeasing your hunger you have no appreciation for the delicacies of eating as a fine art  alec  the meats getting rather mouldy isnt it  dick  damnable its been a source of great anxiety to me in england  alec  what is he talking about now  dick  i was going on with the thread of my observations which you interrupted with the entirely obvious remark that the tinned meat was getting mouldy  alec  i apologise profusely pray go on  dick  i was about to observe that even in england you will eat the most carefully ordered meal with an indifference which is an outrage to decency indeed you pay less attention to it than here because at all events you do notice that the meat is mouldy but if any one gives you a good dinner you notice nothing ive given him priceless port doctor and he drank it as though it were cooking sherry  doctor  i confess it is lamentable but why is it a source of anxiety to you  dick  what on earth is to happen to him in his old age  alec  explain yourself my friend clearly but with as much brevity as possible  dick  the pleasure of eating is the only pleasure that remains to the old lovewhat is love when you lose your figure and your hair grows thin knowledgeone can never know everything and the desire passes with the fire of youth even ambition fails you in the end but to those who have lived wisely and well there remain three pleasures every day of their lives their breakfast their luncheon and their dinner  alec  with a laugh i wouldnt worry about my old age if i were you dick  dick  why  alec  because i think its ten to one that we shall all be dead tomorrow morning  doctor  what              there is a slight pause while both men stare             at him  dick  is this one of your little jokes alec  alec  you have often observed that i joke with difficulty  doctor  but whats wrong now  alec  youll neither of you sleep in your beds tonight another sell for the mosquitoes isnt it i propose to break up the camp and start marching as soon as the moon goes down  dick  i say its a bit thick after a day like this were all so done up that we shant be able to go a mile  alec  nonsense you will have had two hours rest  doctor  but some of those fellows who are wounded cant possibly be moved  alec  they must  doctor  i wont answer for their lives  alec  we must take the risk our only chance is to make a bold dash for it and we cant leave the wounded here  dick  i suppose theres going to be a deuce of a row  alec  grimly there is  dick  your companions seldom have a chance to complain of the monotony of their existence alec what are you going to do now  alec  at this moment im going to fill my pipe              there is a pause while alec fills and lights             his pipe  dick  i gather from the general amiability of your demeanour that were in a rather tight place  alec  tighter than any of your patentleather boots my friend  dick  gravely have we any chance of getting through old man  alec  lightly oh i dont know theres always a chance  dick  dont grin at me in that irritating fashion  alec  you must wish you were treading the light fantastic toe in a london ballroom dick  dick  frankly i do i suppose were going to fight again  alec  like kilkenny cats  dick  briskly well at all events thats some comfort if i am going to be done out of my nights rest i should like to take it out of some one  alec  if things turn out all right we shall have come near finishing the job and there wont be much more slaveraiding in this part of africa  dick  and if things dont turn out all right  alec  why then im afraid the teatables of mayfair will be deprived of your scintillating repartee forever  dick  well ive had a very good time in my life ive loved a little ive looked at some good pictures read some thundering fine books and ive worked and played if i can only account for a few more of those damned scoundrels before i die i shouldnt think i had much to complain of  alec  smiling youre a philosopher dick  dick  doesnt the possibility of an extremely unpleasant demise tempt you to a few appropriate reflections  alec  i dont know that it does im a bit of a fatalist and my theory is that when my time comes nothing can help me but at the bottom of my heart i cant resist the conviction that i shant die till i let myself  doctor  well i must go and put things in order ill bandage those fellows up and i hope theyll stand the jolting  alec  what about perkins  doctor  lord knows ill try and keep him quiet with chloral  alec  you neednt say anything about striking camp i dont propose that any one should know till a quarter of an hour before we start  doctor  but that wont give them time  alec  it must ive trained them often enough to get on the march quickly  doctor  very well              george allerton comes in as the doctor is             on the point of going  george  can i come in  alec  yes  doctor  doctor  hulloa  alec  you might stay a minute will you  doctor  coming back certainly  alec  didnt selim tell you that i wanted to speak to you  george  thats why ive come  alec  youve taken your time about it  george  i say could you give me a drink of brandy im awfully done up  alec  shortly theres no brandy left  george  hasnt the doctor got some  alec  no              there is a pause alec looks at him slowly  george  why are you all looking at me like that you look as if you were going to try me for something  dick  nonsense dont be so nervous  alec  abruptly do you know anything about the death of that turkana woman  george  no how should i  alec  come now you must know something about it last tuesday you came into camp and told me the turkana were very excited  george  unwillingly oh yes i remember something about it it had slipped my memory  alec  well  george  im not very clear about it the woman had been shot hadnt she one of our station boys had been playing the fool with her and he seems to have shot her  alec  have you made no inquiries as to who the man was  george  in a surly way i havent had time weve all been worked off our legs during these three days  alec  do you suspect no one  george  i dont think so  alec  think a moment  george  the only man who might have done it is that big scoundrel whom we got on the coast the swahili  alec  what makes you think that  george  hes been making an awful nuisance of himself and i know he was running after her  alec  i understand she complained about him to you  george  yes  alec  do you think that would be enough evidence to punish him on  george  hes a thorough blackguard and after all if one does make a mistake hes only a nigger  alec  youll be surprised to hear that when the woman was found she wasnt dead              george gives a movement of consternation  alec  she didnt die for nearly an hour  george  after a short pause was she able to say anything  alec  she accused you of having shot her  george  me  alec  it appears that you were playing the fool with her and when she got angry you took out a revolver and fired point blank presumably that she should tell no tales  george  its a stupid lie you know what they are its just like them to tell an absurd lie like that you wouldnt believe a parcel of niggers rather than me would you after all my words worth more than theirs  alec  taking from his pocket an exploded cartridge this was found about two yards from the body as you see its a revolver cartridge it was brought to me this evening  george  i dont know what that proves  alec  you know just as well as i do that none of our natives has a revolver besides ourselves only two or three of the servants have them              george becomes white with fear he takes out             his handkerchief and wipes his face  alec  quietly will you give me your revolver  george  i havent got it i lost it in the skirmish this afternoon i didnt tell you as i thought youd be annoyed  alec  i saw you cleaning it less than an hour ago  george  with a shrug of the shoulders perhaps its in my tent ill go and see  alec  sharply stop here  george  angrily youve no right to talk to me like that im sick to death of being ordered about you seem to think im a dog i came out here of my own free will and i wont let you treat me as if i were a servant  alec  if you put your hand to your hip pocket i think youll find your revolver there  george  im not going to give it to you  alec  quietly dyou want me to come and take it from you myself              the two men stare at one another for a moment             then george slowly puts his hand to his             pocket he lakes out the revolver and             suddenly aims at alec dick beats up             his arm as he fires and the doctor             springing forward seizes him round the             waist alec remains still  dick  during the struggle you young blackguard  george  let me go damn you  alec  you need not hold him              they leave go of george who sinks cowering             into a chair dick hands the revolver to             alec he silently fits into a chamber the             cartridge that had been brought to him  alec  you see that it fits hadnt you better make a clean breast of it  george  cowed yes i shot her she made a row and the devil got into me i didnt know id done anything till she screamed and i saw the blood what a fool i was to throw the cartridge away i wanted to have all the chambers charged  alec  do you remember that two months ago i hanged a man to the nearest tree because hed outraged a native woman  george  springing up in terror you wouldnt do that to me alec oh god no alec have mercy on me you wouldnt hang me oh why did i ever come to this damned place  alec  you need not be afraid im not going to do that in any case i must preserve the native respect for the white man  george  i was half drunk when i saw that woman i wasnt responsible for my actions  alec  the result is that the whole tribe has turned against us the chief is my friend and he sent a message to tell me he couldnt hold them in its from him i got the cartridge it wouldnt be so serious only the best fighting part of our forces are the turkana and we must expect treachery theyve stirred up the neighbouring tribes against us and all the work weve been doing for a year is undone thats the explanation of the arabs attack three days ago  george  sullenly i knew it was all my fault  alec  the natives have made up their minds to join the slavetraders and we shall be attacked on all sides tomorrow we cant hold out against god knows how many thousands  george  dyou mean youll all be killed  alec  if we remain here theres no escape  george  in a whisper what are you going to do to me alec              alec walks up and down the tent  alec  presently i think you might go and see your patients now doctor  doctor  very well  dick  shall i go too alec  alec  no you can stay here but dont open your mouth till youre spoken to  the doctor goes out  george  im sorry i did that silly thing just now im glad i didnt hit you  alec  it doesnt matter at all id forgotten all about it  george  i lost my head i didnt know what i was doing  alec  you need not trouble about that in africa even the strongest people are apt to get excited and lose their balance  alec relights his pipe and there its a very short pause  alec  did you ever know that before we came away i asked lucy to marry me  george  i knew you cared for her  alec  she asked me to bring you here in the hope that you would regain the good name of your family i think that is the object she has most at heart in the world its as great as her love for you the plan hasnt been much of a success has it  george  she ought to have known that i wasnt suited for this kind of life  alec  i saw very soon that you were weak and irresolute but i hoped to make something of you your intentions seemed good enough but you never had the strength to carry them out im sorry if i seem to be preaching to you  george  bitterly oh dyou think i care what any one says to me now  alec  gravely but not unkindly then i found you were drinking i told you that no man could stand liquor in this country and you gave me your word of honour that you wouldnt touch it again  george  yes i broke it i couldnt help it the temptation was too strong  alec  when we came to the station at muneas you and macinnery got blind drunk and the whole camp saw you i ought to have sent you back to the coast then but it would have broken lucys heart  george  it was macinnerys fault  alec  its because i thought he was to blame that i sent him back alone i wanted to give you another chance it struck me that the feeling of authority might have some influence on you and so when we came to the lake i left you to guard the ferry i put the chief part of the stores in your care and marched on i neednt remind you what happened then  george looks down sulkily and in default of excuses keeps silent  alec  i came to the conclusion that it was hopeless you seemed to me rotten through and through  george  with a little laugh like my father before me  alec  i couldnt believe a word you said you did everything you shouldnt have done the result was that the men mutinied and if i hadnt come back in the nick of time theyd have killed you and looted all the stores  george  you always blame me for everything a mans not responsible for what he does when hes down with fever  alec  it was too late to send you back to the coast then and i was obliged to take you on and now the end has come your murder of that woman has put us all in deadly peril already to your charge lie the deaths of richardson and almost twenty natives tribes that were friendly have joined with the arabs and were as near destruction as we can possibly be  george  what are you going to do  alec  were far away from the coast and i must take the law into my own hands  george  with a gasp youre not going to kill me  alec  are you fond of lucy  george  brokenly youyou know i am why dyou remind me of her now ive made a rotten mess of everything and im better out of the way but think of the disgrace of it itll kill lucy and she was hoping id do so much  alec  listen to me our only chance of escaping from the confounded fix were in is to make a sudden attack on the arabs before the natives join them we shall be enormously outnumbered but we may just smash them if we can strike tonight my plan is to start marching as if i didnt know that the turkana were going to turn against us after an hour all the whites but one and the swahilis whom i can trust implicitly will take a short cut the arabs will have had news of our starting and theyll try to cut us off at the pass i shall fall on them just as they begin to attack dyou understand  george  yes  alec  now i must have one white man to head the turkana and that man will run the greatest possible danger id go myself only the swahilis wont fight unless i lead them are you willing to take that post  george  i  alec  i could order you but the jobs too dangerous for me to force it on any one if you refuse i shall call the others together and ask some one to volunteer in that case you will have to find your way back alone as best you can to the coast  george  no no anything rather than the shame of that  alec  i wont hide from you that it means almost certain death but theres no other way of saving ourselves on the other hand if you show perfect courage at the moment the arabs attack and the turkana find that weve given them the slip you may escape if you do i promise nothing shall be said of all that has happened here  george  all right ill do that and i thank you with all my heart for giving me the chance  alec  im glad youve accepted whatever happens youll have done a brave action in your life he holds out his hand to george who takes it i think theres nothing more to be said you must be ready to start in half an hour heres your revolver remember that one chambers empty youd better put in another cartridge  george  yes ill do that              he goes out  dick  dyou think he has any chance of escaping  alec  if he has pluck he may get through  dick  well  alec  tomorrow we shall know if he has that last virtue of a blackguardcourage  dick  and if he hasnt its death youre sending him to  alec  yes its death   end of the second act     the third act        scene a smokingroom at lady kelseys leading by an archway      into a drawingroom at the back on the right is a glass door which      leads into the garden on one side is a sofa on the other a table      with cigarettes matches whiskey sodas etc       lady kelsey is giving a dance and the music of the lancers is      heard vaguely from the ballroom as the curtain rises mrs      crowley and sir robert boulger are sitting down lady kelsey      comes in with the rev james carbery   lady kelsey  oh you wretched people why arent you dancing its too bad of you to hide yourselves here  mrs crowley  we thought no one would find us in the smokingroom but why have you abandoned your guests lady kelsey  lady kelsey  oh ive got them all comfortably settled in the lancers and im free to rest myself for a quarter of an hour you dont know what agonies ive been suffering the whole evening  mrs crowley  good gracious me why  lady kelsey  im so afraid alec mackenzie will come  boulger  you neednt worry about that aunt alice hell never venture to show his face  lady kelsey  i didnt know what to do it was impossible to put the dance off its too dreadful that these horrible revelations should  carbery  supplying the word transpire  lady kelsey  yes transpire on the very day ive at last persuaded lucy to come into the world again i wish dick would come  boulger  yes hell be able to tell us something  mrs crowley  but will he  carbery  wherever i go people are talking about mr mackenzie and im bound to say ive found nobody who has a good word for him  boulger  bitterly humptydumptys had a great fall  carbery  i wonder if i might have a cigarette  mrs crowley  im sure you might and if you press me dreadfully ill have one too  boulger  dont press her shes already had far too many  mrs crowley  well ill forego the pressing but not the cigarette  carbery  handing her the box and giving her a light its against all my principles you know  mrs crowley  what is the use of principles except to give one an agreeable sensation of wickedness when one doesnt act up to them  dick comes in as she speaks  dick  my dear lady youre as epigrammatic as a dramatist do you say such things from choice or necessity  lady kelsey  dick  boulger  dick  mrs crowley  mr lomas  carbery  ah  the four exclamations are simultaneous  dick  this enthusiasm at my appearance is no less gratifying than unexpected  lady kelsey  im so glad youve come at last now we shall get at the truth  boulger  impatiently well  dick  my dear people what are you talking about  boulger  oh dont be such an ass  mrs crowley  good heavens didnt you read the times this morning  dick  i only came back from paris tonight besides i never read the papers except in august  mrs crowley  raising her eyebrows when theres nothing in them  dick  pardon me im an eager student of the seaserpent and the giant gooseberry  lady kelsey  my dear dick its too shocking i wish id had the courage to write and ask mr mackenzie not to come but since you both came back from africa a month ago hes been here nearly every day and hes been so good and kind to us i couldnt treat him as though there was no doubt the story was true  boulger  there cant be the least doubt about it by george i should like to kick him  dick  dryly my dear chap alec is a hardy scot and bigger than you so i shouldnt advise you to try  boulger  i was engaged to dine with him tonight but i wired to say i had a headache  lady kelsey  what will he think if he sees you here  boulger  he can think what he jolly well likes  lady kelsey  i hope he has the sense to stay away  carbery  i think youre pretty safe now lady kelsey its growing late  dick  will some one kindly explain  mrs crowley  dyou mean to say you really dont knowseriously after all you were with him  lady kelsey  my dear dick there are two columns of fiery denunciation in this mornings times  dick is a little startled but at once collects himself  dick  oh thats only the reaction thats nothing since he arrived in mombassa after three years in the heart of africa hes made almost a triumphal progress of course it couldnt last the reaction was bound to come  boulger  looking at him steadily the article is signed by a man named macinnery  dick  calmly alec found macinnery half starving at mombassa and took him solely out of charity but he was a worthless rascal and he had to send him back  boulger  he gives ample proof for every word he says  dick  whenever an explorer comes home theres some one to tell nasty stories about him people forget that kid gloves are not much use in a tropical forest and grow very indignant when they hear that a man has used a little brute force to make himself respected  lady kelsey  oh my dear dick its much worse than that first poor lucys father died  dick  youre not going to count that as an overwhelming misfortune we were unanimous in describing that gentlemans demise as an uncommonly happy release  lady kelsey  but lucy was heartbroken all the same and when her life seemed to grow a little more cheerful came her brothers tragic death  dick  abruptly to mrs crowley what is it exactly  mrs crowley  the long and short of it is that mr mackenzie was the cause of george allertons death  dick  lucys brother was killed by the slavetraders  boulger  mackenzie sent him into a confounded trap to save his own dirty skin  lady kelsey  and the worst of it is that i think lucy is in love with mr mackenzie  boulger makes a slight movement and for a moment there is an uncomfortable pause  carbery  i saw him this evening in piccadilly and i almost ran into his arms it was quite awkward  dick  frigidly why  carbery  i dont think i want to shake the mans hand hes nothing short of a murderer  boulger  savagely hes worse than that hes ten times worse  lady kelsey  well for heavens sake be polite to him if he comes tonight  carbery  i really couldnt bring myself to shake hands with him  dick  dryly dont you think youd better wait for evidence before you condemn him  boulger  my dear fellow the letter in the times is absolutely damning interviewers went to him from the evening papers and he refused to see them  dick  what does lucy say of it after all shes the person most concerned  lady kelsey  she doesnt know i took care that she shouldnt see the paper i wanted to give her this evenings enjoyment unalloyed  mrs crowley  take care here she is  lucy comes in  lady kelsey  smiling and reaching out her hand well darling  lucy  going to lady kelsey are you growing very tired my aunt  lady kelsey  i can rest myself for the time i dont think any one else will come now  lucy  gaily you faithless woman have you forgotten the guest of the evening  lady kelsey  mr mackenzie  lucy  bending over her my dear it was charming of you to hide the paper from me this morning  lady kelsey  startled did you see the letter i so wanted you not to till tomorrow  lucy  mr mackenzie very rightly thought i should know at once what was said about him and my brother he sent me the paper himself this evening  boulger  did he write to you  lucy  no he merely scribbled on a card i think you should read this  boulger  well im damned  lady kelsey  what did you think of the letter lucy  lucy  proudly i didnt believe it  boulger  bitterly you must be blinded by yourfriendship for alec mackenzie i never read anything more convincing  lucy  i could hardly believe him guilty of such an odious crime if he confessed it with his own lips  boulger  of course he wont do that  dick  did i ever tell you how i made acquaintance with alec in the atlanticabout three hundred miles from land  mrs crowley  what a perfectly ridiculous place for an introduction  dick  i was a silly young fool in those days and i habitually played the giddy goat in the course of which i fell overboard and was proceeding to drown when alec jumped in after me it was an incautious thing to do because he very nearly got drowned himself  lucy  thats not the only heroic thing hes done  dick  no its one of his hobbies to risk his life to save unnecessary and useless people but the funny thing is that ever since he saved mine hes been quite absurdly grateful he seems to think i did him an intentional service and fell into the water on purpose to give him a chance of pulling me out  lucy  with a long look at dick its very kind and good of you to have told that story  the butler comes in and announces alec mackenzie  butler  mr mackenzie  alec  blandly ah i thought i should find you here lady kelsey  lady kelsey  shaking hands with him how dyou do weve just been talking of you  alec  really  lady kelsey  its so late we were afraid you wouldnt come i should have been dreadfully disappointed  alec  its very kind of you to say so ive been at the travellers reading various appreciations of my own character  lady kelsey  somewhat embarrassed oh i heard there was something about you in the papers  alec  theres a good deal i really had no idea the world was so interested in me  lady kelsey  its charming of you to come tonight im sure you hate dances  alec  oh no they interest me enormously i remember one of the kings of uganda gave a dance in my honour ten thousand warriors in warpaint i assure you it was most impressive  dick  my dear fellow if paint is the attraction you really need not go much farther than mayfair  alec  pretending for the first time to notice boulger ah theres my little friend bobbie i thought you had a headache  lady kelsey  quickly im afraid bobby is dreadfully dissipated hes not looking at all well  alec  goodhumouredly you shouldnt keep such late hours bobbie at your age one wants ones beauty sleep  boulger  its very kind of you to take an interest in me my headache has passed off  alec  im very glad what do you usephenacetin  boulger  it went away of its own accordafter dinner  alec  smiling so you resolved to give the girls a treat by coming to lady kelseys dance how nice of you not to disappoint them he turns to lucy and holds out his hand they look into one anothers eyes she takes his hand i sent you a paper this evening  lucy  it was very good of you  carbery comes forward and offers his arm  carbery  i think this is my dance miss allerton may i take you in  alec  carbery i saw you in piccadilly just now you were darting about just like a young gazelle i had no idea you could be so active  carbery  i didnt see you  alec  i observed that you were deeply interested in the shop windows as i passed how are you  he holds out his hand and for a moment carbery hesitates to take it but alecs steady gaze compels him  carbery  how dyou do  alec  with an amused smile so glad to see you again old man  dick gives an audible chuckle and carbery reddening draws his hand away angrily he goes to lucy and offers his arm  boulger  to mrs crowley shall i take you back  mrs crowley  do  lady kesley  wont you come mr mackenzie  alec  if you dont mind ill stay and smoke just one cigarette with dick lomas you know im not a dancing man  lady kelsey  very well  all go out except alec and dick  dick  i suppose you know we were all beseeching providence youd have the grace to stay away tonight  alec  with a smile i suspected it i confess i shouldnt have come only i wanted to see lucy ive been in the country all day and i knew nothing about macinnerys letter till i saw the placards at the station  dick  macinnery proposes to make things rather uncomfortable i imagine  alec  with a smile i made a mistake didnt i i ought to have dropped him in the river when i had no further use for him  dick  what are you going to do  alec  its not easy to clear myself at a dead mans expense the earth covers his crime and his sins and his weakness  dick  dyou mean to say that you are going to sit still and let them throw mud at you  alec  when george was dead i wrote to lucy that he died like a brave man i cant now publish to the whole world that he was a coward and a rogue i cant rake up again the story of her fathers crime  dick  impatiently surely thats absolutely quixotic  alec  no it isnt i tell you i cant do anything else im bound hand and foot lucy has talked to me of georges death and the only thing that has consoled her is the idea that in a manner he had redeemed his fathers good name how can i rob her of that she placed all her hopes in george how could she face the world with the knowledge that her brother was rotten to the core as rotten as her father  dick  it seems awfully hard  alec  besides when all is said and done the boy did die game dont you think that should count for something no i tell you i cant give him away now i should never cease to reproach myself i love lucy far too much to cause her such bitter pain  dick  and if it loses you her love  alec  i think she can do without love better than without selfrespect  lucy comes in with mrs crowley  lucy  ive sent my partner away i felt i must have a few words alone with you  dick  shall i take mrs crowley into a retired corner  lucy  no we have nothing to say that you cant hear you and nellie know that were engaged to be married to alec i want you to dance with me  alec  its very good of you  mrs crowley  dont you think thats rather foolish lucy  lucy  to alec i want to show them all that i dont believe that youre guilty of an odious crime  alec  theyve said horrible things about me  lucy  not to me they wanted to hide it from me but i knew they were talking  alec  youll grow used to hearing shameful things said of me i suppose i shall grow used to it too  lucy  oh i hate them  alec  ah its not that i mind what torments me is that it was so easy to despise their praise and now i cant despise their blame  mrs crowley  smiling i believe you have some glimmerings of human nature in you after all  lucy  when you came tonight so calm and selfpossessed i admired you as id never admired you before  alec  its easy enough to command ones face i learnt to do that in africa when often my life depended on my seeming to have no fear but in my heart  i never knew that i could feel so bitter and yet after all its only your good opinion that i care for  lucy  ive trusted you implicitly from the first day i saw you  alec  thank god for that today is the first time ive wanted to be assured that i was trusted and yet im ashamed to want it  lucy  ah dont be too hard upon yourself youre so afraid of letting your tenderness appear  alec  the only way to be strong is never to surrender to ones weakness strength is merely a habit like everything else i want you to be strong too i want you never to doubt me whatever you may hear said  lucy  i gave my brother into your hands and told you that if he died a brave mans death i could ask for no more  alec  i should tell you that ive made up my mind to make no answer to the charges that are made against me  there is a very short pause while he looks at her steadily  mrs crowley  but why  alec  to lucy i can give you my word of honour that ive done nothing which i regret i know that what i did was right with regard to george and if it were all to come again i would do exactly as i did before  lucy  i think i can trust you  alec  i thought of you always and everything i did was for your sake every single act of mine during these four years in africa has been done because i loved you  lucy  you must love me always alec for now i have only you he bends down and kisses her hand come  he gives her his arm and they walk out  mrs crowley  i feel as if i should rather like to cry  dick  do you really so do i  mrs crowley  dont be so silly  dick  by the way you dont want to dance with me do you  mrs crowley  certainly not you dance abominably  dick  its charming of you to say so it puts me at my ease at once  mrs crowley  come and sit on the sofa and talk seriously  dick  ah you want to flirt with me mrs crowley  mrs crowley  good heavens what on earth makes you think that  dick  its what a woman always means when she asks you to talk sensibly  mrs crowley  i cant bear a man who thinks women are in love with him  dick  bless you i dont think that i only think they want to marry me  mrs crowley  thats equally detestable  dick  not at all however old ugly and generally undesirable a man is hell find a heap of charming girls who are willing to marry him marriage is still the only decent means of livelihood for a really nice girl  mrs crowley  but my dear friend if a woman really makes up her mind to marry a man nothing on earth can save him  dick  dont say that you terrify me  mrs crowley  you need not be in the least alarmed because i shall refuse you  dick  thanks awfully but all the same i dont think ill risk a proposal  mrs crowley  my dear mr lomas your only safety is in immediate flight  dick  why  mrs crowley  it must be obvious to the meanest intelligence that youve been on the verge of proposing to me for the last month  dick  oh i assure you youre quite mistaken  mrs crowley  then i shant come to the play with you tomorrow  dick  but ive taken the seats and ive ordered an exquisite dinner at the carlton  mrs crowley  what have you ordered  dick      potage bisque she makes a little face     sole normande she shrugs her shoulders     wild duck  mrs crowley  with an orange salad  dick  yes  mrs crowley  i dont positively dislike that  dick  and ive ordered a soufflé with an ice in the middle of it  mrs crowley  i shant come  dick  i shouldnt have thought you kept very well abreast of dramatic art if you insist on marrying every man who takes you to a theatre  mrs crowley  demurely i was very nicely brought up  dick  of course if youre going to make yourself systematically disagreeable unless i marry you i suppose i shall have to do it in selfdefence  mrs crowley  i dont know if you have the least idea what youre talking about im sure i havent  dick  i was merely asking you in a rather wellturned phrase to name the day the lamb shall be ready for the slaughter  mrs crowley  couldnt you infuse a little romance into it you might begin by going down on your bended knees  dick  i assure you thats quite out of fashion lovers nowadays are much too middleaged and their joints are creaky besides it ruins the trousers  mrs crowley  at all events there can be no excuse for your not saying that you know youre utterly unworthy of me  dick  wild horses wouldnt induce me to make a statement which is so remote from the truth  mrs crowley  and of course you must threaten to commit suicide if i dont consent  dick  women are such sticklers for routine they have no originality  mrs crowley  very well have it your own way but i must have a proposal in due form  dick  only four words are needed counting them on his fingers will you marry me  mrs crowley  that is both clear and simple i reply in one no  dick  as though he were not sure that he had heard correctly i beg your pardon  mrs crowley  the answer is in the negative  dick  youre joking youre certainly joking  mrs crowley  i will be a sister to you  dick  do you mean to say you deliberately refuse me  mrs crowley  smiling i promised you i would  dick  with much seriousness i thank you from the bottom of my heart  mrs crowley  puzzled the mans mad the mans nothing short of a raving lunatic  dick  i wanted to see if you were really attached to me you have given me a proof of esteem which i promise you i will never forget  mrs crowley  laughing youre a perfect idiot mr lomas  dick  its one of my cherished convictions that a really nice woman is never so cruel as to marry a man she cares for  mrs crowley  youre much too flippant to marry anybody and youre perfectly odious into the bargain  she goes out dick chuckling lights a cigarette alec comes in and lies down lazily on the sofa  alec  why dick whats the matter you look as pleased as punch  dick  my dear fellow i feel like the terrible turk ive been wrestling and i thought i was going to have a fall but by the display of considerable agility ive managed to keep my legs  alec  what do you mean  dick  nothing its merely the gaiety of fortytwo  boulger comes into the room followed immediately by mallins and carbery he starts slightly when he sees alec but then goes over to the table on which is the whiskey  mallins  may we smoke here bobby  boulger  certainly dick insisted that this room should be particularly reserved for that purpose  the butler comes in with a small silver salver and takes up one or two dirty glasses  dick  lady kelsey is the most admirable of all hostesses  alec  taking a cigarette from his case give me a match bobby theres a good boy boulger with his back turned to alec takes no notice he pours himself out some whiskey alec smiles slightly bobby throw me over the matches  boulger  with his back still turned miller  butler  yes sir  boulger  mr mackenzie is asking for something  butler  yes sir  alec  you might give me a light will you  butler  yes sir  the butler takes the matches to alec who lights his cigarette  alec  thank you complete silence is preserved till the butler leaves the room i perceive bobbie that during my absence you have not added good manners to your other accomplishments  boulger  if you want things you can ask the servants for them  alec  goodhumouredly dont be foolish bobbie  boulger  would you be so kind as to remember that my name is boulger  alec  smiling perhaps you would like me to call you sir robert  boulger  i should prefer that you would call me nothing at all i have absolutely no wish to know you  alec  which shows that your taste is as bad as your breeding  boulger  angrily walking up to him by god ill knock you down  alec  you could hardly do that when im already lying on my back  boulger  look here mackenzie im not going to let you play the fool with me i want to know what answer you have to make to all these charges that have been brought against you  alec  might i suggest that only miss allerton has the least right to receive answers to her questions and she hasnt questioned me  boulger  ive given up trying to understand her attitude if i were she it would make me sick with horror to look at you since this morning youve rested under a direct accusation of causing georges death and youve said nothing in selfdefence  alec  nothing  boulger  youve been given an opportunity to explain yourself and you havent taken it  alec  quite true  boulger  are you not going to deny the charge  alec  im not  boulger  then i can only draw one conclusion there appears to be no means of bringing you to justice but at least i can refuse to know you  alec  all is over between us and shall i return your letters and your photograph  boulger  im not joking  alec  its singular that though im scotch and you are english i should be able to see how ridiculous you are while youre quite blind to your own absurdity  dick  come alec remember hes only a boy  boulger  to dick lomas im perfectly able to look after myself and ill thank you not to interfere to alec if lucys so indifferent to her brothers death that shes willing to keep up with you thats her own affair   dick  interrupting come bobbie dont make a scene  boulger  furiously leave me alone confound you  alec  do you think this is quite the place for an altercation wouldnt you gain more notoriety if you attacked me in my club or at church parade on sunday  boulger  its mere shameless impudence that you should come here tonight youre using these wretched women as a shield because you know that as long as lucy sticks to you there are people who wont believe the story  alec  i came for the same reason as yourself dear boy because i was invited  dick  now then bobbie shut up  boulger  i shant shut up the mans got no right to force himself here  dick  remember that youre lady kelseys nephew  boulger  i didnt ask him dyou think id have come if i knew he was going to be here hes acknowledged that he has no defence  alec  pardon me i acknowledge nothing and deny nothing  boulger  that wont do for me i want the truth and im going to get it ive got a right to know  alec  beginning to lose his temper dont make an ass of yourself bobby  boulger  by god ill make you answer  as he says this he goes up to alec furiously but alec with a twist of his arm hurls him back  alec  i could break your back you silly boy  with a cry of anger boulger is about to spring at alec when dick gets in the way  dick  now then no scenes and youll only get the worst of it bobby alec could just crumple you up take him away mallins dont stand there like a stuffed owl carbery  boulger  let me alone you fool  mallins  come along old chap  boulger  to alec you damned skunk  dick  now then be off with you dont make a silly ass of yourself  boulger mallins and carbery go out  dick  poor lady kelsey tomorrow half london will be saying that you and bobby had a standup fight in her drawingroom  alec  furiously the damned cubs  dick  the position is growing confoundedly awkward  alec  they lick my boots till i loathe them and then they turn against me like a pack of curs oh i despise themthese silly boys who stay at home wallowing in their ease while men work thank god ive done with them all now they think one can fight ones way through africa as easily as one walks down piccadilly they think one goes through hardships and dangers illness and starvation to be the lion of a dinnerparty in mayfair  dick  my dear alec keep calm  alec  with a visible effort containing himself completely with studied nonchalance dyou think that i look wildly excited  dick  ironically i dont think butter would melt in your mouth  dick and alec go out into the garden in a moment boulger comes in with lady kelsey  boulger  thank heaven theres nobody here  lady kelsey  i think youre dreadfully foolish bobby you know how lucy resents any interference with her actions  boulger  wont you sit down you must be dreadfully tired  lady kelsey  why wont you wait till tomorrow  boulger  i feel that it ought to be settled at once  lucy appears  lucy  did you send for me my aunt mr carbery said you wanted to speak to me here  lady kelsey  yes i gave him that message  boulger  i asked aunt alice to beg you to come here i was afraid you wouldnt if i asked you  lucy  lightly what nonsense im always delighted to see you  boulger  i wanted to speak to you about something and i thought aunt alice should be present  lucy  is it so important that it cant wait till tomorrow  boulger  i venture to think its very important  lucy  smiling im all attention  he hesitates for a moment then braces himself to the ordeal  boulger  ive told you often lucy that ive been in love with you for as many years as i can remember  lucy  surely youve not snatched me from the unwilling arm of my partner in order to make me a proposal of marriage  boulger  im perfectly serious lucy  lucy  smiling i assure you it doesnt suit you at all  boulger  the other day i asked you again to marry me just before alec mackenzie came back  lucy  it was very charming of you you mustnt think that because i laugh at you a little im not grateful for your affection  boulger  except for that letter in this mornings times i should never have dared to say anything to you again but that changes everything  lucy  i dont understand what you mean  boulger  after a little pause i ask you again if youll be my wife when alec mackenzie came back i understood why you were so indifferent to me but you cant marry him now  lucy  you have no right to talk to me like this  boulger  im the only man whos related to you at all and i love you with my whole soul  lady kelsey  i think you should listen to him lucy im growing old and soon youll be quite alone in the world  boulger  i dont ask you to care for me i only want to serve you  lucy  i can only repeat that im very grateful to you i can never marry you  boulger  beginning to lose his temper again are you going to continue to know mackenzie if youll take the advice of any unprejudiced person about that letter youll find that hell say the same as i there can be no shadow of doubt that mackenzie is guilty of a monstrous crime  lucy  i dont care what the evidence is i know he cant have done a shameful thing  boulger  but have you forgotten that its your own brother he killed the whole country is up in arms against him and you are quite indifferent  lucy  much moved oh bobbie how can you be so cruel  boulger  if you ever really cared for george at all you must wish to punish the man who caused his death  lucy  oh why dyou torment me i tell you that he isnt guilty its because im convinced of that   boulger  interrupting but have you asked him  lucy  no  boulger  he might give you the truth  lucy  i couldnt do that  boulger  why not  lady kelsey  its very strange that he should insist on this silence  lucy  do you believe that story too  lady kelsey  i dont know what to believe its so extraordinary if the mans innocent why doesnt he speak  lucy  he knows i trust him i couldnt cause him the great pain of asking him questions  boulger  are you afraid he couldnt answer them  lucy  no no no  boulger  well just try after all you owe as much as that to the memory of george  lady kelsey  i think its very unreasonable lucy he knows were his friends he can count on our discretion  lucy  i believe in him implicitly i believe in him with all the strength ive got  boulger  then surely it can make no difference if you ask him there can be no reason for him not to trust you  lucy  oh why dont you leave me alone  boulger  ask him point blank if he refuses to answer you   lucy  hastily it would mean nothing why should he answer i believe in him absolutely i think hes the greatest and most honourable man ive ever known i care more for his little finger than for the whole world i love him with all my heart and thats why he cant be guilty of this horrible crime because ive loved him for years and hes known it and he loves me and hes loved me always  alec and dick stroll in from the garden  lucy  alec alec i want you thank god youve come  alec  going to her quickly what is it  lucy  alec you must tell them now about you and me  alec looks at lucy for a moment and then turns to lady kelsey  alec  i think perhaps we ought to have told you before lady kelsey but we wanted to enjoy our little secret by ourselves  lady kelsey  im afraid to understand  alec  i have asked lucy to be my wife and she  lucy  interrupting him she said she would be honoured and deeply grateful  lady kelsey  greatly embarrassed i hardly know what to say how long have you been engaged  lucy  wont you tell me youre pleased my aunt i know you want me to be happy  lady kelsey  of course i want you to be happy but ii              boulger turns on his heel and walks out  dick  offering his arm to lady kelsey wouldnt you like to go back to the drawingroom              she allows herself to be led away helplessly             alec and lucy are left alone  alec  with a smile i dont think our announcement has been received with enthusiasm  lucy  youre not angry with me alec  alec  of course not everything you do is right and charming  lucy  i shall really think im a wonderful person if ive taught you to pay compliments  alec  im so glad to be alone with you now at all events people will have the sense to leave us by ourselves  lucy  passionately i want your love i want your love so badly  alec  taking her in his arms my darling  lucy  clinging to him the moment im with you i feel so confident and happy  alec  only when youre with me lucy looks at him for an instant he repeats the question in a caressing voice only when youre with me darling  lucy  why dyou think i made you tell them we were engaged  alec  you took me by surprise  lucy  i had to tell them i couldnt keep it back they made me suffer so dreadfully  alec  the brutes tell me what they did  lucy  oh they said horrible things about you  alec  no more than that  lucy  its nothing to you but to me oh you dont know what agony i endure im such a coward i thought i was so much braver  alec  i dont understand you  lucy  i wanted to burn my ships behind me i wanted to reassure myself alec makes a slight movement away from her but she holds him back anxiously forgive me dear you dont know how terrible it is i stand so dreadfully alone every one is convinced that you caused poor georges deathevery one but me alec looks at her gravely without speaking i try to put the thoughts out of my head but i canti cant that letter in the times looks so dreadfully true dont you see what i mean the uncertainty is more than i can bear at the first moment i felt so absolutely sure of you  alec  and now you dont  lucy  i trust you just as much as ever i know its impossible that you should have done a shameful thing but there it stands in black and white and you have nothing to say in answer  alec  i know its very difficult that is why i asked you to believe in me  lucy  i do alecwith all my soul but have mercy on me im not so strong as i thought its easy for you to stand alone youre iron but im a weak woman  alec  oh no youre not like other women i was proud of your unconquerable spirit  lucy  it was easy to be brave where my father was concerned and george but youre the man i love and its so different i dont know any more how to stand alone              alec looks at her thinking but does not reply             for a moment  alec  do you remember that only an hour ago i told you that id done nothing which i wouldnt do again i gave you my word of honour that i could reproach myself for nothing  lucy  oh i know im so utterly ashamed of myself but i cant bear the doubt  alec  doubt youve said the word at last  lucy  i tell every one that i dont believe a word of these horrible charges and i repeat to myself im certain im certain that hes innocent and yet at the bottom of my heart theres a doubt and i cant crush it  alec  is that why you told them we were engaged to be married  lucy  i wanted to kill that gnawing pain of suspicion i thought if i stood up before them and cried out that my trust in you was so great i was willing to marry you notwithstanding everything i should at least have peace in my own heart              alec walks up and down then he stops in             front of lucy  alec  what is it precisely you want me to do  lucy  i want you to have mercy on me because i love you dont tell the world if you choose not to but tell me the truth i know youre incapable of lying if i only have it from your own lips i shall believe i want to be certain certain  alec  dont you realise that i would never have asked you to marry me if my conscience hadnt been quite clear dont you realise that the reasons i have for holding my tongue must be of overwhelming strength  lucy  but i am going to be your wife and i love you and you love me  alec  i implore you not to insist lucy let us remember only that the past is gone and we love one another its impossible for me to tell you anything  lucy  oh but you must now if any part of the story is true you must give me a chance of judging for myself  alec  im very sorry i cant  lucy  but youll kill my love for you the doubt which lurked at the bottom of my soul now fills me how can you let me suffer such maddening torture  alec  i thought you trusted me  lucy  ill be satisfied if youll only tell me one thing only tell me that when you sent george on that expedition you didnt know that hed be killed alec looks at her steadily only say that alec say thats not true and ill believe you  alec  very quietly but it is true              lucy does not answer but stares at him with             terrified eyes  lucy  oh i dont understand oh my dearest dont treat me as a child have mercy on me you must be serious now its a matter of life and death to both of us  alec  im perfectly serious  lucy  you knew that you were sending george into a deathtrap you knew he couldnt escape alive  alec  except by a miracle  lucy  and you dont believe in miracles  alec  no  lucy  oh it cant be true oh alec alec alec oh what shall i do  alec  i tell you that whatever i did was inevitable  lucy  then if thats true the rest must be true also oh its awful i cant realise it havent you anything to say at all  alec  in a low voice only that ive loved you always with all my soul  lucy  you knew how much i loved my brother you knew how much it meant to me that he should live to wipe out my fathers dishonour all the future was centred on him and you sacrificed him  alec  hesitatingly i think i might tell you this he had committed a grave error of judgment we were entrapped by the arabs and our only chance of escape entailed the almost certain death of one of us              an inkling of the truth seizes lucy and her             face is suddenly distorted with horror she             goes up to him impulsively her voice             trembles with emotion  lucy  alec alec he didnt do somethingunworthy youre not trying to shield him  alec  hoarsely no no no  lucy  with a gasp of relief almost to herself thank god i couldnt have borne that to alec hopelessly then i dont understand  alec  it was not unjust that he should suffer for the catastrophe which he had brought about  lucy  at those times one doesnt think of justice he was so young so frank wouldnt it have been nobler to give your life for his  alec  oh my dear you dont know how easy it is to give ones life how little you know me do you think i should have hesitated if my death had been sufficient to solve the difficulty i had my work to do i was bound by solemn treaties to the surrounding tribes it would have been cowardly for me to die i tell you my death would have meant the awful death of every man in my party  lucy  i can only see one thing that you took george george of all others  alec  i knew at the time that what i did might cost me your love and though you wont believe this i did it for your sake              at this moment mrs crowley enters with             sir robert boulger she has a cloak on  mrs crowley  i was just coming to say goodnight bobby is going to drive me home she suddenly notices lucys agitation what on earths the matter              lady kelsey and dick lomas come in lady             kelsey looks at lucy and then goes up to             her impulsively  lady kelsey  lucy lucy  lucy  brokenly im no longer engaged to mr mackenzie he cant deny that what is said about him is true              they look at him in astonishment but he makes             no movement  mrs crowley  to alec havent you anything to say at all you must have some explanation to offer  alec  no i have none whatever  dick  alec old man have you realised all that this means  alec  quite i see now that it was inevitable  lucy  with a sudden burst of furious anger you killed him you killed him as surely as if youd strangled him with your own hands              robert boulger goes to the door and flings             it open alec gives lucy a look then             slightly shrugs his shoulders he walks             out without a word the moment he has             gone lucy sinks down and bursts into             passionate tears   end of the third act     the fourth act        scenea library in the house of dick lomas in portman square       dick and his valet dick is putting flowers into a vase   dick  has mr mackenzie come in  charles  yes sir hes gone to his room  dick  i expect mrs crowley and miss allerton to tea if any one else comes im not at home  charles  very well sir  dick  and if a caller should ask at what time im expected back you havent the least idea  charles  very well sir  dick  we shall want breakfast at eight tomorrow im going down to southampton to see mr mackenzie off but i shall be home to dinner how about those cases in the hall  charles  mr mackenzie said they were to be sent for this afternoon theyre only labelled zanzibar is that sufficient sir  dick  oh i suppose so mr mackenzie will have given the shippers all directions youd better bring the tea at once mrs crowley is coming at four  charles  very well sir              he goes out dick continues to arrange the             flowers than goes to the window and looks             out he comes back the door is opened by             charles who announces mrs crowley  charles  mrs crowley  dick  going towards her eagerly and taking both her hands best of women  mrs crowley  you seem quite glad to see me  dick  i am but where is lucy  mrs crowley  shes coming later i dont know why you should squeeze my hands in this pointed manner  dick  what an age it is since i saw you  mrs crowley  if you bury yourself in scotland all the summer you cant expect to see people who go to homburg and the italian lakes  dick  heavens how you cultivate respectability  mrs crowley  its a sensitive plant whose vagaries one has to humour  dick  arent you delighted to be back in town  mrs crowley  londons the most charming place in the world to get away from and to come back to now tell me all youve been doing if i can hear it without blushing too furiously  dick  my behaviour would have done credit to a clergymans only daughter i dragged alec off to scotland after that horrible scene at lady kelseys and we played golf  mrs crowley  was he very wretched poor thing  dick  he didnt say a word i wanted to comfort him but he never gave me a chance he never mentioned lucys name  mrs crowley  did he seem unhappy  dick  no he was just the same as ever impassive and collected  mrs crowley  really hes inhuman  dick  hes an anomaly in this juvenile century hes an ancient roman who buys his clothes in savile row an eagle caged with a colony of canaries  mrs crowley  then hes very much in the way in england and its much better for him that he should go back to africa  dick  this time tomorrow hell be halfway down the channel  mrs crowley  im really beginning to think youre a perfect angel mr lomas  dick  dont say that it makes me feel so middleaged id much sooner be a young sinner than an elderly cherub  mrs crowley  it was sweet of you to look after him through the summer and then insist on his staying here till he went away how long is he going for this time  dick  heaven knows perhaps for ever  mrs crowley  have you told him that lucy is coming  dick  no i thought that was a pleasing piece of information which id leave you to impart  mrs crowley  thanks  dick  shes only coming to indulge a truly feminine passion for making scenes and shes made alec quite wretched enough already why doesnt she marry robert boulger  mrs crowley  why should she  dick  half the women i know merely married their husbands to spite somebody else it appears to be one of the commonest causes of matrimony  mrs crowley  with a quizzical look at him talking of which what are you going to do when mr mackenzie is gone  dick  talking of the weather and the crops i propose to go to spain  mrs crowley  opening her eyes wide how very extraordinary i thought of going there too  dick  then without a moments hesitation i shall go to norway  mrs crowley  itll be dreadfully cold  dick  dreadfully but i shall be supported by the consciousness of having done my duty  mrs crowley  you dont think there would be room for both of us in spain  dick  im convinced there wouldnt we should always be running against one another and youd insist on my looking out all your trains in bradshaw  mrs crowley  i hope you remember that you asked me to tea today  dick  pardon me you asked yourself i keep the letter next to my heart and put it under my pillow every night  mrs crowley  you fibber besides if i did it was only on lucys account  dick  that i venture to think is neither polite nor accurate  mrs crowley  i dont think i should so utterly detest you if you hadnt such a good opinion of yourself  dick  you forget that i vowed on the head of my maternal grandmother never to speak to you again  mrs crowley  oh im always doing that i tell my maid that time she does my hair badly  dick  you trifled with the tenderest affection of an innocent and unsophisticated old bachelor  mrs crowley  is that you by any chance  dick  of course its me dyou think i was talking of the man in the moon  mrs crowley  looking at him critically with the light behind you might still pass for thirtyfive  dick  ive given up youth and its vanities i no longer pluck out my white hairs  mrs crowley  then how on earth do you occupy your leisure  dick  for the last three months ive been laboriously piecing together the fragments of a broken heart  mrs crowley  if you hadnt been so certain that i was going to accept you i should never have refused i couldnt resist the temptation of saying no just to see how you took it  dick  i flatter myself that i took it very well  mrs crowley  you didnt you showed an entire lack of humour you might have known that a nice woman doesnt marry a man the first time he asks her its making oneself too cheap it was very silly of you to go off to scotland as if you didnt care how was i to know that you meant to wait three months before asking me again  dick  i havent the least intention of asking you again  mrs crowley  then why in heavens name did you invite me to tea  dick  may i respectfully remind you first that you invited yourself   mrs crowley  interrupting youre so irrelevant  dick  and secondly that an invitation to tea is not necessarily accompanied by a proposal of marriage  mrs crowley  im afraid youre lamentably ignorant of the usages of good society  dick  i assure you its not done in the best circles  mrs crowley  with a little pout i shall be very cross with you in a minute  dick  why  mrs crowley  because youre not behaving at all prettily  dick  dyou know what id do if i were you propose to me  mrs crowley  oh i couldnt do anything so immodest  dick  i have registered a vow that i will never offer my hand and heart to any woman again  mrs crowley  on the head of your maternal grandmother  dick  oh no far more serious than that on the grave of my maiden aunt who left me all my money  mrs crowley  what will you say if i do  dick  that depends entirely on how you do it i may remind you however that first you go down on your bended knees  mrs crowley  oh i waived that with you  dick  and then you confess youre unworthy of me  mrs crowley  mr lomas i am a widow i am twentynine and extremely eligible my maid is a treasure my dressmaker is charming i am clever enough to laugh at your jokes and not so learned as to know where they come from  dick  really youre very longwinded i said it all in four words  mrs crowley  so could i if i might write it down  dick  you must say it  mrs crowley  but what im trying to make you understand is that i dont want to marry you a bit youre just the sort of man wholl beat his wife regularly every saturday night you will say yes if i ask you wont you  dick  ive never been able to refuse a woman anything  mrs crowley  i have no doubt you will after six months of holy matrimony  dick  i never saw any one make such a fuss about so insignificant a detail as a proposal of marriage  mrs crowley  dick she stretches out her hands smiling and he takes her in his arms you really are a detestable person  dick  with a smile taking a ring from his pocket i bought an engagement ring yesterday on the off chance of its being useful  mrs crowley  then you meant to ask me all the time  dick  of course i did you silly  mrs crowley  oh i wish i had known that before id have refused you again  dick  you absurd creature              he kisses her  mrs crowley  trying to release herself theres somebody coming  dick  its only alec              alec comes in  alec  hulloa  dick  alec weve made friends mrs crowley and i  alec  it certainly looks very much like it  dick  the fact is ive asked her to marry me and she  mrs crowley  interrupting with a smile after much pressure  dick  has consented  alec  im so glad i heartily congratulate you both i was rather unhappy at leaving dick mrs crowley but now i leave him in your hands im perfectly content hes the dearest kindest old chap ive ever known  dick  shut up alec dont play the heavy father or we shall burst into tears  alec  hell be an admirable husband because hes an admirable friend  mrs crowley  i know he will and im only prevented from saying all i think of him and how much i love him by the fear that hell become perfectly unmanageable  dick  spare me these chaste blushes which mantle my youthful brow will you pour out the tea  nellie  mrs crowley  yes  dick              she sits down at the teatable and dick makes             himself comfortable in an armchair by             her side  alec  well im thankful to say that everythings packed and ready  mrs crowley  i wish youd stay for our wedding  dick  do you can go just as well by the next boat  alec  im afraid that everything is settled now ive given instructions at zanzibar to collect bearers and i must arrive as quickly as i can  dick  i wish to goodness youd give up these horrible explorations  alec  but theyre the very breath of my life you dont know the exhilaration of the daily dangersthe joy of treading where only the wild beasts have trodden before oh already i can hardly bear my impatience when i think of the boundless country and the enchanting freedom here one grows so small so despicable but in africa everything is built to a nobler standard there a man is really a man there one knows what are will and strength and courage oh you dont know what it is to stand on the edge of some great plain and breathe the pure keen air after the terrors of the forest then at last you know what freedom is  dick  the boundless plain of hyde park is enough for me and the aspect of piccadilly on a fine day in june gives me quite as many emotions as i want  mrs crowley  but what will you gain by it all now that your work in east africa is over by all the dangers and the hardships  alec  nothing i want to gain nothing perhaps i shall discover some new species of antelope or some unknown plant perhaps i shall find some new waterway that is all the reward i want i love the sense of power and mastery what do you think i care for the tinsel rewards of kings and peoples  dick  i always said you were melodramatic i never heard anything so transpontine  mrs crowley  and the end of it what will be the end  alec  the end is death in some feverstricken swamp obscurely worn out by exposure and ague and starvation and the bearers will seize my gun and my clothes and leave me to the jackals  mrs crowley  dont its too horrible  alec  why what does it matter i shall die standing up i shall go the last journey as i have gone every other  mrs crowley  without fear  dick  for all the world like the wicked baronet once aboard the lugger and the girl is mine  mrs crowley  dont you want men to remember you  alec  perhaps they will perhaps in a hundred years or so in some flourishing town where i discovered nothing but wilderness they will commission a secondrate sculptor to make a fancy statue of me and i shall stand in front of the stock exchange a convenient perch for birds to look eternally upon the various shabby deeds of human kind              during this speech mrs crowley makes a sign             to dick who walks slowly away and goes             out  mrs crowley  and is that really everything i cant help thinking that at the bottom of your heart is something that youve never told to a living soul              he gives her a long look and then after a             moments thought breaks into a little smile  alec  why do you want to know so much  mrs crowley  tell me  alec  i daresay i shall never see you again perhaps it doesnt much matter what i say to you youll think me very silly but im afraid im ratherpatriotic its only we who live away from england who really love it im so proud of my country and i wanted so much to do something for it often in africa ive thought of this dear england and longed not to die till i had done my work behind all the soldiers and the statesmen whose fame is imperishable there is a long line of men whove built up the empire piece by piece their names are forgotten and only students know their history but each one of them gave a province to his country and i too have my place among them for five years i toiled night and day and at the end of it was able to hand over to the commissioners a broad tract of land rich and fertile after my death england will forget my faults and my mistakes i care nothing for the flouts and gibes with which she has repaid all my pain for i have added another fair jewel to her crown i dont want rewards i only want the honour of serving this dear land of ours  mrs crowley  why is it when youre so nice really that you do all you can to make people think you utterly horrid  alec  dont laugh at me because youve found out that at heart im nothing more than a sentimental old woman  mrs crowley  putting her hand on his arm what would you do if lucy came here today              alec starts looks at her sharply then answers             with deliberation  alec  i have always lived in polite society i should never dream of outraging its conventions if miss allerton happened to come you may be sure i should be scrupulously polite  mrs crowley  is that all lucy has suffered very much  alec  and do you suppose ive not suffered because i dont whine my misery to all and sundry dyou think i dont care im not the man to fall in and out of love with every pretty face i meet all my life ive kept an ideal before my eyes oh you dont know what it meant to me to fall in love i felt that i had lived all my life in a prison and at last lucy came and took me by the hand and led me out and for the first time i breathed the free air of heaven oh god how ive suffered for it why should it have come to me oh if you knew my agony and the torture              he hides his face trying to master his emotion             mrs crowley goes to him and puts her             hand on his shoulder  mrs crowley  mr mackenzie  alec  springing up go away dont look at me how can you stand there and watch my weakness oh god give me strength my love was the last human weakness i had it was right that i should drink that bitter cup and ive drunk its very dregs i should have known that i wasnt meant for happiness and a life of ease i have other work to do in the world and now that i have overcome this last temptation i am ready to do it  mrs crowley  but havent you any pity for yourself havent you any thought for lucy  alec  must i tell you too that everything i did was for lucys sake and still i love her with all my heart and soul  dick comes in  dick  here is lucy              charles comes in and announces lucy  charles  miss allerton              she enters and dick anxious that the meeting             shall not be more awkward than need be             goes up to her very cordially  dick  ah my dear lucy so glad you were able to come  lucy  giving her hand to dick but looking at alec how dyou do  alec  how dyou do he forces himself to talk how is lady kelsey  lucy  shes much better thanks weve been to spa you know for her health  alec  somebody told me youd gone abroad was it you dick dick is an admirable person a sort of gazetteer for polite society  dick  wont you have some tea lucy  lucy  no thanks  mrs crowley  trying on her side also to make conversation we shall miss you dreadfully when youre gone mr mackenzie  dick  cheerfully not a bit of it  alec  smiling london is an excellent place for showing one of how little importance one is in the world one makes a certain figure and perhaps is tempted to think oneself of some consequence then one goes away and on returning is surprised to discover that nobody has even noticed ones absence  dick  youre overmodest alec if you werent you might be a great man now i make a point of telling my friends that im indispensable and they take me at my word  alec  you are a leaven of flippancy in the heavy dough of british righteousness  dick  the wise man only takes the unimportant quite seriously  alec  with a smile for it is obvious that it needs more brains to do nothing than to be a cabinet minister  dick  you pay me a great compliment alec you repeat to my very face one of my favourite observations  lucy  almost in a whisper havent i heard you say that only the impossible is worth doing  alec  good heavens i must have been reading the headings of a copybook  mrs crowley  to dick are you going to southampton to see mr mackenzie off  dick  i shall hide my face on his shoulder and weep salt tears itll be most affecting because in moments of emotion i always burst into epigram  alec  i loathe all solemn leavetakings i prefer to part from people with a nod and a smile whether im going for ever or for a day to brighton  mrs crowley  youre very hard  alec  dick has been teaching me to take life flippantly and i have learnt that things are only serious if you take them seriously and that is desperately stupid to lucy dont you agree with me  lucy  no              her tone almost tragic makes him pause             for an instant but he is determined             that the conversation shall be purely conventional  alec  its so difficult to be serious without being absurd that is the chief power of women that life and death are merely occasions for a change of costume marriage a creation in white and the worship of god an opportunity for a paris bonnet              mrs crowley makes up her mind to force a             crisis and she gets up  mrs crowley  its growing late dick wont you take me round the house  alec  im afraid my luggage has made everything very disorderly  mrs crowley  it doesnt matter come dick  dick  to lucy you dont mind if we leave you  lucy  oh no              mrs crowley and dick go out there is a             moments silence  alec  do you know that our friend dick has offered his hand and heart to mrs crowley this afternoon  lucy  i hope theyll be very happy theyre very much in love with one another  alec  bitterly and is that a reason for marrying surely love is the worst possible foundation for marriage love creates illusions and marriages destroy them true lovers should never marry  lucy  will you open the window it seems stifling here  alec  certainly from the window you cant think what a joy it is to look upon london for the last time im so thankful to get away              lucy gives a little sob and alec turns to the             window he wants to wound her and yet             cannot bear to see her suffer  alec  tomorrow at this time i shall be well started oh i long for that infinite surface of the clean and comfortable sea  lucy  are you very glad to go  alec  turning to her i feel quite boyish at the very thought  lucy  and is there no one you regret to leave  alec  you see dick is going to marry when a man does that his bachelor friends are wise to depart gracefully before he shows them that he needs their company no longer i have no relations and few friends i cant flatter myself that any one will be much distressed at my departure  lucy  in a low voice you must have no heart at all  alec  icily if i had i certainly should not bring it to portman square that sentimental organ would be surely out of place in such a neighbourhood  lucy  gets up and goes to him oh why do you treat me as if we were strangers how can you be so cruel  alec  gravely dont you think that flippancy is the best refuge from an uncomfortable position we should really be much wiser merely to discuss the weather  lucy  insisting are you angry because i came  alec  that would be ungracious on my part perhaps it wasnt quite necessary that we should meet again  lucy  youve been acting all the time ive been here dyou think i didnt see it was unreal when you talked with such cynical indifference i know you well enough to tell when youre hiding your real self behind a mask  alec  if im doing that the inference is obvious that i wish my real self to be hidden  lucy  i would rather you cursed me than treat me with such cold politeness  alec  im afraid youre rather difficult to please              lucy goes up to him passionately but he draws             back so that she may not touch him  lucy  oh youre of iron alec alec i couldnt let you go without seeing you once more even you would be satisfied if you knew what bitter anguish ive suffered even you would pity me i dont want you to think too badly of me  alec  does it much matter what i think we shall be so many thousand miles apart  lucy  i suppose that you utterly despise me  alec  no i loved you far too much ever to do that believe me i only wish you well now that the bitterness is past i see that you did the only possible thing i hope that youll be very happy  lucy  oh alec dont be utterly pitiless dont leave me without a single word of kindness  alec  nothing is changed lucy you sent me away on account of your brothers death              there is a long silence and when she speaks             it is hesitatingly as if the words were             painful to utter  lucy  i hated you then and yet i couldnt crush the love that was in my heart i used to try and drive you away from my thoughts but every word you had ever said came back to me dont you remember you told me that everything you did was for my sake those words hammered at my heart as though it were an anvil i struggled not to believe them i said to myself that you had sacrificed george coldly callously prudently but in my heart i knew it wasnt true he looks at her hardly able to believe what she is going to say but does not speak your whole life stood on one side and only this hateful story on the other you couldnt have grown into a different man in one single instant i came here today to tell you that i dont understand the reason of what you did i dont want to understand i believe in you now with all my strength i know that whatever you did was right and justbecause you did it              he gives a long deep sigh  alec  thank god oh im so grateful to you for that  lucy  havent you anything more to say to me than that  alec  you see it comes too late nothing much matters now for tomorrow i go away  lucy  but youll come back  alec  im going to a part of africa from which europeans seldom return  lucy  with a sudden outburst of passion oh thats too horrible dont go dearest i cant bear it  alec  i must now everything is settled and there can be no drawing back  lucy  dont you care for me any more  alec  care for you i love you with all my heart and soul  lucy  eagerly then take me with you  alec  you  lucy  you dont know what i can do with you to help me i can be brave let me come alec  alec  no its impossible you dont know what you ask  lucy  then let me wait for you let me wait till you come back  alec  and if i never come back  lucy  i will wait for you still  alec  then have no fear i will come back my journey was only dangerous because i wanted to die i want to live now and i shall live  lucy  oh alec alec im so glad you love me

eckermann gespräche mit goethe     general preface   for clisthenes son of aristonymus son of myron son of andreas had a daughter whose name was agarista her he resolved to give in marriage to the man whom he should find the most accomplished of all the greeks when therefore the olympian games were being celebrated clisthenes being victorious in them in the chariot race made a proclamation that whoever of the greeks deemed himself worthy to become the soninlaw of clisthenes should come to sicyon on the sixtieth day or even before since clisthenes had determined on the marriage in a year reckoning from the sixtieth day thereupon such of the greeks as were puffed up with themselves and their country came as suitors and clisthenes having made a racecourse and palæstra for them kept it for this very purpose from italy accordingly came smindyrides son of hippocrates a sybarite who more than any other man reached the highest pitch of luxury and sybaris was at that time in a most flourishing condition and damasus of siris son of amyris called the wise these came from italy from the ionian gulf amphimnestus son of epistrophus an epidamnian he came from the ionian gulf an Ætolian came males brother of that titormus who surpassed the greeks in strength and fled from the society of men to the extremity of the Ætolian territory and from peloponnesus leocedes son of pheidon tyrant of the argives a decendant of that pheidon who introduced measures among the peloponnesians and was the most insolent of all the greeks who having removed the elean umpires himself regulated the games at olympia his son accordingly came and amiantus son of lycurgus an arcadian from trapezus and an azenian from the city of pæos laphanes son of euphorion who as the story is told in arcadia received the dioscuri in his house and after that entertained all men and an elean onomastus son of agæus these accordingly came from the peloponnesus itself from athens there came megacles son of alcmæon the same who had visited croesus and another hippoclides son of tisander who surpassed the athenians in wealth and beauty from eretria which was flourishing at that time came lysanias he was the only one from euboea and from thessaly there came of the scopades diactorides a cranonian and from the molossi alcon so many were the suitors when they had arrived on the appointed day clisthenes made inquiries of their country and the family of each then detaining them for a year he made trial of their manly qualities their dispositions learning and morals holding familiar intercourse with each separately and with all together and leading out to the gymnasia such of them as were younger but most of all he made trial of them at the banquet for as long as he detained them he did this throughout and at the same time entertained them magnificently and somehow of all the suitors those that had come from athens pleased him most and of these hippoclides son of tisander was preferred both on account of his manly qualities and because he was distantly related to the cypselidæ in corinth when the day appointed for the consummation of the marriage arrived and for the declaration of clisthenes himself whom he would choose of them all clisthenes having sacrificed a hundred oxen entertained both the suitors themselves and all the sicyonians and when they had concluded the feast the suitors had a contest about music and any subject proposed for conversation as the drinking went on hippoclides who much attracted the attention of the rest ordered the fluteplayer to play a dance and when the fluteplayer obeyed he began to dance and he danced probably so as to please himself but clisthenes seeing it beheld the whole matter with suspicion afterwards hippoclides having rested awhile ordered some one to bring in a table and when the table came in he first danced laconian figures on it and then attic ones and in the third place having leant his head on the table he gesticulated with his legs but clisthenes when he danced the first and second time revolted from the thought of having hippoclides for his soninlaw on account of his dancing and want of decorum yet restrained himself not wishing to burst out against him but when he saw him gesticulating with his legs he was no longer able to restrain himself and said son of tisander you have danced away your marriage but hippoclides answered hippoclides cares not hence this answer became a proverb herodotus vi 126 carys translation  this play was first performed by the stage society at

fra angelico and      botticelli the furniture is simple and inexpensive but there is      nothing ugly in the room it is the dwellingplace of a person who      reads a great deal and takes pleasure

      griggs opening the door ushers in the             newcomers  mrs griggs  if you please sir              she goes out again and during the next few             speeches brings two more cups and the tea              mabel and hilda enter followed by john             halliwell basil going towards them             very cordially half stops when he notices             who they are and a slight expression of             embarrassment passes over his face but             he immediately recovers himself and is             extremely gracious hilda murray is a             tall handsome woman selfpossessed and             admirably gowned mabel halliwell is             smaller pretty rather than beautiful             younger than her sister vivacious very             talkative and somewhat irresponsible             john is of the same age as basil goodhumoured             neither handsome nor plain             blunt of speech and open  basil  shaking hands how dyou do  mabel  look pleased to see us mr kent  basil  im perfectly enchanted  hilda  you did ask us to come and have tea with you didnt you  basil  ive asked you fifty times hulloa john i didnt see you  john  im the discreet husband i keep in the background  mabel  why dont you praise me instead of praising yourself people would think it so much nicer  john  on the contrary theyd be convinced that when we were alone i beat you besides i couldnt honestly say that you kept in the background  hilda  to basil i feel rather ashamed at taking you unawares  basil  i was only slacking i was cutting a book  mabel  thats ever so much more fun than reading it isnt it she catches sight of the tea things oh what a beautiful cakeand two cups she looks at him questioning  basil  a little awkwardly ohi always have an extra cup in case some one turns up you know  mabel  how unselfish and do you always have such expensive cake  hilda  with a smile remonstrating mabel  mabel  oh but i know them well and i love them dearly they cost two shillings at the army and navy stores but i cant afford them myself  john  i wish youd explain why weve come or basil will think im responsible  mabel  lightly ive been trying to remember ever since we arrived you say it hilda you invented it  hilda  with a laugh mabel ill never take you out again theyre perfectly incorrigible mr kent  basil  to john and mabel smiling i dont know why youve come mrs murry has promised to come and have tea with me for ages  mabel  pretending to feel injured well you neednt turn me out the moment we arrive besides i refuse to go till ive had a piece of that cake  basil  well heres the tea mrs griggs brings it in as he speaks he turns to hilda i wish youd pour it out im so clumsy  hilda  smiling at him affectionately i shall be delighted              she proceeds to do so and the conversation goes             on while basil hands mabel tea and cake  john  i told them it was improper for more than one woman at a time to call at a bachelors rooms basil  basil  if youd warned me id have made the show a bit tidier  mabel  oh thats just what we didnt want we wanted to see the celebrity at home without limelight  basil  ironically youre too flattering  mabel  by the way how is the book  basil  quite well thanks  mabel  i always forget to ask how its getting on  basil  on the contrary you never let slip an opportunity of making kind inquiries  mabel  i dont believe youve written a word of it  hilda  nonsense mabel ive read it  mabel  oh but youre such a monster of discretion now i want to see your medals mr kent  basil  smiling what medals  mabel  dont be coy you know i mean the medals they gave you for going to the cape  basil  gets them from a drawer and with a smile hands them to mabel if you really care to see them here they are  mabel  taking one whats this  basil  oh thats just the common or garden south african medal  mabel  and the other one  basil  thats the dsm  mabel  why didnt they give you the dso  basil  oh i was only a trooper you know they only give the dso to officers  mabel  and what did you do to deserve it  basil  smiling i really forget  hilda  its given for distinguished service in the field mabel  mabel  i knew only i wanted to see if mr kent was modest or vain  basil  with a smile taking the medals from her and putting them away how spiteful of you  mabel  john why didnt you go to the cape and do heroic things  john  i confined my heroism to the british isles i married you my angel  mabel  is that funny or vulgar  basil  laughing are there no more questions you want to ask me mrs halliwell  mabel  yes i want to know why you live up six flights of stairs  basil  amused for the view simply and solely  mabel  but good heavens there is no view there are only chimneypots  basil  but theyre most æsthetic chimneypots do come and look mrs murray basil and hilda approach one of the windows and he opens it and at night theyre so mysterious they look just like strange goblins playing on the housetops and you cant think how gorgeous the sunsets are sometimes after the rain the slate roofs glitter like burnished gold to hilda often i think i couldnt have lived without my view it says such wonderful things to me turning to mabel gaily scoff mrs halliwell im on the verge of being sentimental  mabel  i was wondering if youd made that up on the spur of the moment or if youd fished it out of an old notebook  hilda  with a look at basil may i go out  basil  yes do come              hilda and basil step out on the balcony             whereupon john goes to mabel and tries             to steal a kiss from her  mabel  springing up go away you horror  john  dont be silly i shall kiss you if i want to  she laughing walks round the sofa while he pursues her  mabel  i wish youd treat life more seriously  john  i wish you wouldnt wear such prominent hats  mabel  as he puts his arm round her waist john some bodyll see us  john  mabel i command you to let yourself be kissed  mabel  how much will you give me  john  sixpence  mabel  slipping away from him i cant do it for less than halfacrown  john  laughing ill give you two shillings  mabel  coaxing make it twoandthree              he kisses her  john  now come and sit down quietly  mabel  sitting down by his side john you mustnt make love to me it would look so odd if they came in  john  after all i am your husband  mabel  thats just it if you wanted to make love to me you ought to have married somebody else he puts his arm round her waist john dont im sure theyll come in  john  i dont care if they do  mabel  sighing john you do love me  john  yes  mabel  and you wont ever care for anybody else  john  no  mabel  in the same tone and you will give me that twoandthreepence wont you  john  mabel it was only two shillings  mabel  oh you cheat  john  getting up im going out on the balcony im passionately devoted to chimneypots  mabel  no john i want you  john  why  mabel  isnt it enough for me to say i want you for you to hurl yourself at my feet immediately  john  oh you poor thing cant you do without me for two minutes  mabel  now youre taking a mean advantage its only this particular two minutes that i want you come and sit by me like a nice dear boy  john  now what have you been doing that you shouldnt  mabel  laughing nothing but i want you to do something for me  john  ha ha i thought so  mabel  its merely to tie up my shoe she puts out her foot  john  is that allhonour bright  mabel  laughing yes john kneels down  john  but my good girl its not undone  mabel  then my good boy undo it and do it up again  john  starting up mabel are we playing gooseberryat our time of life  mabel  ironically oh you are clever do you think hilda would have climbed six flights of stairs unless love had lent her wings  john  i wish love would provide wings for the chaperons as well  mabel  dont be flippant its a serious matter  john  my dear girl you really cant expect me to play the heavy father when weve only been married six months it would be almost improper  mabel  dont be horrid john  john  it isnt horrid its natural history  mabel  primly i was never taught it its not thought nice for young girls to know  john  why didnt you tell me that hilda was fond of basil does he like her  mabel  i dont know i expect thats precisely what shes asking him  john  mabel do you mean to say you brought me here an inoffensive harmless creature for your sister to propose to a pal of mine its an outrage  mabel  shes doing nothing of the sort  john  you neednt look indignant you cant deny that you proposed to me  mabel  i can indeed if i had i should never have taken such an unconscionably long time about it  john  i wonder why hilda wants to marry poor basil  mabel  well captain murray left her five thousand a year and she thinks basil kent a genius  john  theres not a drawingroom in regents park or in bayswater that hasnt got its tame genius i dont know if basil kent is much more than very clever  mabel  anyhow im sure its a mistake to marry geniuses theyre horribly badtempered and they invariably make love to other peoples wives  john  hilda always has gone in for literary people thats the worst of marrying a cavalryman it leads you to attach so much importance to brains  mabel  yes but she neednt marry them if she wants to encourage basil let her do it from a discreet distance genius always thrives best on bread and water and platonic attachments if hilda marries him hell only become fat and ugly and baldheaded and stupid  john  why then hell make an ideal member of parliament              basil and hilda come into the room again  mabel  maliciously well what have you been talking about  hilda  acidly the weather and the crops shakespeare and the musical glasses  mabel  raising her eyebrows oh  hilda  its getting very late mabel we really must be going  mabel  getting up and ive got to pay at least twelve calls i hope every one will be out  hilda  people are so stupid theyre always in when you call  mabel  holding out her hand to basil goodbye  hilda  coldly thanks so much mr kent im afraid we disturbed you awfully  basil  shaking hands with her ive been enchanted to see you goodbye  mabel  lightly we shall see you again before you go to italy shant we  basil  oh im not going to italy now ive changed all my plans  mabel  giving john a look oh well goodbye arent you coming john  john  no i think ill stay and have a little chat with basil while you tread the path of duty  mabel  well mind youre in early weve got a lot of disgusting people coming to dinner  hilda  with a smile poor things who are they  mabel  i forget who they are but i know theyre loathsome thats why i asked them              basil opens the door and the two women go out  john  sitting down and stretching himself now that weve got rid of our womankind lets make ourselves comfortable taking a pipe out of his pocket i think ill sample your baccy if youll pass it along  basil  handing him the jar im rather glad you stayed john i wanted to talk to you  john  ha ha              basil pauses a moment while john looks at             him with amusement he fills his pipe  john  lighting his pipe nice gal hildaaint she  basil  enthusiastically oh i think shes perfectly charming but what makes you say that  john  innocently oh i dont know passed through my head  basil  i say ive got something to tell you john  john  well dont be so beastly solemn about it  basil  smiling its a solemn thing  john  no it aint ive done it myself its like a high dive when you look down at the water it fairly takes your breath away but after youve done itits not so bad as you think youre going to be married my boy  basil  with a smile how the deuce dyou know  john  gaily saw it with mine own eyes i congratulate you and i give you my blessing ill get a new frockcoat to give the lady away in  basil  you suddenly understanding youre on the wrong tack old man its not your sisterinlaw im going to marry  john  then why the dickens did you say it was  basil  i never mentioned her name  john  hm ive made rather more than an average ass of myself havent i  basil  what on earth made you think   john  interrupting oh it was only some stupid idea of my wifes women are such fools you know and they think theyre so confoundedly sharp  basil  disconcertedlooking at him has mrs murray   john  no of course not well who the deuce are you going to marry  basil  flushing im going to marry miss jenny bush  john  never heard of her is it any one i know  basil  yes you knew her  john  searching his memory bush  bush with a smile the only jenny bush ive ever heard of was a rather pretty little barmaid in fleet street presumably youre not going to marry her  john has said this quite lightly not guessing for a moment that it can have anything to do with the person basil proposes to marry then since basil makes no answer john looks at him sharply there is a silence while the two men stare at one another  john  basil its not the woman we used to know before you went out to the cape  basil  pale and nervous but determined ive just told you that you used to know jenny  john  man alive youre not going to marry the barmaid of the golden crown  basil  looking at him steadily jenny was a barmaid at the golden crown  john  but good lord basil what dyou mean youre not serious  basil  perfectly were going to be married this day week  john  are you stark staring mad why on earth dyou want to marry jenny bush  basil  thats rather a delicate question isnt it with a smile presumably because im in love with her  john  well thats a silly ass of an answer  basil  its quite the most obvious  john  nonsense why ive been in love with twenty girls and i havent married them all one cant do that sort of thing in a country where they give you seven years for bigamy every publichouse along the thames from barnes to taplow is the tombstone of an unrequited passion of my youth i loved em dearly but i never asked em to marry me  basil  tightening his lips id rather you didnt make jokes about it john  john  are you sure youre not making an ass of yourself if youve got into a mess surely we can get you out marriage like hanging is rather a desperate remedy  basil is sitting down and moodily shrugs his shoulders john goes up to him and putting his hands on his friends shoulders looks into his eyes  john  why are you going to marry her basil  basil  springing up impatiently damn you why dont you mind your own business  john  dont be a fool basil  basil  cant i marry any one i choose its nothing to you is it dyou suppose i care if shes a barmaid  he walks up and down excitedly while john with steady eyes watches him  john  basil old man weve known each other a good many years now dont you think youd better trust me  basil  setting his teeth what dyou want to know  john  why are you going to marry her  basil  abruptly fiercely because i must  john  nodding his head quietly i see  there is a silence then basil more calmly turns to john  basil  dyou remember jenny  john  yes rather why we always lunched there in the old days  basil  well after i came back from the cape i began going there again when i was out there she took it into her head to write me a letter rather illspelt and funnybut i was touched that she thought of me and she sent some tobacco and some cigarettes  john  my maiden aunt sent you a woollen comforter but im not aware that in return you ever made her a proposal of marriage  basil  and so in one way and another i came to know jenny rather well she appeared to get rather fond of meand i couldnt help seeing it  john  but she always pretended to be engaged to that scrubby little chap with false teeth who used to hang about the bar and make sheeps eyes at her over innumerable scotchandsodas  basil  he made a scene because i took her out on one of her offnights and she broke it off i couldnt help knowing it was on my account  john  well and after that  basil  after that i got into the habit of taking her to the play and so on and finally   john  how long has this been going on  basil  several months  john  and then  basil  well the other day she wired for me i found her in the most awful state she was simply crying her eyes out poor thing shed been seedy and gone to the doctors and he told her   john  what you might really have foreseen  basil  yes she was quite hysterical she said she didnt know what to do nor where to go and she was in an awful funk about her people she said shed kill herself  john  drily naturally she was very much upset  basil  i felt the only thing i could do was to ask her to marry me and when i saw the joy that came into her poor tearstained face i knew id done the right thing  there is a pause john walks up and down then stops suddenly and turns to basil  john  have you thought that you whove never needed to economise will have to look at every shilling you spend youve always been careless with your money and what youve had youve flung about freely  basil  shrugging his shoulders if i have to submit to nothing worse than going without a lot of useless luxuries i really dont think i need complain  john  but you cant afford to keep a wife and an increasing family  basil  i suppose i can make money as well as other men  john  by writing books  basil  i shall set to work to earn my living at the bar up till now ive never troubled myself  john  i dont know any man less fit than you for the dreary waiting and the drudgery of the bar  basil  we shall see  john  and what dyou think your friends will say to your marryinga barmaid  basil  contemptuously i dont care two straws for my friends  john  thats pleasant for them you know men and women without end have snapped their fingers at society and laughed at it and for a while thought they had the better of it but all the time society was quietly smiling up its sleeve and suddenly it put out an iron handand scrunched them up  basil  shrugging his shoulders it only means that a few snobs will cut me  john  not youyour wife  basil  im not such a cad as to go to a house where i cant take my wife  john  but youre the last man in the world to give up these things theres nothing you enjoy more than going to dinnerparties and staying in country houses womens smiles are the very breath of your nostrils  basil  you talk of me as if i were a tame cat i dont want to brag john but after all ive shown that im fit for something in this world i went to the cape because i thought it was my duty i intend to marry jenny for the same reason  john  seriously will you answer me one questionon your honour  basil  yes  john  are you in love with her  basil  after a pause no  john  passionately then by god you have no right to marry her a man has no right to marry a woman for pity its a cruel thing to do you can only end by making yourself and her entirely wretched  basil  i cant break the poor girls heart  john  you dont know what marriage is even with two people who are devoted to one another who have the same interests and belong to the same class its sometimes almost unbearable marriage is the most terrible thing in the world unless passion makes it absolutely inevitable  basil  my marriage is absolutely inevitablefor another reason  john  you talk as if such things had never happened before  basil  oh i know they happen every day its no business of the mans and as for the girl let her throw herself in the river let her go to the deuce and be hanged to her  john  nonsense she can be provided for it only needs a little discretionand no one will be a haporth the wiser nor she a haporth the worse  basil  but its not a matter of people knowing its a matter of honour  john  opening his eyes and where precisely did the honour come in when you   basil  good heavens im a man like any other i have passions as other men have  john  gravely my dear basil i wouldnt venture to judge you but i think its rather late in the day to set up for a moralist  basil  dyou think ive not regretted what i did its easy enough afterwards to say that i should have resisted the world would be a sunday school if we were all as levelheaded at night as we are next morning  john  shaking his head after all its only a very regrettable incident due to your youth andwant of innocence  basil  with vehement seriousness i may have acted like a cur i dont know i acted as i suppose every other man would but now i have a plain duty before me and by god i mean to do it  john  dont you realise that youve only one life and that mistakes are irreparable people play with life as if it were a game of chess in which they can try this move and that and when they get into a muddle sweep the board clear and begin again  basil  but life is a game of chess in which one is always beaten death sits on the other side of the board and for every move he has a countermove and for all your deeplaid schemes he has a parry  john  but if at the end death always mates you the fight is surely worth the fighting dont handicap yourself at the beginning by foolish quixotry life is so full it has so much to offer and youre throwing away almost everything that makes it worth the trouble  basil  gravely jenny would kill herself if i didnt marry her  john  you dont seriously think shed do that people dont commit suicide so easily you know  basil  youve thought of a great deal johnyouve not thought of the child i cant let the child skulk into the world like a thief let him come in openly and lawfully and let him go through the world with an honest name good heavens the worlds bad enough without fettering him all his life with a hideous stigma  john  oh my dear basil   basil  interrupting you can bring forward a thousand objections but nothing alters the fact that under the circumstances theres only one way open to a man of honour  john  drily well its a way that may do credit to your heart but scarcely to your understanding  basil  i thought youd see at once that i was doing the only possible thing  john  my dear basil you talk of pity and you talk of duty but are you sure theres anything more in it than vanity youve set yourself up on a sort of moral pinnacle are you sure you dont admire your own heroism a little too much  basil  with a goodnatured smile does it look so petty as that in your eyes after all its only common morality  john  impatiently but my dear chap its absurd to act according to an unrealisable ideal in a world thats satisfied with the secondrate youre tendering banknotes to african savages among whom cowrie shells are common coin  basil  smiling i dont know what you mean  john  society has made its own decalogue a code thats just fit for middling people who are not very good and not very wicked but society punishes you equally if your actions are higher than its ideal or lower  basil  sometimes it makes a god of you when youre dead  john  but it takes precious good care to crucify you when youre alive  there is a knock at the door and mrs griggs comes in  mrs griggs  some more visitors sir  basil  show em in to john its jenny she said she was coming to tea  john  with a smile oh the cake was for her was it would you like me to go  basil  not unless you choose do you suppose im ashamed  john  i thought after all youve told me you might not care for me to see her  jenny bush and her brother james come in she is very pretty with delicate features and a beautiful complexion her fair hair is abundant and very elaborately arranged she is dressed smartly rather showily it is the usual type of barmaid or teagirl a shade more refined perhaps than the common run her manners are unobjectionable but not those of a gentlewoman james is a young man with cleanshaven face and a sharp expression he is overdressed in a very horsey manner and is distinctly more vulgar than his sister he talks english with a cockney accent not invariably dropping his aitches but only now and then he is over cordial and over genial  jenny  going up to basil im awfully late i couldnt come before  james  jocosely dont mind me give

between acts i and ii        the drawingroom in basils house at putney in the wall facing      the auditorium there is a door leading from the passage on the      right two doors lead into bedrooms and opposite these is a bay      window the same pictures and plates decorate the walls as in the      preceding scene the writingtable is between the side doors      jennys influence is noticeable in the cushions in the wickerwork      armchairs in the window curtains and portières of art serge and      in the huge chrysanthemums of the wall paper               jenny is sewing while james bush is lounging             in one of the arm chairs  james  wheres his lordship this afternoon  jenny  hes gone out for a walk  james  with a malevolent laugh thats what he tells you my dear  jenny  looking

sneer well it was a wonderful fine thing you did when you married him jenny and you thought you done precious well for yourself too  jenny  jimmie dont  james  i cant stick im at any price and i dont

basil comes in notices james but does not             speak  james  afternoon basil  basil  indifferently you here again  james  looks like it dont it  basil  quietly im afraid it does  james  becoming more aggressive as the conversation proceeds are you i suppose i can come and see my own sister  basil  i suppose its inevitable  james  well  basil  smiling only i should be excessively grateful if youd time your coming with mywith my going and vice versa  james  that means you want me to get out i reckon  basil  you show unusual perspicacity dear james  james  and who are you with your long words i should like to know  basil  blandly i a person of not the least importance  james  angrily well i wouldnt put on so much side if i was you  basil  i observe that you have not acquired the useful art of being uncivil without being impertinent  james  look ere im not going to stand this im as good as you are any day  basil  that is a fact i should never dream of contradicting  james  indignantly then what ave you got to turn up your nose about eh what dyou mean by sneerin and snarlin at me when i come here  jenny  nervously jimmie dont  basil  with a smile youre very eloquent james you should join a debating society  james  yes go on thats right you seem to think im nobody i should just like to know why you go on as if i was i dont know what  basil  abruptly because i choose  james  you can bet anything you like i dont come ere to see you  basil  smiling acidly then i have at least something to be thankful for  james  ive got a right to come here as much as anybody i come to see my sister  basil  really thats very thoughtful of you i was under the impression you generally came to borrow money  james  throw that in my face now i cant elp it if im out of work  basil  oh i havent the least objection to your being out of work all i protest againstand that very mildlyis that i should be expected to keep you how much did you want today  james  i dont want your dirty money  basil  with a laugh have you already tried to borrow it from jenny  james  no i avent  basil  and she refused i suppose  james  storming i tell you i dont want your dirty money  basil  well then were both quite satisfied you seemed to think that because i married jenny i was bound to keep the whole gang of you for the rest of your lives im sorry i cant afford it and you will kindly tell the rest of them that im sick and tired of forking out  james  i wonder you dont forbid me your house while youre about it  basil  coolly you may come here when im not at homeif you behave yourself  james  im not good enough for you i suppose  basil  no youre not  james  angrily ah youre a pretty specimen you are you mean skinflint  basil  dont be abusive james its rude  james  i shall say what i choose  basil  and please dont talk so loud it annoys me  james  malevolently i dare say youd like to get me out of the way but i mean to keep my eye on you  basil  sharply what dyou mean by that  james  you know what i mean jenny has something to put up with i lay  basil  containing his anger youll have the goodness to leave the relations between jenny and myself alonedyou hear  james  ha thats touched you up has it you think i dont know what sort of a feller you are i can just about see through two of you and i know a good deal more about you than you think  basil  contemptuously dont be foolish james  james  sarcastic a nice thing jenny did when she married you  basil  recovering himself with a smile has she been telling you my numerous faults to jenny you must have had plenty to talk about my love  jenny  who has been going on with her sewing looking up now and then uneasily i havent said a word against you basil  basil  turning his back on james oh my dear jenny if it amuses you by all means discuss me with your brother and your sister and your father and your mother and the whole crew of them i should be so dull if i had no faults  jenny  anxiously tell him ive not said anything against him jimmie  james  its not for want of something to say i lay  basil  over his shoulder im getting rather tired brother james id go if i were you  james  very aggressively i shant go till i choose  basil  turns round smiling blandly of course were both christians dear james and theres a good deal of civilisation kicking about the world nowadays but notwithstanding the last word is still with the strongest  james  what dyou mean by that  basil  goodhumouredly merely that discretion is the better part of valour they say that proverbs are the wealth of nations  james  indignantly thats just the sort of thing youd doto it a feller smaller than yourself  basil  oh i wouldnt hit you for worlds brother james i should merely throw you downstairs  james  making for the door i should just like to see you try it on  basil  dont be silly james you know you wouldnt like it at all  james  im not afraid of you  basil  of course not but stillyoure not very muscular are you  james  you coward  basil  smiling your repartees are not brilliant james  james  standing at the door for safetys sake ill pay you out before ive done  basil  raising his eyebrows james i told you to get out five minutes ago  james  im going dyou think i want to stay ere goodbye jenny im not going to stand being insulted by any one he goes out slamming the door              basil smiling quietly goes to his writingtable             and turns over some papers  basil  the only compensation in brother james is that he sometimes causes one a little mild amusement  jenny  you might at least be polite to him basil  basil  i used up all my politeness six months ago  jenny  after all he is my brother  basil  that is a fact i deplore with all my heart i assure you  jenny  i dont know whats wrong with him  basil  dont you it doesnt matter  jenny  i know he isnt a society man  basil  with a laugh no he wouldnt shine at duchesses teaparties  jenny  well hes none the worse for that is he  basil  not at all  jenny  then why dyou treat him as if he was a dog  basil  my dear jenny i dont im very fond of dogs  jenny  oh youre always sneering isnt he as good as i am and you condescended to marry me  basil  coldly i really cant see that because i married you i must necessarily take your whole family to my bosom  jenny  why dont you like them theyre honest and respectable  basil  with a little sigh of boredom my dear jenny we dont choose our friends because theyre honest and respectable any more than we choose them because they change their linen daily  jenny  they cant help it if theyre poor  basil  my dear im willing to acknowledge that they have every grace and every virtue but they rather bore me  jenny  they wouldnt if they were swells              basil gives a short laugh but does not answer             and jenny irritated continues more             angrily  jenny  and after all were not in such a bad position as all that my mothers father was a gentleman  basil  i wish your mothers son were  jenny  dyou know what jimmie says you are  basil  i dont vastly care but if it pleases you very much you may tell me  jenny  flushing angrily he says youre a damned snob  basil  is that all i could have invented far worse things than that to say of myself with a change of tone you know jenny its not worth while to worry ourselves about such trifles one cant force oneself to like people im very sorry that i cant stand your relations why on earth dont you resign yourself and make the best of it  jenny  vindictively you dont think theyre good enough for you to associate with because theyre not in swell positions  basil  my dear jenny i dont in the least object to their being grocers and haberdashers i only wish theyd sell us things at cost price  jenny  jimmie isnt a grocer or a haberdasher hes an auctioneers clerk  basil  ironically i humbly apologise i thought he was a grocer because last time he did us the honour of visiting us he asked how much a pound we paid for our tea and offered to sell us some at the same price but then he also offered to insure our house against fire and to sell me a gold mine in australia  jenny  well its better to make a bit as best one can than to she stops  basil  smiling go on pray dont hesitate for fear of hurting my feelings  jenny  defiantly well then its better to do that than moon about like you do  basil  shrugging his shoulders really even to please you im afraid i cant go about with little samples of tea in my pocket and sell my friends a pound or two when i call on them besides i dont believe theyd ever pay me  jenny  scornfully oh no youre a gentleman and a barrister and an author and you couldnt do anything to dirty those white hands that youre so careful about could you  basil  looking at his hands then up at jenny and what is it precisely you want me to do  jenny  well youve been at the bar for five years i should have thought you could make something after all that time  basil  i cant force the wily solicitor to give me briefs  jenny  how do other fellows manage it  basil  with a laugh the simplest way i believe is to marry the wily solicitors daughter  jenny  instead of a barmaid  basil  gravely i didnt say that jenny  jenny  passionately oh no you didnt say it but you hinted it you never say anything but youre always hinting and insinuatingtill you drive me out of my senses  basil  after a moments pause gravely im very sorry if i hurt your feelings i promise you i dont mean to i always try to be kind to you              he looks at jenny expecting her to say something             in forgiveness or in apology but             she shrugging her shoulders looks down             sullenly at her work without a word and             begins again to sew then basil tightening             his lips picks up writing materials and             goes towards the door  jenny  looking up quickly where are you going  basil  stopping i have some letters to write  jenny  cant you write them here  basil  certainlyif it pleases you  jenny  dont you want me to see who youre writing to  basil  i havent the least objection to your knowing all about my correspondence and thats fortunate since you invariably make yourself acquainted with it  jenny  accuse me of reading your letters now  basil  with a smile you always leave my papers in such disorder after youve been to my desk  jenny  youve got no right to say that              basil pauses and looks at her steadily  basil  are you willing to swear that you dont go to my desk when im away to read my letters come jenny answer that question  jenny  disturbed but forced by his glance to reply well im youre wife i have a right to know  basil  bitterly you have such odd ideas about the duties of a wife jenny they include reading my letters and following me in the street but tolerance and charity and forbearance dont seem to come in your scheme of things  jenny  sullenly why dyou want to write your letters elsewhere  basil  shrugging his shoulders i thought i should be quieter  jenny  i suppose i disturb you  basil  its a little difficult to write when youre talking  jenny  why shouldnt i talk dyou think im not good enough eh i should have thought i was more important than your letters              basil does not answer  jenny  angrily am i your wife or not  basil  ironically you have your marriage lines carefully locked up to prove it  jenny  then why dont you treat me as your wife you seem to think im only fit to see after the house and order the dinner and mend your clothes and after that i can go and sit in the kitchen with the servant  basil  moving again towards the door dyou think its worth while making a scene we seem to have said all this before so many times  jenny  interrupting him i want to have it out  basil  bored weve been having it out twice a week for the last six monthsand weve never got anywhere yet  jenny  im not going to be always put upon im your wife and im as good as you are  basil  with a thin smile oh my dear if youre going in for womens rights you may have my vote by all means and you can plump for all the candidates at once if you choose  jenny  you seem to think its a joke  basil  bitterly oh no i promise you i dont do that its lasted too long and god knows where itll end they say the first year of marriage is the worst ours has been bad enough in all conscience  jenny  aggressively and i suppose you think its my fault  basil  dont you think were both more or less to blame  jenny  with a laugh oh im glad you acknowledge that you have something to do with it  basil  i tried to make you happy  jenny  well you havent succeeded very well did you think i was likely to be happywhen you leave me alone all day and half the night for your swell friends that im not good enough for  basil  thats not true i hardly ever see any of my old friends  jenny  except mrs murray eh  basil  ive seen mrs murray perhaps a dozen times in the last year  jenny  oh you neednt tell me that i know it shes a lady isnt she  basil  ignoring the charge and my work takes me away from you i cant always be down here think how bored youd be  jenny  a precious lot of good your work does you cant earn enough money to keep us out of debt  basil  goodhumouredly we are in debt but we share that very respectable condition with half the nobility and gentry in the kingdom were neither of us good managers and weve lived a bit beyond our means this year but in future well be more economical  jenny  sullenly all the neighbours know that weve got bills with the tradesmen  basil  acidly im sorry that you shouldnt have made so good a bargain as you expected when you married me  jenny  i wonder what you do succeed in your book was very successful wasnt it you thought you were going to set the thames on fire and the book fell flat flat flat  basil  recovering his good temper that is a fate which has befallen better books than mine  jenny  it deserved it  basil  oh i didnt expect you to appreciate it it isnt given to all of us to write about wicked earls and beautiful duchesses  jenny  well i wasnt the only one the papers praised it didnt they  basil  the unanimity of their blame was the only thing that consoled me  jenny  and one of them advised you to study an english grammar and youre the fine gentleman who looks down on poor things like us  basil  i often wonder if the reviewer who abuses you for a printers error realises what pleasure he causes the wife of your bosom  jenny  oh ive learnt to know you so well this last six monthssince the baby died youve got no cause to set yourself up on a pedestal  basil  with a laugh my dear jenny i never pretended to be a golden idol  jenny  i know what you are now and i was such a fool as to think you a hero youre merely a failure in everything you try youre a miserable failure  basil  with a slight sigh perhaps youre right jenny              basil walks up and down and then stopping             looks at her for a moment meditatively  basil  i sometimes wonder whether we shouldnt be happierif we lived apart  jenny  with a start what dyou mean  basil  we dont seem able to get on very well and i see no chance of things going any better  jenny  with staring eyes dyou mean to say you want to separate  basil  i think it might be better for both of usat least for a time perhaps later on we might try again  jenny  and whatll you do  basil  i should go abroad for a while  jenny  with mrs murray is that it you want to go away with her  basil  impatiently no of course not  jenny  i dont believe it youre in love with her  basil  youve got no right to say that  jenny  havent i i suppose i must shut my eyes and say nothing youre in love with her dyou think ive not seen it in these months thats why you want to leave me  basil  its impossible for us to live together we shall never agree and we shall never be happy for gods sake let us separate and have done with it  jenny  youre sick of me youve had all you want out of me and now i can go the fine lady comes along and you send me away like a housemaid dyou think i cant see that youre in love with her youd sacrifice me without a thought to save her a moments unpleasantness and because you love her you hate me  basil  its not true  jenny  can you deny that youre in love with her  basil  youre simply mad good heavens ive done nothing that could give you the least cause to be jealous  jenny  passionately will you swear that youre not in love with her swear it on your honour  basil  youre mad  jenny  with growing excitement swear it you cant youre simply madly in love with her  basil  nonsense  jenny  swear it swear it on your honour swear you dont care for her  basil  shrugging his shoulders i swear it  on my honour  jenny  scornfully its a lie and shes just as much in love with you as you are with her  basil  seizing her wrists what dyou mean  jenny  dyou think i havent got eyes in my head i saw it that day she came here dyou suppose she came to see me she despises me im not a lady she came here to please you she was polite to me to please you she asked me to go and see her to please you  basil  trying to compose himself its absurd she was an old friend of mine of course she came  jenny  i know that sort of friend dyou think i didnt see the way she looked at you and how she followed you with her eyes she simply hung on every word you said when you smiled she smiled when you laughed she laughed oh i should think she was in love with you i know what love is and i felt it and when she looked at me i know she hated me because id robbed her of you  basil  unable to contain himself oh what a dogs life it is we lead weve been both utterly wretched it cant go onand i only see one way out  jenny  thats what youve been brooding over this last week is it separation i knew there was something and i couldnt find out what it was  basil  i do my best to hold myself in but sometimes i feel its impossible i shall be led to saying things that we shall both regret for heavens sake let us part  jenny  no  basil  we cant go on having these awful quarrels its too degrading it was a horrible mistake that we ever married  jenny  horrorstricken basil  basil  oh you must see that as well as i were utterly unsuited to one another and the babys death removed the only necessity that held us together  jenny  you talk as if we only remained together because it was convenient  basil  passionately let me go jenny i cant stand it any more i feel as if i shall go mad  jenny  full of pain and anguish its nothing at all to you  basil  jenny i did my best for you a year ago i gave you all i had to give it was little enough in all conscience now i ask you to give me back my freedom  jenny  distracted you only think of yourself what is to become of me  basil  youll be much happier its the best thing for both of us ill do all i can for you and you can have your mother and sister to live here  jenny  with a cry of grief and passion but i love you basil  basil  you why youve tortured me for six months beyond all endurance youve made all my days a burden to me youve made my life a perfect hell  jenny  gives a long groan of horror and dismay oh              they stand facing one another when the             housemaid fanny comes in  fanny  mr halliwell              john comes in jenny after taking his hand             sinks down on a chair paying no attention             to the following conversation she stares in             front of her quite distraught basil tries             with all his might to appear calm and             natural  basil  hulloa what are you doing in these parts  john  how dyou do mrs kent ive been having an early lunch at richmond and i thought id just drop in on my way back as it was saturday afternoon i thought i might find you  basil  im sure were delighted to see you john gives a sideglance at jenny and slightly raises his eyebrows but youve only just come in time because ive got to go up to town we might travel up together  john  certainly  jenny  where are you going basil  basil  to chancery lane to see my agent on business  jenny  suspiciously on saturday afternoon why he wont be there  basil  i have an appointment with him              jenny does not answer but is obviously unconvinced             john somewhat embarrassed exerts             himself to make conversation  john  i was thinking as i came along that one must lead quite an idyllic existence in the suburbswith the riverand ones little garden  basil  ironically and the spectacle of the fifty little houses opposite all exactly like one another  john  and the quiet is perfectly enchanting  basil  oh yes the only vehicles that disturb the peaceful seclusion are the milkcart and the barrelorgans its quite idyllic  jenny  i think its a very nice neighbourhood and you get such a superior class of people here  basil  ill just go and change looking at his watch theres a train at 415  john  all right hurry up              basil goes out of the room jenny at once             springs to her feet and goes towards john             she is distracted and hardly knows what             she says  jenny  can i trust you  john  what dyou mean              she stares into his eyes doubting trying to see             whether he will be willing to help her  jenny  you used to be a good sort you never looked down on me because i was a barmaid tell me i can trust you john theres no one i can speak to and i feel if i dont speak i shall go off my head  john  what is the matter  jenny  will you tell me the truth if i ask you something  john  of course  jenny  on your oath  john  on my oath  jenny  after a momentary pause is there anything between basil and mrs murray  john  aghast no certainly not  jenny  how dyou know are you sure you wouldnt tell me if there was youre all against me because im not a lady oh im so unhappy              she tries to restrain her tears she is halfhysterical             john stares at her surprised             at a loss for words  jenny  if you only knew what a life we lead he calls it a dogs life and hes right  john  i thought you got on so well  jenny  oh before you weve always kept up appearances hes ashamed to let you know he regrets he ever married me he wants to separate  john  what  jenny  impatiently oh dont look so surprised youre not an utter fool are you he proposed it today before you came in wed been having one of our rows  john  but what on earth is it all about  jenny  god knows  john  its nonsense it can only be a little passing quarrel you must expect to have those  jenny  no it isnt no it isnt he doesnt love me hes in love with your sisterinlaw  john  its impossible  jenny  hes always there he was there twice last week and twice the week before  john  how dyou know  jenny  ive followed him  john  you followed him in the street jenny  jenny  defiantly yes if im not ladylike enough for him i neednt play the lady there youre shocked now i suppose  john  i wouldnt presume to judge you jenny  jenny  and ive read his letters toobecause i wanted to know what he was doing i steamed one open and he saw it and he never said a word  john  good heavens why did you do it  jenny  because i cant live unless i know the truth i thought it was mrs murrays handwriting  john  was it from her  jenny  no it was a receipt from the coal merchant i could see how he despised me when he looked at the envelopei didnt stick it down again very well and i saw him smile when he found it was only a receipt  john  upon my word i dont think youve got much cause to be jealous  jenny  oh you dont know last tuesday he was dining there and you should have seen the state he was in he was so restless he couldnt sit still he looked at his watch every minute his eyes simply glittered with excitement and i could almost hear his heart beating  john  it cant be true  jenny  he never loved me he married me because he thought it was his duty and then when the baby diedhe thought id entrapped him  john  he didnt say so  jenny  no he never says anythingbut i saw it in his eyes passionately clasping her hands oh you dont know what our life is for days he doesnt say a word except to answer my questions and the silence simply drives me mad i shouldnt mind if he blackguarded me id rather he hit me than simply look and look i can see hes keeping himself in hes said more today than hes ever said before i knew it was getting towards the end  john  with a helpless gesture im very sorry  jenny  oh dont you pity me too ive had a great deal too much pity i dont want it basil married me from pity oh i wish he hadnt i cant stand the unhappiness  john  gravely you know jenny hes a man of honour  jenny  oh i know hes a man of honour i wish he had a little less of it one doesnt want a lot of fine sentiments in married life they dont work oh why couldnt i fall in love with a man of my own class i should have been so much happier i used to be so proud that basil wasnt a clerk or something in the city hes right we shall never be happy  john  trying to calm her oh yes you will you mustnt take things too seriously  jenny  it isnt a matter of yesterday or today or tomorrow i cant alter myself he knew i wasnt a lady when he married me my father had to bring up five children on twoten a week you cant expect a man to send his daughters to a boardingschool at brighton on that and have them finished in paris he doesnt say a word when i do something or say something a lady wouldntbut he purses up his lips and looks then i get so mad that i do things just to aggravate him sometimes i try to be vulgar one learns a good deal in a bar in the city and i know so well the things to say thatll make basil curl up i want to get a bit of revenge out of him sometimes and i know exactly where hes raw and where i can hurt him with a laugh of scorn you should see the way he looks when i dont eat properly or when i call a man a johnny  john  drily it opens up endless possibilities of domestic unhappiness  jenny  oh i know it isnt fair to him but i lose my head i cant always be refined sometimes i cant help breaking out i feel i must let myself go  john  why dont you separate then  jenny  because i love him oh john you dont know how i love him id do anything to make him happy id give my life if he wanted it oh i cant say it but when i think of him my heart burns so that sometimes i can hardly breathe i can never show him that hes all in the world to me i try to make him love me and i only make him hate me what can i do to show him ah if he only knew im sure hed not regret that he married me i feeli feel as if my heart was full of music and yet something prevents me from ever bringing it out  john  dyou think he means it seriously when he talks of separation  jenny  hes been brooding over it i know him so well i knew there was something he was thinking over oh john i couldnt live without him id rather die if he leaves me i swear ill kill myself  john  walking up and down i wish i could help you i dont see anything i can do  jenny  oh yes there is speak to your sisterinlaw ask her to have mercy on me perhaps she doesnt know what shes doing tell her i love him take care theres basil if he knew what id said hed never speak to me again              basil comes in dressed in a frockcoat with a             tall hat in his hand  basil  im ready weve just got time to catch the train  john  all right goodbye mrs kent  jenny  keeping her eyes fixed on basil goodbye              the two men go out jenny runs to the door             and calls out  jenny  basil i want you a moment basil              basil appears at the door  jenny  are you really going to chancery lane              basil makes a movement of impatience and             goes out again without answering  jenny  alone oh well im going to see that for myself calling to the maid fanny bring my hat and my jacket quick              she runs to the window and looks out at basil             and john going away fanny appears             with the clothes jenny hurriedly puts             them on  jenny  as fanny is helping her what time is it  fanny  looking up at the clock five minutes past four  jenny  i think i can catch it he said 415  fanny  will you be in to tea mum  jenny  i dont know she runs to the door and rushes out   end of the second act     the third act  the same afternoon        a luxuriously furnished drawingroom at mrs murrays house in      charles street mayfair everything in it is beautiful but      suggests in the owner good taste rather than originality       hilda is seated near a teatable elaborately gowned and with      her is mabel mr robert brackley is sitting down a stout      roundfaced man cleanshaven and very bald about forty he is      attired in the height of fashion in a frockcoat patentleather      boots and an eyeglass he talks very quickly in a careless      frivolous fashion and is always much amused at what he says   mabel  what is the time mr brackley  brackley  i shant tell you again  mabel  how brutal of you  brackley  theres something unhealthy in your passion for information ive already told you five times  hilda  its very unflattering to us whove been doing our little best to amuse you  mabel  i cant imagine whats happened to john he promised to fetch me here  hilda  hes sure to come if youll only wait patiently  mabel  but i hate waiting patiently  hilda  you shouldnt have let him out of your sight  mabel  he went to putney after luncheon to see your friend mr kent have you seen him lately  hilda  john i saw him at the martins yesterday  mabel  slyly i meant mr kent  hilda  indifferently yes he called the other day to change the conversation youre unusually silent mr brackley  brackley  smiling i have nothing whatever to say  mabel  thats usually when clever people talk most  hilda  are you doing anything now  brackley  oh yes im writing a play in blank verse  hilda  you brave man what is it about  brackley  cleopatra  hilda  dear me shakespeare wrote a play about cleopatra didnt he  brackley  i daresay i havent read it shakespeare bores me he lived so long ago  mabel  of course there are people who read him  brackley  are there what do they look like  hilda  smiling they bear no distinctive mark of their eccentricity  brackley  the english are so original  mabel  i think i shall go and ring up the flat i wonder if john has gone straight home  brackley  do im growing very uneasy about him  mabel  laughing you absurd creature              she goes out  hilda  you talk more nonsense than anyone i ever met  brackley  thats my stock in trade you dont imagine people would read my poems if they knew that i was sober industrious and economical as a matter of fact i lead the virtuous life of a clergymans daughter but not a reviewer would notice me if he knew it  hilda  and the little things that the indiscreet read of in the papers  brackley  are merely another proof of my passion for duty the british public wants its poets to lead romantic lives  hilda  are you ever serious  brackley  may i come to lunch with you on thursday  hilda  a little surprised certainly but why on thursday  brackley  because on that day i intend to ask you to marry me  hilda  with a smile im sorry ive just remembered that im lunching out  brackley  you break my heart  hilda  on the contrary i provide you with the materials for a sonnet  brackley  wont you marry me  hilda  no  brackley  why not  hilda  amused im not in the least in love with you  brackley  people who propose to marry should ask themselves if they can look forward with equanimity to breakfasting opposite one another for an indefinite number of years  hilda  youre very unromantic  brackley  my dear lady if you want romance ill send you my complete works bound in vellum ive ground out ten volumes of romance to phyllis and chloe and heaven knows who the lord save me from a romantic wife  hilda  but im afraid im hopelessly romantic  brackley  well six months of marriage with a poet will cure you  hilda  id rather not be cured  brackley  wont you be in to luncheon on thursday  hilda  no              the butler comes in  butler  mr halliwell mr kent              basil and john appear and at the same             moment mabel comes in from the room in             which she has been telephoning  mabel  to john wretched creature ive been trying to ring you up  john  have i kept you waiting i went down to chancery lane with basil              john turns to shake hands with hilda and             brackley while basil who has said how             dyou do to hilda comes down to speak to             mabel the conversation between mabel             and basil is in an undertone  basil  how dyou do you must scold me for keeping john so long  mabel  i didnt really want him you know  basil  pointing with his head to brackley i say who is that  mabel  robert brackley dont you know him  basil  the poet  mabel  of course they say hed have been given the laureateship if it hadnt been abolished at tennysons death  basil  tightening his lips hes rather a low blackguard isnt he  mabel  heavens whats the matter with him poor man hes hildas latest celebrity he pretends to adore her  basil  dont you remember the grange case that he was mixed up in  mabel  in tones of surprise but my dear mr kent that was two years ago  hilda  mr kent i want to introduce you to mr brackley  basil  going up how dyou do              john comes down to his wife  mabel  wretched creature  john  i say mabel is basil often here  mabel  i dont know i met him here last week  john  why the dickens does he come hes got no business to  mabel  you brought him yourself today  john  i didnt he insisted on comingwhen i said i had to fetch you  mabel  perhaps he came to see me  john  fiddledidee i think you ought to speak to hilda about it  mabel  my dear john are you mad shed jump down my throat  john  why does she let him hang about her she must know shes turning his silly head  mabel  i daresay she wants to prove to him that he showed very bad taste a year ago it is rather annoying when youre attached to a young man that he should go and marry somebody else  john  well i dont think shes playing the game and i shall tell her so  mabel  shell snub you awfully  john  i dont care look here you make a diversion so that i can get hold of her  mabel  how  john  dryly i dont know exercise your invention  mabel  going towards the others hilda john is clamouring for some tea  hilda  coming down why on earth cant he help himself  john  my native modesty prevents  hilda  thats quite a new trait in you              hilda sits down and pours out tea for john             he looks at her silently  hilda  youve been lunching at richmond  john  yes then i went on to putney  hilda  youve been making quite a day of it  john  taking the cup i say old galyoure not going to make a fool of yourself are you  hilda  opening her eyes oh i hope not why  john  i thought it might have slipped your memory that basil was married about a year ago  hilda  freezing what on earth dyou mean calling mabel  john  one moment you can give me a little conversation cant you  hilda  im afraid youre going to bore me  john  goodhumouredly i assure you im not isnt basil here rather often  hilda  i wonder you havent learnt to mind your own business john  john  dont you think its rather rough on that poor little woman in putney  hilda  with a suspicion of contempt i went down to see her i thought she was vulgar and pretentious im afraid i cant arouse any interest in her  john  gently she may be vulgar but she told me her love was like music in her heart dont you think she must have suffered awfully to get hold of a thought like that  hilda  after a pause changing suddenly both voice and manner and dyou think ive not suffered john im so unhappy  john  do you really care for him  hilda  in a low voice hoarse with passion no i dont care for him i worship the very ground he treads on  john  very gravely then you must do as you think best youre playing the most dangerous game in the world youre playing with human hearts goodbye  hilda  taking his hand goodbye john youre not angry with me because i was horrid im glad you told me about his wife now i shall know what to do  john  mabel  mabel  coming forward yes we really must be going ive not seen my precious baby for two hours  hilda  taking both her hands goodbye you happy child youve got a precious baby and youve got a husband you love what can you want more  mabel  flippantly i want a motorcar  hilda  kissing her goodbye darling              mabel and john go out  brackley  i like this room mrs murray it never seems to say to you now its really time for you to go away as some drawingrooms do  hilda  recovering her serenity i suppose its the furniture im thinking of changing it  brackley  with a smile upon my word that almost suggests that ive outstayed my welcome  hilda  gaily i shouldnt have said that if i didnt know that nothing would induce you to go till you wanted to  brackley  rising you know me like your glove but it really is growing monstrous late  hilda  you mustnt go till youve told me who the fair charmer was i saw you with at the play last night  brackley  ah the greeneyed monster  hilda  laughing dont be so absurd but i thought youd like to know her yellow hair was dyed              basil looks over the pages of a book somewhat             annoyed that hilda takes no notice of him  brackley  of course it was dyed that was just the charm of it any woman can have yellow hair naturally theres no more credit in that than in having it blue or green  hilda  ive always wanted to make mine purple  brackley  dont you think women ought to be artificial its just as much their duty to rouge their cheeks and powder their noses as it is for them to wear nice frocks  hilda  but i know many women who wear horrid frocks  brackley  oh those are the others i treat them as nonexistent  hilda  what do you mean  brackley  there are only two sorts of women in the worldthe women who powder their noses and the others  hilda  and who are they if you

only forty poor thingand ive never known a coming young man who was less than that  basil  hes a young man with a very bald head  hilda  amused i wonder why you dislike him  basil  with a jealous glance icily i thought he wasnt admitted into decent houses  hilda  opening her eyes he comes here mr kent  basil  unable to restrain his illtemper dont you know that hes been mixed up in every scandal for the last twenty years  hilda  goodhumouredly seeing that basil is merely jealous there must be people in the world to provide gossip for their neighbours  basil  its no business of mine i have no right to talk to you like this  hilda  i wonder why you do it  basil  almost savagely because i love you              there is a little pause  hilda  with a smile ironically wont you have some more tea mr kent  basil  going up to her speaking with a sort of vehement gravity you dont know what ive suffered you dont know what a hell my life is i tried so hard to prevent myself from coming here when i married i swore id break with all my old friends when i married i found i loved you  hilda  i cant listen to you if you talk like that  basil  dyou want me to go              she does not answer for a moment but walks             up and down in agitation at last she             stops and faces him  hilda  did you hear me tell mr brackley to come on thursday  basil  yes  hilda  hes

sacrifice our happiness oh hilda i love you i cant live without you at first i tried to resist seeing you i used to pass your door and look up at your windows and the door seemed as if it were waiting for me and at the end of the street i used to look back oh how i used to want to come in and see you once more i thought if i saw you just once i should get over it and at last i couldnt help myself im so weak do you despise me  hilda  almost in a whisper i dont know  basil  and you were so kind i couldnt help coming again i thought i did no harm  hilda  i saw you were unhappy  basil  i should

hilda  but you must its your duty  basil  oh i think ive had enough of duty and honour ive used up all my principles in the last year  hilda  dont say that basil  basil  after all its my own fault i brought it on myself and i must take the consequences but i havent the strength i dont love her  hilda  then dont let her ever find it out be kind to her and gentle and forbearing  basil  i cant be kind and gentle and forbearing day after day for weeks and months and years  hilda  i thought you were a brave man they wouldnt have given you that medal if youd been a coward  basil  oh my dearest its not hard to risk your life in the midst of battle i can do thatbut this needs more strength than ive got i tell you i cant endure it  hilda  tenderly but itll get better youll get used to one

for my sake  basil  you dont know what it is everything she says everything she does jars upon me so frightfully i try to restrain myself i clench my teeth to prevent myself from breaking out at her sometimes i cant help it and i say things that id give anything to have left unsaid shes dragging me down im getting as common and vulgar as she is  hilda  how can you say that of your wife  basil  dont you think i must have gone through a good deal before i could acknowledge to myself what she was im chained to her for all my life and when i look into the futurei see her a vulgar slatternly shrew like her mother and myself abject degraded and despicable the woman never tires in her conflict with the man and in the end he always succumbs a man when he marries a woman like that thinks hes going to lift her up to his own station the fool its she who drags him down to hers  hilda  much disturbed rising from her seat i wanted you to be so happy  basil  going towards her hilda  hilda  nodont please  basil  if it werent for you i couldnt have lived it was only by seeing you that i gathered courage to go on with it and each time i came here i loved you more passionately  hilda  oh

manand let me respect you  basil  say that you love me hilda  hilda  distracted youre making our friendship impossible dont you see that youre preventing me from ever having you here again  basil  i cant help it  hilda  i ought never to have seen you again i thought there was no harm in your coming and ii couldnt bear to lose you altogether  basil  even if i never see you again i must tell you now that i love you i made you suffer i was blind but i love you with all my heart hilda all day i think of you and i dream of you in the night i long to take you in my arms and kiss you to kiss your lips and your beautiful hair and your hands my whole soul is yours hilda              he goes towards her again to take her in his             arms  hilda  oh no go away for gods sake go now i cant bear it  basil  hilda i cant live without you  hilda  have mercy on me dont you see how weak i am oh god help me  basil  you dont love me  hilda  vehemently you know i love you but because of my great love i beseech you to do your duty  basil  my duty is to be happy let us go where we can love one anotheraway from england to a land where love isnt sinful and ugly  hilda  oh basil let us try to walk straight think of your wife who loves you alsoas much as i do youre all the world to her you cant treat her so shamefully              she puts her handkerchief to her eyes and basil             gently takes away her hand  basil  dont cry hilda i cant bear it  hilda  in broken tones dont you understand that we could never respect ourselves again if we did that poor creature such a fearful wrong she would be always between us with her tears and her sorrows i tell you i couldnt bear it have mercy on meif you love me at all  basil  wavering hilda its too hard i cant leave you  hilda  you

   he leans his head on his hands and sighs             deeply for a while they remain in silence             at last with another sigh he gets up  basil  i dont know any longer whats right and whats wrong it all seems confused its very hard  hilda  hoarsely its just as hard for me basil  basil  brokenhearted goodbye then i dare say youre right and perhaps i should only make you very unhappy  hilda  goodbye my dearest              he bends down and kisses her hands she             stifles a sob he goes slowly to the door             with his back turned to her and then             hilda unable to endure it gives a groan  hilda  basil dont go  basil  with a cry of joy ah hilda              he clasps her passionately in his arms  hilda  oh i cant bear it i wont lose you basil say you

basil  looks at her for a moment hesitating then shrugs his shoulders then goodbye              he goes out and jenny looking after him             passes her hand wearily over her forehead  jenny  with a sigh hes so glad to go she gives a little sob theyve got no room for me              she takes up from the floor the photograph on             which she stamped and looks at it then             sinks down burying her face in her hands             and bursts into a passion of tears   end of the third act     the fourth act  the next morning        the scene is the same as in the second act the drawingroom at      basils house in putney basil is sitting at the table with his      head in his hands he looks tired and worn his face is very white      and there are great black lines under his eyes his hair is      dishevelled on the table lies a revolver               a knock at the door  basil  without looking up come in              fanny enters  fanny  subdued and pale i came to see

great trouble  basil  i suppose i thought youd see it in the papers  john  what on earth dyou mean ive not seen a paper wheres your wife  basil  after a pause almost in a whisper shes dead  john  thunderstruck good god  basil  impatiently dont look at me like that isnt it plain enough dont you understand  john  but she was all right yesterday  basil  dully yes she was all right yesterday  john  for goodness sake tell me what you mean basil  basil  shes dead and she was all right yesterday              john does not understand he is greatly             distressed and does not know what to say  basil  i killed heras surely as if id strangled her with my own hands  john  what dyou mean shes not really dead  basil  in agony she threw herself into the river last night  john  how awful  basil  havent you got something more to say than how awful i feel as if i were going mad  john  but i cant understand why did she do it  basil  ohyesterday we had an awful row  before you came  john  i know  basil  then she followed me to  to your sisterinlaws and she came up and made another scene then i lost my head i was so furious i dont know what i said i was mad i told her id have nothing more to do with her oh i cant bear it i cant bear it              he breaks down and hides his face in his hands             sobbing  john  come basilpull yourself together a bit  basil  looking up despairingly i can hear her voice now i can see the look of her eyes she asked me to give her another chance and i refused it was so pitiful to hear the way she appealed to me only i was mad and i couldnt feel it              fanny comes in with the cup of tea which             basil silently takes and drinks  fanny  to john he aint slept a wink all night sir no more ave i for the matter of that              john nods but does not answer and fanny             wiping her eyes with her apron leaves the             room  basil  oh id give everything not to have said what i did id always held myself in before but yesterdayi couldnt  john  well  basil  i didnt get back here till nearly ten and the maid told me jenny had just gone out i thought shed gone back to her mothers  john  yes  basil  and soon after a constable came up and asked me to go down to the river he said thered been an accident she was dead a man had seen her walk along the towpath and throw herself in  john  where is she now  basil  pointing to one of the doors in there  john  will you take me in  basil  go in alone john i darent im afraid to look at her i cant bear the look on her face i killed heras surely as if id strangled her with my own hands ive been looking at the door all night and once i thought i heard a sound i thought she was coming to reproach me for killing her              john goes to the door and as he opens it basil             averts his head when john shuts the             door after him he looks at it with staring             frightened eyes half mad with agony he             tries to contain himself after a while             john comes back very quietly  basil  whispering what does she look like  john  theres nothing to be afraid of basil she might be sleeping  basil  clenching his hands but the ghastly pallor  john  gravely shes happier than she would ever have been if shed lived              basil sighs deeply  john  seeing the revolver whats this for  basil  with a groan of selfcontempt i tried to kill myself in the night  john  hm              he takes the cartridges out and puts the revolver             in his pocket  basil  bitterly oh dont be afraid i havent got the pluck i was afraid to go on living i thought if i killed myself it would be a reparation for her death i went down to the river and i walked along the towpath to the same spotbut i couldnt do it the water looked so black and cold and pitiless and yet she did it so easily she just walked along and threw herself in a pause then i came back and i thought id shoot myself  john  dyou think that would have done any one much good  basil  i despised myself i felt i hadnt the right to live and i thought it would be easier just to pull a trigger people say its cowardly to destroy oneself they dont know what courage it wants i couldnt face the painand then i dont know whats on the other side after all it may be true that theres a cruel avenging god who will punish us to all eternity if we break his unknown laws  john  im very glad you sent for me you had better come back to london and stay with me for the present  basil  and dyou know what happened in the night i couldnt go to bed i felt i could never sleep againand then presently i dozed off quite quietly in my chair and i slept as comfortablyas if jenny werent lying in there cold and dead and the maid pities me because she thinks i passed as sleepless a night as she did              a sound of voices is heard outside in altercation             fanny comes in  fanny  please sir mr james  basil  angrily i wont see him  fanny  he wont go away i told im you was too ill to see anybody  basil  i wont see him i knew hed be round curse him  john  after all i suppose he has a certain right to come hereunder the circumstances hadnt you better see what he wants  basil  oh hell make a scene i shall knock him down ive suffered too much through him already  john  let me see him you dont want him to make a fuss at the inquest  basil  ive been thinking of that i know the stories he and his people will make up and the papers will get hold of it and every one will blackguard me theyll say it was my fault  john  dyou mind if i have a talk to him i think i can save you from all that  basil  shrugging his shoulders impatiently do whatever you like  john  to fanny show him up fanny  fanny  yes sir              she goes out  basil  then i shall go              john nods and basil goes out by the door             next to that of the room in which jenny is             lying james bush appears  john  grave and

business  john  if you sold it for instance  james  it might fetch a hundred poundsit might fetch a hundred and fifty  john  that wouldnt be a bad present to make to any one would it  james  no i think i can agree with you there  john  well basil thought of giving the entire contents of the house to your mother and sister  james  to tell you the truth its no more than he ought to do  john  the condition is of course that nothing is said at the inquest  james  with a sneer you make me laugh dyou think you can gag me by giving a houseful of furniture to my mother  john  i had no such exalted opinion of your disinterestedness mr bush i come to you now  james  sharply what dyou mean by that  john  it appears that you owe basil a good deal of money can you pay it  james  no  john  also it appears that there was some difficulty with your accounts in your last place  james  thats a lie  john  possibly but altogether i fancy we could make it uncommonly nasty for you if you made a fuss if dirty linen is going to be washed in publictheres generally a good deal to be done on both sides  james  i dont care i mean to get my own back if i can only get my knife into that manill take the consequences  john  on the other handif you wont make a fuss at the inquest ill give you fifty pounds  james  jumping up indignantly are you trying to bribe me  john  calmly yes  james  i would ave you know that im a gentleman and whats more im an englishman and im proud of it you ought to be ashamed of yourself ive never ad any one try and bribe me before  john  indifferently otherwise you would doubtless have accepted  james  ive got more than half a mind to knock you down  john  with a slight smile come come mr bush dont be ridiculous youd far better keep quiet you know  james  scornfully what do you think fifty pounds is to me  john  with a sharp look who spoke of fifty pounds  james  you did  john  you must have mistaken me a hundred and fifty  james  oh at first he is surprised then as the amount sinks into his mind grows doubtful thats a very different pair of shoes  john  i dont ask you to say anything untrue after all its not worth while for a man of the world like youa business manto give way to petty spite and we dont want to have any scandal that would be just as unpleasant for you as for us  james  undecided theres no denying that she was hysterical if hed only treated me like a gentleman i shouldnt have had anything to say  john  well  james  with a foxy keen glance at john make it two undred and ill say done  john  firmly no you can take a hundred and fifty or go to the devil  james  oh well and it over  john  taking a cheque out of his pocket ill give you fifty now and the rest after the inquest  james  with a certain admiration youre a sharp un you are              john writes out the cheque and gives it to             james bush  james  shall i give you a receipt im a business man you know  john  yes i know but its not necessary youll tell your mother and sister  james  dont you fear im a gentleman and i dont go back on my friends  john  now i think ill say good morning to you you can understand that basil isnt fit to see any one  james  i understand so long              he stretches out his hand which john shakes             gravely  john  good morning              fanny comes in by one door as james bush             goes out by another  fanny  good riddance to bad rubbish  john  ah fanny if there were no rogues in the world life would really be too difficult for honest men              fanny goes out and john walks to the door             and calls  john  basilhes gone where are you  basil comes out of the room in which is lying jennys body  john  i didnt know you were in there  basil  i wonder if she forgives me  john  i wouldnt worry myself too much if i were you basil old man  basil  if you only knew how i despise myself  john  come come basil you must make an effort  basil  ive not told you the worst i feel such a cad theres one thought thats been with me all night and i cant drive it away its worse than anything else its too shameful  john  what do you mean  basil  oh its so despicable and yet its too strong for me i cant help thinking that imfree  john  free  basil  its treachery to her memory but you dont know what it is when your prison door is opened as he speaks he grows more and more excited i dont want to die i want to live and i want to take life by both hands and enjoy it ive got such a desire for happiness lets open the windows and let the sunlight in he goes to the window and flings it open its so good just to be alive how can i help thinking that now i can start fresh the slate is wiped clean and i can begin again i will be happy god forgive me i cant help the thought im free i made a ghastly mistake and i suffered for it heaven knows how i suffered and how hard i tried to make the best of it it wasnt all my fault in this world were made to act and think things because other people have thought them good we never have a chance of going our own way were bound down by the prejudices and the morals of everybody else for gods sake let us be free let us do this and that because we want to and because we must not because other people think we ought he stops suddenly in front of john why dont you say something you stare at me as if you thought me raving mad  john  i dont know what to say  basil  oh i suppose youre shocked and scandalised i ought to go on posing i ought to act the part decently to the end you would never have had the courage to do what i did and yet because ive failed you think you can look down on me from the height of your moral elevation  john  gravely i was thinking how far a man may fall when he attempts to climb the stars  basil  i gave the world fine gold and their currency is only cowrieshells i held up an ideal and they sneered at me in this world you must wallow in the trough with the rest of them the only moral i can see is that if id acted like a blackguardas ninetynine men out of a hundred would have doneand let jenny go to the dogs i should have remained happy and contented and prosperous and she i dare say wouldnt have died its because i tried to do my duty and act like a gentleman and a man of honour that all this misery has come about  john  looking at him quietly i think i should put it in another way one has to be very strong and very sure of oneself to go against the ordinary view of things and if one isnt perhaps its better not to run any risks but just to walk along the same secure old road as the common herd its not exhilarating its not brave and its rather dull but its eminently safe              basil scarcely hears the last words but listens             intently to other sounds outside  basil  whats that i thought i heard a carriage  john  a little surprised do you expect any one  basil  i sent a wire toto hilda at the same time as to you  john  already  basil  excited dyou think shell come  john  i dont know a ring is heard at the front door  basil  running to the window theres some one at the door  john  perhaps its occurred to her also that youre free  basil  with the utmost passion oh she loves me and ii adore her god forgive me i cant help it              fanny comes in  fanny  if you please sir the coroners officer  the end  printed by ballantyne  company ltd at the ballantyne press
