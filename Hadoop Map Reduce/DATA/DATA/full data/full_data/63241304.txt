chapter i  folking    perhaps it was more the fault of daniel caldigate the father than of his son john caldigate that they two could not live together in comfort in the days of the young mans early youth and yet it would have been much for both of them that such comfortable association should have been possible to them wherever the fault lay or the chief faultfor probably there was some on both sidesthe misfortune was so great as to bring crushing troubles upon each of them  there were but the two of which to make a household when john was fifteen and had been about a year at harrow he lost his mother and his two little sisters almost at a blow the two girls went first and the poor mother who had kept herself alive to see them die followed them almost instantly then daniel caldigate had been alone  and he was a man who knew how to live alonea just hard unsympathetic manof whom his neighbours said with something of implied reproach that he bore up strangely when he lost his wife and girls this they said because he was to be seen riding about the country and because he was to be heard talking to the farmers and labourers as though nothing special had happened to him it was rumoured of him too that he was as constant with his books as before and he had been a man always constant with his books and also that he had never been seen to shed a tear or been heard to speak of those who had been taken from him  he was in truth a stout selfconstraining man silent unless when he had something to say then he could become loud enough or perhaps it might be said eloquent to his wife he had been inwardly affectionate but outwardly almost stern to his daughters he had been the samealways anxious for every good thing on their behalf but never able to make the children conscious of this anxiety when they were taken from him he suffered in silence as such men do suffer and he suffered the more because he knew well how little of gentleness there had been in his manners with them  but he had hoped as he sat alone in his desolate house that it would be different with him and his only sonwith his son who was now the only thing left to him but the son was a boy and he had to look forward to what years might bring him rather than to present happiness from that source when the boy came home for his holidays the father would sometimes walk with him and discourse on certain chosen subjectson the politics of the day in regard to which mr caldigate was an advanced liberal on the abomination of the game laws on the folly of protection on the antiquated absurdity of a state churchas to all which matters his son john lent him a very inattentive ear then the lad would escape and kill rabbits or rats or even take birds nests with a zest for such pursuits which was disgusting to the father though he would not absolutely forbid them then john would be allured to go to his uncle babingtons house where there was a pony on which he could hunt and fishingrods and a lake with a boat and three fine bouncing girlcousins who made much of him and called him jack so that he soon preferred his uncle babingtons house and would spend much of his holidays at babington house  mr caldigate was a country squire with a moderate income living in a moderate house called folking in the parish of utterden about ten miles from cambridge here he owned nearly the entire parish and some portion of netherden which lay next to it having the reputation of an income of £3000 ayear it probably amounted to about twothirds of that early in life he had been a very poor man owing to the improvidence of his father but he had soon quarrelled with his fatheras he had with almost everyone elseand had for some ten years earned his own bread in the metropolis among the magazines and newspapers then when his father died the property was his own with such encumbrances as the old squire had been able to impose upon it daniel caldigate had married when he was a poor man but did not go to folking to live till the estate was clear at which time he was forty years old when he was endeavouring to inculcate good liberal principles into that son of his who was burning the while to get off to a battle of rats among the cornstacks he was not yet fifty there might therefore be some time left to him for the promised joys of companionship if he could only convince the boy that politics were better than rats  but he did not long make himself any such promise it seemed to him that his sons mind was of a nature very different from his own and much like to that of his grandfather the lad could be awakened to no enthusiasm in the abuse of conservative leaders and those babingtons were such fools he despised the whole race of themespecially those thicklegged romping cherrycheeked damsels of whom no doubt his son would marry one they were all of the earth earthy without an idea among them and yet he did not dare to forbid his son to go to the house lest people should say of him that his sternness was unendurable  folking is not a place having many attractions of its own beyond the rats it lies in the middle of the cambridgeshire fens between st ives cambridge and ely in the two parishes of utterden and netherden there is no rise of ground which can by any stretch of complaisance be called a hill the property is bisected by an immense straight dike which is called the middle wash and which is so sluggish so straight so ugly and so deep as to impress the mind of a stranger with the ideas of suicide and there are straight roads and straight dikes with ugly names on all sides and passages through the country called droves also with ugly appellations of their own which certainly are not worthy of the name of roads the folking causeway possesses a bridge across the wash and is said to be the remains of an old roman way which ran in a perfectly direct line from st neots to ely when you have crossed the bridge going northwardor northwestwardthere is a lodge at your right hand and a private road running as straight as a line can be drawn through pollard poplars up to mr caldigates house round the house there are meadows and a large oldfashioned kitchen garden and a small dark flowergarden with clipt hedges and straight walks quite in the old fashion the house itself is dark picturesque wellbuilt low and uncomfortable part of it is as old as the time of charles ii and part dates from queen anne something was added at a later dateperhaps early in the georges but it was all done with good materials and no stint of labour shoddy had not been received among building materials when any portion of folking was erected but then neither had modern ideas of comfort become in vogue just behind the kitchengarden a great cross ditch called foulwater drain runs or rather creeps down to the wash looking on that side as though it had been made to act as a moat to the house and on the other side of the drain there is twopenny drove at the end of which twopenny ferry leads to twopenny hall a farmhouse across the wash belonging to mr caldigate the fields around are all square and all flat all mostly arable and are often so deep in mud that a stranger wonders that a plough should be able to be dragged through the soil the farming is however good of its kind and the ploughing is mostly done by steam  such is and has been for some years the house at folking in which mr caldigate has lived quite alone for five years after his wifes death he had only on rare occasions received visitors there twice his brother had come to folking and had brought a son with him the brother had been a fellow of a college at cambridge and had taken a living and married late in life the living was far away in dorsetshire and the son at the time of these visits was being educated at a private school twice they had both been at folking together and the uncle had in his silent way liked the boy the lad had preferred or had pretended to prefer books to rats had understood or seemed to understand something of the advantages of cheap food for the people and had been commended by the father for general good conduct but when they had last taken their departure from folking no one had entertained any idea of any peculiar relations between the nephew and the uncle it was not till a year or two more had run by that mr daniel caldigate thought of making his nephew george the heir to the property  the property indeed was entailed upon john as it had been entailed upon johns father there were many institutions of his country which mr caldigate hated with almost an inhuman hatred but there were none more odious to him than that of entails which institution he was wont to prove by many arguments to be the source of all the ignorance and all the poverty and all the troubles by which his country was inflicted he had got his own property by an entail and certainly never would have had an acre had his father been able to consume more than a lifeinterest but he had denied that the property had done him any good and was loud in declaring that the entail had done the property and those who lived on it very much harm in his hearts of hearts he did feel a desire that when he was gone the acres should still belong to a caldigate there was so much in him of the leaven of the old english squirarchic aristocracy as to create a pride in the fact that the caldigates had been at folking for three hundred years and a wish that they might remain there and no doubt he knew that without repeated entails they would not have remained there but still he had hated the thing and as years rolled on he came to think that the entail now existing would do an especial evil  his son on leaving school spent almost the whole four months between that time and the beginning of his first term at cambridge with the babingtons this period included the month of september and afforded therefore much partridge shootingthan which nothing was meaner in the opinion of the squire of folking when a short visit was made to folking the father was sarcastic and disagreeable and then for the first time john caldigate showed himself to be possessed of a power of reply which was peculiarly disagreeable to the old man this had the effect of cutting down the intended allowance of £250 to £220 per annum for which sum the father had been told that his son could live like a gentleman at the university this parsimony so disgusted uncle babington who lived on the other side of the county within the borders of suffolk that he insisted on giving his nephew a hunter and an undertaking to bear the expense of the animal as long as john should remain at the university no arrangement could have been more foolish and that last visit made by john to babington house for the two days previous to his cambridge career was in itself most indiscreet the angry father would not take upon himself to forbid it but was worked up by it to perilous jealousy he did not scruple to declare aloud that old humphrey babington was a thickheaded fool nor did humphrey babington who with his ten or twelve thousand ayear was considerably involved scruple to say that he hated such cheeseparing ways john caldigate felt more distaste to the cheeseparing ways than he did to his uncles want of literature  such was the beginning of the rupture which took place before the time had come for john to take his degree when that time came he had a couple of hunters at cambridge played in the cambridge eleven and rowed in one of the trinity boats he also owed something over £800 to the regular tradesmen of the university and a good deal more to other creditors who were not regular during the whole of this time his visits to folking had been short and few the old squire had become more and more angry and not the less so because he was sensible of a nonperformance of duty on his own part though he was close to cambridge he never went to see his son nor would he even press the lad to come out to folking nor when on rare occasions a visit was made did he endeavour to make the house pleasant he was jealous jealous to hot anger at being neglected but could not bring himself to make advances to his own son then when he heard from his sons tutor that his son could not pass his degree without the payment of £800 for recognised debtsthen his anger boiled over and he told john caldigate that he was expelled from his fathers heart and his fathers house  the money was paid and the degree was taken and there arose the question as to what was to be done john of course took himself to babington house and was condoled with by his uncle and cousins his troubles at this time were numerous enough that £800 by no means summed up his whole indebtednesscovered indeed but a small part of it he had been at newmarket and there was a pleasant gentleman named davis who frequented that place and cambridge who had been very civil to him when he lost a little money and who now held his acceptances for alas much more than £800 even uncle babington knew nothing of this when the degree was taken and then there came a terrible blow to him aunt babingtonaunt polly as she was calledgot him into her own closet upstairs where she kept her linen and her jams and favourite liqueurs and told him that his cousin julia was dying in love for him after all that had passed of course it was expected he would engage himself to his cousin julia now julia was the eldest the thickestankled and the cherrycheekedest of the lot to him up to that time the babington folk had always been a unit no one else had been so goodnatured to him had so petted him and so freely administered to all his wants he would kiss them all round whenever he went to babington but he had not kissed julia more than her sisters there were three sons whom he never specially liked and who certainly were fools one was the heir and of course did nothing the second was struggling for a degree at oxford with an eye to the family living the third was in a fair way to become the family gamekeeper he certainly did not wish to marry into the familyand yet they had all been so kind to him  i should have nothing to marry on aunt polly he said  then he was reminded that he was his fathers heir and that his fathers house was sadly in want of a mistress they could live at babington till folking should be ready the prospect was awful  what is a young man to say in such a position i do not love the young lady after that fashion and therefore i must decline it requires a hero and a coldblooded hero to do that and aunt polly was very much in earnest for she brought julia into the room and absolutely delivered her up into the young mans arms  i am so much in debt he said that i dont care to think of it  aunt polly declared that such debts did not signify in the least folking was not embarrassed folking did not owe a shilling every one knew that and there was julia in his arms he never said that he would marry her but when he left the linencloset the two ladies understood that the thing was arranged  luckily for him aunt polly had postponed this scene till the moment before his departure from the house he was at this time going to cambridge where he was to be the guest for one night of a certain mr bolton who was one of the very few friends to whom his father was still attached mr bolton was a banker living close to cambridge an old man now with four sons and one daughter and to his house john caldigate was going in order that he might there discuss with mr bolton certain propositions which had been made between him and his father respecting the folking property the father had now realised the idea of buying his son out and john himself who had all the world and all his life before him and was terribly conscious of the obligations which he owed to his friend davis had got into his head a notion that he would prefer to face his fortune with a sum of ready money than to wait in absolute poverty for the reversion of the family estate he had his own ideas and in furtherance of them he had made certain inquiries there was gold being found at this moment among the mountains of new south wales in quantities which captivated his imagination and this was being done in a most lovely spot among circumstances which were in all respects romantic his friend richard shand who was also a trinity man was quite resolved to go out and he was minded to accompany his friend in this way and as he thought in this way only could a final settlement be made with that most assiduous of attendants mr davis his mind was fully set upon new south wales and his little interview with his cousin julia did not tend to bind him more closely to his own country or to babington or to folking     chapter ii  puritan grange    perhaps there had been a little treachery on the part of mr davis for he had in a gently insinuating way made known to the squire the fact of those acceptances and the additional fact that he was through unforeseen circumstances lamentably in want of ready money the squire became eloquent and assured mr davis that he would not pay a penny to save either mr davis or his son from instant imprisonmentor even from absolute starvation then mr davis shrugged his shoulders and whispered the word postobits the squire thereupon threatened to kick him out of the house and on the next day paid a visit to his friend mr bolton there had after that been a long correspondence between the father the son and mr bolton as to which john caldigate said not a word to the babingtons had he been more communicative he might have perhaps saved himself from that scene in the linencloset as it was when he started for cambridge nothing was known at babington either of mr davis or of the new south wales scheme  mr bolton lived in a large redbrick house in the village of chesterton near to cambridge which with a large garden was surrounded by an old high darkcoloured brickwall he rarely saw any company and there were probably not many of the more recently imported inhabitants of the town who had ever been inside the elaborate iron gates by which the place was to be approached he had been a banker all his life and was still reported to be the senior partner in boltons bank but the management of the concern had in truth been given up to his two elder sons his third son was a barrister in london and a fourth was settled in cambridge as a solicitor these men were all married and were doing well in the world living in houses better than their fathers and spending a great deal more money mr bolton had the name of being a hard man because having begun life in small circumstances he had never learned to chuck his shillings about easily but he had in a most liberal manner made over the bulk of his fortune to his sons and though he himself could rarely be got to sit at their tables he took delight in hearing that they lived bounteously with their friends he had been twice married and there now lived with him his second wife and a daughter hestera girl about sixteen years of age at the period of john caldigates visit to puritan grange as mr boltons house was called at this time puritan grange was not badly named for mrs bolton was a lady of stern life and hester bolton was brought up with more of seclusion and religious observances than are now common in our houses  mr bolton was probably ten years older than the squire of folking but circumstances had in early life made them fast friends the old squire had owed a large sum of money to the bank and mr bolton had then been attracted by the manner in which the son had set himself to work so that he might not be a burden on the estate they had been fast friends for a quarter of a century and now the arrangement of terms between the present squire and his son had been left to mr bolton  mr bolton had no doubt received a very unfavourable account of the young man men such as was mr bolton who make their money by lending it out at recognised rates of interestand who are generally very keen in looking after their principalhave no mercy whatsoever for the davises of creation and very little for their customers to have had dealings with a davis is condemnation in their eyes mr bolton would not therefore have opened his gates to this spendthrift had not his feelings for the father been very strong he had thought much upon the matter and had tried hard to dissuade the squire he the banker was not particularly attached to the theory of primogeniture he had divided his wealth equally between his own sons but he had a strong idea as to property and its rights the young mans claim to folking after his fathers death was as valid as the fathers claim during his life no doubt the severance of the entail if made at all would be made in accordance with the young mans wishes and on certain terms which should be declared to be just by persons able to compute the value of such rights no doubt alsoso mr bolton thoughtthe property would be utterly squandered if left in its present condition it would be ruined by incumbrances in the shape of postobits all this had been deeply considered and at last mr bolton had consented to act between the father and the son  when john caldigate was driven up through the iron gates to mr boltons door his mind was not quite at ease within him he had seen mr bolton on two or three occasions during his university career and had called at the house but he had never entered it and had never seen the ladies and now it was necessary that he should discuss his own follies and own all his faults of course that which he was going to do would in the eyes of the british world be considered very unwise the british world regards the position of heirship to acres as the most desirable which a young man could hold that he was about to abandon but as he told himself without abandoning it he could not rid himself from the horror of davis he was quite prepared to acknowledge his own vice and childish stupidity in regard to davis he had looked all round that now and was sure that he would do nothing of the kind again but how could he get rid of davis in any other way than this and then folking had no charms for him he hated folking he was certain that any life would suit him better than a life to be passed as squire of folking and he was quite alive to the fact that though there was at home the prospect of future position and future income for the present there would be nothing were he to submit himself humbly to his father he might probably be allowed to vegetate at the old family home but there was no career for him no profession had as yet been even proposed his father was fiftyfive a very healthy manlikely to live for the next twenty years and then it would be impossible that he should dwell in peace under the same roof with his father and davis life would be miserable to him if he could not free himself from that thraldom the sum of money which was to be offered to him and which was to be raised on the folking property would enable him to pay davis and to start upon his career with plentiful means in his pocket he would too be wise and not risk all his capital shand had a couple of thousand pounds and he would start with a like sum of his own should he fail in new south wales there would still be something on which to begin again with his mind thus fixed he entered mr boltons gates  he was to stay one night at puritan grange and then if the matter were arranged he would go over to folking for a day or two and endeavour to part from his father on friendly terms in that case he would be able to pay davis himself and there need be no ground for quarrelling on that score  before dinner the matter was settled at the grange the stern old man bade his visitor sit down and then explained to him at full length that which it was proposed to do so much money the squire had himself put by so much more mr bolton himself would advance the value had been properly computed and should the arrangement be completed he john caldigate would sell his inheritance at its proper price over and over again the young man endeavoured to interrupt the speaker but was told to postpone his words till the other should have done such interruptions came from the too evident fact that mr bolton thoroughly despised his guest caldigate though he had been very foolish though he had loved to slaughter rats and rabbits and to romp with the girls at babington was by no means a fool he was possessed of good natural abilities of great activity and of a high spirit his appreciation was quicker than that of the old banker who as he soon saw had altogether failed to understand him in every word that the banker spoke it was evident that he thought that these thousands would be squandered instantly the banker spoke as though this terrible severance was to be made because the natural heir had shown himself to be irrevocably bad what could be expected from a youth who was deep in the books of a davis before he had left his college i do not recommend this he said at last i have never recommended it the disruption is so great as to be awful but when your father has asked what better step he could take i have been unable to advise him it was as though the old man were telling the young one that he was too bad for hope and that therefore he must be consigned for ever to perdition  caldigate conscious of the mistake which the banker was making full of hope as to himself intending to acknowledge the follies of which he had been guilty and at the same time not to promisefor he would not condescend so farbut to profess that they were things of the past and impatient of the judgment expressed against him endeavoured to stop the old man in his severity so that the tone in which the business was being done might be altered but when he found that he could not do this without offence he leaned back in his chair and heard the indictment to the end now mr bolton he said when at length his time came you shall hear my view of the matter and mr bolton did hear him listening very patiently caldigate first asserted that in coming there to puritan grange his object had been to learn what were the terms proposedas to which he was now willing to give his assent he had already quite made up his mind to sell what property he had on the estate and therefore though he was much indebted to mr bolton for his disinterested and kind friendship he was hardly in want of counsel on that matter mr bolton raised his eyebrows but still listened patiently caldigate then went on to explain his views as to life declaring that under no circumstanceshad there been no daviswould he have consented to remain at folking as a deputysquire waiting to take up his position some twenty years hence at his fathers death nor even were folking his own at this moment would he live there he must do something and upon the whole he thought that goldmining in the colonies was the most congenial pursuit to which he could put his hand then he made a frank acknowledgment as to davis and his gambling follies and ended by saying that the matter might be regarded as settled  he had certainly been successful in changing the old mans opinion mr bolton did not say as much nor was he a man likely to make such acknowledgment but when he led john caldigate away to be introduced to his wife in the drawingroom he felt less of disdain for his guest than he had done half an hour before mr bolton was a silent cautious man even in his own family and had said nothing of this business to his wife and nothing of course to his daughter mrs bolton asked after the squire and expressed a hope that her guest would not find the house very dull for one night she had heard that john caldigate was a fast young man and of course regarded him as a lost sinner hester who was with her mother looked at him with all her young big eyes but did not speak a word it was very seldom that she saw any young man or indeed young people of either sex but when this stranger spoke freely to her mother about this subject and the other she listened to him and was interested  john caldigate without being absolutely handsome was a youth sure to find favour in a womans eyes he was about five feet ten in height strong and very active with bright dark eyes which were full of life and intelligence his forehead was square and showed the angles of his brow his hair was dark and thick and cut somewhat short his mouth was large but full of expression and generally also of goodhumour his nose would have been well formed but that it was a little snubbed at the end altogether his face gave you the idea of will intellect and a kindly nature but there was in it a promise too of occasional anger and a physiognomist might perhaps have expected from it that vacillation in conduct which had hitherto led him from better things into wretched faults  as he was talking to mrs bolton he had observed the girl who sat apart with her fingers busy on her work and who had hardly spoken a word since his entrance she was he thought the most lovely human being that he had ever beheld and yet she was hardly more than a child but how different from those girls at babington her bright brown hair was simply brushed from off her forehead and tied in a knot behind her head her dress was as plain as a childsas though it was intended that she should still be regarded as a child her face was very fair with large grey thoughtful eyes and a mouth which though as caldigate watched her it was never opened seemed always as if it was just about to pour forth words and he could see that though her eyes were intent upon her work from time to time she looked across at him and he thought that if only they two were alone together he could teach her to speak  but no such opportunity was given to him now or during his short sojourn at the grange after a while the old man returned to the room and took him up to his bedchamber it was then about halfpast four and he was told that they were to dine at six it was early in novembernot cold enough for bedroom fires among thrifty people and there he was left apparently to spend an hour with nothing to do rebelling against this declaring that even at puritan grange he would be master of his own actions he rushed down into the hall took his hat and walked off into the town he would go and take one last look at the old college  he went in through the great gate and across the yard and passing by the wellknown butteryhatches looked into the old hall for the last time the men were all seated at dinner and he could see the fellows up at the high table three years ago it had been his fixed resolve to earn for himself the right to sit upon that dais he had then been sure of himselfthat he would do well and take honours and win a fellowship there had been moments in which he had thought that a college life would suit him till he came into his own property but how had all that faded away everybody had congratulated him on the ease with which he did his workand the result had been newmarket davis and a long score in the ephemeral records of a cricket match as he stood there with his slouched hat over his eyes one of the college servants recognised him and called him by his name then he passed on quickly and made his way out to the gravelwalk by the riverside it was not yet closed for the night and he went on that he might take one last turn up and down the old avenue  he had certainly made a failure of his life so far he did acknowledge to himself that there was something nobler in these classic shades than in the oreladen dirt of an australian goldgully he knew as much of the world as that he had not hitherto chosen the better part and now something of regret even as to folkingpoor old folkingcame upon him he was as it were being kicked out and repudiated by his own family as worthless and what was he to do about julia babington after that scene in the linencloset he could not leave his country without a word either to julia or to aunt polly but the idea of julia was doubly distasteful to him since that lovely vision of young female simplicity had shone upon him from the corner of mrs boltons drawingroom romping with the babington girls was all very well but if he could only feel the tips of that girls fingers come within the grasp of his hand then he thought that it would lend a fine romance to his life if he could resolve to come back when he should be laden with gold and make hester bolton his wife it should be his romance and he swore that he would cling to it  he turned back and came down to dinner five minutes after the time at ten minutes before dinnertime mr bolton heard that he was gone out and was offendedthinking it quite possible that he would not return at all what might not be expected from a young man who could so easily abandon his inheritance but he was there only five minutes after the time and the dinner was eaten almost in silence in the evening there was tea and the coldest shivering attempt at conversation for half an hour during which he could still at moments catch the glance of hesters eyes and see the moving curve of her lips then there was a reading of the bible and prayer and before ten he was in his bedroom  on the next morning as he took his departure mr bolton said a word intended to be gracious i hope you may succeed in your enterprise mr caldigate  why should i not as well as another said john cheerily  if you are steady sober industrious selfdenying and honest you probably will replied the banker  to promise all that would be to promise too much said john but i mean to make an effort  then at that moment he made one effort which was successful for an instant he held hesters fingers within his hand     chapter iii  daniel caldigate    that piece of business was done it was one of the disagreeable things which he had had to do before he could get away to the golddiggings and it was done now he had to say farewell to his father and that would be a harder task as the moment was coming in which he must bid adieu to his father perhaps for ever and bid adieu to the old place which though he despised it he still loved his heart was heavy within him he felt sure that his father had no special regard for himin which he was of course altogether wrong and the old man was equally wrong in supposing that his son was unnaturally deficient in filial affection but they had never known each other and were so different that neither had understood the other the son however was ready to confess to himself that the chief fault had been with himself it was natural he thought that a fathers regard should be deadened by such conduct as his had been and natural that an old man should not believe in the quick repentance and improvement of a young one  he hired a gig and drove himself over from cambridge to folking as he got near to the place and passed along the dikes and looked to the right and left down the droves and trotted at last over the folking bridge across the middle wash the country did not seem to him to be so unattractive as of yore and when he recognised the faces of the neighbours when one of the tenants spoke to him kindly and the girls dropped a curtsey as he passed certain soft regrets began to crop up in his mind after all there is a comfort in the feeling of propertynot simply its money comfort but in the stability and reputation of a recognised home six months ago there had seemed to him to be something ridiculous in the idea of a permanent connection between the names of caldigate and folking it was absurd that with so wild and beautiful a world around him he should be called upon to live in a washy fen because his father and grandfather had been unfortunate enough to do so and then at that time all sympathy with bricks and mortar any affection for special trees or wellknown homehaunts was absurd in his eyes and as his father had been harsh to him and did not like him would it not be better that they should be far apart it was thus that he had reasoned but now all that was changed an unwonted tenderness had come upon his spirit the very sallows by the brook seemed to appeal to him as he saw the house chimneys through the trees he remembered that they had carried smoke from the hearths of many generations of caldigates he remembered too that his father would soon be old and would be alone it seemed to himself that his very mind and spirit were altered  but all that was too late he had agreed to the terms proposed and even were he now to repudiate them what could he do with davis and how could he live for the present not for a moment did he entertain such an idea but he had lost that alacrity of spirit which had been his when he first found the way out of his difficulties  his father did not come forth to meet him he went in across the hall and through the library into a little closet beyond in which mr caldigate was wont to sit well john said the old man how have you and mr bolton got on together  there seemed to be something terribly cold in this it might be better that they should partbetter even though the parting should be for ever it might be rightnay he knew that it was right that he should be thrust out of the inheritance he had spent money that was not his own and of course he must pay the debt but that his father should sit there in his chair on his entrance not even rising to greet him and should refer at once to mr bolton and that business arrangement as though that and that alone need now be discussed did seem to him to be almost cruel of all that his father had suffered in constraining himself to this conduct he understood nothing mr bolton made himself very plain sir  he would be sure to do so he is a man of business and intelligent but as to the terms proposed were they what you had expected  quite as good as i had expected  whether good or bad of course you will understand that i have had nothing to do with them the matter has been referred to two gentlemen conversant with such subjects and after due inquiry they told mr bolton what was the money value of your rights it is a question to be settled as easily as the price of a ton of coals or a joint of beef but you must understand that i have not interfered  i am quite aware of that sir  as for the money something over a third of it is in my own hands i have not been extravagant myself and have saved so much the remainder will come out of mr boltons bank and will be lent on mortgage i certainly shall not have cause for extravagance now living here alone and shall endeavour to free the estate from the burden by degrees when i die it will in accordance with my present purpose go to your cousin george as this was said john thought he perceived something like a quiver in his fathers voice which up to that point had been hard clear and unshaken as to that however i do not intend to pledge myself he continued the estate will now be my own subject to the claim from messrs boltons bank i dont know that there is anything else to be said  not about business sir  and it is business i suppose that has brought you hereand to cambridge i do not know what little things you have of your own in the house  not much sir  if there be anything that you wish to take take it but with you now i suppose money is the only possession that has any value  i should like to have the small portrait of youthe miniature  the miniature of me said the father almost scoffingly looking up at his sons face suspiciously and yet though he would not show it he was touched only if this were a ruse on the part of the young man a mock sentiment a little gotup theatrical pretencethenthen how disgraced he would be in his own estimation at having been moved by such mockery  the son stood square before his father disdaining any attempt to evince a supplicating tenderness either by his voice or by his features but perhaps you have a special value for it he said  no indeed it is others not oneself that ought to have such triflesthat is if they are of value at all  there is none but myself that can care much for it  there is no one to care at all no one else that is he added wishing to avoid any further declaration take that or anything else you want in the house there will be things left i supposeclothes and books and suchlike  hardly anything sir going so far i had better give them away a few books i shall take then the conversation was over and in a few minutes john caldigate found himself roaming alone about the place  it was so probable that he might never see it again indeed it seemed to him now that were he to return to england with a fortune made he would hardly come to folking years and years must roll by before that could be done if he could only come back to cambridge and fetch that wife away with him then he thought it would be better for him to live far from england whether he were rich or whether he were poor it was quite evident that his fathers heart was turned from him altogether of course he had himself to blamehimself only but still it was strange to him that a father should feel no tenderness at parting with an only son while he had been in the room he had constrained himself manfully not a drop of moisture had glittered in his eye not a tone of feeling had thrilled in his voice his features had never failed him there had always been that look of audacity on his brow joined to a certain manliness of goodhumour in his mouth as though he had been thoroughly master of himself and the situation but now as he pushed his hat from off his forehead he rubbed his hand across his eyes to dash away the tears he felt almost inclined to rush back to the house and fall on his knees before his father and kiss the old mans hands and beg the old mans blessing but though he was potent for much he was not potent for that such expression of tenderness would have been true but he knew that he would so break down in the attempt as to make it seem to be false  he got out upon twopenny drove and passed over the ferry meaning to walk across the farm and so out on to the causeway and round home by the bridge but on the other side of the wash he encountered mr ralph holt the occupier of twopenny farm whose father also and grandfather had lived upon the same acres and so thou beest going away from us mr john said the farmer with real tenderness almost with solemnity in his voice although there was at the same time something ridiculous in the farfetched sadness of his tone and gait  yes indeed holt i want to travel and see the world at a distance from here  if it was no more than that mr john there would be nothing about it zeeing the world you young collegers allays does that but beest thou to come back and be squoire ofolking  i think not holt i think not my father i hope will be squire for many a year  like enough and we all hope that for there arent nowhere a juster man nor the squoire and hes hale and hearty but in course of things his timell run out and it be so mr john that thou beest going for ever and allays  i rather think i am  its wrong mr john though maybe im making overfree to talk of what dont concern me yet i say its wrong sons should come arter fathers specially where theres land we dont none of us like itnone of us its worse nor going any one of ourselves for whats a lease but when a man has a freehold he should stick to it for ever and aye its just as though the old place was atumbling about all our ears caldigate was goodnatured with the man trying to make him understand that everything was being done for the best and at last he bade him goodbye affectionately shaking hands with him and going into the farmhouse to perform the same ceremony with his wife and daughters but to the last ralph holt was uncomfortable and dismal foretelling miseries it was clear that to his thinking the stability of this world was undermined and destroyed by the very contemplation of such a proceeding as this  caldigate pursued his walk and in the course of it bade farewell to more than one old friend none of them were so expressive as holt but he could perceive that he was regarded by all of them as a person who by his conduct was bringing misfortune not only on himself but on the whole parishes of utterden and netherden  at dinner the squire conversed upon various subjects if not easily to himself at least with affected ease had he applied himself to subjects altogether indifferentto the state of politics or the game laws or the absurdities of a state church the unfitness of such matters for the occasion would have been too apparent both he and his son would have broken down in the attempt but he could talk about babingtonabusing the old familyand even about himself and about new south wales and gold and the coming voyage without touching points which had been and would be specially painful not a word had ever been spoken between them as to davis there had of course been letters very angry letters but the usurers name had never been mentioned nor was there any need that it should be mentioned now it was johns affairnot in any way his so he asked and listened to much about richard shand and the mode of goldfinding practised among the diggings in new south wales  when the old butler had gone he was even more free speaking of things that were past not only without anger but as far as possible without chagrintreating his son as a person altogether free from any control of his i dare say it is all for the best he said  it is well at any rate to try to think so sir replied john consciencestricken as to his own faults  i doubt whether there would have been anything for you to do hereor at least anything that you would have done you would have had too much ambition to manage this little estate under me and not enough of industry i fear to carry you to the front in any of the professions i used to think of the bar  and so did i  but when i found that the babingtons had got hold of you and that you liked horses and guns better than words and arguments  i never did sir  it seemed so  of course i have been weak  do not suppose for a moment that i am finding fault it would be of no avail and i would not thus embitter our last hours together but when i saw how your tastes seemed to lead you i began to fear that there could be no career for you here on such a property as babington an eldest son may vegetate like his father before him and may succeed to it in due time before he has wasted everything and may die as he had lived useless but having to the end all the enjoyments of a swine  you are severe upon my cousins sir  i say what i think but you would not have done that and though you are not industrious you are far too active and too clever for such a life now you are probably in earnest as to the future  yes i am certainly in earnest  and though you are going to risk your capital in a precarious business you will only be doing what is done daily by enterprising men i could wish that your position were more securebut that now cannot be helped  my bed is as i have made it i quite understand that sir  thinking of all this i have endeavoured to reconcile myself to your going then he paused a moment considering what he should next say and his son was silent knowing that something further was to come had you remained in england we could hardly have lived together as father and son should live you would have been dependent on me and would have rebelled against that submission which a state of dependence demands there would have been nothing for you but to have waitedand almost to have wished for my death  no sir never never that  it would have been no more than natural i shall hear from you sometimes  certainly sir  it will give an interest to my life if you will write occasionally whither do you go tomorrow  it had certainly been presumed though never said that this last visit to the old home was to be only for one day the hired gig had been kept and in his letter the son had asked whether he could be taken in for thursday night but now the proposition that he should go so soon seemed to imply a coldblooded want of feeling on his part i need not be in such a hurry sir he said  of course it shall be as you please but i do not know that you will do any good by staying a last month may be pleasant enough or even a last week but a last day is purgatory the melancholy of the occasion cannot be shaken off it is only the prolonged wail of a last farewell all this was said in the old mans ordinary voice but it seemed to betoken if not feeling itself a recognition of feeling which the son had not expected  it is very sad said the son  therefore why prolong it stand not upon the order of your going but go at onceseeing that it is necessary that you should go will you take any more wine no then let us go into the other room as they are making company of you and have lighted another fire we will do as they would have us then for the rest of the evening there was some talk about books and the father who was greatly given to reading explained to his son what kind of literature would as he thought fit in best with the life of a golddigger  after what had passed caldigate of course took his departure on the following morning goodbye said the old man as the son grasped his hand goodbye he made no overture to come even as far as the hall in making this his final adieu  i trust i may return to see you in health  it may be so as to that we can say nothing goodbye then when the son had turned his back the father recalled him by a murmur rather than by a wordbut in that moment he had resolved to give way a little to the demands of nature goodbye my son he said in a low voice very solemnly may god bless you and preserve you then he turned back at once to his own closet     chapter iv  the shands    john caldigate had promised to go direct from folking to the house of his friend richard shand or rather to the house in which lived richard shands father and family the two young men had much to arrange together and this had been thought to be expedient when caldigate remembering how affairs were at his own home had suggested that at so sad a moment he might be found to be in the way shand had assured him that there would be no sadness at all we are not a sentimental race he had said there are a dozen of us and the sooner some of us disperse ourselves the more room will there be in the nest for the others  shand had been caldigates most intimate friend at college through the whole period of their residence and now he was to be his companion in a still more intimate alliance and yet though he liked the man he did not altogether approve of him shand had also got into debt at cambridge but had not paid his debts and had dealings also with davis as to which he was now quite indifferent he had left the university without taking a degree and had seemed to bear all these adversities with perfect equanimity there had not been hitherto much of veneration in caldigates character but even he had on occasions been almost shocked at the want of respect evinced by his friend for conventional rules all college discipline all college authorities all university traditions had been despised by shand who even in his dress had departed as far from recognised customs and fashions among the men as from the requisitions of the statutes and the milder requirements of the dignitaries of the day now though he could not pay his debtsand intended indeed to run away from themhe was going to try his fortune with a certain small capital which his father had agreed to give him as his share of what there might be of the good things of the world among the shands generally as shand himself said of both of them he was about to go forth as a prodigal son with a perfect assurance that should he come back emptyhanded no calf would be killed for him but he was an active man with a dash of fun and perhaps a sprinkling of wit quick and brave to whom life was apparently a joke and who boasted of himself that though he was very fond of beef and beer he could live on bread and water if put to it without complaining caldigate almost feared that the man was a dangerous companion but still there was a certain fitness about him for the thing contemplated and for such a venture where could he find any other companion who would be fit  dr shand the father was a physician enjoying a considerable amount of provincial eminence in a small town in essex here he had certainly been a succesful man for with all the weight of such a family on his back he had managed to save some money there had been small legacies from other shands and trifles of portion had come to them from the potters of whom mrs shand had been oneshand and potter having been wholesale druggists in smithfield the young shands had generally lived a pleasant life had gone to schoolthe eldest son as we have seen to the university alsoand had had governesses and ponies to ride and had been great at dancing and had shot arrows and played badminton and been subject to but little domestic discipline they had lived crowded together in a great redbrick house plenteously roughly quarrelling continually but very fond of each other in their own way and were known throughout that side of the country as a happy family the girls had always gloves and shoes for dancing and the boys had enjoyed a considerable amount of shooting and hunting without owning either guns or horses of their own now dick was to go in quest of a fortune and all the girls were stitching shirts for him and were as happy as possible not a word was said about his debts and no one threw it in his teeth that he had failed to take a degree it was known of the shands that they always made the best of everything  when caldigate got out of the railway carriage at pollington he was still melancholy with the remembrance of all that he had done and all that he had lost and he expected to find something of the same feeling at his friends house but before he had been there an hour he was laughing with the girls as though such an enterprise as theirs was the best joke in the world and when a day and a night had passed mrs shand was deep among his shirts and socks and had already given him much advice about flannel and soft soap i know maria would like to go out with you said the youngest daughter on the third day a girl of twelve years old who ought to have known better and who nevertheless knew more than she ought to have done  indeed maria would like nothing of the kind said the young lady in question  only mr caldigate of course you would have to marry her then the child was cuffed and maria declared that the proposed arrangement would suit neither her nor mr caldigate in the least the eldest daughter harriet was engaged to marry a young clergyman in the neighbourhood which event however was to be postponed till he had got a living and the second matilda was under a cloud because she would persist in being in love with lieutenant postlethwaite of the dragoons whose regiment was quartered in the town maria was the third all these family secrets were told to him quite openly as well as the fact that josh the third son was to become a farmer because he could not be got to learn the multiplication table  between pollington and london caldigate remained for six weeks during which time he fitted himself out took his passage and executed the necessary deeds as to the estate it might have been pleasant enoughthis little interval before his voyageas the shands though rough and coarse were kind to him and goodhumoured had it not been that a great trouble befell him through over conscientiousness as to a certain matter after what had passed at babington house it was expedient that he should before he started for new south wales give some notice to his relatives there so that julia might know that destiny did not intend her to become mrs caldigate of folking aunt polly had no doubt been too forward in that matter and in wishing to dispose of her daughter had put herself in the way of merited rebuke and disappointment it was however not the less necessary that she should be told of the altered circumstances of her wishedfor soninlaw but had he been wise he would so have written his letter that no answer should reach him before he had left the shores of england his conscience however pinched him and before he had even settled the day on which he would start he wrote to his aunt a long letter in which he told her everythinghow he had disposed of his inheritancehow he had become so indebted to davis as to have to seek a new fortune out of englandhow he had bade farewell to folking for everand how impossible it was under all these circumstances that he should aspire to the hand of his cousin julia  it was as though a thunderbolt had fallen among them at babington mr babington himself was certainly not a clever man but he knew enough of his own position as an owner of acres to be very proud of it and he was affectionate enough towards his nephew to feel the full weight of this terrible disruption it seemed to him that his brotherinlaw daniel caldigate was doing a very wicked thing and he hurried across the country to folking that he might say so you have not sense enough to understand the matter said daniel caldigate you have no heart in your bowels if you can disinherit an only son said the big squire never mind where i carry my heart said the smaller squire but it is a pity you should carry so small an amount of brain no good could be done by such a meeting as that nor by the journey which aunt polly took to pollington the caldigates both father and son were gifted with too strong a will to be turned from their purpose by such interference but a great deal of confusion was occasioned and aunt polly among the shands was regarded as a very wonderful woman indeed oh my son my darling son she said weeping on john caldigates shoulder now john caldigate was certainly not her son in the usual acceptation of the word nor did maria shand believe that he was so even in that limited sense in which a daughters husband may be so designated it was altogether very disagreeable and made our hero almost resolve to get on board the ship a week before it started from the thames instead of going down to plymouth and catching it at the last moment of course it would have been necessary that the babingtons should know all about it sooner or later but john very much regretted that he had not delayed his letter till the day before his departure  there is something jovial when you are young in preparing for a long voyage and for totally altered circumstances in life especially when the surroundings are in themselves not melancholy a mother weeping over a banished child may be sad enoughgoing as an exile when there is no hope of a return but here among the shands with whom sons and daughters were plentiful and with whom the feelings were of a useful kind and likely to wear well rather than of a romantic nature the bustle the purchasings the arrangements and the packings generally had in them a pleasantness of activity with no disagreeable accompaniments  i do hope you will wear them dick the mother said with something like a sob in her voice but the tenderness came not from the approaching departure but from her fear that the thick woollen drawers on which she was resewing all the buttons should be neglectedafter dicks usual fashion mr caldigate i hope you will see that he wears them he looks strong but indeed he is not our hero who had always regarded his friend as a bull for strength of constitution generally promised that he would be attentive to dicks drawers  you may be sure that i shall wear them said dick but the time will come when i shall probably wear nothing else so you had better make the buttons firm  everything was to be done with strict economy but yet there was plenty of money for purchases there always is at such occasions the quantity of clothes got together seemed to be more than any two men could ever wear and among it all there were no dresscoats and no dresstrousers or if either of them had such articles they were smuggled the two young men were going out as miners and took a delight in preparing themselves to be rough caldigate was at first somewhat modest in submitting his own belongings to the females of the establishment but that feeling soon wore off and the markings and mendings and buttonings and hemmings went on in a strictly impartial manner as though he himself were a chick out of the same brood  what will you do said the doctor if you spend your capital and make nothing  work for wages said dick we shall have got at any rate enough experience out of our money to be able to do that men are getting 10s aday  but youd have to go on doing that always said the mother  not at all of course its a life of ups and downs a man working for wages can put half what he earns into a claim so that when a thing does come up trumps at last he will have his chance i have read a good deal about it now there is plenty to be got if a man only knows how to keep it  drinking is the worst said the doctor  i think i can trust myself for that said dick whose hand at the moment was on a bottle of whisky and who had been by no means averse to jollifications at cambridge a miner when hes at work should never drink  nor when hes not at work if he wants to keep what he earns  im not going to take the pledge or anything of that kind continued the son but i think i know enough of it all not to fall into that pit during this discussion caldigate sat silent for he had already had various conversations on this subject with his friend he had entertained some fears which were not perhaps quite removed by dicks manly assurances  a cabin had been taken for the joint use of the young men on board the goldfinder a large steamer which was running at the time from london to melbourne doing the voyage generally in about two months but they were going as secondclass passengers and their accommodation therefore was limited dick had insisted on this economy which was hardly necessary to caldigate and which was not absolutely pressed upon the other but dick had insisted let us begin as we mean to go on he had said of course weve got to rough it we shall come across something a good deal harder than secondclass fare before we have made our fortunes and worked probably with mates more uncouth than secondclass passengers it was impossible to oppose counsel such as this and therefore secondclass tickets were taken on board the goldfinder  a terrible struggle was made during the last fortnight to prevent the going of john caldigate mr babington was so shocked that he did not cease to stir himself allow a son to disinherit himself merely because he had fallen into the hands of a moneylending jew before he had left college to have the whole condition of a property changed by such a simple accident it was shocking to him and he moved himself in the matter with much more energy than old mr caldigate had expected from him he wrote heartrending letters to folking in spite of the hard words which had been said to him there he made a second journey to cambridge and endeavoured to frighten mr bolton descent of acres from father to son was to him so holy a thing that he was roused to unexpected energies he was so far successful that mr daniel caldigate did write a long letter to his son in which he offered to annul the whole proceeding your uncle accuses me of injustice he said i have not been unjust but there is no reason whatever why the arrangement should stand even if the money has been paid to davis i will bear that loss rather than you should think that i have taken advantage of you in your troubles but john caldigate was too firm and too determined for such retrogression the money had been paid to davis and other monies had been used in other directions he was quite contented with the bargain and would certainly adhere to it  then came the last night before their departure the evening before the day on which they were to go from pollington to london and from london to plymouth all the heavy packages and all the clothes had of course been put on board the goldfinder in the london docks the pleasant task of preparation was at an end and they were now to go forth upon their hard labours caldigate had become so intimate with the family that it seemed as though a new life had sprung up for him and that as he had parted from all that he then had of a family at folking he was now to break away from new ties under the doctors roof they had dined early and at ten oclock there was what mrs shand called a little bit of supper they were all of them high in heart and very happytestifying their affection to the departing ones by helping them to the nicest bits and by filling their tumblers the fullest how it happened no one could have said but it did happen that before the evening was over maria and caldigate were together in a little room behind the front parlour what still remained of their luggage was collected there and this last visit had probably been made in order that the packages might be once more counted  it does seem so odd that you should be going she said  it is so odd to me that i should ever have come  we had always heard of you since dick went to cambridge  i knew that there were so many of you and that was all brothers never talk of their sisters i suppose but i seem to know you now so well you have been so kind to me  because you are dicks friend  i didnt suppose that it was anything else  thats not nice of you mr caldigate you know that we are all very fond of you we shall be so anxious to hear you will be good to him wont you  and he to me i hope  i think you are steadier than he is and can do more for him than he can for you i wonder shall we ever see each other again mr caldigate  why not  new south wales is so far and you will both marry there and then you will not want to come back i hope i may live to see dear dick again some day  but only dick  and you too if you would care about it  of course i should care about it he said and as he said so of course he put his arm round her waist and kissed her it did not mean much she did not think it meant much but it gave a little colouring of romance to that special moment of her life he when he went up to his bed declared to himself that it meant nothing at all he still had those large eyes clear before him and was still fixed in his resolution to come back for them when some undefined point of his life should have passed by  now said dick shand as they were seated together in a thirdclass railway carriage on the following morning now i feel that i am beginning life  with proper resolutions i hope as to honesty sobriety and industry  with a fixed determination to make a fortune and come back and be facile princeps among all the shands i have already made up my mind as to the sum i will give each of the girls and the way i will start the two younger boys in business in the meantime let us light a pipe     chapter v  the goldfinder    there is no peculiar life more thoroughly apart from life in general more unlike our usual life more completely a life of itself governed by its own rules and having its own roughnesses and amenities than life on board ship what tender friendship it produces and what bitter enmities how completely the society has formed itself into separate sets after the three or four first days how thoroughly it is acknowledged that this is the aristocratic set and that the plebeian how determined are the aristocrats to admit no intrusion and how anxious are the plebeians to intrude then there arises the great demagogue who heads a party having probably been disappointed in early lifethat is in his first endeavours on board the ship and the women have to acknowledge all their weaknesses and to exercise all their strength it is a bad time for them on board ship if they cannot secure the attention of the menas it is in the other world but in order that they may secure it they assume indifference they assume indifference but are hard at work with their usual weapons the men can do very well by themselves for them there is drinking smoking cards and various games but the potency of female spells soon works upon them and all who are worth anything are more or less in love by the end of the first week of course it must all come to an end when the port is reached that is understood though there may sometimes be mistakes most pathetic secrets are told with the consciousness that they will be forgotten as soon as the ship is left and there is the whole day for these occupations no work is required from any one the lawyer does not go to his court nor the merchant to his desk paterfamilias receives no bills materfamilias orders no dinners the daughter has no household linen to disturb her the son is never recalled to his books there is no parliament no municipality no vestry there are neither rates nor taxes nor rents to be paid the government is the softest despotism under which subjects were ever allowed to do almost just as they please that the captain has a power is known but hardly felt he smiles on all is responsible for everything really rules the world submitted to him from the setting of the sails down to the frying of the chops and makes one fancy that there must be something wrong with men on shore because firstclass nations cannot be governed like firstclass ships  the goldfinder had on board her over a hundred firstclass passengers and nearly as many of the second class the life among them was much of the same kind though in the second class there was less of idleness less of pleasure and something more of an attempt to continue the ordinary industry of life the women worked more and the men read more than their richer neighbours but the lovemaking and the fashion and the mutiny against the fashion were the same in one set as in the other our friends were at first subjected to an inconvenience which is always felt in such a position they were known to have had saloon rather than secondclass antecedents everybody had heard that they had been at cambridge and therefore they were at first avoided and as they themselves were determined not to seek associates among their more aristocratic neighbours they were left to themselves and solitary for some few days but this was a condition not at all suited to dick shands temperament and it was not long before he had made both male and female acquaintances  have you observed that woman in the brown straw hat dick said to caldigate one morning as they were leaning together on the forepart of the vessel against one of the pens in which the fowls were kept they were both dressed according to the parts they were acting and which they intended to act as secondclass passengers and future working miners any one knowing in such matters would have seen that they were overdressed for the real miner when he is away from his work puts on his best clothes and endeavours to look as little rough as possible and all this had no doubt been seen and felt and discounted among our friends fellowpassengers  i have seen her every day of course said caldigate and have been looking at her for the last half hour  she is looking at us now  she seems to me to be very attentive to the stocking she is mending  just a womans wiles at this moment she cant hear us but she knows pretty nearly what we are saying by the way our lips are going have you spoken to her  i did say a word or two to her yesterday  what did she say  i dont recollect especially she struck me as talking better than her gown if you know what i mean  she talks a great deal better than her gown said dick i dont quite know what to make of her she says that she is going out to earn her bread but when i asked her how she either couldnt or wouldnt answer me she is a mystery and mysteries are always worth unravelling i shall go to work and unravel her  at that moment the female of whom they were speaking got up from her seat on one of the spars which was bound upon the deck folded up her work and walked away she was a remarkable woman and certainly looked to be better than her gown which was old and common enough caldigate had observed her frequently and had been much struck by the word or two she had spoken to him on the preceding day i should like shiplife well enough she had said in answer to some ordinary question if it led to nothing else  you would not remain here for ever  certainly if i could there is plenty to eat and a bed to sleep on and no one to be afraid of and though nobody knows me everybody knows enough of me not to think that i ought to be taken to a police office because i have not gloves to my hands  dont you think it wearisome he had asked  everything is wearisome but here i have a proud feeling of having paid my way to have settled in advance for your dinner for six weeks to come is a magnificent thing if i get too tired of it i can throw myself overboard you cant even do that in london without the police being down upon you the only horror to me here is that there will so soon be an end to it  at that time he had not even heard her name or known whether she were alone or joined to others then he had inquired and a female fellowpassenger had informed him that she was a mrs smiththat she had seen better days but had been married to a neerdowell husband who had drank himself to death within a year of their marriage and that she was now going out to the colony probablyso the old lady said who was the informantin search of a second husband she was to some extent the old lady said in charge of a distant relative who was then on board with a respectable husband and children and who was very much ashamed of her poor connection so much john caldigate had heard  though he had heard this he did not feel inclined to tell it all to dick shand dick had professed his intention of unravelling the mystery but caldigate almost thought that he would like to unravel it himself the woman was so constantly alone and then though she was illdressed untidy almost unkempt on occasions still through it all there was something attractive about her there was a brightness in her eye and a courage about her mouth which had made him think that in spite of her appearance she would be worth his attentionjust for the voyage when he had been speaking to herself they had been on the deck together and it had been dusk and he had not been able to look her in the face but while shand had been speaking to him he had observed that she was very comely and this was the more remarkable because it seemed to him to be so evident that she made the worst rather than the best of herself she was quite a young womanprobably he thought not more than three or four and twenty and she was there with many young men round her and yet she made no effort to attract attention when his eye had fallen upon her she had generally been quite alone doing some piece of coarse and ordinary work  i have had another conversation with her said shand to him that night  have you unravelled the mystery  not quite but i have got the fact that there is a mystery she told me that you and i and she herself ought not to be here when i asked her why she said that you and i ought to be gentlemen and that she ought to be a lady i told her that you and i were gentlemen in spite of our trousers ah she said there comes the difference im not a lady any longer when i contradicted her she snubbed me and said that i hadnt seen enough of the world to know anything about it but ill have it all out of her before ive done  for some days after that caldigate kept himself aloof from mrs smith not at all because he had ceased to notice her or to think about her but from a feeling of dislike to exhibit rivalry with his friend shand was making himself very particular and he thought that shand was a fool for his pains he was becoming angry with shand and had serious thoughts of speaking to him with solemn severity what could such a woman be to him but at the bottom of all this there was something akin to jealousy the woman was goodlooking and certainly clever and was very interesting shand for two or three evenings running related his success how mrs smith had communicated to him the fact that she utterly despised those cromptons who were distant cousins of her late husbands and with whom she had come on board how she preferred to be alone to having aught to do with them how she had one or two books with her and passed some hours in reading and how she was poor very poor but still had something on which to live for a few weeks after landing but caldigate fancied that there must be a betrayal of trust in these revelations and though he was in truth interested about the woman did not give much encouragement to his friend  upon my word he said i dont seem to care so very much about mrs smiths affairs  i do said shand who was thickskinned and irrepressible i declared my intention of unravelling the mystery and i mean to do it  i hope you are not too inquisitive  of course she likes to have some one to whom she can talk and what can people talk about on board ship except themselves a woman who has a mystery always likes to have it unravelled what else is the good of a mystery  he was thickskinned and irrepressible but caldigate endeavoured to show his displeasure he felt that the poor woman was in coarse hands and he thought that had matters gone otherwise he might have accepted in a more delicate manner so much confidence as she chose to vouchsafe  so it was when they had been a fortnight at sea they had left home in midwinter but now they were in the tropics near the line and everything was sultry sleepy and warm flyingfishes were jumping from the waves on to the deck and when the dusk of night was come the passengers would stand by the hour together watching the phosphorus on the water the southern cross had shown itself plainly and possessed the heavens in conjunction with the bear the thick woollen drawers which had been so carefully prepared were no longer in use and men were going about in light pantaloons and linen jacketsthose on the quarterdeck at first beautifully clean and white while our friends of the second cabin were less careful the women too had got quit of their wraps and lounged about the deck in light attire during the bright hours of the day the aristocrats in the stern were shrouded from the sun by a delightful awning but forward the passengers sought the shade of the loose idle sails or screened themselves from the fierce rays as best they might among the hatchways and woodwork but it was when the burning sun had hidden himself when the short twilight had disappeared and the heavens were alive and alight with stars that all the world of the ship would be crowded on the upper deck there they would remain long after the lamps below had been extinguished some of them sleeping through the whole night in the comparative coolness of the air but it was from eight when tea would be over till midnight that the hum of voices would be thickest and the tread of those who walked for their exercise the most frequent  at such times caldigate would be often alone for though he had made acquaintances and had become indeed intimate with some of those around him he had never thrust himself into the life of the ship as shand had done charades were acted in the second cabin in which shand always took partand there were penny readings at which shand was often the reader and he smoked much and drank somewhat with those who smoked and drank the awe at first inspired by his university superiority and supposed rank in the world had faded almost into nothing but by caldigate unconsciously much of this had been preserved i am not sure that he did not envy his friend but at any rate he stood aloof and in regard to mrs smith when he saw her walking one evening with shand in the sweetly dim light of the evening with her hand upon shands arm he made up his mind that he would think no more about her  they had been at sea just a fortnight when this happened and in about a quarter of an hour after this resolve had been formed mrs smith was standing by him and talking to him a ball was being held on the quarterdeck or rather as there was in truth no quarterdeck to the goldfinder on that clean large luxurious expanse devoted to the aristocracy in the afterpart of the vessel from among the secondclass passengers two fiddlers and a flute player had been procured who formed the band at sea you have always to look for your musicians among the secondclass passengers and now under the awning young and old were standing up and making themselves happy beneath the starlight and the glimmer of the dozen shiplamps which had been hung around on board ship there are many sources of joy of which the land knows nothing you may flirt and dance at sixty and if you are awkward in the turn of a valse you may put it down to the motion of the ship you need wear no gloves and may drink your sodaandbrandy without being ashamed of it  it was not for john caldigate to join the mazes of that dance though he would have liked it well and was well fitted by skill and taste for such exercise but the ground was hallowed on which they trod and forbidden to him and though there was probably not a girl or a dancing married woman there who would not have been proud to stand up with mr caldigate of folking there was not one who would have dared to take the hand of a secondclass passenger so he stood just within his own boundary and looked and longed then there was a voice in his ear do you dance mr caldigate  it was a very pleasant voice low but distinct and silvery infinitely better again than the gown a voice so distinct and wellmanaged that it would have been noticed for its peculiar sweetness if coming from any highbred lady he turned round and found her face close to his why had she come to speak to him when she must have perceived that he had intentionally avoided her  i used to be very fond of dancing he said but it is one of the things that have gone away  i too was fond of dancing but as you say it has gone away it will come back to you in halfadozen years perhaps it can never come back to me things do come back to men  why more than to women  you have a resurrectioni mean here upon earth we never have though we live as long as you the pleasureseeking years of our lives are much shorter we burst out into full flowering early in our spring but long before the summer is over we are no more than huddled leaves and thick stalks  are you a thick stalk mrs smith  unfortunately not my flowers are gone while my stalk is still thin and sensitive and then women cant recuperate  i dont quite know what that means  yes you do it is good english enough even for cambridge by this time if you had made a false step got into debt and ran away or mistaken another mans wife for your own or disappeared altogether under a cloud for a while you could retrieve your honour and sinking at twentyfive or thirty could come up from out of the waters at thirtyfive as capable of enjoyment and almost as fresh as ever but a woman does not bear submersion she is draggled ever afterwards she must hide everything by a life of lies or she will get no admittance anywhere the man is rather the better liked because he has sown his wild oats broadly of all these ladies dancing there which dances the best there is not one who really knows how to dance     chapter vi  mrs smith    she had changed the conversation so suddenly rushing off from that great question as to the condition of women generally to the very unimportant matter of the dancing powers of the ladies who were manoeuvring before them that caldigate hardly knew how to travel with her so quickly they all dance well enough for ship dancing he replied but as to what you were saying about women  no mr caldigate they dont dance well enough for ship dancing dancing wherever it be done should be graceful a woman may at any rate move her feet in accordance with time and she need not skip nor prance nor jump even on board ship look at that stout lady  mrs callander  everybody by this time knew everybodys name  if she is mrs callander  mrs smith no doubt knew very well that it was mrs callander  does not your ear catch separately the thud of her footfall every time she comes to the ground  she is fat fair and forty  fat enoughand what she lacks in fairness may be added on to the forty but if she were less ambitious and had a glimmer of taste she might do better than that you see that girl with the green scarf round her she is young and goodlooking why should she spring about like a bear on a hot iron  you should go and teach them  it is just what i should like only they would not be taught and i should be stern and tell them the truth  why dont you go and dance with them yourself  i  why not there is one secondclass lady there this was true for though none of the men would have been admitted from the inferior rank to join the superior the rule of demarcation had so far been broken that a pretty girl who was known to some of the firstclass passengers had been invited to come over the line and join the amusements of the evening she dances about as well as any of them  if you were among them would you dare to come out and ask me to join them that is a question which you wont even dare to answer  it is a little personal  no you ought to say i could not do that because your clothes are so poor and because of your ragged old hat and i am not quite sure that your shoes are fit to be seen is not that what you would say if you said what you thought  perhaps it is  and if you said all that you thought perhaps you would remind me that a woman of whom nobody knows anything is always held to be disreputable that girl no doubt has her decent belongings i have nobody  you have your friends on board  no i have not i have not a single friend on board those cromptons were very unwillingly persuaded to take a sort of interest in me though they really know nothing about me and i have already lost any good which might come from their protection she told me yesterday that i ought not to walk about with mr shand  and what did you say  of course i told her to mind her own business i had no alternative a woman has to show a little spirit or she will be trodden absolutely into the dirt it was something to have a woman to speak to even though i had not a thought in common with herthough she was to my feeling as inferior to myself as i no doubt am thought to be by that fat prancing woman to herself even mrs cromptons countenance was of value but if i had yielded she would have taken it out in tyranny so now we dont speak  that is a pity  it is a pity you watch them all and see how they look at methe women i mean they know that mr shand speaks to me and that you and mr shand are the two gentlemen we have among us there are no doubt a dozen of them watching me now somewhere and denouncing me for the impropriety of my behaviour  is it improper  what do you think  why may we not talk as well as others  exactly but there are people who are tabooed look at that miss green and the ship doctor at that moment the ships doctor and the young lady in question came close to them in the dance there is no harm in miss green talking by the hour together with the doctor because she is comfortably placed she has got an old father and mother on board who dont look after her and everything is respectable but if i show any of the same propensities i ought almost to be put into irons  has anybody else been harsh to you  the captain has been making inquiriesno doubt with the idea that he may at last be driven to harsh measures have you got a sister  no  or a mother  no  or a housemaid  not even a housemaid i have no female belongings whatever  dont you know that if you had a sister and a mother and a housemaid your mother would quite expect that your sister should in time have a lover but that she would be horrified at the idea of the housemaid having a follower  i did not know that i thought housemaids got married sometimes  human nature is stronger than tyranny  but what does all this mean you are not a housemaid and you have not got a mistress  not exactly but at presentif i say my outward woman youll know what i mean perhaps  i think i shall  well my present outward woman stands to me in lieu of the housemaids broom and the united authority of the captain and mrs crompton make up the mistress between them and the worst of it all is that though i have to endure the tyranny i have not got the follower it is as hard upon mr shand as it is upon me  shand i suppose can take care of himself  no doubtand so in real truth can i i can stand apart and defy them all and as i look at them looking at me and almost know with what words they are maligning me i can tell myself that they are beneath me and that i care nothing for them i shall do nothing which will enable any one to interfere with me but it seems hard that all this should be so because i am a widowand because i am aloneand because i am poorly clothed  as she said this there were tears in her eyes true ones and something of the sound of a broken sob in her voice and caldigate was moved the womans condition was to be pitied whether it had been produced with or without fault on her own part to be alone is always sadeven for a man but for a woman and for a young woman it is doubly melancholy of a sudden the dancing was done and the lamps were taken away  if you do not want to go to bed he said let us take a turn  i never go to bed i mean here on board ship i linger up on deck half hiding myself about the place till i see some quartermaster eying me suspiciously and then i creep down into the little hole which i occupy with three of mrs cromptons children and then i cry myself to sleep but i dont call that going to bed  take a turn now  i shall feel like the housemaid talking to her follower through the areagate but she is brave and why should i be a coward then she put her hand upon his arm and you she said why are not you dancing in the other part of the ship with mrs callander and miss green instead of picking your way among the hencoops here with me  this suited my pocket bestand my future prospects  you are making a delightful experiment in roughing itas people eat picnic dinners out in the woods occasionally so that there may be a break in the monotony of chairs and tables  while shand had been unravelling her mystery she perhaps had been more successful in unravelling his  we intend to be miners  and to return home before long with some vast treasure i hope you may be successful  you seem to doubt it  of course it is doubtful if not the thing would be common and hardly worth the doing will mr shand be very persistent as a working miner  i hope so  he seems to me to have great gifts of idleness which on board ship are a blessing how i do envy men when i see them smoking it seems to me that nothing is wanting to them women have their needlework but though they hate it less than idleness they do hate it but you really like your tobacco  i dont like being idle i read a good deal do you read  i have but few books here i have read more perhaps than most young women of my age i came away in such a hurry that i have almost nothing with me  can i lend you books  if you will i will promise to take care of them  i have the heartbroken one by spratt you know it is very absurd but full of life from beginning to end all that spratt writes is very lively  i dont think i care for spratt he may be lively but hes not lifelike  and michael bamfold it is hard work perhaps but very thoughtful if you can digest that sort of thing  i hate thought  what do you say to miss bouveries lastridden to a standstill a little loud perhaps but very interesting or green grow the rushes o by mrs tremaine none of mrs tremaines people do anything that anybody would do but they all talk well  i hate novels written by women their girls are so unlovely and their men such absurdly fine fellows  i have william coxes lock picked at last of which i will defy you to find the secret till you have got to the end of it  i am a great deal too impatient  and thompsons four marquises that wont give you any trouble because you will know it all from the first chapter  and never have a moment of excitement from the beginning to the end i dont think i care very much for novels have you nothing else  caldigate had many other books a shakespeare some lighter poetry and sundry heavier works of which he did not wish specially to speak lest he should seem to be boasting of his own literary taste but at last it was settled that on the next morning he should supply her with what choice he had among the poets then at about midnight they parted and caldigate as he found his way down to his cabin saw the quartermaster with his eye fixed upon mrs smith there is no so stern guardian of morality and propriety as your old quartermaster on board a firstclass ship  you have been having a grand time of it with mrs smith said shand as soon as caldigate was in their cabin  pretty wellas far as fine times go on board ship is there anything against it  oh no not that i know of i started the hare if you choose to run it i have no right to complain i suppose  i dont know anything about the hare but you certainly have no right to complain because i have been talking to mrs smithunless indeed you tell me that you are going to make her mrs shand  you are much more likely to make her mrs caldigate  i dont know that i should have any objectionthat is if i wanted a wife she is goodlooking clever welleducated and would be wellmannered were it not that she bristles up against the illusage of the world too roughly  i didnt know it had gone so far as that said shand angrily  nor did i till you suggested it to me now i think ill go to sleep if you please and dream about it  he did not go to sleep but lay awake half thinking and half dreaming he certainly liked mrs smith but then as he had begun to find out of himself he liked womens society generally he was almost jealous of the doctor because the doctor was allowed to talk to miss green and waltz with miss green whereas he could not approach her then he thought of maria shand and that kiss in the little back parlourthe kiss which had not meant much but which had meant something and then of julia babington to whom he was not quite sure that he ought not to feel himself engaged but the face that was clearest to him of alland which became the dearer the nearer that he approached to a state of dozingwas that of hester bolton whose voice he had hardly heard who had barely spoken to himthe tips of whose fingers he had only just touched if there was any one thing fixed on his mind it was that as soon as he had put together a large lump of gold he would go back to cambridge and win hester bolton to be his wife but yet what a singular woman was this mrs smith as to marrying her that of course had been a joke produced by the petulance of his snoring friend he began to dislike shand because he did snore so loudly and drank so much bottled ale and smelt so strongly of cavendish tobacco mrs smith was at any rate much too good for shand surely she must have been a lady or her voice would not have been sweet and silvery and though she did bristle roughly against the illusage of the world and say strong things she was never absolutely indelicate or even loud and she was certainly very interesting how did it come to pass that she was so completely alone so poor so unfriended and yet possessed of such gifts there certainly was a mystery and it would certainly be his fate and not the fate of dick shand to unravel it the puzzle was much too delicate and too intricate for dick shands rough hands then giving his last waking thoughts for a moment to hester bolton he went to sleep in spite of the snoring  on the next morning as soon as he was out of bed he opened a small portmanteau in which he had put up some volumes the day before he left pollington and to which he had not yet had recourse since the beginning of the voyage from these he would select one or two for the use of his new friend so he dragged out the valise from beneath the berth while shand abused him for the disturbance he made on the top lying on the other volumes which were as he had placed them was a little book prettily bound by no means new which he was sure had never been placed there by himself he took it up and standing in the centre of the cabin between the light of the porthole and dicks bed he examined it it was a copy of thomsons seasons and on the flyleaf was written in a girls hand the name of its late ownermaria shand the truth flashed upon him at once she must have gone down on that last night after he was in bed and thus have made her little offering in silence knowing that it would be hidden from him till he was far away from her  what book is that said shand suddenly emerging with his head and shoulders from the low berth  a book of mine said caldigate disconcerted for the moment  what are you going to do with it  i am looking for something to lend to mrs smith  that is mollys thomsons seasons said the brother remembering as we are so apt to remember the old thing that had met his eye so often in the old house where did you get it  i didnt steal it dick  i dont suppose you did but im sure its the book i say  no doubt it is if you think it is in bad hands shall i give it back to you  i dont want it if she gave it you she was a fool for her pains  i dont see that  i would rather at any rate that you would not lend a book with my sisters name in it to mrs smith  i was not thinking of doing so she wants a shakespeare that i have got here and a volume of tennyson then dick retreated back into his berth and snored again while caldigate dressed himself when that operation was completedwhich including his lavations occupied about five minuteshe went up on the deck with the books for mrs smith in his hand and with thomsons seasons in his pocket so the poor girl had absolutely stolen downstairs in the middle of the cold night and had opened the case and refastened it in order that he when in strange lands might find himself in possession of something that had been hers  he had not been alone a minute or two and was looking about to see if mrs smith was there when he was accosted by the captain the captain was a pleasantlooking handsome man about fortyfive years of age who had the good word of almost everybody on board but who had not before spoken specially to caldigate  good morning mr caldigate i hope you find yourself fairly comfortable where you are  pretty well thank you captain  if there is anything i can do  we have all that we have a right to expect  i wish mr caldigate i could invite you and your friends to come astern among us sometimes but it would be contrary to rule  i can quite understand that captain  you are doing a bit of roughingno doubt for the sake of experience if you only knew the sort of roughing ive had in my time  i dare say  salt pork and hard biscuit and only half enough of that you find yourself among some queer fellowpassengers i dare say mr caldigate  everybody is very civil  theyre sure to be that to a gentleman but one has to be careful the women are the most dangerous then the captain laughed as though it had only been a jokethis allusion to the women but caldigate knew that there was more than a joke in it the captain had intended to warn him against mrs smith     chapter vii  the three attempts    something more than a month had gone by and john caldigate and mrs smith were very close companions this had not been effected without considerable opposition partly on the part of shand and partly by the ships inhabitants generally the inhabitants of the ship were inimical to mrs smith she was a woman who had no friends and the very female who had first appeared as a friend was now the readiest to say hard things of her and caldigate was a handsome wellmannered young man by this time all the ladies in the firstclass knew very well who he was and some of them had spoken to him on one or two occasions the stern law of the vessel had been broken and he had been absolutely invited to sit on those august afterbenches he was known to be a gentleman and believed on the evidence of dick shand to be possessed of considerable means it was therefore a thing horrible to all of them and particularly to miss green that he should allow himself to be enticed into difficulties by such a creature as that mrs smith miss green had already been a little cold to the doctor in consequence of a pleasant halfhour spent by her in caldigates company as they looked over the side of the vessel at the flyingfish mrs callander had been with them and everything had been quite proper but what a pity it was that he should devote so much of his time to that woman fancy his condition if he should be induced to marry her said miss green holding up her hands in horror the idea was so terrible that mrs callander declared that she would speak to him nobody ever disliked interfering so much as i do said mrs callander but sometimes a word from a lady will go so far with a young man mrs callander was a most respectable woman whose father had begun life as a cattle drover in the colonies but had succeeded in amassing a considerable fortune oh i do wish that something may be done to save him said miss green  among the secondclass passengers the same feeling existed quite as strongly the woman herself had not only been able but had been foolish enough to show that in spite of her gown she considered herself superior to them all when it was found that she was in truth handsome to look uponthat her words were soft and well chosenthat she could sit apart and readand that she could trample upon mrs crompton in her scornthen for a while there were some who made little efforts to get into her good graces she might even have made an ally of goodnatured mrs bones the wife of the butcher who was going out with his large family to try his fortune at melbourne mrs bones had been injured after some ship fashion by mrs crompton and would have made herself pleasant but mrs smith had despised them all and had shown her contempt and was now as deeply suspected by mrs bones as by mrs crompton or mrs callander  but of all the foes to this intimacy dick shand was for a time the most bitter and the most determined no doubt this arose at first from jealousy he had declared his purpose of unravelling the mystery but the task had been taken out of his hands and the unravelling was being done by another and the more that the woman was abused and the more intent were all the people in regard to her wicked determination to be intimate with caldigate the more interesting she became dick who was himself the very imp of imprudencewho had never been deterred from doing anything he fancied by any glimmer of controlwould have been delighted to be the hero of all the little stories that were being told but as that morsel of bread had been taken as it were from between his very teeth by the unjustifiable interference of his friend he had become more alive than any one else to the danger of the whole proceeding he acknowledged to the captain that his friend was making a fool of himself and though he was a little afraid of caldigate he resolved upon interfering  dont you think you are making an ass of yourself about this woman he said  i daresay i am  well  all the wise men from david downwards have made asses of themselves about women and why should i be wiser than the rest  thats nonsense you know  very likely  i am trying to talk to you in earnest  you make such a failure of it old boy that i am compelled to talk nonsense in return the idea of your preaching here i am with nothing special to do and i like to amuse myself ought not that to be enough for you  but what is to be the end of it dick shand asked very solemnly  how can i tell but the absurdity is that such a man as you should talk about the end of anything did you ever look before you leaped in your life  we are to be together you know and it wont do for us to be hampered with that woman  wont it then let me tell you that if i choose to hamper myself with that woman or with a whole harem of women and am not deterred by any consideration for myself i certainly shall not be deterred by any consideration for you do you understand me  that is not being a true partner said shand  im quite sure of thisthat im likely to be as true as you are im not aware that i have entered into any terms with you by which i have bound myself to any special mode of living i have left england as i fancy you have done also because i desired more conventional freedom than one can find among the folk at home and now on the first outset i am to be cautioned and threatened by you because i have made acquaintance with a young woman of all the moral pastors and masters that one might come across in the world you dick shand appear to me to be the most absurd but you are so far right as this that if my conduct is shocking to you you had better leave me to my wickedness  you are always so d upsetting said dick that no one can speak to you then dick turned away and there was nothing more said about mrs smith on that occasion  the next to try her hand was mrs callander by this time the passengers had become familiar with the ship and knew what they might and what they might not do the secondclass passengers were not often found intruding across the bar but the firstclass frequently made visits to their friends amidships in this way mrs callander had become acquainted with our two goldseekers and often found herself in conversation with one or the other even miss green as has been stated before would come and gaze upon the waves from the inferior part of the deck  what a very nice voyage we are having mr caldigate mrs callander said one afternoon  yes indeed it is getting a little cold now but we shall enjoy that after all the heat  quite so only i suppose it will be very cold when we get quite south you still find yourself tolerably comfortable  i shall be glad to have it over said caldigate who had in truth become disgusted with dicks snoring  i daresayi am sure we shall my young people are getting very tired of it children when they are accustomed to every comfort on shore of course feel it grievously i suppose you are rather crowded  of course we are crowded one cant have a twentyfoot square room on board ship  no indeed but then you are with your friend and that is much pleasanter than a stranger  that would depend on whether the stranger snored mrs callander  dont talk of snoring mr caldigate if you only heard mr callander but as i was saying you must have some very queer characters down there she had not been saying anything of the kind but she found a difficulty in introducing her subject  take them altogether they are a very decent pleasant wellmannered set of people and all of them in earnest about their future lives  poor creatures but i dare say theyre very good then she paused a moment and looked into his face she had undertaken a duty and she was not the woman to shrink from it so she told herself at that moment and yet she was very much afraid of him as she saw the squareness of his forehead and the set of his mouth and there was a frown across his brow as though he were preparing himself to fight you must have found it hard to accommodate yourselves to them mr caldigate  not at all  of course we all know that you are a gentleman  i am much obliged to you but i do not know any word that requires a definition so much as that i am going to work hard to earn my bread and i suppose these people are going to do the same  there always will be some danger in such society said mrs callander  i hope i may escape any great evil  i hope so too mr caldigate you probably have had a long roll of ancestors before you  we all have thatback to adam  ah but i mean a family roll of which you ought to be proudall ladies and gentlemen  upon my word i dont know  so i hear and i have no doubt it is true then she paused looking again into his face it was very square and his lips were hard and there was a gleam of anger in his eyes she wished herself back again in her own part of the ship but she had boasted to miss green that she was not the woman to give up a duty when she had undertaken it though she was frightened still she must go on i hope you will excuse me mr caldigate  i am sure you will not say anything that i cannot excuse  dont you think then she paused she had looked into his face again and was so little satisfied that she did not dare to go on he would not help her in the least but stood there looking at her with something of a smile stealing over the hardness of his face but with such an expression that the smile was even worse than the hardness  were you going to speak to me about another lady mrs callander  i was that is what i was going to speak of  she was anxious to remonstrate against that word lady but her courage failed her  then dont you think that perhaps you had better leave it alone i am very much obliged to you and all that kind of thing and as to myself i really shouldnt care what you said any good advice would be taken most gratefullyif it didnt affect any one else but you might say things of the lady in question which i shouldnt bear patiently  she cant be your equal  i wont hear even that patiently you know nothing about her except that she is a secondclass passengerin which matter she is exactly my equal if you come to that dont you think that you are degrading yourself in coming here and talking to me i am not your equal  but you are  and so is she then we shant arrive at anything mrs callander and so you had better give it up whereupon she did give it up and retreat to her own part of the ship but not with a very good grace  they had certainly become very intimatejohn caldigate and mrs smith and there could be no doubt that in the ordinary language of the world he was making a fool of himself he did in fact know nothing about her but what she told herself and this amounted to little more than three statements which might or might not be truethat she had gone on the stage in opposition to her friendsthat she had married an actor who had treated her with great crueltyand that he had died of drink and with each of these stories there had been an accompaniment of mystery she had not told him her maiden name nor what had been the condition of her parents nor whether they were living nor at what theatres she and her husband had acted nor when he had died she had expressed a hope that she might get an engagement in the colonies but she had not spoken of any recommendation or letters of introduction he simply knew of her that her name was euphemia smith  in that matter of her clothes there had been a great improvement but made very gradually she had laughed at her own precautions saying that in her poverty she had wished to save everything that could be saved and that she had only intended to make herself look like others in the same class and i had wanted to avoid all attentionat first she said smiling as she looked up at him  in which you have been altogether unsuccessful he replied as you are certainly more talked about than any one in the ship  has it been my fault she asked  then he comforted her saying that it certainly had not been her fault that she had been reticent and reserved till she had been either provoked or invited to come forth and in fact that her conduct had been in all respects feminine pretty and decorousas to all which he was not perhaps the best judge in the world  but she was certainly much pleasanter to look at and even to talk to now that she had put on a small clean black felt hat instead of the broken straw and had got out from her trunks a pretty warm shawl and placed a ribbon or two about her in some indescribable manner and was no longer ashamed of showing her shoes as she sat about upon the deck there could be no doubt as she was seen now that she was the most attractive female on board the ship but it may be doubted whether the anger of the mrs cromptons mrs callanders and miss greens was mitigated by the change the battle against her became stronger and the duty of rescuing that infatuated young man from her sorceries was more clear than everif only anything could be done to rescue him  what could be done mrs smith could not be locked up no onenot even the captaincould send her down to her own wretched little cabin because she would talk with a gentleman talking is allowed on board ship and even flirting to a certain extent mrs smiths conduct with mr caldigate was not more peculiar than that of miss green and the doctor only it pleased certain people to think that miss green might be fond of the doctor if she chose and that mrs smith had no right to be fond of any man there was a stubbornness about both the sinners which resolved to set public opinion at defiance the very fact that others wished to interfere with him made caldigate determined to resent all interference and the woman with perhaps a deeper insight into her own advantages was brave enough to be able to set opposition at defiance  they were about a week from their port when the captaincaptain mundaywas induced to take the matter into his own hands it is hardly too much to say that he was pressed to do so by the united efforts of the firstclass passengers it was dreadful to think that this unfortunate young man should go on shore merely to become the prey of such a woman as that so captain munday who at heart was not afraid of his passengerbut who persisted in saying that no good could be done and who had as may be remembered already made a slight attemptwas induced to take the matter in hand he came up to caldigate on the deck one afternoon and without any preface began his business mr caldigate he said i am afraid you are getting into a scrape with one of your fellowpassengers  what do you call a scrape captain munday  i should call it a scrape if a young gentleman of your position and your prospects were to find himself engaged on board ship to marry a woman he knew nothing about  do you know anything about my position and prospects captain munday  i know you are a gentleman  and i think you know less about the lady  i know nothingbut i will tell you what i hear  i really would rather that you did not of course captain munday on board your own ship you are a despot and i must say that you have made everything very pleasant for us but i dont think even your position entitles you to talk to me about my private affairsor about hers you say you know nothing is it manly to repeat what one hears about a poor forlorn woman then the captain retreated without another word owning to himself that he was beaten if this foolish young man chose to make for himself a bed of that kind he must lie upon it captain munday went away shrugging his shoulders and spoke no further word to john caldigate on that or any other subject during the voyage  caldigate had driven off his persecutors valiantly and had taught them all to think that he was resolute in his purposes in regard to mrs smith let those purposes be what they might but nothing could be further from the truth for he had no purposes and was within his own mind conscious of his lack of all purpose and very conscious of his folly and though he could repel mrs callander and the captainas he had always repelled those who had attempted to control himstill he knew that they had been right such an intimacy as this could not be wise and its want of wisdom became the more strongly impressed upon him the nearer he got to shore and the more he felt that when he had got ashore he should not know how to act in regard to her  the intimacy had certainly become very close he had expressed his great admiration and she had replied that had things not been as they were she could have returned the feeling but she did not say what the things were which might have been otherwise nor did she seem to attempt to lead him on to further and more definite proposals and she never spoke of any joint action between them when on shore though she gave herself up to his society here on board the ship she seemed to think that they were then to part as though one would be going one way and one the otherbut he felt that after so close an intimacy they could not part like that     chapter viii  reaching melbourne    things went on in the same way till the night before the morning on which they were to enter hobsons bay hobsons bay as every one knows is the inlet of the sea into which the little river runs on which melbourne is built after leaving the tropics they had gone down south and had encountered showers and wind and cold weather but now they had come up again into warm latitudes and fine autumn weatherfor it was the beginning of march and the world out there is upside down before that evening nothing had been said between mrs smith and john caldigate as to any future not a word to indicate that when the journey should be over there would or that there would not be further intercourse between them she had purposely avoided any reference to a world after this world of the ship even refusing in her halfsad but halfjoking manner to discuss matters so far ahead but he felt that he could not leave her on board as he would the other passengers without a word spoken as to some future meeting there will arrive on occasions a certain pitch of intimacywhich cannot be defined as may a degree of cousinship but which is perfectly understood by the persons concernedso close as to forbid such mere shaking of the hands there are many men and perhaps more women cautious enough and wise enough to think of this beforehand and thinking of it to guard themselves from the dangerous attractions of casual companions by a composed manner and unenthusiastic conversation who does not know the sagacious lady who after sitting at table with the same gentleman for a month can say goodbye mr jones just as though mr jones had been a stranger under her notice but for a day but others gush out and when mr jones takes his departure hardly know how not to throw themselves into his arms the intercourse between our hero and mrs smith had been such that as a gentleman he could not leave her without some allusion to future meetings that was all up to the evening before their arrival the whole ships company captain officers quartermasters passengers and all were quite sure that she had succeeded in getting a promise of marriage from him but there had been nothing of the kind  among others dick shand was sure that there was some entanglement entanglement was the word he always used in discussing the matter with mrs callander between dick and his friend there had been very little confidential communication of late caldigate had forbidden shand to talk to him about mrs smith and thus had naturally closed the mans mouth on other matters and then they had fallen into different sets dick at least had fallen into a set while caldigate had hardly associated with any but the one dangerous friend dick had lived much with a bevy of noisy young men who had been given to games and smoking and to a good deal of drink caldigate had said not a word even when on one occasion dick had stumbled down into the cabin very much the worse for what he had taken how could he find fault with dicks folly when he would not allow dick to say a word to him as to his own but on this last day at sea it became necessary that they should understand each other  what do you mean to do when you land caldigate asked  all that had been settled between them very exactly long since at a town called nobble about three hundred miles west of sydney there lived a man supposed to be knowing in gold named crinkett with whom they had corresponded and to whom they intended in the first instance to apply and about twenty miles beyond nobble were the new and now much reputed ahalala diggings at which they purposed to make their first debut it had been decided that they would go direct from melbourne to nobblenot round by sydney so as to see more of the world and thus spend more moneybut by the direct route taking the railway to albury and the coaches which they were informed were running between albury and nobble and it had also been determined that they would spend but two nights in melbournejust to get their things washedso keen had they been in their determination to begin their work but on all these matters there had been no discussion now for a month nor even an allusion to them  what do you mean to do when we land caldigate asked on that last day  i thought all that was settled but i suppose you are going to change everything  i am going to change nothing only you seem to have got into such a way of life that i didnt know whether you would be prepared for serious work  i shall be as well prepared as you are i dont doubt said dick i have no impediment of any kind  i certainly have none then we will start by the first train on wednesday morning for albury we must have our heavy things sent round by sea to sydney and get them from there as best we can when we are a little fixed one of us can run down to sydney  and so it was settled without any real confidence between them but in conformity with their previous arrangements  it was on the evening of the same day after they had sighted cape otway that mrs smith and caldigate began their last conversation on board the goldfindera conversation which lasted with one or two interruptions late into the night  so we have come to the end of it she said  to the end of what  to the end of all that is pleasant and easy and safe dont you remember my telling you how i dreaded the finish here i have been fairly comfortable and have in many respects enjoyed it i have had you to talk to and there has been a flavour of old days about it what shall i be doing this time tomorrow  i dont know your plans  exactlyand i have not told you because i would not have you bothered with me when i land you have enough on your own hands and if i were to be a burden to you now it might be a serious trouble i am afraid poor mr shand objects to me  you dont think that would stand in my way  it stands in mine of course with your pride and your obstinacy you would tell mr shand to go tothe devil if he ventured to object to any little delay that might be occasioned by looking after me then mr shand would gothere or elsewhere and all your plans would be broken up and you would be without a companion  unless i had you of all the words which he could have spoken in such an emergency these were the most foolish and yet at so tender a moment how were they to be repressed  i do think that dick shand is dangerous she answered laughing but i should be worse i am afraid dick shand willdrink  if so we must part and what would you do  what would i do what could i do then there was a pause perhaps i should want you tomarry me which would be worse than dick shands drinking eh  there is an obligation on a man to persevere when a woman has encouraged him in lovemaking it is like riding at a fence when once you have set your horse at it you must go on however impracticable it may appear as you draw close to it if you have never looked at the fence at allif you have ridden quite the other way making for some safe gate or clinging to the dull lanethen there will be no excitement but also there will be no danger and no disgrace caldigate had ridden hard at the fence and could not crane at it now that it was so close to him he could only trust to his good fortune to carry him safe over i dont suppose you would want it he said but i might  you would want me but you would not want me for always i should be a burden less easy to shake off than dick shand  is that the way a man is always to look at a woman  it is the way in which they do i think i often wonder that any man is ever fool enough to marry a poor man may want some one to serve him and may be able to get service in no other way or a man poor in another way may find an heiress convenientbut otherwise i think men only marry when they are caught women are prehensile things which have to cling to something for nourishment and support when i come across such a one as you i naturally put out my feelers  i have not been aware of it  yes you are and i do not doubt that your mind is vacillating about me i am sure you like me  certainly i like you  and you know that i love you  i did not know it  yes you did you are not the man to be diffident of yourself in such a matter you must either think that i love you or that i have been a great hypocrite in pretending to do so love you they were sitting together on a large spar which was lashed on to the deck and which had served throughout all the voyage for a seat for secondclass passengers there were others now on the farther end of it but there was a feeling that when caldigate and mrs smith were together it would not be civil to intrude upon their privacy at this time it was dark but their eyes had become used to the gloom and each could see the others face love you she repeated looking up at him speaking in a very low voice but yet oh so clearly so that not a fraction of a sound was lost to his ears with no special emotion in her face with no contortion no grimace but with her eyes fixed upon his how should it be possible that i should not love you for two months we have been together as people seldom are in the worldas they never can be without hating each other or loving each other thoroughly you have been very good to me who am all alone and desolate and you are clever educatedand a man how should i not love you and i know from the touch of your hand from your breath when i feel it on my face from the fire of your eye and from the tenderness of your mouth that you too love me  i do he said  but as there may be marriage without love so there may be love without marriage you cannot but feel how little you know of me and ignorant as you are of so much that to marry me might beruin it was just what he had told himself over and over again when he had been trying to resolve what he would do in regard to her dont you know that  i know that it might have been so among the connections of home life  and to you the connections of home life may all come back that woman talked about your roll of ancestors coming from her it was absurd but there was some truth in it you know that were you to marry me say tomorrow in melbourne it would shut you out fromwell not the possibility but the probability of return  i do not want to go back  nor do i want to hinder you from doing so if we were alike desolate alike alone alike cast out oh then what a heaven of happiness i should think had been opened to me by the idea of joining myself to you there is nothing i could not do for you but i will not be a millstone round your neck  she had taken so much the more prominent part in all this that he felt himself compelled by his manliness to say something in contradiction to itsomething that should have the same flavour about it as had her selfabnegation and declared passion he also must be unselfish and enthusiastic i do not deny that there is truth in what you say  it is true  of course i love you  it ought to be of coursenow  and of course i do not mean to part from you now as though we were never to see each other again  i hope not quite that  certainly not i shall therefore hold you as engaged to me and myself as engaged to youunless something should occur to separate us it was a foolish thing to say but he did not know how to speak without being foolish it is not usual that a gentleman should ask a lady to be engaged to him unless something should occur to separate them you will consent to that he said  what i will consent to is this that i will be yours all yours whenever you may choose to send for me at any moment i will be your wife for the asking but you shall go away first and shall think of it and reflect upon itso that i may not have to reproach myself with having caught you  caught me  well yes caught you i do feel that i have caught youalmost i do feelalmostthat i ought to have had nothing to do with you from the beginning of it all i knew that i ought to have nothing to say to you you are too good for me then she rose from her place as though to leave him i will go down now she said because i know you will have many things to do tomorrow when we get up we shall be in the harbour and you will be on shore quite early there will be no time for a word of farewell then i will meet you again here just before we go to bedsay at halfpast ten then we will arrange if we can arrange how we may meet again  and so she glided away from him and he was left alone sitting on the spar now at any rate he had engaged himself there could not be any doubt about that he certainly could not be justified in regarding himself as free because she had told him that she would give him time to think of it of course he was engaged to marry her when a man has been successful in his wooing he is supposed to be happy he asked himself whether he was proud of the result of this intimacy she had told himshe herselfthat she had caught him meaning thereby that he had been taken as a rabbit with a snare or a fish with a baited hook if it had been so surely she would not herself have said so and yet he was aware how common it is for a delinquent to cover his own delinquency by declaring it of course i am idle says the idle one escaping the disgrace of his idleness by his honesty i have caught you there is something soothing to the vanity in such a declaration from a pretty woman that she should have wished to catch you is somethingsomething that the net should itself be so pleasant with its silken meshes but the declaration may not the less be true and the fact unpleasant in the matter of matrimony a man does not wish to be caught and caldigate fond as he was of her acknowledged that what she said was true  he leant back in a corner that was made by the hatchway and endeavoured to think over his life and prospects if this were a true engagement then must he cease altogether to think of hester bolton then must that dream be abandoned it is of no use to the most fervid imagination to have a castle projected in spain from which all possible foundation has been taken away in his dreams of life a man should never dream that which is altogether impossible there had been something in the thought of hester bolton which had taken him back from the roughnesses of his new life from the doubtful respectability of mrs smith from the squalor of the secondclass from the whiskyladen snores of dick shand to a sweeter brighter cleaner world till this engagement had been absolutely spoken he could still indulge in that romance distant and unreal as it was but nownow it seemed to be brought in upon him very forcibly that he must rid his thoughts of hester boltonor else rid his life of mrs smith  but he was engaged to marry mrs smith then he got up and walked backwards and forwards along the deck asking himself whether this could really be the truth was he bound to this woman for his life and if so had he done a thing of which he already repented himself he tried to persuade himself that she was admirably fitted for the life which he was fated to lead she was handsome intellectual a most delightful companion and yet capable of enduring the hardships of an adventurous uncertain career ought he not to think himself peculiarly lucky in having found for himself so eligible a companion but there is something so solemn so sacred in the name of wife a man brought up among soft things is so imbued with the feeling that his wife should be something better cleaner sweeter holier than himself that he could not but be awestruck when he thought that he was bound to marry this all but nameless widow of some drunken playerthis woman who among other women had been thought unfit for all companionship  but things arrange themselves how probable it was that he would never be married to her after all this might be but an incident and not an unpleasant incident in his life he had had his amusement out of it and she had had hers perhaps they would part to meet no more but when he thought that there might be comfort in this direction he felt that he was a scoundrel for thinking so  and this is to say goodbye twas thus she greeted him again that night goodbye  goodbye my love  my love my love and now remember this my address will be postoffice melbourne it will be for you to write to me you will not hear from me unless you do indeed i shall know nothing of you let me have a line before a month is over this he promised and then they parted  at break of day on the following morning the goldfinder rode over the rip into hobsons bay there were still four hours before the ship lay at her moorings but during all that time mrs smith was not seen by caldigate as he got into the boat which took him and shand from the ship to the pier at sandridge she kissed her hand to him over the side of the vessel before eleven oclock dick shand and his companion were comfortably put up at the miners home in flinders lane     chapter ix  nobble    during the two days which dick and caldigate spent together in melbourne mrs smiths name was not mentioned between them they were particularly civil each to the other and went to work together making arrangements at a bank as to their money taking their places despatching their luggage and sorting their belongings as though there had been no such woman as mrs smith on board the goldfinder dick though he had been inclined to grumble when his mystery had been taken out of his handswho had of course been jealous when he saw that the lady had discarded her old hat and put on new ribbons not for him but for anotherwas too conscious of the desolation to which he would be subjected by quarrelling with his friend he felt himself unable to go alone and was therefore willing that the bygones of the ship should be bygones caldigate on the other hand acknowledged to himself that he owed some reparation to his companion of course he had not bound himself to any special mode of lifebut had he in his present condition allied himself more closely to mrs smith he would to some extent have thrown dick over and then as soon as he was on shore he did feel somewhat ashamed of himself in regard to mrs smith was it not manifest that any closer alliance let the alliance be what it might must be ruinous to him as it was had he not made an absolute fool of himself with mrs smith had he not got himself already into a mess from which there was no escape of course he must write to her when the month was over the very weight of his thoughts on this matter made him tamer with dick and more observant than he would otherwise have been  they were during those two days frequently about the town looking at the various streets and buildings at the banks and churches and gardensas is usual with young men when they visit a new town but during it all caldigates mind was more intent on mrs smith than he was on the sights of the place melbourne is not so big but that she might easily have thrown herself in his way had she pleased strangers residing in such a town are almost sure to see each other before twentyfour hours are gone but mrs smith was not seen two or three times he went up and down collins street alone without his friend not wishing to see heraware that he had better not see herbut made restless by a nervous feeling that he ought to wish to see her that he should at any rate not keep out of her way but mrs smith did not show herself whatever might be her future views she did not now take steps to present herself to him i shall be so much the more bound to present myself to her he said to himself but perhaps she knows all that he added in the same soliloquy  on the wednesday morning they left melbourne by the 6 am train for albury which latter place they reached the same day about 2 pm having then crossed the murray river and passed into the colony of new south wales here they stayed but a few hours and then went on by coach on their journey to nobble from one wretched vehicle they were handed on to another never stopping anywhere long enough to go to bedthree hours at one wretched place and five at anothertravelling at the rate of six miles an hour bumping through the mud and slush of the bush roads and still going on for three days and three nights this was roughing it indeed even dick complained and said that of all the torments prepared for wicked mortals on earth this australian coaching was the worst they went through waggawagga and murrumburra and other places with similar names till at last they were told that they had reached nobble nobble they thought was the foulest place which they had ever seen it was a golddigging town as such places are called and had been built with great rapidity to supply the necessities of adjacent miners it was constructed altogether of wood but no two houses had been constructed alike they generally had gable ends opening on to the street but were so different in breadth altitude and form that it was easy to see that each enterprising proprietor had been his own architect but they were all alike in having enormous advertisementboards some high some broad some sloping on which were declared the merits of the tradesmen who administered within to the wants of mining humanity and they had generally assumed most singular names for themselves the old stickinthemud soft goods store the polyeuka stout depot number nine flour mills and so onall of which were very unintelligible to our friends till they learned that these were the names belonging to certain goldmining claims which had been opened in the neighbourhood of nobble the street itself was almost more perilous to vehicles than the slush of the foresttracks so deep were the holes and so uncertain the surface when caldigate informed the driver that they wanted to be taken as far as hennikers hotel the man said that he had given up going so far as that for the last two months the journey being too perilous so they shouldered their portmanteaus and struggled forth down the street here and there a short bit of wooden causeway perhaps for the length of three houses would assist them and then again they would have to descend into the roadway and plunge along through the mud  it is not quite as nice walking as the old quad at trinity said caldigate  it is the beastliest hole i ever put my foot in since i was born said dick who had just stumbled and nearly came to the ground with his burden they told us that nobble was a fine town  hennikers hotel was a long low wooden shanty divided into various very small partitions by thin planks in most of which two or more dirtylooking beds had been packed very closely but between these little compartments there was a long chamber containing a long and very dirty table and two long benches here were sitting a crowd of miners drinking when our friends were ushered in through the bar or counter which faced to the street at the bar they were received by a dirty old woman who said that she was mrs henniker then they were told while the convivial crowd were looking on and listening that they could have the use of one of the partitions and their grub for 7s 6d aday each when they asked for a partition apiece they were told that if they didnt like what was offered to them they might go elsewhere upon that they agreed to mrs hennikers terms and sitting down on one of the benches looked desolately into each others faces  yesit was different from trinity college different from babington very different even from the less luxurious comfort of the house at pollington the deck even the secondclass cabin of the goldfinder had been better than this and then they had no friend not even an acquaintance within some hundred miles the men around them were not uncivil australian miners never are so but they were inquisitive familiar and with their halfdrunken goodhumour almost repulsive it was about noon when our friends reached hennikers and they were told that there would be dinner at one there was always grub at one and grub at seven and grub at eight in the morning so one of the men informed them the same gentleman hoped that the strangers were not very particular as the grub though plentiful was apt to be rough of its kind  youll have it a deal worse before youve done if youre going on to ahalala said another then caldigate said that they did intend to go on to ahalala were going to have a spell at golddigging said he what was the use of making any secret of the matter we knowed that ready enough said one of the men chaps like you dont come much to nobble for nothing else have you got any money to start with  a few halfcrowns said dick cautiously  halfcrowns dont go very far here my mate if you can spend four or five pounds aweek each for the next month so as to get help till you know where you are it may be youll turn up gold at ahalalabut if not youd better go elsewhere you neednt be afraid we aint agoing to rob you of nothing  nor yet we dont want nothing to drink said another  speak for yourself jack said a third but comeas these are regular new chums i dont care if i shout for the lot myself then the dirty old woman was summoned and everybody had whisky all round when that was done another generous man came to the front and there was more whisky till caldigate was frightened as to the result  evil might have come from it had not the old woman opportunely brought the grub into the room this she chucked down on the table in such a way that the grease out of the dish spattered itself all around there was no tablecloth nor had any preparation been made but in the middle of the table there was a heap of dirty knives and forks with which the men at once armed themselves and each took a plate out of a heap that had been placed on a shelf against the wall caldigate and shand when they saw how the matter was to be arranged did as the other men the grub consisted of an enormous lump of boiled beef and a bowl of potatoes which was moderate enough in size considering that there were in all about a dozen men to be fed but there was meat enough for double the number and bread in plenty but so illmade as to be rejected by most of the men the potatoes were evidently the luxury and guided by that feeling the man who had told the strangers that they need not be afraid of being robbed at once selected six out of the bowl and deposited three each before dick and caldigate he helped the others all round to one each and then was left without any for himself i dont care a damn for that sort of tucker he said as though he despised potatoes from the bottom of his heart of all the crew he was the dirtiest and was certainly half drunk another man holloaed to mother henniker for pickles but mother henniker without leaving her seat at the bar told them to pickle themselves whereupon one of the party making some allusion to jack briens swagjack brien being absent at the momentrose from his seat and undid a great roll lying in one of the corners every miner has his swagconsisting of a large blanket which is rolled up and contains all his personal luggage out of jack briens swag were extracted two large square bottles of pickles these were straightway divided among the men care being taken that dick and caldigate should have ample shares then every man helped himself to beef as much as he would passing the dish round from one to the other when the meal was half finished mrs henniker brought in an enormous jorum of tea which she served out to all the guests in tin pannikins giving to every man a fixed and ample allowance of brown sugar without at all consulting his taste milk there was none in the midst of this jack brien came in and with a clamour of mirth the empty pickle jars were shown him jack who was a silent man and somewhat melancholy merely shook his head and ate his beef it may be presumed that he was fond of pickles having taken so much trouble to provide them but he said not a word of the injury to which he had been subjected  thems agoing to ahalala jack said the distributor of the potatoes nodding his head to indicate the two new adventurers  then theyre agoing to the most infernal mean   breakheartedest place as god almighty ever put on this arth for the perplexment of poor unfortunate   miners this was jack briens eloquence and his description of ahalala before this he had not spoken a word nor did he speak again till he had consumed three or four pounds of beef and had swallowed two pannikins of tea then he repeated his speech there isnt so   an infernal mean breakhearted a place as ahalalanot nowhere no not nowhere and so them chumsll find for theirselves if they go there then his neighbour whispered into caldigates ear that jack had gone to ahalala with fifty sovereigns in his pocket and that he wasnt now worth a red cent  but there is gold there asked caldigate  its my belief theres gold pretty much everywhere and you may find it or you maynt thats where it isand the maynts are a deal oftener turning up than the mays  a man can get work for wages suggested dick  wages whats the use of that a man as knows mining can earn wages but ahalala aint a place for wages if you want wages go to one of the oldfashioned placesbendigo or the like of that ive worked for wages but what comes of it a man goes to ahalala because he wants to run his chance and get a big haul its every one on his own bottom pretty much at ahalala  wages be  said jack brien rising from the seat and hitching up his trousers as he left the room it was very evident that jack brien was a gambler  after dinner there was a smoke and after the smoke dick shand shouted for the company dick had quite learned by this time the mystery of shouting when one man stands drinks all round he shouts and then it is no more than reciprocal that another man should do the same and in this way when the reciprocal feeling is spread over a good many drinkers a good deal of liquor is consumed  while dick shands shout was being consumed caldigate asked one of his new friends where mr crinkett lived was mr crinkett known in nobble it seemed that crinkett was very well known in nobble indeed if anybody had done well at nobble mr crinkett had done well he was the swell of the place this informant did not think that mr crinkett had himself gone very deep at ahalala mr crinkett had risen high enough in his profession to be able to achieve more certainty than could be found at such a place as ahalala by this time they were on the road to mr crinketts house this new friend having undertaken to show them the way  he can put you up to a thing or two if he likes said the new friend perhaps hes a pal of yourn  caldigate explained that he had never seen mr crinkett but that he had come to nobble armed with a letter from a gentleman in england who had once been concerned in golddigging  hes a civil enough gent is crinkett said the minerbut he do like making money they say of him theres nothing he wouldnt sellnot even his grandmothers bones i like trade myself added the miner but some of ems too sharp thats where crinkett lives hes a swell aint he  they had walked about half a mile from the town turning down a lane at the back of the house and had made their way through yawning pitholes and heaps of dirt and pools of yellow waterwhere everything was disorderly and apparently desertedtill they came to a cluster of heaps so large as to look like little hills and here there were signs of mining vitality on their way they had not come across a single shred of vegetation though here and there stood the bare trunks of a few dead and headless trees the ghosts of the forest which had occupied the place six or seven years previously on the tops of these artificial hills there were sundry ricketylooking erections and around them were troughs and sheds and rude waterworks these as the miner explained were the outward and visible signs of the worldfamous old stickinthemud claim which was now giving two ounces of gold to the ton of quartz and which was at present the exclusive property of mr crinkett who had bought out the tribute shareholders and was working the thing altogether on his own bottom as they ascended one of those mounds of upcast stones and rubble they could see on the other side the crushingmills and the enginehouse and could hear the thud thud thud of the great iron hammers as they fell on the quartzand then close beyond but still among the hillocks and surrounded on all sides by the dirt and filth of the mining operations was mr crinketts mansion and theres his very self astanding at the gate acounting how many times the hammer falls a minute and how much gold is acoming from every blow as it falls with this little observation as to mr crinketts personal character the miner made his way back to his companions     chapter x  polyeuka hall    the house which they saw certainly surprised them much and seemed to justify the assertion just before made to them that mr crinkett was a swell it was marvellous that any man should have contemplated the building of such a mansion in a place so little attractive with so many houses within view the house and little attempted garden together with the stables and appurtenances may have occupied half an acre all around it were those hideous signs of mining operations which make a country rich in metals look as though the devil had walked over it dragging behind him an enormous rake there was not a blade of grass to be seen as far as the eye could reach there stood those ghostlike skeletons of trees in all spots where the soil had not been turned up but on none of them was there a leaf left or even a branch everywhere the ground was thrown about in hideous uncovered hillocks all of which seemed to have been deserted except those in the immediate neighbourhood of mr crinketts house but close around him one could see wheels turning and long ropes moving and water running in little wooden conduits all of which were signs of the activity going on under ground and then there was the neverceasing thud thud thud of the crushingmill which from twelve oclock on sunday night to twelve oclock on saturday night never paused for a moment having the effect on that vacant day of creating a painful strain of silence upon the ears of those who were compelled to remain on the spot during the unoccupied time it was said that in mr crinketts mansion every sleeper would wake from his sleep as soon as the engine was stopped disturbed by the unwonted quiescence  but the house which had been built in this unpromising spot was quite entitled to be called a mansion it was of red brick three storeys high with white stone facings to all the windows and all the corners which glittered uncomfortably in the hot sun there was a sweep up to it the road having been made from the débris of the stone out of which the gold had been crushed but though there was the sweep up to the door carefully made for the length of a few dozen yards there was nothing that could be called a road outside though there were tracks here and there through the hillocks along which the waggons employed about the place struggled through the mud the house itself was built with a large hall in the middle and three large windows on each side on the floor there were four large rooms with kitchens opening out behind and above there were of course chambers in proportion and in the little garden there was a pond and a big bathhouse and there were coachhouses and stablesso that it was quite a mansion it was called polyeuka hall because while it was being built mr crinkett was drawing large gains from the polyeuka mine about three miles distant on the other side of nobble for the building of his mansion on this special site no one could imagine any other reason than that love which a brave man has of overcoming difficulties to endeavour to create a paradise in such a pandemonium required all the energies of a crinkett whether or not he had been successful depended of course on his own idiosyncrasies he had a wife who it is to be hoped liked her residence they had no children and he spent the greater part of his time away in other mining districts in which he had ventures when thus absent he would live as jack brien and his friends were living at mrs hennikers and was supposed to enjoy the ease of his inn more thoroughly than he did the constraint of his grand establishment  at the present moment he was at home and was standing at the gate of his domain all alone with a pipe in his mouthperhaps listening as the man had said to the noise of his own crushingmachine he was dressed in black with a chimneypot on his headand certainly did not look like a miner though he looked as little like a gentleman our friends were in what they conceived to be proper miners costume but mr crinkett knew at a glance that there was something uncommon about them as they approached he did not attempt to open the gate but awaited them looking over the top of it from the inside well my mates what can i do for you he said still remaining on his side and apparently intending that they should remain on theirs then caldigate brought forth his letter and handed it to the owner of the place across the top of the gate i think mr jones wrote to you about us before said caldigate  crinkett read the letter very deliberately perhaps he required time to meditate what his conduct should be perhaps he was not quick at reading written letters but at last he got to the end of the very few words which the note contained jones he said jones wasnt much account when he was out here  we dont know a great deal about him said dick  but when he heard that we were coming he offered us a letter to you said caldigate i believe him to be an honest man  honest well yes i daresay hes honest enough he never robbed me of nothing and shall i tell you why because i know how to take care that he dont nor yet nobody else as he said this he looked at them as though he intended that they were included among the numbers against whom he was perfectly on his guard  thats the way to live said dick  thats the way i live my friend he did write before i remember saying to myself what a pair of simpletons you must be if you was thinking of going to ahalala  we do think of going there said caldigate  the roads open to you nobody wont prevent you you can get beef and mutton there and damper and tea no doubt and what they call brandy as long as youve got the money to pay for it one wont say anything about what price theyll charge you have you got any money then caldigate made a lengthened speech in which he explained so much of their circumstances as seemed necessary he did not name the exact sum which had been left at the bank in melbourne but he did make mr crinkett understand that they were not paupers they were anxious to do something in the way of mining and particularly anxious to make money but they did not quite know how to begin could he give them a hint they meant to work with their own hands but perhaps it might be well for them at first to hire the services of some one to set them agoing  crinkett listened very patiently still maintaining his position on his own side of the gate then he spoke words of such wisdom as was in him ahalala is just the place to ease you of a little money mind i tell you gold of course theres been gold to be got there but whats been the cost of it whats been the return if sixteen hundred men among em can sell fifteen hundred pounds worth of gold a week how is each man to have twenty shillings on saturday night thats about what it is at ahalala of course theres gold and where theres gold chucked about in that way just on the surface one gets it and ten dont who is to say you maynt be the one as to hiring a man to show you the wayyou can hire a dozen as long as youll pay em ten shillings aday to loaf about you may have men enough but whether theyll show you the way to anything except the liquor store thats another thing now shall i tell you what you two gents had better do dick declared that the two gents would be very much obliged to him if he would take that trouble of course youve heard of the old stickinthemud dick told him that they had heard of that very successful mining enterprise since their arrival at nobble you ask on the veranda at melbourne or at ballarat or at sydney if they dont tell you about it my names not crinkett you put your money what youve got into tenshilling shares ill accommodate you as youre friends of jones with any reasonable number were getting two ounces to the ton the booksll show you that  we thought youd purchased out all the shareholders said caldigate  so i did and now im redividing it id rather have a company its pleasanter if you can put in a couple of thousand pounds or so between you you can travel about and see the country and your moneyll be working for you all the time did you ever see a gold mine  they owned that they never yet had been a yard below ground then he opened his gate preparatory to taking them down the old stickinthemud and brought them with him into one of the front rooms it was a large parlour only half furnished not yet papered without a carpet in which it appeared that mr crinkett kept his own belongings here he divested himself of his black clothes and put on a suit of miners garmentsreal miners garments very dirty with a slouch hat on the top of which there was a lump of mud in which to stick a candleend any one learned in the matter would immediately have known the real miner now if you like to see a mine we will go down and then you can do as you like about your money  they started forth crinkett leading the way and entered the enginehouse as they went he said not a word being aware that gold gold that they could see with their eyes in its raw condition would tempt them more surely than all his eloquence in the enginehouse the three of them got into a box or truck that was suspended over the mouth of a deep shaft and soon found themselves descending through the bowels of the earth they went down about four hundred feet and as they were reaching the bottom crinkett remarked that it was a goodish deep hole all to belong to one man yes he added as caldigate extricated himself from the truck and theres a precious lot more gold to come out of it yet i can tell you  in all the sights to be seen about the world there is no sight in which there is less to be seen than in a goldmine the two young men were made to follow their conductor along a very dirty underground gallery for about a quarter of a mile and then they came to four men working with picks in a rough sort of chamber and four others driving holes in the walls they were simply picking down the rock in doing which they were assisted by gunpowder with keen eyes crinkett searched along the roof and sides and at last showed to his companions one or two little specks which he pronounced to be gold when it shows itself like that all about you may guess whether its a paying concern two ounces to the ton my boys as dick and caldigate hitherto knew nothing about ounces and tons in reference to gold and as they had heard of nuggets and lumps of gold nearly as big as their fist they were not much exalted by what they saw down the old stickinthemud nor did they like the darkness and dampness and dirt and dreariness of the place they had both resolved to work as they had often said with their own handsbut in thinking over it their imagination had not pictured to them so uncomfortable a workshop as this when they had returned to the light the owner of the place took them through the crushingmill attached showed them the stone or mulloch as it was thrust into the jaws of the devouring animal and then brought them in triumph round to the place where the gold was eliminated from the débris of mud and water the gold did not seem to them to be very much but still there it was two ounces to the ton my boys said crinkett as he brought them back to his house youll find that a 10s sharell give you about 6d a month thats about 60 per cent i guess you can have your money monthly what comes out of that there mine in a march you can have in a april and so on there aint nothing like it anywhere elsenot as i knows on and instead of working your hearts out you can be just amusing yourselves about the country dont go to ahalalaunless it is for dropping your money if thats what you want i wont say but ahalala is as good a place as youll find in the colony then he brought a bottle of whisky out of a cupboard and treated them to a glass of grog apiece beyond that his hospitality did not go  dick looked as though he liked the idea of having a venture in the old stickinthemud caldigate without actually disbelieving all that had been said to him did not relish the proposal it was not the kind of thing which they had intended after they had learned their trade as miners it might be very well for them to have shares in some established concernbut in that case he would wish to be one of the managers himself and not to trust everything to any crinkett however honest that suggestion of travelling about and amusing themselves did not commend itself to him new south wales might he thought be a good country for work but did not seem to offer much amusement beyond sheer idleness and brandyandwater  i rather think we should like to do a little in the rough first he said  a very littlell go a long way with you im thinking  i dont see that at all said dick stoutly  you go down there and take one of them picks in your hand for a weekeight hours at a time with five minutes spell allowed for a smoke and see how youll feel at the end of the week  well try it on if youll give us 10s aday for the week said caldigate rubbing his hands together  i wouldnt give you halfacrown for the whole time between you and you wouldnt earn it ten shillings a day i suppose you think a man has only just to say the word and become a miner out of hand youve a deal to learn before youll be worth half the money i never knew chaps like you come to any good at working if youve got a little money you know ive shown you what you can do with it but perhaps you havent  the conversation was ended by a declaration on the part of caldigate that they would take a week to think over mr crinketts kind proposition and that they might as well occupy the time by taking a look at ahalala a place that had been so much praised and so much abused must be worth seeing whos been apraising it asked crinkett angrily unless its that fool jones and as for waiting i dont say that youll have the shares at that price next week in this way he waxed angry but nevertheless he condescended to recommend a man to them when caldigate declared that they would like to hire some practical miner to accompany them theres mick maggott said he knows mining amost as well as anybody youll hear of him may be up at hennikers hes honest and if you can keep him off the drink hell do as well as anybody but neither mick nor nobody else can do you no good at ahalala with that he led them out of the gate and nodding his head at them by way of farewell left them to go back to mrs hennikers  to mrs hennikers they went and there stretched out at length on the wooden veranda before the house they found the hero of the potatoesthe man who had taken them down to crinketts house he seemed to be fast asleep but as they came up on the boards he turned himself on his elbow and looked at them well mates he said what do you think of tom crinkett now youve seen him  he doesnt seem to approve of ahalala said dick  in course he dont when a new rush is opened like that and takes away half the hands a man has about him and raises the wages of them who remain in course he dont like it you see the difference the old stickinthemud is an established kind of thing  its a paying concern i suppose said caldigate  it has paidnot a doubt about it whether its played out or not im not so sure but ahalala is a workingmans diggings not a masters such as crinkett is now of course crinkett has a down on ahalala  your friend jack brien didnt seem to think much of the place said dick  poor jack is one of them who never has a stroke of luck hes a sort of chum who when he has a bottle of pickles somebody else is sure to eat em ahalala isnt so bad its one of them chancy places of course you may and you maynt as i was asaying before when the great rush was on i did uncommon well at ahalala i never was the man i was then  what became of it asked caldigate with a smile  mother henniker can tell you that or any other publican round the country it never will stick to me i dont know why but it never will ive had my luck too oh laws i might have had my house just as grand as polly hooker this moment only i never could stick to it like tom crinkett ive drank champaign out of bucketsi have  id rather have a pot of beer out of the pewter said caldigate  very like one doesnt drink champaign because its better nor anything else a nobbler of brandys worth ten of it its the glory of outfacing the swells at their own game there was a chap over in the other colony shod his horse with goldand he had to go shepherding afterwards for thirty pounds ayear and his grub but its something for him to have ridden a horse with gold shoes youve never seen a bucketful of champaign in the old country  when both dick and caldigate had owned that they had never encountered luxury so superabundant and had discussed the matter in various shapesasking whether the bucket had been emptied and other questions of the same naturecaldigate inquired of his friend whether he knew mick maggott  mick maggott said the man jumping up to his feet who wants mick maggott then caldigate explained the recommendation which mr crinkett had made wellim darnedmick maggott im mick maggott myself  before the evening was over an arrangement had been made between the parties and had even been written on paper and signed by all the three mick on the morrow was to proceed to ahalala with his new comrades and was to remain with them for a month assisting them in all their views and for this he was to receive ten shillings aday but in the event of his getting drunk he was to be liable to dismissal at once mick pleaded hard for one bout of drinking during the monthbut when dick explained that one bout might last for the entire time he acknowledged that the objection was reasonable and assented to the terms proposed     chapter xi  ahalala    it was all settled that night and some necessary purchases made ahalala was twentythree miles from nobble and a coach had been established through the bush for the benefit of miners going to the diggingsbut mick was of opinion that miners ought to walk with their swag on their backs when the distance was not more than forty miles you look so foolish getting out of one of them rattletrap coaches he said and everybody axing whether youre going to pick for yourself or buy a share in a claim im all for walkingif it aint beneath you they declared themselves quite ready to walk and under micks guidance they went out and bought two large red blankets and two pannikins mick declared that if they went without swags on their backs and pannikins attached to their swags they would be regarded with evil eyes by all who saw them there were some words about the portmanteaus mick proposed that they should be left for the entire month in the charge of mrs henniker and when this was pronounced impossible he was for a while disposed to be off the bargain caldigate declared that with all his ambition to be a miner he must have a change of shirts then mick pointed to the swag couldnt he put another shirt into the swag it was at last settled that one portmanteau should be sent by the coach and one left in the charge of mrs henniker them sort of traps aint never any good in my mind said mick its unmanly having all them togs i like a wash as well as any mantrousers jersey drawers and all im always at em when i get a place for a rinse by the side of a creek but when my things are so gone that they wont hang on comfortable any longer i chucks em away and buys more two jerseys is good and two drawers is good because of wet boots is awkward and i allays does with one pair some have two and ties em on with the pannikin but it aint shipshape thems my ideas and ive been at it these nine years youll come to the same  the three started the next morning at six duly invested with their swags before they went they found mrs henniker up with hot tea boiled beef and damper just one drop at startingfor the good of the house said mick apologetically whereupon the whisky was brought and mick insisted on shouting for it out of his own pocket  they had hardly gone a mile out of nobble before maggott started a little difficultymerely for the purpose of solving it with a masters hand there aint to be no misters among us you know  certainly not said caldigate  my names mick this chaps names dick i didnt exactly catch yourn i suppose youve been kursened  yesthey christened me john  aint it never been jack with you  i dont think it ever was  john it do sound lackadaisical what i call womanish but perhaps its for the better we have such a lot of jacks theres dirty jack and jack the nigger and jack miserythats poor jack brienand a lot more perhaps you wouldnt like not another name of that sort  well nounless its necessary  there aint another john about the place as i know i never knew a john down a minenever well try it anyhow  and so that was settled as it happened though dick shand had always been dick to his friend caldigate had never as yet been either john or jack to dick shand there are men who fall into the way of being called by their christian names and others who never hear them except from their own family but before the day was out caldigate had become john to both his companions it dont sound as it ought to donot yet said mick after he had tried it about a dozen times in five minutes  before the day was over it was clear that mick maggott had assumed the mastery when three men start on an enterprise together one man must be boss let the republic be as few as it may one man must be president and as mick knew what he was about he assumed the situation easily the fact that he was to receive wages from the others had no bearing on the subject at all before they got to ahalala caldigate had begun to appreciate all this and to understand in part what they would have to do during this month and how they would have to live it was proposed that they should at once fix on a spotpeg out a claim on some unoccupied piece of ground buy for themselves a small tentof which they were assured that they would find many for saleand then begin to sink a hole when they entered ahalala caldigate was surprised to find that mick was the most tired of the three it is always so the man who has laboured from his youth upwards can endure with his arms it is he who has had leisure to shoot to play cricket to climb up mountains and to handle a racket that can walk darned if you aint better stuff than i took you for said mick as the three let the swags down from their backs on the veranda of ridleys hotel at ahalala  ahalala was a very different place from nobblemade nobble seem to be almost a compact and prosperous city at nobble there was at any rate a street but at ahalala everything was straggling the houses such as they were stood here and there about the place while a great part of the population lived under canvas and then ahalala was decidedly in the forest the trees around had not yet been altogether killed nor had they been cut down in sufficient numbers to divest the place of its forest appearance ahalala was leafy and therefore though much less regular also less hideous than nobble when dick first made tender inquiry as to the comforts of an hotel he was assured that there were at least a couple of dozen but the place was bewildering there seemed to be no beginning to it and no end there were many tracks about here and therebut nothing which could be called a road the number of holes was infiniteeach hole covered by a rough windlass used for taking out the dirt which was thrown loosely anywhere round the aperture here and there were to be seen little red flags stuck upon the end of poles these indicated as mick informed them those fortunate adventures in which gold had been found at those very much more numerous hillocks which showed no red flag the labourers were hitherto labouring in vain there was a little tent generally near to each hillock in which the miners slept packed nearly as close as sheep in a fold as our party made its way through the midst of this new world to ridleys hotel our friend observed many a miner sitting at his evening meal each generally had a fryingpan between his legs out of which he was helping himself to meat which he had cooked on the ashes just behind him sometimes two or three were sharing their provisions out of the same fryingpan but as a rule each miner had his own and each had it between his legs  before they had been at ahalala twentyfour hours they also had their tent and their fryingpan and their fire and had pegged out their claim and were ready to commence operations on the morrow it was soon manifest to caldigate and dick shand that they would have been very much astray without a boss to direct them three or four hours had been passed in forming a judgment as to the spot on which they should commence to dig and in making his choice mick had been guided by many matters as to which our two adventurers were altogether ignorant it might be that mick was equally so but he at any rate assumed some knowledge he looked to the fall of the ground the line in which the red flags were to be tracedif any such line could be foundand was possessed of a considerable amount of jargon as to topographical mining secrets at last they found a spot near a creek surrounded by foresttrees perhaps three hundred yards from the nearest adjacent claim and as mick declared in a direct line with three red flags here they determined to commence their operations i dont suppose we shall do any good said caldigate to dick but we must make a beginning if only for the sake of hardening our hands we shall be learning something at the time even though we only shovel up so much mud  for a fortnight they shovelled up the soil continuously without any golden effects and so far without any feeling of disappointment mick had told them that if they found a speck at the end of three weeks they would be very fortunate they had their windlass and they worked in relays one man at the bottom one man at the wheel and one man idle in this way they kept up their work during eighteen hours of the day each man in this way worked twelve hours and had twelve for sleeping and cooking and eating other occupation they had none during the fortnight neither of them went any further distance from their claim than to the neighbouring shop mick often expressed his admiration at their continued industry not understanding the spirit which will induce such young men as them to work even when the work is agonising and they were equally charmed with micks sobriety and loyalty not a word had been said as to hours of workand yet he was as constant to their long hours as though the venture was his ownas though there was no question of wages  we aint had a drop o drink yet said mick one night aint we a holding off like britons there was great triumph in his voice as he said thisvery great triumph but also as caldigate thought a sound of longing also they were now in their third week and the word whisky had never been pronounced between them at this moment when micks triumphant ejaculation was uttered they were all lyingin bed it shall be called bed by way of compliment they had bought a truss of straw which mick had declared to be altogether unnecessary and womanish and over that was laid a white indiarubber sheet which caldigate had brought with him from england this too had roused the miners wrath nevertheless he condescended to lie upon it this was their bed and here they lay each wrapped up in his blanket mick in the middle with our two friends at the sides now it was not only on micks account but quite as much in reference to dick shand that caldigate deprecated any reference to drink the abstention hitherto had been marvellous he himself would have gone daily to the store for a bottle of beer but that he recognised the expediency of keeping them away from the place he had heard that it was a peculiarity of the country that all labour was done without drink even when it was done by determined drunkards the drunkard would work for a month and then drink for a monthand then after a time would die the drink almost always consisted of spirits of the worst description it seemed to be recognised by the men that work and drink must be kept separate but micks mind travelled away on this occasion from the little tent to the delights of ridleys bar we havent had a drop of drink yet he said  well push through the month without iteh old boy said caldigate  what wouldnt i give for a pint of bitter beer said shand  or a bottle of battleaxe between the three of us said mickbattleaxe being the name for a certain brand of brandy  not a drop till the month is over said caldigate turning himself round in his blanket then there were whisperings between the other two men of which he could only hear the hum  on the next morning at six caldigate and dick shand were at the hole together it was caldigates turn to work till noon whereas dick went off at nine and mick would come on from nine till three at nine mick did not make his appearance and dick declared his purpose of looking after him caldigate also threw down his tools as he could not work alone and went in search the upshot of it was that he did not see either of his companions again till he found them both very drunk at a drinkingshop about two miles away from their claim just before dusk  this was terrible he did at last succeed in bringing back his own friend to the tent having however a sad task in doing so but mick maggott would not be moved he had his wits about him enough to swear that he cared for nothing he was going to have a spree nobody had ever known him to be talked out of it when he had once set his mind upon it he had set his mind upon it now and he meant to have his whack this was what he said of himself it aint no good john it aint no good at all john dont you trouble yourself john im going to have it out john so i tell you this he said nodding his head about in a maudlin sort of way and refusing to allow himself to be moved  on the next day dick shand was sick repentant and idle on the third he returned to his workworking however with difficulty after that he fairly recovered himself and the two cambridge men went on resolutely at their hole they soon found how hard it was not to go astray without their instructed mate the sides of the shaft became crooked and uneven and the windlass sometimes could not be made to work but still they persevered and went on by themselves for an entire week without a sign of gold during this time various fruitless expeditions were made by both the men in search of maggott he was still at the same drinkingshop but could not be induced to leave it at last they found him with the incipient horrors of delirium tremens and yet they could not get him away the man who kept the place was quite used to delirium tremens and thought nothing about it when caldigate tried a high moral tone everybody around him laughed at him  they had been digging for a month and still without a speck of gold when one morning early mick appeared in front of the tent it was then about eight and our friends had stopped their work to eat their breakfast the poor man without saying a word came and crouched down before themnot in shamenot at all that but apparently in an agony of sicknessive had my bout he said  i dont suppose youre much the better for it replied caldigate  no i aint none the better i thought it was all up with me yesterday oh laws ive had it heavy this time  why are you such a fool  wellyou see john some of us is born fools im one of em you neednt tell me cause i know all about it without any sermoning nobody dont know it so well as i do how should they if you had my inside nowand my head oh laws  give it up man  thats easy saidas if i wouldnt if i could i havent got a blessed coin left to buy a bite of bread withand i couldnt touch a morsel if i had ever so much ill take my blanket and be off as soon as i can move all this time he had been crouching but now he threw himself at length upon the ground  of course they did what they could for the poor wretch they got him into the tent and they made him swallow some tea then he slept and in the course of the afternoon he had so far recovered as to be able to eat a bit of meat then when his companions were at their work he carefully packed up his swag and fastening it on to his back appeared by the side of the hole im come to bid you goodbye he said  where are you going mick asked caldigate climbing up out of the hole by the rope  im blessed if i know but im off you are getting that hole tarnation crooked  the man was going without any allusion to the wages he had earned or to the work that he had done but then in truth he had not earned his wages as he had broken his contract he made no complaint however and no apology but was prepared to start  thats all nonsense said dick catching hold of him  you put your swag down said caldigate also catching hold of the other shoulder  what am i to put my swag down for im agoing back to nobble crinkettll give me work  youre not going to leave us in that way said dick  stop and make the shaft straight said caldigate the man looked irresolute friends are not to part like that  friends said the poor fellow wholl be friends to such a beast as i be but ill stay out the month if youll find me my grub  you shall have your grub and your money too do you think weve forgotten the potatoes   the potatoes said the man bursting into tears then he chucked away his swag and threw himself under the tent upon the straw the next day he was making things as straight as he could down the shaft  when they had been at work about five weeks there was a pole stuck into their heap of dirt and on the top of the pole there was a little red flag flying at about thirty feet from the surface when they had already been obliged to insert transverse logs in the shaft to prevent the sides from falling in they had come upon a kind of soil altogether different from the ordinary clay through which they had been working there was a stratum of loose shingle or gravelly earth running apparently in a sloping direction taking the decline of the very slight hill on which their claim was situated mick as soon as this was brought to light became an altered man the first bucket of this stuff that was pulled up was deposited by him separately and he at once sat down to wash it this he did in an open tin pan handful after handful he washed shifting and teasing it about in the pan and then he cast it out always leaving some very small residuum he was intent upon his business to a degree that caldigate would have thought to be beyond the mans nature with extreme patience he went on washing handful after handful all the day while the other two pulled up fresh buckets of the same stuff he would not pause to eat or hardly to talk at last there came a loud exclamation by weve got it then dick and caldigate stooping down were shown four or five little specks in the angle of the pans bottom before the sun had set they had stuck up their little red flag and a crowd of neighbours was standing round them asking questions as to their success     chapter xii  mademoiselle cettini    after three days of successful washing when it became apparent that a shed must be built and that if possible some further labour must be hired mick said that he must go i aint earned nothing he said because of that bout and i aint going to ask for nothing but i cant stand this any longer i hope youll make your fortins then came the explanation it was not possible he said that a regular miner such as he was should be a party to such a grand success without owning a share in it he was quite aware that nothing belonged to him he was working for wages and he had forfeited them but he couldnt see the gold coming out under his hands in pailfuls and feel that none of it belonged to him then it was agreed that there should be no more talk of wages and that each should have a third share in the concern very much was said on the matter of drink in all of which caldigate was clever enough to impose on his friend dick the heavy responsibility of a mentor a man who has once been induced to preach to another against a fault will feel himself somewhat constrained by his own sermons mick would make no promises but declared his intention of trying very hard if anybodyd knock me down as soon as i goes a yard off the claim thatd be best and so they renewed their work and at the end of six weeks from the commencement of their operations sold nine ounces of gold to the manager of the little branch bank which had already established itself at ahalala these were hardly pailfuls but gold is an article which adds fervour to the imagination and almost creates a power for romance  other matters however were not running smoothly with john caldigate at this eventful time to have found gold so soon after their arrival was no doubt a great triumph and justified him in writing a long letter to his father in which he explained what he had done and declared that he looked forward to success with confidence but still he was far from being at ease he could not suffer himself to remain hidden at ahalala without saying something of his whereabouts to mrs smith after what had happened between them he would be odious to himself if he omitted to keep the promise which he had made to her and yet he would so fain have forgotten heror rather have wiped away from the reality of his past life that one episode had it been possible a months separation had taught him to see how very silly he had been in regard to this womanand had also detracted much from those charms which had delighted him on board ship she was pretty she was clever she had the knack of being a pleasant companion but how much more than all these was wanted in a wife and then he knew nothing about her she might be or have been all that was disreputable if he could not shake himself free from her she would be a millstone round his neck he was aware of all that and as he thought of it he would think also of the face of hester bolton and remember her form as she sat silent in the big house at chesterton but nevertheless it was necessary that he should write to mrs smith he had promised that he would do so and he must keep his word  the name of the woman had not been mentioned between him and dick shand since they left the ship dick had been curious but had been afraid to inquire and had in his heart applauded the courage of the man who had thus been able to shake off at once a woman with whom he had amused himself caldigate himself was continually meditating as he worked with the windlass in his hand or with his pick at the bottom of the hole whether in conformity with the usages of the world he could not simplydrop her then he remembered the words which had passed between them on the subject and he could not do it he was as yet too young to be at the same time so wise and so hard i shall hold you as engaged to me he had said and myself as engaged to you and he remembered the tones of her voice as with her last words she had said to him my love my love they had been very pleasant to him then but now they were most unfortunate they were unfortunate because there had been a power in them from which he was now unable to extricate himself  therefore during one of those leisure periods in which mick and dick were at work he wrote his letter with the paper on his knees squatting down just within his tent on a deal case which had contained boxes of sardines bottles of pickles and cans of jam for now in their prosperity they had advanced somewhat beyond the simple plenty of the fryingpan it was a difficult letter to write should it be ecstatic and loving or cold and severeor light and therefore false my own one here i am i have struck gold come to me and share it that would have been ecstatic and loving tis a hard life this and not fit for a womans weakness but it must be my lifeand therefore let there be an end of all between us that would have been cold and severe how are you and what are you doing dick and i are shoving along it isnt half as nice as on board ship hope to see you before long and am yoursjust the same as ever that would have been light and falsekeeping the word of promise to the ear but breaking it to the heart he could not write either of these he began by describing what they had done and had completed two pages before he had said a word of their peculiar circumstances in regard to each other he felt that his letter was running into mere gossip and was not such as she would have a right to expect if any letter were sent at all there must be something more in it than all this and so after much thinking of it he at last rushed as it were into hot words and ended it as follows i have put off to the last what i have really got to say let me know what you are doing and what you wishand whether you love me i have not as yet the power of offering you a home but i trust that the time may come these last words were false he knew that they were false but the falseness was not of a nature to cause him to be ashamed it shames no man to swear that he loves a woman when he has ceased to love herbut it does shame him to drop off from the love which he has promised he balanced the matter in his mind for a while before he would send his letter then getting up quickly he rushed forth and dropped it into the postoffice box  the very next day chance brought to ahalala one who had been a passenger on board the goldfinder and the man hearing of the success of shand and caldigate came to see them of course you know said the man what your fellowpassenger is doing down at sydney dick shand who was present replied that they had heard nothing of any fellowpassenger caldigate understood at once to whom the allusion was made and was silent look here said the man bringing a newspaper out of his pocket and pointing to a special advertisement who do you think that is the advertisement declared that mademoiselle cettini would on such and such a night sing a certain number of songs and dance a certain number of dances and perform a certain number of tableaux at a certain theatre in sydney thats your mrs smith said the man turning to caldigate  i am very glad she has got employment said caldigate but she is not my mrs smith  we all thought that you and she were very thick  all the same i beg you to understand that she is not my mrs smith repeated caldigate endeavouring to appear unconcerned but hardly able to conceal his anger  dancing dances singing songs and acting tableauxand all under the name of mademoiselle cettini nothing could be worseunless indeed it might be of service to him to know that she was earning her bread and therefore not in distress and earning it after a fashion of which he would be at liberty to express his disapproval nothing more was said at the time about mrs smith and the man went his way  ten days afterwards caldigate in the presence both of mick and dick declared his purpose of going down to sydney our luggage must be looked after said heand i have a friend whom i want to see he added not choosing to lie at this time all was going successfully with them mick maggott lived in such a manner that no one near him would have thought that he knew what whisky meant his selfrespect had returned to him and he was manifestly boss there had come to be necessity for complicated woodwork below the surface and he had shown himself to be a skilled miner and it had come to pass that our two friends were as well assured of his honesty as of their own he had been a veritable godsend to themand would remain so could he be kept away from the drinkingshops  if you go away dont you think hell break out dick asked when they were alone together  i hope not he seems to have been steadied by success at any rate i must go  is it to seemrs smith dick as he asked the question put on his most serious face he did not utter the name as though he were finding fault the time that had passed had been sufficient to quench the unpleasantness of their difference on board ship he was justified in asking his friend such a question and caldigate felt that it was so  i am  dont you think upon the whole i dont like to interfere but upon my word the thing is so important  you think i had better not see her  i do  and lie to her  all is fair in love and war  that means that no faith is due to a woman i cannot live by such a doctrine i do not mind owning to you that i wish i could do as you bid me i cant i cannot be so false i must go old fellow but i know all that you would say to me and i will endeavour to escape honestly from this trouble and so he went  yesto escape honestly from that trouble but how it is just that trouble from which there is no honest escapeunless a man may honestly break his word he had engaged himself to her so much that simply to ignore her would be cowardly as well as false there was but one thing that he could do but one step that he could take by which his security and his selfrespect might both be maintained he would tell her the exact truth and put it to her whether looking at their joint circumstances it would not be better that they shouldpart reflecting on this during his three days journey down to sydney it was thus that he resolvedforgetting altogether in his meditations the renewed force of the womans charms upon himself  as he went from the railway station at sydney to the thirdclass inn at which he located himself he saw the hoardings on all sides placarded with the name of mademoiselle cettini and there was a picture on some of these placards of a wonderful female without much clothes which was supposed to represent some tragic figure in a tableau there was the woman whom he was to make his wife he had travelled all night and had intended to seek mrs smith immediately after his breakfast but so unhappy was he so much disgusted by the tragic figure in the picture that he postponed his visit and went after his luggage his luggage was all right in the warehouse and he arranged that it should be sent down to nobble waggons with stores did make their way to nobble from the nearest railway station and hopes were held out that the packages might be there in six weeks time he would have been willing to postpone their arrival for twelve months for twentyfour months could he as compensation have been enabled to postpone with honour his visit to mrs smith for the same time  soon after noon however his time was vacant and he rushed to his fate she had sent him her address and he found her living in very decent lodgings overlooking the public park he was at once shown up to her room where he found her at breakfast so you have come she said then when the door was shut she flung herself into his arms  he was dressed as a miner might be dressed who was off work and out for a holidayclean rough and arranged with a studied intention to look as little like a gentleman as possible the main figure and manner were so completely those of a gentleman that the disguise was not perfect but yet he was rough she was dressed with all the pretty care which a woman can use when she expects her lover to see her in morning costume anything more unlike the mrs smith of the ship could not be imagined if she had been attractive then what was she now if her womans charms sufficed to overcome his prudence while they were so clouded what effect would they have upon him now and she was in his arms here there was no quartermaster to look after the proprietiesno mrs crompton no mrs callander no miss green to watch with a hundred eyes for the exchange of a chance kiss in some moment of bliss so you have come oh my darling oh my love no doubt it was all just as it should be if a lady may not call the man to whom she is engaged her love and her darling what proper use can there be for such words and into whose arms is she to jump if not into his as he pressed her to his heart and pressed his lips to hers he told himself that he ought to have arranged it all by letter  why cettini he asked but he smiled as he put the question it was intended to be serious but still he could not be hard upon her all at once  why fifty thousand fools  i dont understand  supposing there to be fifty thousand people in sydneyas to which i know nothing or why ever so many million fools in london if i called myself mrs smith nobody would come and see me if i called myself madame cettini not nearly so many would come you have got to inculcate into the minds of the people an idea that a pure young girl is going to jump about for their diversion they know it isnt so but there must be a flavour of the idea it isnt nice but one has to live  were you ever cettini before  yeswhen i was on the stage as a girl then he thought he remembered that she had once told him some particular in regard to her early life which was incompatible with this unless indeed she had gone under more than one name before she was married i used as a child to dance and sing under that name  was it your fathers name  she smiled as she answered you want to discover all the little mean secrets of my life at once and do not reflect that in so far as they were mean they are disagreeable as subjects of conversation i was not mean myself  i am sure of that  if you are sure of it is not that enough of course i have been among low people if not why should i have been a singer on the stage at so early an age why a dancer why should i have married such a one as mr smith  i do not know of what sort he was said caldigate  this is not the time to ask when you have just come to see mewhen i am so delighted to see you oh it is such a pleasure i have not had a nice word spoken to me since i left the goldfinder come and take a walk in the gardens nobody knows me off the stage yet and nobody knows you so we can do just as we like come and tell me about the gold  he did go and did tell her about the gold and before he had been with her an hour sitting about on the benches in that loveliest of all places the public gardens at sydney he was almost happy with her it was now late in the autumn in may but the end of the autumn in sydney is the most charming time of the year he spent the whole day with her dining with her in her lodgings at five in order that he might take her to the theatre at seven she had said a great deal to him about her performances declaring that he would find them to be neither vulgar nor disagreeable she told him that she had no friend in sydney but that she had been able to get an engagement for a fortnight at melbourne and had been very shortly afterwards pressed to come on to sydney she listened not only with patience but apparently with the greatest pleasure to all that he could tell her of dick shand and mr crinkett and mick maggott arousing herself quite to enthusiasm when he came to the finding of the gold but there was not a word said the whole day as to their future combined prospects nor was there any more outspoken allusion to loves and darlings or any repetition of that throwing herself into his arms for once it was natural if she were wanted thus again the action must be hisnot hers she was clever enough to know that  what do you think of it she said when he waited to take her home  it is the only good dancing i ever saw in my life but  well  i will tell you tomorrow  tell me whatever you think and you will see that i will attend to you come about elevennot sooner as i shall not be dressed now goodnight     chapter xiii  coming back    the letter which caldigate wrote to his father from ahalala telling him of the discovery of gold upon their claim contained the first tidings which reached folking of the wanderer and that was not received till seven or eight months had passed by since he left the place the old squire during that time had lived a very solitary life in regard to his nephew whom he had declared his purpose of partially adopting he had expressed himself willing to pay for his education but had not proposed to receive him at folking and as to that matter of heirship he gave his brother to understand that it was not to be regarded as a settled thing folking was now his own to do what he liked with it and as such it was to remain but he would treat his nephew as a son while the nephew seemed to him to merit such treatment as for the estate he was not at all sure whether it would not be better for the community at large and for the caldigate family in particular that it should be cut up and sold in small parcels there was a long correspondence between him and his brother which was ended by his declaring that he did not wish to see any of the family just at present at folking he was low in spirits and would prefer to be alone  he was very low in spirits and completely alone all those who knew anything about himand they were very few the tenants perhaps and servants and old mr boltonwere of opinion that he had torn his son out from all place in his heart had so thoroughly disinherited the sinner not only from his house and acres but from his love that they did not believe him capable of suffering from regret but even they knew very little of the man as he wandered about alone among the dikes as he sat alone among his books even as he pored over the volumes which were always in his hand he was ever mourning and moaning over his desolation his wife and daughters had been taken from him by the hand of godbut how had it come to pass that he had also lost his son that son who was all that was left to him when he had first heard of those dealings with davis while john was amusing himself with the frivolities of babington he had been full of wrath and had declared to himself that the young man must be expelled if not from all affection yet from all esteem and he had gone on to tell himself that it would be unprofitable for him to live with a son whom he did not esteem then it had come to pass that arguing it out in his own mind rationally as he had thought but still under the impulse of hot anger he had determined that it was better that they should part even though the parting should be for ever but now he had almost forgotten davishad turned the matter over in his mind till he had taught himself to think that the disruption had been altogether his sons work and in no degree his own his son had not loved him he had not been able to inspire his son with love he was solitary and wretched because he had been harsh and unforgiving that was his own judgment as to himself but he never said a word of his feelings to any human being  john had promised to write the promise had not been very enthusiastically given but still as the months went by it was constantly remembered the young man after leaving cambridgeshire had remained some weeks at the shands house before he had startedand from thence he had not written the request had been that he should write from australia and the correspondence between him and his father had always been so slight that it had not occurred to him to write from pollington but mr caldigate hadnot expected but hoped that a letter might come at the last moment he knew to a day to an hour when the vessel would sail from plymouth there might have been a letter from plymouth but no letter came and then the months went by slowly the son did not write from melbourne nor from nobblenor from ahalala till gold had been found so it came to pass that nearly eight months had passed and that the father had told himself again and again that his son had torn himself altogether away from all remembrance of his home before the letter came  it was not a long letter but it was very satisfactory the finding of the gold was in itself of course a great thing but the manner in which it was told without triumph or exultation but with an air of sober industrious determination was much more and then there was a word or two at the end dear fatheri think of you every day and am already looking forward to the time when i may return and see you again as he read it the tears rolled down his cheeks and unluckily the old housekeeper came into the room at the same time  is it from mr john sir  he had to recover himself and to get rid of his tears and to answer the old woman in an unconcerned tone all in a moment and it disconcerted him  yesyes he said ill tell you all about it another time  is he well sir  i daresay he is he doesnt say its about business didnt you hear me say that id tell you another time and so the old woman was turned out of the room having seen the tear and heard the little gurgle in the throat  he seems to be doing well the squire said to mr holt he has got a couple of partners and they have succeeded in finding gold he may probably come back some day but i dont suppose it will be for the next twenty years  after that he marked the posts which he knew came from that part of the world by san francisco and had resolved not to expect anything by that of the next monthwhen there came a day before its time a much longer letter than the last in this there was given a detailed description of the claim at ahalala which had already been named folking much was said of mick and much was said of dick both of whom were working as steady as rocks the number of ounces extracted were stated with the amount of profits which had been divided and something was said as to the nature of their life at ahalala they were still living under their original tent but were meditating the erection of a wooden shanty ahalala the writer said was not a place at which a prosperous miner could expect to locate himself for many years but the prospects were good enough to justify some present attention to personal comforts all this was rational pleasant and straightforward and in the letter there was no tone or touch of the old quarrel it was full and cordialsuch as any son might write to any father it need hardly be said that there was no mention made in it of mrs smith it was written after the return of john caldigate from sydney to ahalala but contained no reference to any matrimonial projects  letters then came regularly month by month and were always regularly answeredtill a chance reader would have thought that no father and no son stood on better terms with each other there had been misfortunes but the misfortunes did not seem to touch john caldigate himself after three months of hard work and steady conduct mick maggott had broken out and had again taken to drinking champagne out of buckets efforts were made with infinite trouble to reclaim him which would be successful for a timeand then again he would slip away into the mud and then shand would sometimes go into the mud with him and shand when drunk would be more unmanageable even than mick and this went on till mick hadkilled himself and dick shand had disappeared i grieve for the man as for a dear friend he said in one of his fathers letters for he has been as true to me as steel in all things save drink and i feel that i have learned under him the practical work of a goldminer as it cannot be learned except by the unwearied attention of the teacher could he have kept from spirits this man would have made a large fortune and would have deserved it for he was indefatigable and neverending in resources such was the history of poor mick maggott  and shands history was told also shand strayed away to queensland and then returning was again admitted to a certain degree of partnership and then again fell into drink and at last deserting the trade of a miner tried his hand at various kinds of work till at last he became a simple shepherd from time to time caldigate sent him money when he was in want of it but they had not again come together as associates in their work  all this was told in his monthly letters which came to be expected at folking till each letter was regarded as the rising of a new sun there is a style of letterwriting which seems to indicate strength of purpose and a general healthy condition on the part of the writer in all his letters the son spoke of himself and his doings with confidence and serenity somewhat surprising his father after a while by always desiring to be remembered to mr mrs and miss bolton this went on not only from month to month but from year to year till at the end of three years from the date at which the son had left folking there had come to be a complete confidence between him and his father john caldigate had gone into partnership with crinkettwho had indeed tried to cheat him wretchedly but had failedand at that time was the manager of the polyeuka mine the claim at ahalala had been sold and he had deserted the flashy insecurity of alluvial searchings for the fundamental security of rockgold he was deep in the crushing of quartz and understood well the meaning of two ounces to the tonthat glittering boast by which crinkett had at first thought to allure him from time to time he sent money home paying back to his father and to boltons bank what had been borrowed on the estate for there had passed between them many communications respecting folking the extravagances of the son became almost the delight of the father when the father had become certain of the sons reform there had been even jocular reference to davis and a complete understanding as to the amount of money to be given to the nephew in compensation for the blighted hopes as to the reversion of the property  why it should have been that these years of absence should have endeared to john caldigate a place which while it was his home had always been distasteful to him i cannot perhaps explain to those readers who have never strayed far from their original nestsand to those who have been wanderers i certainly need not explain it as soon as he felt that he could base the expression of his desires as to folking on the foundation of substantial remittances he was not slow to say that he should like to keep the place he knew that he had no right to the reversion but perhaps his father would sympathise with his desire to buy back his right his father with all his political tenets as to land with his oftenexpressed admiration as to the french system with his loud denunciations of the absurdity of binding a special family to a special fraction of the earths surface did sympathise with him so strongly that he at once accepted the arrangement i think that his conduct has given him a right to demand it he said to mr bolton  i dont quite see that money certainly gives a man great powers if he has money enough he can buy the succession to folking if you choose to sell it to him  i mean as my son said the father somewhat proudly he was the heir  but he ceased to be soby his own doing i advised you to think longer over it before you allowed him to dispossess himself  it certainly has been all for the best  i hope so but when you talk of his right i am bound to say that he has none folking is now yours without encumbrance and you can give it to whom you please  it was he who paid off the mortgage  you have told me that he sent you part of the moneybut thats between you and him i am very glad caldigate that your son has done so welland the more so perhaps because the early promise was not good but it may be doubted whether a successful golddigger will settle down quietly as an english country gentleman  there can be no doubt that old mr bolton was a little jealous and perhaps in some degree incredulous as to the success of john caldigate his sons had worked hard from the very beginning of their lives with them there had been no period of newmarket davis and disreputation on the basis of capital combined with conduct they had gradually risen to high success but here was a young man who having by his selfindulgence thrown away all the prospects of his youth had rehabilitated himself by the luck of finding gold in a gully to mr bolton it was no better than had he found a box of treasure at the bottom of a well mr bolton had himself been a seeker of money all his life but he had his prejudices as to the way in which money was to be sought it should be done in a gradual industrious manner and in accordance with recognised forms a digger who might by chance find a lump of gold as big as his head or might work for three months without finding any was to him only one degree better than davis and therefore he did not receive his old friends statements as to the young mans success with all the encouragement which his old friend would have liked  but his father was very enthusiastic in his return letter to the miner the matter as to the estate had been arranged the nephew who after all had not shown himself to be very praiseworthy had already beencompensated his own will had already been madeof course in his sons favour as there had been so much successand as continued success must always be doubtfulwould it not be well that he should come back as soon as possible there would be enough now for them all then he expressed an opinion that such a place as nobble could not be very nice for a permanent residence  nobble was not very nice over and beside his professional success there was not much in his present life which endeared itself to john caldigate but the acquisition of gold is a difficult thing to leave there is a curse about it or a blessingit is hard to decide whichthat makes it almost impossible for a man to tear himself away from its pursuit when it is coming in freely and the absolute goldnot the money not the balance at ones bankers not the plentiful so much per annumbut the absolute metal clinging about the palm of ones hands like small gravel or welded together in a lump too heavy to be lifted has a peculiar charm of its own i have heard of a man who having his pocket full of diamonds declared as he let them run through his fingers that human bliss could not go beyond that sensation john caldigate did not shoe his horse with gold but he liked to feel that he had enough gold by him to shoe a whole team he could not return home quite as yet his affairs were too complicated to be left quite at a moments notice if as he hoped he should find himself able to leave the colony within four years of the day on which he had begun work and could then do so with an adequate fortune he believed that he should have done better than any other englishman who had set himself to the task of goldfinding in none of his letters did he say anything special about hester bolton but his inquiries about the family generally were so frequent as to make his father wonder why such questions should be asked the squire himself who was living hardly a dozen miles from mr boltons house did not see the old banker above once a quarter perhaps and the ladies of the family certainly not oftener than once a year very little was said in answer to any of johns inquiries mr and mrs and miss bolton are i believe quite well so much was declared in one of the old squires letters and even that little served to make known that at any rate so far no tidings as to marriage on the part of hester had reached the ear of her fathers old friend perhaps this was all that john caldigate wanted to learn  at last there came word that john intended to come home with the next months mail this letter arrived about midsummer when the miner had been absent three years and a half he had not settled all his affairs so completely but that it might be necessary that he should return but he thought that he would be able to remain at least twelve months in england and in england he intended to make his home gold he said was certainly very attractive but he did not like new south wales as a country in which to live he had now contracted his ventures to the one enterprise of the polyeuka mine from which he was receiving large monthly dividends if that went on prosperously perhaps he need not return to the colony at all poor dick shand he said he is a shepherd far away in the west hardly earning better wages than an english ploughman and i am coming home with a pocket full of money a few glasses of whisky have made all the difference  the squire when he received this felt more of exultation than he had ever known in his life it seemed as though something of those throbbings of delight which are common to most of us when we are young had come to him for the first time in his old age he could not bring himself to care in the least for dick shand at lastat lasthe was going to have near him a companion that he could love  well yes i suppose he has put together a little money he said to farmer holt when that worthy tenant asked enthusiastically as to the truth of the rumours which were spread about as to the young squires success i rather think hell settle down and live in the old place after all  thats what he ought to do squoirethats what he ought to do said mr holt almost choked by the energy of his own utterances     chapter xiv  again at home    on his arrival in england john caldigate went instantly down to folking he had come back quite fortified in his resolution of making hester bolton his wife if he should find hester bolton willing and if she should have grown at all into that form and manner into those ways of look of speech and of gait which he had pictured to himself when thinking of her away at nobble the females by whom he had been surrounded had not been attractive to him in all our colonies the women are beautiful and in the large towns a society is soon created of which the fastidious traveller has very little ground to complain but in the small distant bushtowns as they are called the rougher elements must predominate our hero though he had worn moleskin trousers and jersey shirts and had worked down a pit twelve hours aday with a pickaxe had never reconciled himself to female roughnesses he had condescended to do so occasionallytelling himself that it was his destiny to pass his life among such surroundings but his imagination had ever been at work with him and he possessed a certain aptitude for romance which told him continually that hester bolton was the dream of his life and ought to become if possible the reality and now he came back resolved to attempt the realityunless he should find that the hester bolton of chesterton was altogether different from the hester bolton of his dreams  the fatted calf was killed for him in a very simple but fullhearted way there was no other guest to witness the meeting and here you are said the father  yes sir here i amall thats left of me  there is quite plenty said the father looking at the large proportions of his son it seems but a day or two since you wentand yet they have been long days i hardly expected to see you again johncertainly not so soon as this certainly not in such circumstances if ever a man was welcome to a house you are welcome to this and nowwhat do you mean to do with yourself  by nine oclock tomorrow morning you will probably find a pit opened on the lawn and i shall be down to the middle looking for gold ah sir i wish you could have known poor mick maggott  if he would have made holes in my lawn i am glad he did not come home with you this was the first conversation but both the father and son felt that there was a tone about it which had never before been heard between them  john caldigate at this time was so altered in appearance that they who had not known him well might possibly have mistaken him he was now nearly thirty but looked older than his age the squareness of his brow was squarer and here and there through his dark brown hair there was to be seen an early tinge of coming grey and about his mouth was all the decision of purpose which comes to a man when he is called upon to act quickly on his own judgment in matters of importance and there was that look of selfconfidence which success gives he had thriven in all that he had undertaken in that goldfinding business of his he had made no mistakes men who had been at it when a boy had tried to cheat him but had failed he had seen into such mysteries as the business possessed with quick glances and had soon learned to know his way and he had neither gambled nor drankwhich are the two rocks on which goldminers are apt to wreck their vessels all this gave him an air of power and selfassertion which might perhaps have been distasteful to an indifferent acquaintance but which at this first meeting was very pleasing to the father his son was somebodyhad done something that son of whom he had been so thoroughly ashamed when the dealings with davis had first been brought to light he had kept up his reading too had strong opinions of his own respecting politics regarded the colonies generally from a politicoeconomical point of view had ideas on social religious and literary subjects sufficiently alike to his fathers not to be made disagreeable by the obstinacy with which he maintained them he had become much darker in colour having been as it seemed bronzed through and through by colonial suns and colonial labour altogether he was a son of whom any father might be proud as long as the father managed not to quarrel with him mr caldigate who during the last four years had thought very much on the subject was determined not to quarrel with his son  you asked sir the other day what i meant to do  what are we to find to amuse you  as for amusement i could kill rats as i used to do or slaughter a hecatomb of pheasants at babingtonhere the old man winced though the word hecatomb reconciled him a little to the disagreeable allusion but it has come to me now that i want so much more than amusement what do you say to a farm  on the estateand the landlord at once began to think whether there was any tenant who could be induced to go without injustice  about three times as big as the estate if i could find it a man can farm five thousand acres as well as fifty i take it if he have the capital i should like to cut a broad sward or better still to roam among many herds i suppose a man should have ten pounds an acre to begin with the difficulty would be in getting the land but all this was said half in joke for he was still of opinion that he would after his years holiday be forced to return for a time to new south wales he had fixed a price for which up to a certain date he would sell his interest in the polyeuka mine but the price was high and he doubted whether he would get it and if not then he must return  he had not been long at folkingnot as yet long enough to have made his way into the house at chestertonbefore annoyance arose mrs shand was most anxious that he should go to pollington and tell them anything about poor dick they did in truth know everything about poor dick that poor dicks money was all gone and that poor dick was earning his bread or rather his damper mutton and tea wretchedly in the wilderness of a sheeprun in queensland the mothers letter was not very piteous did not contain much of complaintalluded to poor dick as one whose poverty was almost natural but still it was very pressing the girls were so anxious to hear all the detailsparticularly maria the details of the life of a drunken sot are not pleasant tidings to be poured into a mothers ear or a sisters and then as they two had gone away equal and as he john caldigate had returned rich whereas poor dick was a wretched menial creature he felt that his very presence in england would carry with it some reproach against himself he had in truth been both loyal and generous to dick but stillthere was the truth he had come back as a rich man to his own country while dick was a miserable queensland shepherd it was very well for him to tell his father that a few glasses of whisky had made the difference but it would be difficult to explain this to the large circle at pollington and very disagreeable even to him to allude to it and he did not feel disposed to discuss the subject with maria with that closer confidence of which full sympathy is capable and yet he did not know how to refuse to pay the visit he wrote a line to say that as soon as he was at liberty he would run up to pollington but that at present business incidental to his return made such a journey impossible  but the letter or letters which he received from babington were more difficult to answer even than the shand despatch there were three of themfrom his uncle from aunt polly and fromnot juliabut julias second sister whereby it was signified that julias heart was much too heavily laden to allow her to write a simple cousinly note the babington girls were still babington girlswould still romp row boats and play cricket but their condition was becoming a care to their parents here was this cousin come back unmarried with gold at commandnot only once again his fathers heir but with means at command which were not at all diminished by the babington imagination after all that had passed in the linencloset what escape would there be for him that he should come to babington would be a matter of course the real kindness which had been shown to him there as a child would make it impossible that he should refuse  caldigate did feel it to be impossible to refuse though aunt polly had on that last occasion been somewhat hard upon him had laid snares for him and endeavoured to catch him as a fowler catches a bird still there had been the fact that she had been as a mother to him when he had no other mother his uncle too had supplied him with hunting and shooting and fishing when hunting and shooting and fishing were the great joys of his life it was incumbent on him to go to babington probably would be incumbent on him to pay a prolonged visit there but he certainly would not marry julia as to that his mind was so fixed that even though he should have to declare his purpose with some rudeness still he would declare it my aunt wants me to go over to babington he said to his father  of course she does  and i must go  you know best what your own feelings are as to that after you went they made all manner of absurd accusations against me but i dont wish to force a quarrel upon you on that account  i should be sorry to quarrel with them because they were kind to me when i was a boy they are not very wise  i dont think i ever knew such a houseful of fools there was no relationship by blood between the squire of folking and the squire of babington but they had married two sisters and therefore mrs babington was aunt polly to john caldigate  but fools may be very worthy sir i should say that a great many people are fools to you  not to me especially said the squire almost angrily  people who read no books are always fools to those who do read  i deny it our neighbour over the waterthe middle wash was always called the water at folkingnever looks at a book as far as i know and he is not a fool he thoroughly understands his own business but your uncle babington doesnt know how to manage his own propertyand yet he knows nothing else thats what i call being a fool  now im going to tell you a secret sir  a secret  you must promise to keep it  of course i will keep it if it ought to be kept  they want me to marry julia  what  my cousin julia its an old affair perhaps it was not davis only that made me run away five years ago  do you mean they asked youor did you ask her  well i did not ask her i do not know that i can be more explicit nevertheless it is expected and as i do not mean to do it you can see that there is a difficulty  i would not go near the place john  i must  then youll have to marry her  i wont  then therell be a quarrel  it may be so but i will avoid it if possible i must go i could not stay away without laying myself open to a charge of ingratitude they were very kind to me in the old days then the subject was dropped and on the next morning john wrote to his aunt saying that he would go over to babington after his return from london he was going to london on business and would come back from london to babington on a day which he named then he resolved that he would take pollington on his way down knowing that a disagreeable thing to be done is a lion in ones path which should be encountered and conquered as soon as possible  but there was one visit which he must pay before he went up to london i think i shall ride over tomorrow and call on the boltons he said to his father  of course you can do that if you please  he was a little rough to me but he was kind i stayed a night at his house and he advanced me the money  as for the money that was a matter of business he had his security and in truth his interest he is an honest man and a very old friend of mine but perhaps i may as well tell you that he has always been a little hard about you  he didnt approve of davis said the son laughing  he is too prejudiced a man to forget davis  the more he thinks of davis the better hell think of me if i can make him believe that i am not likely to want a davis again  youll find him probably at the bank about halfpast two  i shall go to the house it wouldnt be civil if i didnt call on mrs bolton  as the squire was never in the habit of going to the house at chesterton himself and as mrs bolton was a lady who kept up none of the outward ceremonies of social life he did not quite understand this but he made no further objection  on the following day about five in the afternoon he rode through the iron gates which he with difficulty caused to be opened for him and asked for mrs bolton when he had been here before the winter had commenced and everything around had been dull and ugly but now it was july and the patch before the house was bright with flowers the roses were in full bloom and every morsel of available soil was bedded out with geraniums as he stood holding his horse by the rein while he rang the bell a sidedoor leading through the high brick wall from the garden which stretched away behind the house was suddenly opened and a lady came through with a garden hat on and garden gloves and a basket full of rose leaves in her hand it was the lady of whom he had never ceased to think from the day on which he had been allowed just to touch her fingers now five years ago  it was she of course whom he had come to see and there she was to be seen it was of her that he had come to form a judgmentto tell himself whether she was or was not such as he had dreamed her to be he had not been so foolishly romantic as to have been unaware that in all probability she might have grown up to be something very different from that which his fancy had depicted it might or it might not come to pass that that promise of lovelinessof loveliness combined with innocence and full intelligenceshould be kept how often it is that nature is unkind to a girl as she grows into womanhood and robs the attractive child of her charms how often will the sparkle of early youth get itself quenched utterly by the dampness and clouds of the opening world he knew all thatand knew too that he had only just seen her had barely heard the voice which had sounded so silvery sweet in his ears  but there she wasto be seen again to be heard if possible and to receive his judgment miss bolton he said coming down the stone steps which he had ascended that he might ring the bell and offering her his hand  mr caldigate  you remember me then  oh yes i remember you very well i do not see people often enough to forget them and papa said that you were coming home  i have come at once to call upon your mother and your fatherand upon you i have to thank him for great kindness to me before i went  poor mamma is not quite well said the daughter she has headaches so often and she has one now and papa has not come back from the bank i have been gardening and am all then she stopped and blushed as though ashamed of herself for saying so much  i am sorry mrs bolton is unwell i will not go the ceremony of leaving a card as i hope to able to come again to thank her for her kindness before i went on my travels will you tell your father that i called then he mounted his horse feeling as he did so that he was throwing away an opportunity which kind fortune had given him there they were together he and this girl of whom he had dreamedand now he was leaving her because he did not know how to hold her in conversation for ten minutes but it was true and he had to leave her he could not instantly tell her how he admired her how he loved her how he had thought of her and how completely she had realised all his fondest dreams when on his horse he turned round and lifting his hat to her took a last glance it could not have been otherwise he said to himself he had been sure that she would grow up to be exactly that which he had found her to have supposed that nature could have been untrue to such promises as had been made then would have been to suppose nature a liar  just outside the gate he met the old banker who according to his daily custom had walked back from the town yes said mr bolton i remember youi remember you very well so you found a lot of gold  i got some  you have been one of the few fortunate i hear i hope you will be able to keep it and to make a good use of it my compliments to your father good evening  i shall take an early opportunity of paying my respects again to mrs bolton who i am sorry to hear is not well enough to see me said caldigate preventing the old curmudgeon from escaping with his intended rapidity  she is unfortunately often an invalid sirand feels therefore that she has no right to exact from any one the ceremony of morning visits good evening sir  but he cared not much for this coldness having found where the gold lay at this second ahalalathat the gold was real goldhe did not doubt but that he would be able to make good his mining operations     chapter xv  again at pollington    on his arrival at pollington all the shands welcomed him as though he had been the successful son or successful brother who had gone out from among them and spoke of poor dick as being the unsuccessful son or unsuccessful brotheras indeed he was there did not seem to be the slightest anger against him in that he had thriven and had left dick behind him in such wretched poverty there was no just ground for anger indeed he was well aware of that he had done his duty by dick to the best of his ability but fathers and mothers are sometimes apt to think that more should be done for their own children than a friends best ability can afford these people however were reasonable poor dick isnt it sad i suppose when hes quite far away in the bush like that he cant get itby which last miserable shred of security the poor mother allowed herself to be in some degree comforted  now i want you to tell me said the father when they were alone together on the first evening what is really his condition  he was a shepherd when i last heard about him  he wrote to his mother by the last mail asking whether something cannot be done for him he was a shepherd then what is a shepherd  a man who goes about with the sheep all day and brings them up to a camp at night he may probably be a week without seeing a human being that is the worst of it  how is he fed  food is brought out to his hutperhaps once a week perhaps once a fortnightso much meat so much flour so much tea and so much sugar and he has thirty or thirtyfive pounds ayear besides  paid weekly  noperhaps quarterly perhaps halfyearly he can do nothing with his money as long as he is there if he wants a pair of boots or a new shirt they send it out to him from the store and his employer charges him with the price it is a poor life sir  very poor now tell me what can we do for him  it is an affair of money  but is it an affair of money mr caldigate is it not rather an affair of drink he has had his moneymore than his share more than he ought to have had but even though i were able to send him more what good would it do him  this was a question very difficult to answer caldigate had been forced to answer it to himself in reference to his own conduct he had sent money to his former friend and could without much damage to himself have sent more latterly he had been in that condition as to money in which a man thinks nothing of fifty poundsthat condition which induces one man to shoe his horse with gold and another to chuck his banknotes about like halfcrowns the condition is altogether opposed to the regulated prudence of confirmed wealth caldigate had stayed his hand in regard to dick shand simply because the affair had been one not of money but of drink i suppose a man may be cured by the absence of liquor  by the enforced absence  no doubt they often break out again i hardly know what to say sir if you think that money will do goodmoney that is in moderationi will advance it he and i started together and i am sometimes aghast with myself when i think of the small matter which like the point on a railway sent me running rapidly on to prosperitywhile the same point turned wrong hurried him to ruin i have taken my glass of grog too my two glassesor perhaps more but that which would elate him into some fury of action would not move me it was something nature did for me rather than virtue i am a rich man and he is a shepherd because something was put into my stomach capable of digesting bad brandy which was not put into his  a man has more than one chance when he found how it was with him he should have abstained a man must pay the fine of his own weakness  oh yes it is all understood somewhere i suppose though we dont understand it i tell you what it is dr shand if you think that five hundred pounds left with you can be of any assistance you can have it  but the doctor seemed to doubt whether the money would do any good and refused to take it at any rate for the present what could he do with it if he did take it i fear that he must lie upon his bed as he has made it said the doctor sorrowfully it is a complaint which money cannot cure but can always exaggerate if without costing myself or my family a shilling i could put a thousand pounds into his hands tomorrow i do not know whether i ought to do it  you will remember my offer  the doctor thanked him and said that he would remember so the conversation was ended and the doctor went about the ordinary occupation of his life apparently without any settled grief at his heart he had done his duty by his son and that sufficedor almost sufficed for him  then came the mothers turn could anything be sent to the poor lost oneto poor dick clothes ran chiefly in her mind if among them they could make up a dozen of shirts would there be any assured means of getting them conveyed safely to dicks shepherdhut out in the queensland bush in answer to this caldigate would fain have explained had it been possible that dick would not care much for a dozen new shirtsthat they would be to him even if received almost as little a source of comfort as would be a ton of newcastle coals he had sunk below shirts by the dozen almost below single shirts such as mrs shand and her daughters would be able to fabricate some upper flannel garment and something in the nature of trousers with a belt round his middle and an old strawhat would be all the wardrobe required by him men by dint of misery rise above the need of superfluities the poor wretch whom you see rolling himself as it were at the corner of the street within his old tattered filthy coat trying to extract something more of life and warmth out of the last glass of gin which he has swallowed is by no means discomposed because he has no clean linen for the morrow all this caldigate understood thoroughlybut there was a difficulty in explaining it to dick shands mother i think there would be some trouble about the address he said  but you must know so many people out there  i have never been in queensland myself and have no acquaintance with squatters but that is not all mrs shand  what else you can tell me of course i know what it is that he has come to i dont blind myself to it mr caldigate even though i am his mother but i am his mother and if i could comfort him just a little  clothes are not what he wantsof clothes he can get what is necessary poor as he is  what is it he wants most  somebody to speak tosome one to be kind to him  my poor boy  as he has fallen to what he is now so can he rise again if he can find courage to give his mind to it i think that if you write to him and tell him so that will be better than sending him shirts the doctor has been talking to me about money for him  but mr caldigate he couldnt drink the shirts out there in the bush here where there is a pawnbroker at all the corners they drink everything  he had promised to stay two days at pollington and was of course aware of the dangers among which he walked maria had been by no means the first to welcome him all the other girls had presented themselves before her and when at last she did come forward she was very shy the eldest daughter had married her clergyman though he was still only a curate and the second had been equally successful with lieutenant postlethwaite though the lieutenant had been obliged in consequence to leave the army and to earn his bread by becoming agent to a soapmaking company maria shand was still maria shand and was it not too probable that she had remained so for the sake of that companion who had gone away with her darling brother dick maria has been thinking so much about your coming said the youngestnot the girl who had been impertinent and illbehaved before for she had since become a grownup miss shand and had a young attorney of her own on hand and was supposed to be the one of the family most likely to carry her pigs to a good marketbut the youngest of them all who had been no more than a child when he had been at pollington before i hope she is at home said caldigate at home of course shes at home she wouldnt be away when youre coming  the shands were demonstrative alwaysand never hypocritical here it was told at oncethe whole story he was to atone for having left dick in the lurch by marrying maria there did seem to him to be a certain amount of justice in the idea but then unfortunately it could not be carried out if there were nothing else against it but the existence of the young lady at chesterton that alone would have been sufficient and then though maria shand was very well though no doubt she would make a true and loving wife to any husband though there had been a pretty touch of feeling about the thomsons seasonsstill still she was not all that he fancied that a wife should be he was quite willing to give £500 for dick but after that he thought that he would have had almost enough of the shands he could not marry maria and so he must say plainly if called upon to declare himself in the matter there was an easiness about the family generally which enabled him to hope that the difficulty would be light it would be as nothing compared with that coming scene between himself and aunt polly perhaps between himself and his uncle babington or perhapsworse againbetween himself and julia  when he found himself alone with maria in the drawingroom on the following morning he almost thought that it must have been arranged by the family doesnt it seem almost no time since you went away said the young lady  it has gone quicklybut a great deal has been done  i suppose so poor dick  yes indeed poor fellow we can only hope about dick i have been speaking to your father about him  of course we all know that you did your very best for him he has said so himself when he has written but youyou have been fortunate  yes i have done very well there is so much chance at it that there is nothing to be proud of  i am sure there is a great dealcleverness and steadiness and courage and all that we were delighted to hear it though poor dick could not share it with you you have made an immense fortune  oh dear nonot that i have been able to get over the little difficulties which i left behind me when i went away and have got something in hand to live upon  and now  i suppose i shall go back again said caldigate with an air of indifference  go back again said maria who had not imagined this but still a man going back to australia might take a wife with him she would not object to the voyage her remembrance of the evening on which she had crept down and put the little book into his valise was so strong that she felt herself to be justified in being in love with him but not for always  certainly notbut just to wind up affairs  it would be no more than a pleasant weddingtourand perhaps she could do something for poor dick she could take the shirts so far on their destination  oh mr caldigate how well i remember that last night  so indeed do iand the book the hardship upon the moth is that though he has already scorched himself terribly in the flame and burned up all the tender fibre of his wings yet he cant help returning to the seductions of the tallowcandle till his whole body has become a wretched cinder why should he have been the first to speak of the book  of course she blushed and of course she stammered but in spite of her stammering she could say a word i dare say you never looked at it  indeed i didvery often once when dick saw it in my hands he wanted to take it away from me  poor dick  but i have never parted with it for an hour  where is it now she asked  here said caldigate pulling it out of the breastpocket of his coat if he had had the presence of mind to say that he had lent the book to another young lady and that she had never returned it there might probably have been an end of this little trouble at once but when the little volume appeared just as though it had been kept close to his heart during all these four years of course she was entitled to hope he had never opened the book since that morning in his cabin not caring for the academic beauties of thomsons seasonshad never looked at it till it had occurred to him as proper that he should take it with him to pollington now he brought it out of his pocket and she put out her hand to receive it from him you are not going to take it back again  certainly not if it be of any value to you  do you not value the presents which your friends make you  if i care for the friends i do  as i care very much for this friend i shall keep the book  i dont think that can be true mr caldigate  he was painfully near the blazedetermined not to be burned and yet with no powers of flying away from the candle into the farthest corner of the room why not true i have kept it hitherto it has been with me in many very strange places  then there was a pausewhile he thought of escaping and she of utilising the occasion and yet it was not in her nature to be unmaidenly or aggressive only if he did like her it would be so very nice and it is so often the case that men want a little encouragement i dare say you thought more of the book than the donor  that is intended to be unkind  nocertainly not i can never be unkind to a friend who has been so very good as you were to poor dick whatever else may happen i shallneverforgetthat by this time there was a faint sound of sobbing to be heard and then she turned away her face that she might wipe a tear from her eyes it was a real tear and a real sob and she really thought that she was in love with him  i know i ought not to have come here he said  why not she asked energetically  because my coming would give rise to so much sadness about your brother  i am so glad you have comeso very glad of course we wanted to hear and besides  what besides  papa and mamma and all of them are so glad to see you we never forget old friends then again there was silence never she repeated as she rose from her chair slowly and went out of the room though he had fluttered flamewards now and again though he had shown some mothlike aptitudes he had not shown himself to be a downright foolish blindeyed moth determined to burn himself to a cinder as a moth should do and sheshe was weak having her opportunity at command she went away and left him because she did not know what more to say she went away to her own bedroom and cried and had a headache during the remainder of the day and yet there was no other day  late that evening just at the hour when on the previous night he was closeted with the father he found himself closeted with the mother she has never forgotten you for one moment since you left us said the mother mrs shand had rushed into the subject so quickly that these were almost the first words she said to him he remained quite quiet looking out from the open window into the moonlight when a distinct proposition was made to him like this he certainly would not be a moth i dont know whether you have thought of her too mr caldigate he only shook his head that is so  i hope you do not think that i have been to blame in any way he said with a conscience somewhat strickenfor he remembered well that he had kissed the young lady on that evening four years ago  oh no i have no complaint to make my poor child it is a pity but i have nothing more to say it must be so then  i am the least settled man in all the world mrs shand  but at some future time  i fear not my mind is intent on other things so it wasintent on hester bolton but the statement as he made it was certainly false for it was intended to deceive mrs shand shook hands with him kindly however as she sent him away to bed telling him that breakfast should be ready for him at eight the next morning  his train left pollington at nine and at eight the doctor with all his family were there to greet him at the breakfasttablewith all the family except maria the mother in the most natural tone in the world said that poor maria had a headache and could not come down they filled his plate with eggs and bacon and toast and were as good to him as though he had blighted no hopes and broken no heart he whispered one word at going to the doctor pray remember that whenever you think the money can be of use it is there i consider that i owe him quite as much as that the father grasped his hand and all of them blessed him as he went  if i can only get away from babington as easily he said to himself as he took his place in the railway carriage     chapter xvi  again at babington    the affair of julia babington had been made to him in set terms and had if not accepted not been at once refused no doubt this had occurred four years ago and if either of them had married since they would have met each other without an unpleasant reminiscence but they had not done so and there was no reason why the original proposition should not hold good after escaping from babington he had indeed given various reasons why such a marriage was impossible he had sold his inheritance he was a ruined man he was going out to australia as a simple miner it was only necessary for him to state all this and it became at once evident that he was below the notice of julia babington but everything had been altered since that he had regained his inheritance he had come back a rich man and he was more than ever indebted to the family because of the violent fight they had made on his behalf just as he was going as he journeyed to babington all this was clear to him and it was clear to him also that from his first entrance into the house he must put on an air of settled purpose he must gird up his loins seriously he must let it be understood that he was not as he used to be ready for worldly lectures from his aunt or for romping with his female cousins or for rats or rabbits or partridges with the male members of the family the cares of the world must be seen to sit heavy on him and at the very first mention of a british wife he must declare himself to be wedded to polyeuka  at babington he was received with many fatted calves the whole family were there to welcome him springing out upon him and dragging him out of the fly as soon as he had entered the park gates aunt polly almost fainted as she was embracing him under an oak tree and tears real tears ran down the squires face as he shook both his nephews hands at once by george said the babington heir youre the luckiest fellow i ever heard of we all thought folking was gone for good as though the possessions of folking were the summit of human bliss caldigate with all the girls around him could not remonstrate with words but his spirit did remonstrate oh john we are so very very very very glad to have you back again said julia sobbing and laughing at the same time he had kissed them all of course and now julia was close to his elbow as he walked up to the house  in the midst of all this there was hardly opportunity for that deportment which he meant to exercise when fatted calves are being killed for you by the dozen it is very difficult to repudiate the good nature of the slaughterers little efforts he did make even before he got to the house i hardly know how i stand just yet he had said in answer to his uncles congratulations as to his wealth i must go out again at any rate  back to australia asked his aunt  i fear so it is a kind of businessgoldminingin which it is very hard for a man to know what hes worth a claim that has been giving you a thousand pounds net every month for two years past comes all of sudden a great deal worse than valueless you cant give it up and you have to throw back your thousands in profitless work  i wouldnt do that said the squire  id stick to what id got said the babington heir  it is a very difficult business said caldigate with a considerable amount of deportment and an assumed look of ageas though the cares of goldseeking had made him indifferent to all the lighter joys of existence  but you mean to live at folking asked aunt polly  i should think probably not but a man situated as i am never can say where he means to live  but you are to have folking whispered the squirewhispered it so that all the party heard the wordswhispering not from reticence but excitement  thats the idea at present said the folking heir but polyeuka is so much more to me than folking a gold mine with fifty or sixty thousand pounds worth of plant about it aunt polly is an imperious mistress in all this our hero was calumniating himself polyeuka and the plant he was willing to abandon on very moderate terms and had arranged to wipe his hands of the whole concern if those moderate terms were accepted but cousin julia and aunt polly were enemies against whom it was necessary to assume whatever weapons might come to his hand  he had arranged to stay a week at babington he had considered it all very deeply and had felt that as two days was the least fraction of time which he could with propriety devote to the shands so must he give at least a week to babington there was therefore no necessity for any immediate violence on the part of the ladies the whole week might probably have been allowed to pass without absolute violence had he not shown by various ways that he did not intend to make many visits to the old haunts of his childhood before his return to australia when he said that he should not hunt in the coming winter that he feared his hand was out for shooting that he had an idea of travelling on the continent during the autumn and that there was no knowing when he might be summoned back to polyeuka of course there came across aunt pollys mindand probably also across julias mindan idea that he meant to give them the slip again on the former occasion he had behaved badly this was their opinion but as it had turned out his circumstances at the moment were such as to make his conduct pardonable he had been harassed by the importunities both of his father and of davis and that under such circumstances he should have run away from his affianced bride was almost excusable but now it was very different now something must be settled it was very well to talk about polyeuka a man who has engaged himself in business must no doubt attend to it but married men can attend to business quite as well as they who are single at any rate there could be no reason why the previous engagement should not be consolidated and made a family affair there was felt to be something almost approaching to resistance in what he had said and done already therefore aunt polly flew to her weapons and summoned julia also to take up arms he must be bound at once with chains but the chains were made as soft as love and flattery could make them aunt polly was almost angrywas prepared to be very angrybut not the less did she go on killing fatted calves  there were archery meetings at this time through the country the period of the year being unfitted for other sports it seemed to caldigate as though all the bows and all the arrows had been kept specially for himas though he was the great toxophilite of the agewhereas no man could have cared less for the amusement than he he was carried here and was carried there and then there was a great gathering in their own park at home but it always came to pass that he and julia were shooting togetheras though it were necessary that she should teach himthat she should make up by her dexterity for what was lost by his awkwardnessthat she by her peculiar sweetness should reconcile him to his new employment before the week was over there was a feeling among all the dependants at babington and among many of the neighbours that everything was settled and that miss julia was to be the new mistress of folking  caldigate knew that it was so he perceived the growth of the feeling from day to day he could not say that he would not go to the meetings all of which had been arranged beforehand nor could he refuse to stand up beside his cousin julia and shoot his arrows directly after she had shot hers nor could he refrain from acknowledging that though she was awkward in a drawingroom she was a buxom young woman dressed in green with a feather in her hat and a bow in her hand and then she could always shoot her arrows straight into the bullseye but he was well aware that the new hat had been bought specially for him and that the sharpest arrow from her quiver was intended to be lodged in his heart he was quite determined that any such shooting as that should be unsuccessful  has he said anything the mother asked the daughter not a word this occurred on the sunday night he had reached babington on the previous tuesday and was to go to folking on next tuesday not a word the reply was made in a tone almost of anger julia did believe that her cousin had been engaged to her and that she actually had a right to him now that he had come back no longer ruined  some men never do said aunt polly not wishing to encourage her daughters anger just at present some men are never left alone with a girl for half a moment but what they are talking stuff and nonsense others never seem to think about it in the least but whether its the one or whether its the other it makes no difference afterwards he never had much talk of that kind ill just say a word to him julia  the saying of the word was put off till late on sunday evening sunday was rather a trying day at babington if hunting shooting fishing croquet lawnbilliards bow and arrows battledore and shuttlecock with every other game as games come up and go constitute a worldly kind of life the babingtons were worldly there surely never was a family in which any kind of work was so wholly out of the question and every amusement so much a matter of course but if worldliness and religion are terms opposed to each other then they were not worldly there were always prayers for the whole household morning and evening there were two services on sunday at the first of which the males and at both of which the females were expected to attend but the great struggle came after dinner at nine oclock when aunt polly always read a sermon out loud to the assembled household aunt polly had a certain power of her own and no one dared to be absent except the single servant who was left in the kitchen to look after the fire  the squire himself was always there but a peculiar chair was placed for him supposed to be invisible to the reader in which he slept during the whole time subject to correction from a neighbouring daughter in the event of his snoring an extra bottle of port after dinner was another sunday observance which added to the irritability of the occasionso that the squire when the reading and prayers were over would generally be very cross and would take himself up to bed almost without a word and the brothers would rush away almost with indecent haste to their smoking as the novels had all been put away into a cupboard and the good books which were kept for the purpose strewed about in place of them and as knitting and even music were tabooed the girls having nothing to do would also go away at an early hour  john would you mind staying a few moments with me said aunt polly in her softest voice when caldigate was hurrying after his male cousins he knew that the hour had come and he girded up his loins  come nearer john she saidand he came nearer so that she could put her hand upon his do you remember john when you and i and julia were together in that little room upstairs there was so much pathos in her voice she did her acting so well that his respect for her was greatly augmentedas was also his fear she remembers it very well  of course i remember it aunt polly its one of those things that a man doesnt forget  a man ought not to forget such a scene as that she said shaking her head a man would be very hard of heart if he could forget it  now must be the moment for his exertion she had spoken so plainly as to leave no doubt of her meaning and she was pausing for an answer yet he hesitatednot in his purpose but doubting as to his own manner of declaring it he must be very decided upon that he was resolved he would be decided though they should drag him in pieces with wild horses for it afterwards but he would fain be gentle with his aunt if it were possible my dear aunt polly it wont do im not going to be caught and so you may as well give it over that was what he wished her to understandbut he would not say it in such language much was due to her though she was struggling to catch him in a trap when i had made such a fool of myself before i wentabout money he said i thought that was all over  but you have made anything but a fool of yourself since she replied triumphantly you have gone out into the world like a man and have made your fortune and have so returned that everybody is proud of you now you can take a wife to yourself and settle down and be a happy goodman  it was exactly his view of lifeonly there was a difference about the wife to be taken he certainly had never said a word to his cousin which could justify this attack upon him the girl had been brought to him in a cupboard and he had been told that he was to marry her and that when he had been young and drowned with difficulties how is a man ever to escape if he must submit under such circumstances as these my dear aunt polly i had better tell you at once that i cannot marry my cousin julia those were the words which he did speak and as he spoke there was a look about his eyes and his mouth which ought to have made her know that there was no hope  and why not john caldigate is this you that i hear  why should i  because you promised it  i never did aunt polly  and because she loves you  even if it were so am i to be bound by that but indeed indeed i never even suggested itnever thought of it i am very fond of my cousin very fond of all my cousins but marriage is a different thing i am inclined to think that cousins had better not marry  you should have said that before but it is nonsense cousins marry every day there is nothing about it either in the bible or the prayerbook she will die  aunt polly said this in a tone of voice which made it a matter of regret that she should not have been educated for drury lane but as she said it he could not avoid thinking of julias large ankles and red cheeks and of the new green hat and feather a girl with large ankles is one may suppose as liable to die for love as though she were as fine about her feet as a thoroughbred filly and there is surely no reason why a true heart and a pair of cherry cheeks should not go together but our imagination has created ideas in such matters so fixed that it is useless to contend against them in our endeavours to produce effects these ideas should be remembered and obeyed i hope not on that account said caldigate and as he uttered the words some slightest suspicion of a smile crossed his face  then aunt polly blazed forth in wrath and at such a moment as this you can laugh  indeed i did not laughi am very far from laughing aunt polly  because i am anxious for my child my child whom you have deceived you make yourself merry with me  i am not merry i am miserably unhappy because of all this but i cannot admit that i have deceived my cousin all that was settled i thought when i went away but coming back at the end of four years of four such long years with very different ideas of life  what ideas  wellat any rate with ideas of having my own wayi cannot submit myself to this plan of yours which though it would have given me so much  it would give you everything sir  granted but i cannot take everything it is better that we should understand each other so that my cousin for whom i have the most sincere regard should not be annoyed  much you care  what shall i say  it signifies nothing what you say you are a false man you have inveigled your cousins affections and now you say that you can do nothing for her this comes from the sort of society you have kept out at botany bay i suppose a mans word there is worth nothing and that the women are of such a kind they dont mind it it is not the way with gentlemen here in england let me tell you that then she stalked out of the room leaving him either to go to bed or join the smokers or to sit still and repent at his leisure as he might please his mind however was chiefly occupied for the next halfhour with thinking whether it would be possible for him to escape from babington on the following morning  before the morning he had resolved that let the torment of the day be what it might he would bear itunless by chance he might be turned out of the house but no tragedy such as that came to relieve him aunt polly gave him his tea at breakfast with a sternly forbidding lookand julia was as cherrycheeked as ever though very silent the killing of calves was over and he was left to do what he pleased during the whole day one spark of comfort came to him john my boy said his uncle in a whisper whats the matter between you and madame mr babington would sometimes call his wife madame when he was half inclined to laugh at her caldigate of course declared that there was nothing wrong the squire shook his head and went away but from this it appeared to caldigate that the young ladys father was not one of the conspiratorsby ascertaining which his mind was somewhat relieved  on the next morning the fly came for him and he went away without any kisses upon the whole he was contented with both his visits and was inclined to assure himself that a man has only to look a difficulty in the face and that the difficulty will be difficult no longer     chapter xvii  again at puritan grange    as caldigate travelled home to folking he turned many things in his mind in the first place he had escaped and that to him was a matter of selfcongratulation he had declared his purpose in reference to his cousin julia very clearlyand though he had done so he had not quarrelled utterly with the family as far as the young ladys father was concerned or her brothers there had been no quarrel at all the illwill against him was confined to the women but as he thought of it all he was not proud of himself he had received great kindness from their hands and certainly owed them much in return when he had been a boy he had been treated almost as one of the familybut as he had not been quite one of them would it not have been natural that he should be absorbed in the manner proposed and then he could not but admit to himself that he had been deficient in proper courage when he had been first caught and taken into the cupboard on that occasion he had neither accepted nor rejected the young lady and in such a matter as this silence certainly may be supposed to give consent though he rejoiced in his escape he was not altogether proud of his conduct in reference to his friends at babington  would it not have been better that he should have told his aunt frankly that his heart was engaged elsewhere the ladys name would have been asked and the ladys name could not have been given but he might in this way have prepared the way for the tidings which would have to be communicated should he finally be successful with hester bolton now such news would reach them as an aggravation of the injury for that however there could be no remedy the task at present before him was that of obtaining a footing in the house at chesterton and the more he thought of it the more he was at a loss to know how to set about it they could not intend to shut such a girl up through all her young years as in a convent there must be present to the minds of both of them an idea that marriage would be good for her or at any rate that she should herself have some choice in the matter and if there were to be any soninlaw why should not he have as good a chance as any other when they should learn how constantly the girls image had been present to his mind so far away during so many years under such hard circumstances would not that recommend him to them had he not proved himself to be steady industrious and a good man of business in regard to position and fortune was he not such as a father would desire for his daughter having lost his claim to folking had he not regained itand in doing so had he not shown himself to be something much more than merely the heir to folking an immediate income would of course be necessarybut there was money enough he would ask the old man for nothing reports said that though the old man had been generous to his own sons still he was fond of money he should have the opportunity of bestowing his daughter in marriage without being asked for a shilling and then john caldigate bethought himself with some pride that he could make a proper settlement on his wife without burdening the estate at folking with any dowers but of what use would be all this if he could not get at the girl to tell her that he loved her  he might indeed get at the father and tell his purpose plainly and honestly but he thought that his chance of prevailing with the girl might be better than with the father in such cases it is so often the daughter who prevails with her own parents after she has surrendered her own heart the old man had looked at him sternly had seemed even in that moment of time to disapprove of him but the girl well in such an interview as that there had not been much scope for approval nor was he a man likely to flatter himself that any girl could fall in love with him at first sight but she had not looked sternly at him in the few words which she had spoken her voice had been very sweet both of them had said they remembered him after the long interval that had passedbut the manner of saying so had been very different he was almost sure that the old man would be averse to him though he could tell himself personally that there was no just cause for such aversion but if this were so he could not forward his cause by making his offer through the father  well john how has it gone with you at babington his father asked almost as soon as they were together  it had not been difficult to tell his father of the danger before he made his visit but now he hesitated before he could avow that the young ladys hand had again been offered to him pretty well sir we had a good deal of archery and that kind of thing it was rather slow  i should think so was there nothing besides the archery  not much  the young lady was not troublesome  perhaps the less we say about it the better sir they were very kind to me when i was a boy  i have nothing to say at all unless i am to be called on to welcome her as a daughterinlaw  you will not have to do that sir  i suppose john you mean to marry some day said the father after a pause then it occurred to the son that he must have some one whom he could trust in this matter which now occupied his mind and that no one probably might be so able to assist him as his father i wish i knew what your idea of life is continued mr caldigate i fear you will be growing tired of this place and that when you get back to your goldmines you will stay there  there is no fear of that i do not love the place well enough  if you were settled here i should feel more comfortable i sometimes think john that if you would fix yourself i would give the property up to you altogether and go away with my books into some town cambridge perhaps would do as well as any other  you must never do that sir you must not leave folking but as for myselfi have ideas about my own life  are they such that you can tell them  yesyou shall hear them all but i shall expect you to help meor at least not turn against me  turn against you john i hope i may never have to do that again what is that you mean this he said very seriously there was usually in his voice something of a tone of bantera subdued cynicismwhich had caused everybody near him to be afraid of him and which even yet was habitual to him but now that was all gone was there to be any new source of trouble betwixt him and his son  i intend to ask hester bolton to be my wife said john caldigate  the father who was standing in the library slapped both his hands down upon the table hester bolton  is there any objection  what do you know about her whyshes a child  she is nearly twenty sir  have you ever seen her  yes i have seen hertwice i daresay youll think it very absurd but i have made up my mind about it if i say that i was thinking about it all the time i was in australia of course you will laugh at me  i will not laugh at you at all john  if any one else were to say so to me i should laugh at them but yet it was so have you ever seen her  i suppose i have i think i remember a little girl  for beauty i have never seen anybody equal to her said the lover i wish youd go over to chesterton and judge for yourself  they wouldnt know what such a thing meant it is years since i have been in the house i believe that mrs bolton devotes herself to religious exercises and that she regards me as a pagan  thats just the difficulty sir how am i to get at her but you may be sure of this i mean to do it if i were beat i do think that then i should go back and bury myself in the goldmines you asked me what i meant to do about my future life that is my purpose if she were my wife i should consult her we might travel part of the time and i might have a farm i should always look upon folking as home but till that is settled when you ask me what i mean to do with my life i can only say that i mean to marry hester bolton  did you tell them at babington  i have told nobody but you how am i to set about it  then mr caldigate sat down and began to scratch his head and to consider i dont suppose they ever go out anywhere  i dont think they doexcept to church  you cant very well ask her there you can always knock at the housedoor  i can call again oncebut what if i am refused then it is of no use knocking if a man does not get in after a little more conversation the squire was so far persuaded that he assented to the proposed marriage as far as his assent was required but he did not see his way to give any assistance he could only suggest that his son should go direct to the father and make his proposition in the oldfashioned legitimate fashion but when it was put to him whether mr bolton would not certainly reject the offer unless it were supported by some goodwill on the part of his own daughter he acknowledged that it might probably be so you see said the squire he believes in gold but he doesnt believe in goldmines  it is that accursed davis that stands against me said the son  john caldigate no doubt had many things to trouble him before he had resolved on making his second visit to chesterton he received a most heartrending epistle from aunt polly in which he was assured that he was quite as dear to her as ever quite as dear as her own children and in which he was implored to return to the haunts of his childhood where everybody loved him and admired him after what had passed he was determined not to revisit the haunts till he was married or at any rate engaged to be married but there was a difficulty in explaining this to aunt polly without an appearance of ingratitude and then there were affairs in australia which annoyed him tom crinkett was taking advantage of his absence in reference to polyeukathat his presence would soon be required thereand other things were not going quite smoothly he had much to trouble himbut still he was determined to carry out his purpose with hester bolton since the day on which he had roused himself to the necessity of an active life he had ever called upon himself not to let the grass grow under his feet and he had taught himself to think that there were few things a man could not achieve if he would only live up to that motto therefore though he was perplexed by letters from australia and though his aunt polly was a great nuisance he determined to persevere at once if he allowed himself to revisit nobble before he had settled this matter with hester bolton would it not be natural that hester bolton should be the wife of some other man before he returned  with all this on his mind he started off one day on horseback to cambridge when he left folking he had not quite made up his mind whether he would go direct to the bank and ask for old mr bolton or make a first attempt at that fortified castle at chesterton but on entering the town he put his horse up at an inn just where the road turns off to chesterton and proceeded on foot to the house this was about a mile distant from the stable and as he walked that mile he resolved that if he could get into the house at all he would declare his purpose to some one before he left it what was the use of shillyshallying who ever did anything by letting the grass grow under his feet so he knocked boldly at the door and asked for mrs bolton after a considerable time the maid came and told him apparently with much hesitation that mrs bolton was at home he was quite determined to ask for miss bolton if mrs bolton were denied to him but the girl said that mrs bolton was at home seeming by her manner to say at the same time i cannot tell a lie about it because of the sin but i dont know what business you can have here and im sure that my mistress does not want to see any such a one as you nevertheless she showed him into the big sittingroom on the left hand of the hall and as he entered he saw the skirts of a ladys dress vanishing through another door had there been a moment allowed him he would boldly have called the lady back for he was sure that the lady was hesterbut the lady was gone and the door closed before he could open his mouth  then he waited for full ten minutes which of course seemed to him to be very much more than an hour at last the door was opened and mrs bolton appeared the reader is not to suppose that she was an ugly crosslooking old woman she was neither ugly nor old nor cross when she had married mr bolton she had been quite young and now she was not much past forty and she was handsome too with a fine oval face which suited well with the peculiar simplicity of her dress and the sober seriousness of her gait and manner it might perhaps be said of her that she tried to look old and uglyand cross too but that she did not succeed she now greeted her visitor very coldly and having asked after old mr caldigate sat silent looking at john caldigate as though there were nothing more possible for her to say  i could not but come to see you and thank you for your kindness before i went said john  i remember your coming about some business we have very few visitors here  i went out you know as a miner  i think i heard mr bolton say so  and i have succeeded very well  oh indeed  so well that i have been able to come back and though i may perhaps be obliged to revisit the colony to settle my affairs there i am going to live here at home  i hope that will be comfortable to you at every word she spoke her voice took more and more plainly that tone of wonder which we are all of us apt to express when called on to speak on matters which we are at the moment astonished to have introduced to us  yes mrs bolton i hope it will and now i have got something particular to say  perhaps you had better seemr boltonat the bank  i hope i may be able to do so i quite intend it but as i am here if you will allow me i will say a word to you first in all matters there is nothing so good as being explicit she looked at him as though she was altogether afraid of him and indeed she was her husbands opinion of the young man had been very bad five years agoand she had not heard that it had been altered since young men who went out to the colonies because they were ruined were to her thinking the worst among the badmen who drank and gambled and indulged in strange lives mere castaways the adopted of satan and to her thinking among men none were so rough as minersand among miners none were so godless so unrestrained so wild as the seekers after gold she had read perhaps something of the spaniards in central america and regarded such adventurers as she would pirates and freebooters generally and then with regard to the caldigates generallythe elder of whom she knew to have been one of her husbands intimate friends in his less regenerated daysshe believed them to be infidel freethinkers she was not therefore by any means predisposed in favour of this young man and when he spoke of his desire to be explicit she thought that he had better be explicit anywhere rather than in her drawingroom you may remember he said that i had the pleasure of meeting your daughter here before i left the country five years ago then she listened with all her ears there were not many things in this empty vain hard unattractive world which excited her but the one thing in regard to which she had hopes and fears doubts and resolutionsthe one matter as to which she knew that she must ever be on her guard and yet as to which she hardly knew how she was to exercise her carewas her child and once i have seen her since i have been back though only for a moment then he paused as though expecting that she should say somethingbut what was it possible that she should say she only looked at him with all her eyes and retreated a little from him with her body as anxious to get away from a man of his class who should dare even to speak to her of her girl the truth is mrs bolton that her image has been present to me through all my wanderings and i am here to ask her to be my wife she rose from her chair as though to fly from himand then sitting down again stared at him with her mouth open and her eyes fixed upon him his wife her hester to become the wife of such a one as that her girl as to whom when thinking of the future life of her darling she had come to tell herself that there could be no man good enough pure enough true enough firm enough in his faith and life to have so tender so inestimable a treasure committed to his charge     chapter xviii  robert bolton    caldigate felt at the moment that he had been very abruptso abrupt as to have caused infinite dismay but then it had been necessary that he should be abrupt in order that he might get the matter understood the ordinary approaches were not open to him and unless he had taken a more than usually rapid advantage of the occasion which he had made for himself he would have had to leave the house without having been able to give any of its inmates the least idea of his purpose and thenas he said to himselfmatrimony is honest he was in all worldly respects a fit match for the young lady to his own thinking there was nothing preposterous in the nature of his request though it might have been made with some precipitate informality he did not regard himself exactly as the lady regarded him and therefore though he saw her surprise he still hoped that he might be able to convince her that in all that he was doing he was as anxious for the welfare of her child as she could be herself  she sat there so long without saying a word that he found himself obliged to renew his suit of course mrs bolton i am aware how very little you know of me  nothing at all she answered hurriedlyor rather too much  he blushed up to his eyes perfectly understanding the meaning of her words and knowing that he had not deserved them he was almost angry if you will make inquiry i think you will find that i have so far succeeded as to justify you in hoping that i may be able to marry and settle myself in my own country  you dont know my daughter at all  very little  it is quite out of the question she is very young and such a thing has never occurred to her and we are not the same sort of people  why not mrs bolton your husband and my father have been intimate friends for a great many years it is not as though i had taken up the idea only yesterday it has been present with me comforting me during all my work for the last five years i know all your daughters features as though she had been my constant companion the lady shivered and almost trembled at this profanation of her childs name it was trouble to her that one so holy should ever have been thought about by one so unholy of course i do not ask for anything at presentbut will you not consult your husband as to the propriety of allowing her to make my acquaintance  i shall tell my husband of course  and will repeat to him what i say  i shall tell himas i should any other most wild proposition that might be made to me but i am quite sure that he will be very angry  angry why should he be angry  because then she stopped  i do not think mrs bolton that there can be any cause for anger if i were a beggar if i were below her in position if i had not means to keep a wifeeven if i were a stranger to his name he might be angry but i do not think he can be angry with me now because in the most straightforward way i come to the young ladys parents and tell them that i love their child is it a disgrace to me that of all whom i have seen i think her to be the loveliest and best her father may reject me but he will be very unreasonable if he is angry with me  she could not tell him about the dove and the kite or the lamb and the wolf she could not explain to him that he was a sinner unregenerated a wild man in her estimation a being of quite another kind than herself and therefore altogether unfitted to be the husband of her girl her husband no doubt could do all thisif he would but then she too had her own skeleton in her own cupboard she was not quite assured of her own husbands regeneration he went to church regularly and read his bible and said his prayers but she fearedshe was almost surethat he liked the bankbooks better than his bible that he would reject this offer from john caldigate she did not doubt she had always heard her husband speak of the man with disapprobation and scorn she had heard the whole story of davis and the newmarket debts she had heard too the mans subsequent prosperity spoken of as a thing of chanceas having come from gambling on an extensive scale she herself regarded money acquired in so unholy a way as likely to turn to slatestones or to fly away and become worse than nothing she knew that mr bolton whether regenerate or not regarded young caldigate as an adventurer and that therefore the idea of such a marriage would be as unpalatable to him as to herself but she did not dare to tell her visitor that he was an unregenerate kite lest her husband would not support her  whatever more you have got to say you had better say it to him she replied to the lover when he had come to the end of his defence at that moment the door opened and a gentleman entered the room this was mr robert bolton the attorney now of all her husbands sonswho were of course not her sonsmrs bolton saw this one the most frequently and perhaps liked him the least or it might be juster to say that she was more afraid of him than of the others the two eldest who were both in the bank were quiet sober men who lived affluently and were married to religious wives and brought up their children plentifully and piously she did not see very much of them because her life was not a social life but among her friends they were the most intimate but roberts wife was given to gaiety and dinnerparties and had been seen even at balls and robert himself was much oftener at the grange than either of the other brothers he managed his fathers private affairs and was perhaps of all his sons the best liked by the father he was prosperous in his business and was reported to be the leading lawyer in the town in the old cambridge days he had entertained john caldigate at his house and though they had not met since the miners return from australia each at once knew the other and their greeting was friendly wheres hess said robert asking at once after his sister  she is engaged robert said mrs bolton very seriously and very firmly  she gave me a commission about some silk and margaret says that it cant be executed in cambridge she must write to fanny margaret was mrs robert bolton and fanny was the wife of the barrister brother who lived in london  i will tell her robert  all the same i should have liked to have seen her  she is engaged robert this was said almost more seriously and more firmly than before  well caldigate said the attorney turning to the visitor so you are the one man who has not only gone to the gold country and found gold but has brought his gold home with him  i have brought a little homebut i hope others have done so before  i have never heard of any you seem to have been uncommonly lucky hard work wasnt it  hard enough at first  and a good deal of chance  if a man will work steadily and has backbone enough to stand up against reverses without consoling himself with drink and if when the gold comes he can refrain from throwing it about as though it were endless i think a man may be tolerably sure to earn something then he told the story of the horse with the golden shoes  shoes of gold upon a horse said mrs bolton holding up both her hands the man who could even tell such a story must be an adventurer but nevertheless the story had interested her so that she had been enticed into taking some part in the conversation  when caldigate got up to take his leave robert bolton offered to walk back to the town with him he had expected to find his father but would now look for him at the bank they started together and as they went caldigate told his story to the young ladys halfbrother it occurred to him that of all the family robert bolton would be the most reasonable in such a matter and that of all the family he might perhaps be the best able to give assistance when robert bolton had heard it all at first he whistled then he asked the following question what did she say to you  she did not give me much encouragement  i should think not though i say it who shouldnt hester is the sweetest girl in cambridgeshire but her mother thinks her much too good to be given in marriage to any man this kind of thing was bound to come about some day  but mrs bolton seems to have some personal objection to me  thats probable  i dont know why she should  she has got one treasure of her own in enjoying which she is shut out from all the rest of the world is it unnatural that she should be a little suspicious about a man who proposes to take her treasure away from her  she must surrender her treasure to some onesome day  if it be so she will hope to do so to a man of whose antecedents she may know more than she does of yours what she does know of you is of a nature to frighten her you will excuse me  oh of course  she has heard that you went away under a cloud having surrendered your estate that was against you wellyou have come back and she hears that you have brought some money with you she does not care very much about money but she does care about regularity and fixed habits if hess is to be married at all she would especially wish that her husband should be a religious man perhaps you are  i am neither the one thing nor the otherespecially  and therefore peculiarly dangerous in her eyes it is natural that she should oppose you  what am i to do then  ah how am i to answer that the whole story is very romantic and i do not know that we are a romantic family my father is autocratic in his own house  this last assurance seemed to contain some comfort as mrs bolton would be his enemy in the matter it was well that the power of deciding should be in other hands i do not mean to give it up said he  i suppose you must if they wont open their doors to you  i think they ought to allow me to have the chance of seeing her  i dont see why they should mind i am not saying anything of this for myself if i were my sisters guardian i should take the trouble to make many inquiries before i either asked you into my house or declined to do so i should not give access to you or to any other gentleman merely because he asked it  let them make inquiry  mrs bolton probably thinks that she already knows enough what my father may say i cannot even surmise  will you tell him  if you wish it  tell him also that i will wait upon him at once if he desires it he shall know everything about my affairswhich indeed require no concealment i can settle enough upon her for her comfort if she is to have anything of her own that will be over and above as far as i am concerned myself i ask no question about that i think that a man ought to earn enough for himself and for his wife too as to religion  if i were you i would leave that alone said the lawyer  perhaps so  i will tell my father that is all i can say goodbye  so they parted and caldigate getting on his horse rode back to folking looking back at what he had done that day he was almost disposed to be contented with it the ladys too evident hostility was of course to be deprecatedbut then he had expected it as robert bolton had explained to him very clearly it was almost impossible that he should at the first be regarded by her with favourable eyes but he thought that the brother had been quite as favourable to him as he could have expected and the ice was broken the bolton family generally would know what he was about hester would not be told of courseat any rate not at once but the first steps had been taken and it must be for him now so to press the matter that the ultimate decision should be made to rest in her hands as soon as possible  what did mr bolton say to you asked the squire  i did not see him  and what did the young lady say  i did not see her  or the mamma  i did see her and told her my project  i should think she would be startled  she was not very propitious sir but that was not to be expected  she is a poor melancholy halfcrazed creature i take it said the squire at least that is what i hear the girl i should think would be glad to get away from such a home but i am afraid you will find a good many obstacles after that nothing more was said about the matter at folking for some days  but there was a great deal said upon the matter both in cambridge and at chesterton robert bolton found his father at the bank on the same afternoon and performed his promise did he see your stepmother asked the old man  oh yes and as far as i can understand did not receive very much favour at her hands  but he did not see hester  certainly not today  then the old man looked up into his sons face as though seeking some expression there from which he might take some counsel his own nature had ever been imperious but he was old now and in certain difficulties which environed him he was apt to lean on his son robert it was robert who encouraged him still to keep in his hands some share of the management of the bank and it was to robert that he could look for counsel when the ceremonious strictness of his wife at home became almost too hard even for him  it is natural to suppose that hester should be married some day said the lawyer  her mother will never wish it  she will never wish it at any given moment but she would probably assent to the proposition generally why not hester as well as another girl it is the happiest life for women  i am not sure i am not sure  women think so themselves and hester will probably be the same as others she will of course have an opinion of her own  she will be guided by her mother  not altogether it will only be fair that she should be consulted on a matter of such importance to herself  you would not tell her what this man has been saying  not necessarily i say that she should be consulted generally as to her future life in regard to this man i see no objection to him if he be a good man  he was here at college you know what he did then  yes and i know too something of what he has done since he went away disinherited and almost degraded he has come back as i hear comparatively a rich man he has got back his inheritance which might probably be settled on his children if he were to be married and all this he has done off his own bat where other men stumble so frequently he has stood on his legs no doubt he has lived with rough people but still he seems to be a gentleman hester will be well off no doubt some day  she will have somethingsomething said the old man  but this suitor asks for nothing it is not as though he were coming to you to prop him up in the world it does not look like that at least of course we ought to make inquiry as to his means  the mortgage has been paid off  so much we know and the rest may be found out i do not mean at all to say that he should be allowed to have his own way i think too much of my sister for that but in this matter we ought to regard simply her happiness and her welfareand in considering that you ought to be prepared for her coming marriage you may take it for granted that she will choose to give herself sooner or later to some man give a girl good looks and good sense and good health and she is sure to wish to be some mans wifeunless she be deterred by some conventual superstition  if there were any words capable of conveying horror to the mind of the old banker they were convents priests and papacyof which the lawyer was well aware when speaking thus of his sister mrs bolton was certainly not addicted to papistical observances nor was she at all likely to recommend the seclusion of her daughter in a convent all her religious doctrines were those of the low church but she had a tendency to arrive at similar results by other means she was so afraid of the world the flesh and the devil that she would fain shut up her child so as to keep her from the reach of all evil vowed celibacy was abominable to her because it was the resource of the roman catholics and because she had been taught to believe that conventwalls were screens for hiding unheardof wickedness but yet on behalf of her child she desired seclusion from the world fancying that so and so only might security be ensured superstition was as strong with her as with any selfflagellated nun fasting under that name she held in abhorrence but all sensual gratifications were wicked in her sight she would allow all home indulgences to her daughter each under some separate pleaconstrained to do so by excessive love but she did so always in fear and trembling lest she was giving some foothold to satan all of which robert bolton understood better even than did his father when he gave the above advice in reference to this lover     chapter xix  men are so wicked    a month had passed by since caldigates interview with mrs bolton and nothing had as yet been decided either for him or against him at chesterton and the fact that no absolute decision had been made against him may be taken as having been very much in his favour but of those who doubted and doubting had come to no decision mrs bolton herself was by no means one she was as firm as ever in her intention that the idea should not even be suggested to her daughter nor up to this time had our heros name been even mentioned to hester bolton  about a week after caldigates visit to chesterton in the early days of august he wrote to robert bolton saying that he was going into scotland for a month and that he trusted that during that time his proposition might be considered on his return he would take the liberty of calling on mr bolton at the bank in the meantime he hoped that inquiries might be made as to his position in the world and in order that such inquiries might be effectual he gave a reference to his man of business in london to this letter robert bolton sent no answer but he went up to london and did make the inquiries as suggested and consulted his brother the barrister and his sisterinlaw the barristers wife they were both of opinion that john caldigate was behaving well and were of opinion also that something should be done to liberate hester from the thraldom of her mother i knew how it would be when she grew up and became a woman said mrs william bolton nobody will be allowed to see her and she wont have a chance of settling herself when we asked her to come up here for a couple of months in the season mrs bolton sent me word that london is a terrible place for young girlsthough of course she knew that our own girls were being brought up here then the ways of mrs bolton at chesterton and hesters future life generally were discussed in a spirit that was by no means unfriendly to our hero  the suggested inquiries were made in the city and were all favourable everyone connected with the mining interests of the australian colonies knew the name of john caldigate all of that class of people were well aware of his prosperity and confirmed goodfortune he had brought with him or sent home nobody quite knew how much money but it was very well known that he had left his interest in the polyeuka mine to be sold for £60000 and now there had come word that a company had created itself for the sake of making the purchase and that the money would be forthcoming the gentleman in the city connected with mining matters did not think that mr caldigate would be called upon to go out to the colony again unless he chose to do so for his own pleasure all this robert bolton learned in the city and he learned also that the man as to whom he was making inquiry was held in high esteem for honesty perseverance and capacity the result of all this was that he returned to cambridge with a feeling that his sister ought to be allowed to make the mans acquaintance he and his brother had agreed that something should be done to liberate their sister from her present condition love on the part of a mother may be as injurious as cruelty if the mother be both tyrannical and superstitious while hester had been a child no interference had been possible or perhaps expedientbut the time had now come when something ought to be done such having been the decision in harley street where the william boltons lived robert bolton went back home with the intention of carrying it out  this could only be done through the old man and even with him not without great care he was devotedly attached to his young wifebut was very averse to having it thought that he was ruled by her indeed in all matters affecting his establishment his means and his business he would hardly admit of interference from her at all his worldly matters he kept between himself and his sons but in regard to his soul he could not restrain her and sometimes would hardly oppose her the prolonged evening prayers the sermons twice aweek the two long church services on sundaysindulgence as to the third being allowed to him only on the score of his agehe endured at her command and in regard to hester he had hitherto been ruled by his wife thinking it proper that a daughter should be left in the hands of her mother but now when he was told that if he did not interfere his girl would be constrained by the harsh bonds of an unnatural life stern as he was himself and inclined to be gloomy little as he was disposed to admit ideas of recreation and delight he did acknowledge that something should be done to relieve her but when i die she must be left in her mothers hands said the old banker  it is to be hoped that she may be in other hands before that replied his son i do not mean to say anything against my stepmotherbut for a young woman it is generally best that she should be married and in hesters peculiar position she ought to have the chance of choosing for herself  in this way something almost like a conspiracy was made on behalf of caldigate and yet the old man did not as yet abandon his prejudices against the miner a man who had at so early an age done so much to ruin himself and had then sprung so suddenly from ruin to prosperity could not he thought be regarded as a steady welltodo man of business he did agree that as regarded hester the prisonbars should be removed but he did not think that she should be invited to walk forth with mr john caldigate robert declared that his sister was quite able to form an opinion of her own and boldly suggested that hester should be allowed to come and dine at his house to meet the man asked the banker in dismay yes said robert he isnt an ogre you neednt be afraid of him i shall be thereand margaret bring her yourself if you are afraid of anything no plant ever becomes strong by being kept always away from the winds of heaven to this he could not assent at the time he knew that it was impossible to assent without consulting his wife but he was brought so far round as to think that if nothing but his own consent were wanting his girl would be allowed to go and meet the ogre  i suppose we ought to wish that hester should be married some day he said to his wife about this time she shuddered and dashed her hands together as though deprecating some evilsome event which she could hardly hope to avoid but which was certainly an evil do you not wish that yourself she shook her head is it not the safest condition in which a woman can live  how shall any one be safe among the dangers of this world nicholas she habitually called her husband by his christian name but she was the only living being who did so  more safe then said he it is the natural condition of a woman  i do not know sin is natural  very likely no doubt but marriage is not sinful  men are so wicked  some of them are  where is there one that is not steeped in sin over his head  that applies to women also doesnt it said the banker petulantly he was almost angry because she was introducing a commonplace as to the worlds condition into a particular argument as to their daughters future lifewhich he felt to be unfair and illogical  of course it does nicholas we are all black and grimed with sin men and women too and perhaps something more may be forgiven to men because they have to go out into the world and do their work but neither one nor the other can be anything but foul with sinexceptexcept  he was quite accustomed to the religious truth which was coming and in an ordinary way did not object to the doctrine which she was apt to preach to him often but it had no reference whatever to the matter now under discussion the general condition of things produced by the fall of adam could not be used as an argument against matrimony generally wicked as men and women are it is so evidently intended that they should marry and multiply that even she would not deny the general propriety of such an arrangement therefore when he was talking to her about their daughter she was illtreating him when on that occasion she flew away to her muchaccustomed discourse  whats the use then of saying that men are wicked  they are they are  not a doubt about it and so are the women but theyve got to have husbands and wives they wouldnt be any the better if there were no marrying we have to suppose that hester will do the same as other girls  i hope not nicholas  but why not  they are vain and they adorn themselves not in modest apparel as st paul says in first timothy chapter second nor with shamefacedness and sobriety but with braided hair and gold and pearls and costly array  what has that to do with it  oh nicholas  she might be married without all those things  you said you wanted her to be like other girls  no i didnt i said she would have to get married like other girls you dont want to make a nun of her  a nun i would sooner sit by her bedside and watch her die my hester a nun  very well then let her go out into the world  the world nicholas the world the flesh and the devil do they not always go together  he was much harassed and very angry he knew how unreasonable she was and yet he did not know how to answer her and she was dishonest with him because she felt herself unable to advocate in plain terms a thorough shutting up of her daughtera protecting of her from the temptation of sin by absolute and prolonged sequestrationtherefore she equivocated with him pretending to think that he was desirous of sending his girl out to have her hair braided and herself arrayed in gold and pearls it was thoroughly dishonest and he understood the dishonesty she must go somewhere he said rising from his chair and closing the conversation at this time a month had passed since caldigate had been at chesterton and he had now returned from scotland to folking  on the following day hester was taken out to dinner at the nurseries as robert boltons house was calledwas taken out by her father this was quite a new experiment as she had never dined with any of her aunts and cousins except at an early dinner almost as a childand even as a child not at her brother roberts but the banker after having declared that she must go somewhere had persisted it is not to be supposed that caldigate was on this occasion invited to meet hernor that the father had as yet agreed that any such meeting should be allowed but as william boltonthe london brotherand mrs william and one of their girls were down at cambridge it was arranged that hester should meet her relatives even so much as this was not settled without much opposition on the part of hesters mother  there was nobody at the house but members of the family the old bankers oldest son nicholas was not there as his wife and mrs robert did not get on well together mrs nicholas was almost as strict as mrs bolton herself and having no children of her own would not have sympathised at all in any desire to procure for hester the wicked luxury of a lover the second son daniel joined the party with his wife but he had married too late to have grownup children his wife was strict toobut of a medium strictness teas concerts and occasional dinner parties were with her permissibleas were also ribbons and a certain amount of costly array mrs nicholas was in the habit of telling mrs daniel that you cannot touch pitch and not be defiledgenerally intending to imply that mrs robert was the pitch and would harp on the impossibility of serving both god and mammon thinking perhaps that her brotherinlaw robert and mammon were one and the same but daniel who could go to church as often as any man on sundays and had thoroughly acquired for himself the reputation of a religious man of business had his own ideas as to proprieties and expediencies and would neither quarrel with his brother robert or allow his wife to quarrel with mrs robert so that the nicholases lived very much alone mrs nicholas and mrs bolton might have suited each other might have been congenial and a comfort each to the other but the elder son and the elder sons wife had endeavoured to prevent the old mans second marriage and there had never been a thorough reconciliation since there are people who can never forgive mrs nicholas had never forgiven the young girl for marrying the old man and the young girl had never forgiven the opposition of her elder stepdaughterinlaw to her own marriage hence it had come to pass that the nicholases were extruded from the family conclaves which generally consisted of the daniels and the roberts the williams were away in london not often having much to do with these matters but they too allied themselves with the dominant party it being quite understood that as long as the old man lived robert was and would be the most potent member of the family  when the father and the three sons were in the diningroom together after the six or seven ladies had left them the propriety of allowing john caldigate to make hesters acquaintance was fully discussed i would not for the world interfere said robert if i did not think it unfair to the dear girl that she should be shut up there altogether  do you suppose that the young man is in earnest asked daniel  as to this they all agreed that there could be no doubt he was too an old family friend welltodo in the world able to make proper settlements and not at all greedy as to a fortune with his wife even daniel bolton thought that the young man should have a chanceby saying which he was supposed to declare that the question ought to be left to the arbitrament of the young lady the old banker was unhappy and ill at ease he could not reconcile himself at once to so great a change though he felt that the excessive fears of his wife if indulged would be prejudicial to their girl still he did not wish to thrust her out into the world all at once could there not be some middle course could there not be a day named some four years hence at which she might be allowed to begin to judge for herself but his three sons were against him and he could not resist their joint influence it was therefore absolutely decided that steps should be taken for enabling john caldigate to meet hester at robert boltons house  i suppose it will end in a marriage william bolton said to his brother robert when they were alone  of course it will she is the dearest creature in the worldso good to her mother but no fool and quite aware that the kind of restraint to which she has been subjected is an injustice of course she will be gratified when a man like that tells her that he loves her he is a goodlooking fellow with a fine spirit and plenty of means how on earth can she do better  but mrs b said william who would sometimes thus disrespectfully allude to his stepmother  mrs b will do all she can to prevent it said robert but i think we shall find that hester has a will of her own  on the following day john caldigate called at the bank where the banker had a small wainscoted backparlour appropriated to himself he had already promised that he would see the young man and caldigate was shown into the little room he soon told his story and was soon clever enough to perceive that the telling of his story was at any rate permitted the old father did not receive him with astonishment and displeasure combined as the young mother had done of course he made difficulties and spoke of the thing as being beyond the bounds of probability but objection no stronger than that may be taken as amounting almost to encouragement in such circumstances and he paid evident attention to all that caldigate said about his own pecuniary affairsgoing so far as to say that he was not in a condition to declare whether he would give his daughter any fortune at all on her marriage  it is quite unnecessary said caldigate  she will probably have something at my death rejoined the old man  and when may i see her asked caldigate  in answer to that mr bolton would not at first make any suggestion whatsoeverfalling back upon his old fears and declaring that there could be no such meetings at all but at last allowing that the lover should discuss the matter with his son robert  perhaps i may have been mistaken about the young man caldigate the banker said to his wife that night  oh nicholas  i only say that perhaps i may have been mistaken  you are not thinking of hester  i said nothing about hester thenbut perhaps i may have been mistaken in my opinion about that young man john caldigate  john caldigate as he rode home after his interview at the bank almost felt that he had cleared away many difficulties and that by his perseverance he might probably be enabled to carry out the dream of his earlier youth     chapter xx  hesters courage    after that caldigate did not allow the grass to grow under his feet and before the end of november the two young people were engaged as robert bolton had said hester was of course flattered and of course delighted with this new joy john caldigate was just the man to recommend himself to such a girl not too light not too prone to pleasure not contenting himself with bicycles cricket matches or billiards and yet not wholly given to serious matters as had been those among whom she had hitherto passed her days and he was one who could speak of his love with soft winning words neither roughly nor yet with too much of shamefaced diffidence and when he told her how he had sworn to himself after seeing her that oncethat once when all before him in life was enveloped in doubt and difficultythat he would come home and make her his wife she thought that the manly constancy of his heart was almost divine of course she loved him with all her heart he was in all respects one made to be loved by a womanand then what else had she ever had to love when once it was arranged that he should be allowed to speak to her the thing was done she did not at once tell him that it was done she took some few short halcyon weeks to dally with the vow which her heart was ready to make but those around her knew that the vow had been inwardly made and those who were anxious on her behalf with a new anxiety with a new responsibility redoubled their inquiries as to john caldigate how would robert bolton or mrs robert excuse themselves to that frightened miserable mother if at last it should turn out that john caldigate was not such as they had represented him to be  but no one could pick a hole in him although many attempts to pick holes were made the question of his money was put quite at rest by the transference of all his securities balances and documents to the boltons bank and the £60000 for polyeuka was accepted so that there was no longer any need that he should go again to the colony this was sweet news to hester when she first heard itfor it had come to pass that it had been agreed that the marriage should be postponed till his return that having been the one concession made to mrs bolton there had been many arguments about itbut hester at last told him that she had promised so much to her mother and that she would of course keep her promise then the arrangement took such a form that the journey was not necessaryor perhaps the objection to the journey became so strong in caldigates mind that he determined to dispense with it at any price and thus very greatly to the dismay of mrs bolton suddenly there came to be no reason why they should not be married almost at once  but there was an attempt made at the picking of holesor rather many attempts it would be unfair to say that this was carried on by mrs bolton herselfbut she was always ready to listen to what evil things were said to her mrs nicholas in her horror at the general wickedness of the caldigates almost reconciled herself to her stepmother and even mrs daniel began to fear that a rash thing was being done in the first place there was the old story of davis and newmarket robert bolton who had necessarily become the advocate and defender of our hero generally did not care much for davis and newmarket all young men sow their wild oats of course he had been extravagant since his extravagance he had shown himself to be an industrious sensible steady member of societyand there was the money that he had earned what young man had earned more in a shorter time or had ever been more prudent in keeping it davis and newmarket were easily answered by a reference to the bank account did he ever go to newmarket now though he was living so close to it on that matter robert bolton was very strong  but mrs nicholas had found out that caldigate had spent certainly two sundays running at folking without going to church at all and as far as she could learn he was altogether indifferent about public worship mrs bolton who could never bring herself to treat him as a soninlaw but who was still obliged to receive him taxed him to his face with his paganism have you no religion mr caldigate he assured her that he had and fell into a long discussion in which he thoroughly confused her though he by no means convinced her that he was what he ought to be but he went with her to church twice on one sunday and showed her that he was perfectly familiar with the ways of the place  but perhaps the loudest complaint came from the side of babington and here two sets of enemies joined their forces together who were thoroughly hostile to each other mrs babington declared loudly that old bolton had been an errandboy in his youth and that his father had been a porter and his mother a washerwoman this could do no real harm as caldigate would not have been deterred by any such rumours even had they been true but they tended to show animosity and enabled mrs nicholas to find out the cause of the babington opposition when she learned that john caldigate had been engaged to his cousin julia of course she made the most of it and so did mrs bolton and in this way it came to be reported not only that the young man had been engaged to miss babington before he went to australiabut also that he had renewed his engagement since his return you do not love her do you hester asked him then he told her the whole story as nearly as he could tell it with some respect for his cousin laughing the while at his aunts solicitude and saying perhaps something not quite respectful as to julias red cheeks and green hat all of which certainly had not the effect of hardening hesters heart against him the poor young lady cant help it if her feet are big said hester who was quite alive to the grace of a wellmade pair of boots although she had been taught to eschew braided hair and pearls and gold  mrs babington however pushed her remonstrances so far that she boldly declared that the man was engaged to her daughter and wrote to him more than once declaring that it was so she wrote indeed very often sometimes abusing him for his perfidy and then again imploring him to return to them and not to defile the true old english blood of the caldigates with the suds of a washerwoman and the sweptup refuse of a porters shovel she became quite eloquent in her denunciation but always saying that if he would only come back to babington all would be forgiven him but in these days he made no visits to babington  then there came a plaintive little note from mrs shand of course they wished him joy if it were true but could it be true men were very fickle certainly but this change seemed to have been very very sudden and there was a word or two prettily written in another hand on a small slip of paperperhaps you had better send back the book and caldigate as he read it thought that he could discern the almostobliterated smudge of a wipedup tear he wrote a cheerful letter to mrs shand in which he told her that though he had not been absolutely engaged to marry hester bolton before he started for australiaand consequently before he had ever been at pollingtonyet his mind had been quite made up to do so and that therefore he regarded himself as being abnormally constant rather than fickle and tell your daughter with my kindest regards he added that i hope i may be allowed to keep the book  the babington objections certainly made their way in cambridge and out at chesterton further than any others and for a time did give a hope to mrs bolton and mrs nicholasand made robert bolton shrug his shoulders uneasily when he heard all the details of the engagement in the linencloset but there came at one moment a rumour which did not count for much among the boltons but which disturbed caldigate himself more than any of the other causes adduced for breaking off his intended marriage word came that he had been very intimate with a certain woman on his way out to melbournea woman supposed to be a foreigner and an actress and the name of cettini was whispered he did not know whence the rumour camebut on one morning robert bolton halflaughing but still with a tone of voice that was halfearnest taxed him with having as many loves as lothario who is cettini asked robert bolton  cettini said caldigate with a struggle to prevent a blush  did you travel with such a woman  yesat least if that was her name i did not hear it till afterwards a very agreeable woman she was  they say that you promised to marry her when on board  then they lie but that is a matter of course there are so many lies going about that i almost feel myself to be famous  you did not see her after the journey  yes i did i saw her act at sydney and very well she acted have you anything else to ask robert bolton said that he had nothing else to askand seemed at the moment to turn his halfserious mood into one that was altogether jocular but the mention of the name had been a wound and when an anonymous letter a few days afterwards reached hester herself he was really unhappy hester made nothing of the letterdid not even show it to her mother at that time a day had been fixed for their marriage and she already regarded her lover as nearer to her than either father or mother the letter purported to be from some one who had travelled with her lover and this woman on board ship and declared that everybody on board the ship had thought that caldigate meant to marry the womanwho then so said the letter called herself mrs smith hester showed the letter to caldigate and then caldigate told his story there had been such a woman who had been much illtreated because of her poverty he had certainly taken the womans part she had been clever and as he had thought wellbehaved and no doubt there had been a certain amount of friendship he had seen her again in sydney where he had found her exercising her profession as an actress that had been all i cannot imagine dear he said that you should be jealous of any woman but certainly not of such a one as she nor can i imagine said hester stoutly that i could possibly be jealous of any woman and then there was nothing more said about the woman smithcettini  during all this time there were many family meetings those between mr caldigate the father and old mr bolton were pleasant enough though not peculiarly cordial the banker though he had been brought to agree to the marriage had not been quite reconciled to it his younger son had been able to convince him that it was his duty to liberate his daughter from the oppression of her mothers overvigilance and all the rest had followed very quicklyoverwhelming him as it were by stern necessity when once the girl had come to understand that she could have her own way if she chose to have a way of her own she very quickly took the matter into her own management and in this way the engagement became a thing settled before the banker had realised the facts of the position though he could not be cordial he endeavoured to be gracious to his old friend but mrs bolton spoke words which made all friendship impossible she asked old mr caldigate after his soul and when he replied to her less seriously than she thought becoming she told him that he was in the bad way and then she said things about the marriage which implied that she would sooner see her daughter in her grave than married to a man who was no more than a professing christian the conversation ended in a quarrel after which the squire would not go again to puritan grange  there was indeed a time an entire week during which the mother and daughter hardly spoke to each other in these days mrs bolton continually demanded of her husband that he should break off the match always giving as a reason the alleged fact that john caldigate was not a true believer it had been acknowledged between them that if such were the fact the man would be an unfit husband for their daughter but they differed as to the fact the son had over and over again declared himself to be a faithful member of the church of englandnot very scrupulous perhaps in the performance of her ceremoniesbut still a believing member that his father was not so every one knew but he was not responsible for his father mr bolton seemed to think that the argument was goodbut mrs bolton was of opinion that to become willingly the daughterinlaw of an infidel would be to throw oneself with ones eyes open in the way of perdition hester through all this declared that nothing should now turn her from the man she loved not though he were an infidel himself said the terrorstricken mother nothing said hester bravely of course i should try to change him a more wretched woman than mrs bolton might not probably then have been found she suddenly perceived herself to be quite powerless with the child over whom her dominion had hitherto been supreme and she felt herself compelled to give way to people whom with all her heart she hated she determined that nothingnothing should induce her to soften her feelings to this soninlaw who was forced upon her the man had come and had stolen from her her treasure her one treasure and that other man whom she had always feared and always hated robert bolton the man whose craft and worldliness had ever prevented her from emancipating her husband from the flesh and the devil had brought all this about then she reconciled herself to her child and wept over her and implored heaven to save her hester tried to argue with herspoke of her own loveappealed to her mother asking whether as she had now declared her love it could be right that she should abandon a man who was so good and so fondly attached to her then mrs bolton would hide her face and sob and put up renewed prayers to heaven that her daughter might not by means of this unhappy marriage become lost to all sense of grace  it was very miserable but still the prospect of the marriage was never abandoned nor postponed a day had been settled a little before christmas and the robert boltons would allow of no postponement the old man was so tormented by the misery of his own home that he himself was averse to delay there could be no comfort for him till the thing should have been done mrs bolton had suggested that it should be put off till the springbut he had gloomily replied that as the thing had to be done the sooner it was done the better  it had been settled almost from the first that the marriage festival should be held not at puritan grange but at the nurseries and gradually it came to be understood that mrs bolton herself would not be present either at the church or at the breakfast it was in vain that hester implored her mother to yield to her in something to stand with her at any rate on the steps before the altar would you wish me to go and lie before my god said the unhappy woman when i would give all that i have in the world except my soulmy life my name even my child herself to prevent this am i to go and smile and be congratulated and to look as though i were happy there was therefore very much unhappiness at the grange and an absence of all triumph even at the nurseries at the old bankhouse in the town where the nicholases lived the marriage was openly denounced and even the daniels though they were pledged to be present were in doubt  i suppose it is all right said mrs robert to her husband  of course it is all right why not  it seems sad that such an event as a marriage should give rise to so much illfeeling i almost wish we had not meddled robert  i dont think there is anything to regret remember what hesters position would have been if my father had died leaving her simply to her mothers guardianship we were bound to free her from that and we have done it this was all very wellbut still there was no triumph no ringing of those inward marriage bells the sound of whose music ought to be so pleasant to both the families concerned  there were however two persons quite firm to their purpose and these were the bride and bridegroom with him firmness was comparatively easy when his father suggested that the whole bolton family was making itself disagreeable he could with much satisfaction reply that he did not intend to marry the whole bolton family having answered the first letter or two he could ignore the babington remonstrances and when he was crossexamined as to points of doctrine he could with sincerity profess himself to be of the same creed with his examiners if he went to church less often than old mr bolton so did old mr bolton go less often than his wife it was a matter as to which there was no rule thus his troubles were comparatively light and his firmness might be regarded as a thing of course but she was firm too and firm amidst very different circumstances though her mother prayed and sobbed implored her and almost cursed her still she was firm she had given her word to the man and her heart and she would not go back yes papa it is too late now she said when her father coming from his wife once suggested to her that even yet it was not too late of course i shall marry him she said to mrs robert almost with indignation when mrs robert on one occasion almost broke down in her purpose  dear aunt indeed indeed you need not interfere she said to mrs nicholas if he were all that they have called him still i would marry him she said to her other auntbecause i love him and so they all became astonished at the young girl whom they had reared up among them and to understand that whatever might now be their opinions she would have her way  and so it was decided that they should be married on a certain tuesday in the middle of december early in the morning she was to be brought down to her aunts house there to be decked in her bridal robes thence to be taken to the church then to return for the bridal feast and from thence to be taken off by her husbandto go whither they might list     chapter xxi  the wedding    it was a sad wedding though everything within the power of mr robert bolton was done to make it gay there was a great breakfast and all the boltons were at last persuaded to be present except mrs bolton and mrs nicholas as to mrs nicholas she was hardly even asked of course we would be delighted to see mrs nicholas if she would come mrs robert said to nicholas himself but there had been such longcontinued and absolute hostility between the ladies that this was known to be impossible in regard to mrs bolton herself great efforts were made her husband condescended to beg her to consent on this one occasion to appear among the philistines but as the time came nearer she became more and more firm in her resolution you shall not touch pitch and not be defiled she said you cannot serve god and mammon when the old man tried to show her that there was no question of mammon here she evaded him as she always did on such occasions either by a real or simulated deficiency of consequent intelligence she regarded john caldigate as being altogether unregenerate and therefore a man of the worldand therefore a disciple of mammon she asked him whether he wanted her to do what she thought to be sinful it is very sinful hating people as you hate my sons families he said in his wrath no nicholas i do not hate their families i certainly do not hate margaret nor yet fannybut i think that they live in opposition to the gospel am i to belie my own belief now the old man was quite certain that his wife did hate both roberts wife and williams and would not admit in her own mind this distinction between the conduct of persons and the persons themselves but he altogether failed in his attempts to induce her to go to the breakfast  the great contest was between the mother and the daughter but in all that passed between them no reference was even made to the banquet as to that hester was indifferent she thought on the whole that her mother would do best to be absent after all what is a breakfastor what the significance of any merrymeeting even for a wedding there would no doubt be much said and much done on such an occasion at variance with her mothers feelings even the enforced gaiety of the dresses would be distasteful to her and there would hardly be sufficient cause for pressing her to be present on such an occasion but in reference to the church the question to hesters thinking was very different mamma she said if you are not there it will be a lasting misery to me  how can i go there when i would give so much to save you from going there yourself this was a terrible thing for a mother to say to her own child on the eve of her wedding but it had been now said so often as to have lost something of its sting it had come to be understood that mrs bolton would not allow herself to give any assent to the marriage but that the marriage was to go on without such assent all that had been settled but still she might go to the church with them and pray for good results she feared that evil would come but still she might wish for goodwish for it and pray for it  you dont want me to be unhappy mamma  want said the mother who can want her child to be unhappy but there is an unhappiness harder to be borne more to be dreaded enduring so much longer than that which we may suffer here  will you not come and pray that i may be delivered also from that as i am going from you will you not let me know that you are there with me at the last moment though you do not love him you do not wish to quarrel with me oh mamma let me feel at any rate that you are there then the mother promised that she would be there in the church though unknown to or at least unrecognised by any one else when the morning came and when hester was dropped at the nurseries in order that she might go up and be invested in her finery amidst her bridesmaids who were all her cousins the carriage went on and took mrs bolton to the church it was represented to her that by this arrangement she would be forced to remain an hour alone in the cold building but she was one of those who regarded all discomfort as meritorious as in some way adding something to her claim for heaven selfscourging with rods as a penance was to her thinking a papistical ordinance most abominable and damnatory but the essence of the selfscourging was as comfortable to her as ever was a hairshirt to a roman catholic enthusiast so she went and sat apart in a dark distant pew dressed in black and deeply veiled praying not it is to be feared that john caldigate might be a good husband to her girl but that he as he made his way downward to things below might not drag her darling with him that only a few can be saved was the fact in all her religion with which she was most thoroughly conversant the strait way and the narrow gate through which only a few can pass were they not known to all believers to all who had a glimmering of belief as an established part of the christian faith as a part so established that to dream even that the gate would be made broad and the way open would be to dream against the gospel against the very plainest of gods words if soand she would tell herself at all hours that certainly certainly certainly so it wasthen why should she trouble herself for one so little likely to come in the way of salvation as this man who was now robbing her of her daughter if it was the will of the almightyas it clearly was the will of the almightythat out of every hundred ninety and nine should perish could she dare now to pray more than for one or if her prayers were wider must they not be inefficacious yesthere had been the thief upon the cross it was all possible but this man was a thief not upon the cross and therefore as she prayed that morning she said not a prayer for him  in the meantime the carriage had gone back for the bride who in very simple raiment but yet in bridalwhite array was taken up to the church these boltons were prosperous people who had all their carriages so that there was no lack of vehicles two of the girls from london and two from the nurseries made up the bevy of bridesmaids who were as bright and fair as though the bride had come from some worldlier stock mrs robert indeed had done all she could to give to the whole concern a becoming bridal brightness till even mrs daniel had been tempted to remonstrate i dont see why you shouldnt wear pretty things if youve got the money to pay for them said mrs robert mrs daniel shook her head but on the afternoon before the wedding she bought an additional ribbon  caldigate came over from folking that morning attended by one john jones an old college friend as his best man the squire was not at the wedding but on the day before he was with hester at the nurseries telling her that she should be his dear daughter and at the same time giving her a whole set of wicked but very pretty worldly gauds upon my word my dear he has been very gracious said mrs robert when she saw them i quite envy the girls being married nowadays because they get such pretty things  they are very pretty said hester  and must have cost im afraid to say how much money  i suppose it means to say that he will love me and therefore i am so glad to have them but the squire though he did mean to say that he would love her did not come to the wedding he was he said unaccustomed to such things and hoped that he might be excused  therefore from the folking side there was no one but john caldigate himself and john jones of the babingtons of course there was not one as long as there was a possibility of success mrs babington had kept up her remonstrancesbut when there was no longer a possibility she announced that there was to be an everlasting quarrel between the houses babington and folking were for the future to know nothing of each other caldigate had hoped that though the ladies would for a time be unforgiving his uncle and his male cousins would not take up the quarrel but aunt polly was too strong for that and he was declared to be a viper who had been warmed in all their bosoms and had then stung them all round if you will nurse a viper in your bosom of course he will sting you said aunt polly in a letter which she took the trouble to write to the squire in reply to which the squire wrote back thus my dear sister if you will look into your dictionary of natural history you will see that vipers have no stings yours truly d caldigate this letter was supposed to add much to the already existing offence  but the marriage ceremony was performed in spite of all this quarrelling and the mother standing up in the dark corner of her pew heard her daughters silverclear voice as she vowed to devote herself to her husband as she heard it she also devoted herself when sorrow should come as sorrow certainly would come then she would be ready once again to be a mother to her child but till that time should come the wife of john caldigate would be nothing to her  she was not content with thinking and resolving that it should be so but she declared her intention in so many words to her daughter for poor hester though she was proud of her husband this was in truth a miserable day could she have been induced to separate herself altogether from her mother on the previous night or even on that morning it would have been better but there was with her that customary longing for a last word of farewell which has often made so many of us wretched and then there was a feeling that as she was giving herself away in marriage altogether in opposition to her mothers counsels on that very account she owed to her more attached and increased observance therefore she had arranged with her husband that when she returned from the banquet to prepare herself for her journey a longer absence than usual should be allowed to herso that she might be taken back to chesterton and might thus see her mother the last after saying farewell to all the others then the carriage should return to the nurseries and he would be ready to step in and she need not show herself again worn out as she would be with the tears and sobbings which she anticipated  it all went as it was arranged but it would have been much better to arrange it otherwise the journey to the grange and back together with the time spent in the interview took an hourand the time went very slowly with the marriage guests there always comes a period beyond which it is impossible to be festive when the bride left the room the bridesmaids and other ladies went with her then the gentlemen who remained hardly knew what to do with each other old mr bolton was not jovial on the occasion and the four brothers hardly knew how to find subjects for conversation on such an occasion the bridegroom felt the hour to be very long although he consented to play billiards with the boys and john jones although he did at last escape and find his way up among the girls thought that his friend had married himself into a very sombre family but all this was pleasant pastime indeed compared with that which poor hester endured in her mothers bedroom so it has been done said mrs bolton sitting in a comfortless little chair which she was accustomed to use when secluded with her bible from all the household she spoke in a voice that might have been fit had a son of hers been just executed on the gallows  oh mamma do not speak of it like that  my darling my own one would you have me pretend what i do not feel why yes even that would be better than treatment such as this that would have been hesters reply could she have spoken her mind but she could not speak it and therefore she stood silent i will not pretend you and your father have done this thing against my wishes and against my advice  it is i that have done it mamma  you would not have persevered had he been firmas firm as i have been but he has vacillated turning hither and thither serving god and mammon and he has allowed himself to be ruled by his own son i will never never speak to robert bolton again  oh mamma do not say that  i do say it i swear it you shall not touch pitch and not be defiled if there be pitch on earth he is pitch if your eye offend you pluck it out he is my stepson i know but i will pluck him out like an eye that has offended it is he that has robbed me of my child  am i not still your child said hester going down on her knees with her hands in her mothers lap and her eyes turned up to her mothers face  no you are not mine any longer you are his you are that mans wife when he bids you do that which is evil in the sight of the lord you must do it and he will bid you you are not my child now as days run on and sins grow black i cannot warn you now against the wrath to come but though you are not my child though you are this mans wife i will pray for you  and for him  i do not know i cannot say who am i that i should venture to pray specially for a stranger that his way may be shown to all sinnersthus will i pray for him and it will be shown though whether he will walk in itwho can say that so much was true of john caldigate no doubt and is true of all but there was a tone in her voice which implied that in regard to this special sinner there could be very little hope indeed  why should you think that he is bad mamma  we are all bad there is no doubt about his being bad there is not one among us fit to sweep the lowest step of gods throne but they who are his people shall be made bright enough to sit round his feet may the time come when you my darling shall be restored to the fold the poor young wife by this time had acknowledged to herself the mistake she had made in thus coming to her mother after her marriage she now was of course in that ecstatic phase of existence which makes ones own self altogether subordinate to the self of another person that her husband should be happy constituted her hope of happiness that he should be comfortable her comfort if he were thought worthy that would be her worthiness or if he were good that would be her goodness and even as to those higher more distant aspirations amidst which her mother was always dwelling she would take no joy for herself which did not include him the denunciations against him which were so plainly included even in her mothers blessings and prayers for herself did not frighten her on behalf of the man to whom she had devoted herself she could see the fanaticism and fury of her mothers creed but she could not escape from the curse of the moment when that last imprecation was made by the woman with her hands folded and her eyes turned up to heaven hester could only bury her face on her mothers knees and weep when that time comes and i know it will come you shall return to me and once more be my child said the mother  you do not mean that i shall leave my husband  who can tell if you do and i am living you shall be my child till then we must be apart how can it be otherwise can i give my cheek to a man to be kissed and call him my son when i think that he has robbed me of my only treasure  this was so terrible that the daughter could only hang around her mothers neck sobbing and kissing her at the same time and then go without another word she was sure of thisthat if she must lose one or the other her mother or her husband then she would lose her mother when she returned to the nurseries her husband according to agreement came out to her at once she had bidden adieu to all the others but at the last moment her father put his hand into the carriage so that she could take it and kiss it mamma is so sad she said to him go home to her and comfort her of course the old man did go home but he was aware that there would for some time be little comfort there either for him or for his wife he and his sons had been too powerful for her in arranging the marriage but now now that it was done nothing could stop her reproaches he had been made to think it wrong on one side to shut his girl up and now from the other side he was being made to think that he had done very wrong in allowing her to escape  it had been arranged that they should be driven out of cambridge to the railway station at audley end on their way to london so that they might avoid the crowd of people who would know them at the cambridge station as soon as they had got away from the door of robert boltons house the husband attempted to comfort his young wife at any rate it is over he said alluding of course to the tedium of their wedding festivities  so much is over she replied  you do not regret anything  she shook her head slowly as she leaned lovingly against his shoulder you are not sorry hester that you have become my wife  i had to be your wifebecause i love you  is that a sorrow  i had been all my mothersand now i am all yours she has thrown me off because i have disobeyed her i hope you will never throw me off  is it likely  i think not i know that i shall never throw you off they have tried to make me believe that you are not all that you ought to bein religion but now your religion shall be my religion and your life my life i shall be of your colouraltogether but john a limb cannot be wrenched out of a socket as i have been torn away from my mother without pain  she will forgive it all when we come back  i feari fear i never knew her to forgive anything yet this was very bad but nevertheless it was plain to him as it had been plain to robert and william bolton that not because of the violence of the womans character should the life of her daughter have been sacrificed to her his duty to make her new life bright for her was all the more plain and all the more soundand as they made their first journey together he explained to her how sacred that duty should always be to him      chapter xxii  as to touching pitch    before the wedding old mr caldigate arranged with his son that he would give up to the young married people the house at folking and indeed the entire management of the property i have made up my mind about it said the squire who at this time was living with his son on happy terms i have never been adapted for the life of a country gentleman he continued though i have endeavoured to make the best of it and have in a certain way come to love the old place but i dont care about wheat nor yet about bullocksand a country house should always have a mistress and so it was settled mr caldigate took for himself a house in cambridge whither he proposed to remove nothing but himself and his books and promised to have folking ready for his son and his sons bride on their return from their wedding tour in all this robert bolton and the old squire acted together the brother thinking that the position would suit his sister well but others among the boltonsmrs daniel the london people and even mrs robert herselfhad thought that the young people had better be further away from the influences or annoyances of puritan grange robert however had declared that it would be absurd to yield to the temper and prejudice and furyas he called itof his fathers wife when this discussion was going on she had absolutely quarrelled with the attorney and the attorney had made up his mind that she should beignored and then too as robert explained it must be for the husband and not for the wife to choose where they would live folking was or at any rate would be his own by right of inheritance and it was not to be thought of that a man should be driven away from his natural duties and from the enjoyment of his natural privileges by the mad humours of a fanatic female in all this old mr bolton was hardly consulted but there was no reason why he should express an opinion he was giving his daughter absolutely no fortune nor had he even vouchsafed to declare what money should be coming to her at his death john caldigate had positively refused to say a word on the subjecthad refused even when instigated to do so by hesters brother it shall be just as he pleases caldigate had said i told your father that i was not looking after his daughter with any view to money and i will be as good as my word robert had told her father that something should be arrangedbut the old man had put it off from day to day and nothing had been arranged and so it came to pass that he was excluded almost from having an opinion as to his daughters future life  it was understood that the marriage trip should be continued for some months caldigate was fettered by no business that required an early return he had worked hard for five years and felt that he had earned a holiday and hester naturally was well disposed to be absent for as long a time as would suit her husband time and time alone might perhaps soften her mothers heart they went to italy and stayed during the winter months in rome and then when the fine weather came they returned across the alps and lingered about among the playgrounds of europe visiting switzerland the tyrol and the pyrenees and returning home to cambridgeshire at the close of the following september  and then there was a reason for the return it would be well that the coming heir to the folking estate should be born at folking whether an heir or only an insignificant girl it would be well that the child should be born amidst the comforts of home and so they came back when they reached the station at cambridge the squire was there to receive them as were also robert bolton and his wife i am already in my new house said the old manbut i mean to go out with you for today and tomorrow and just stay till you are comfortably fixed  i never see her myself said robert in answer to a whispered inquiry from his sister or it would be more correct to say she will never see me but i hear from the others that she speaks of you constantly  she has written to me of course but she never mentions john in writing back i have always sent his love and have endeavoured to show that i would not recognise any quarrel  if i were you said robert i would not take him with me when i went then the three caldigates were taken off to folking  a week passed by and then arrived the day on which it had been arranged that hester was to go to chesterton and see her mother there had been numerous letters and at last the matter was settled between caldigate and old mr bolton at the bank i think you had better let her come alone the old man had said when caldigate asked whether he might be allowed to accompany his wife mrs bolton has not been well since her daughters marriage and has felt the desolation of her position very much she is weak and nervous and i think you had better let hester come alone had caldigate known his motherinlaw better he would not have suggested a visit from himself no one who did know her would have looked forward to see her old hatred eradicated by an absence of nine months hester therefore went into cambridge alone and was taken up to the house by her father as she entered the iron gates she felt almost as though she were going into the presence of one who was an enemy to herself and yet when she saw her mother she rushed at once into the poor womans arms oh mamma dear mamma dearest mamma my own own own mamma  mrs bolton was sitting by the open window of a small breakfast parlour which looked into the garden and had before her on her little table her knitting and a volume of sermons so you have come back hester she said after a short pause she had risen at first to receive her daughter and had returned her childs caresses but had then reseated herself quickly as though anxious not to evince any strong feeling on the occasion  yes mamma i have come back we have been so happy  i am glad you have been happy such joys are shortlived but still  he has been so good to me mamma  good what was the meaning of the word good she doubted the goodness of such goodness as his do not they who are tempted by the pleasures of the world always praise the goodnature and kindness of them by whom they are tempted there are meanings to the word good which are so opposed one to another a husband is i suppose generally kind to his wife at any rate for a little time she said  oh mamma i do so wish you knew him the woman turned her face round away from her daughter and assumed that look of hard determined impregnable obstinacy with which hester had been well acquainted all her life but the young wife had come there with a purpose not strong perhaps in actual hope but resolute even against hope to do her best there must be an enduring misery to her unless she could bring her mother into some friendly relation with her husband and she had calculated that the softness produced by her return would give a better chance for this than she might find at any more protracted time but mrs bolton had also made her calculations and had come to her determination she turned her head away therefore and sat quite silent with the old stubborn look of resolved purpose  mamma you will let him come to you now  no  not your own hesters husband  no  are we to be divided for ever  did i not tell you beforewhen you were going shall i lie and say that i love him i will not touch pitch lest i be defiled  mamma he is my husband you shall not call him pitch he is my very own mamma mammarecall the word that you have said  the woman felt that it had to be recalled in some degree i said nothing of him hester i call that pitch which i believe to be wrong and if i swerve but a hairsbreadth wittingly towards what i believe to be evil then i shall be touching pitch and then i shall be defiled i did not say that he was pitch judge not and ye shall not be judged but if ever judgment was pronounced and a verdict given and penalties awarded such was done now in regard to john caldigate  but mamma why will it be doing evil to be gracious to your daughters husband  the woman had an answer to this appeal very clearly set forth in her mind though she was unable to produce it clearly in words when the marriage had been first discussed she had opposed it with all her power because she had believed the man to be wicked he was unregenerateand when she had put it to her husband and to the nicholases and to the daniels to see whether such was not the case they had not contradicted her it was acknowledged that he was such a one as roberta worldly man all round and then he was worse than robert having been a spendthrift a gambler and if the rumours which had reached them were true given to the company of loose women she had striven with all her might that such a one should not be allowed to take her daughter from her and had striven in vain he had succeededbut his character was not changed by his success did she not know him to be chaff that must be separated by the wind from the corn and then consumed in the fire his character was not altered because that human being whom she loved the best in all the world had fallen into his power he was not the less chaffthe less likely to be burned that her daughter should become chaff alsoah there was the agony of it if instead of taking the husband and wife together she could even now separate themwould it not be her duty to do so of all duties would it not be the first let the misery here be what it might what was that to eternal misery or to eternal bliss when therefore she was asked whether she would be doing evil were she to be gracious to her own soninlaw she was quite quite sure that any such civility would be a sin the man was pitchthough she had been coerced by the exigencies of a worldly courtesy to deny that she had intended to say so he was pitch to her and she declared to herself that were she to touch him she would be denied but she knew not in what language to explain all this what you call graciousness hester is an obligation of which religion knows nothing she said after a pause  i dont know why it shouldnt are we to be divided mamma because of religion  if you were alone  but i am not alone oh mamma mamma do you not know that i am going to become a mother  my child  and you will not be with me because you think that you and john differ as to religious forms  forms she said forms is the spirit there by their fruits ye shall know them i ask you yourself whether his life as you have seen it is such as i should think conformable with the word of god  whose life is so  but an effort may be made do not let us palter with each other hester there are the sheepand there are the goats of which is he according to the teaching of your early years in which flock would he be found if account were taken now  there was something so terrible in this that the young wife who was thus called upon to denounce her husband separated herself by some steps from her mother retreating back to a chair in which she seated herself do you remember mamma the words you said just now judge not and ye shall not be judged  nor do i judge  and how does it go on forgive and ye shall be forgiven  neither do i judge nor can i forgive this she said putting all her emphasis on the pronoun and thereby declaring her own humility but the great truths of my religion are dear to me i will not trust myself in the way of sinners because by some worldly alliance to which i myself was no consenting party i have been brought into worldly contact with them i at any rate will be firm i say to you now no more than i said ah so many times when it was still possible that my words should not be vain they were vain but not on that account am i to be changed i will not be wound like a skein of silk round your little finger that was it was she to give way in everything because they had been successful among them in carrying out this marriage in opposition to her judgment was she to assent that this man be treated as a sheep because he had prevailed against her while she was so well aware that he would still have been a goat to them all had he not prevailed she at any rate was sincere she was consistent she would be true to her principles even at the expense of all her natural yearnings of what use to her would be her religious convictions if she were to give them up just because her heartstrings were torn and agonised the man was a goat though he were ten times told her childs husband so she looked again away into the garden and resolved that she would not yield in a single point  goodbye mamma said hester rising from her chair and coming up to her mother  goodbye hester god bless you my child  you will not come to me to folking  no i will not go to folking  i may come to you here  oh yesas often as you will and for as long as you will  i cannot stay away from home without him you know said the young wife  as often as you will and for as long as you will the mother said again repeating the words with emphasis would i could have you here as i used to do so as to look after every want and administer to every wish my fingers shall work for your baby and my prayers shall be said for him and for you morning and night i am not changed hester i am still and ever shall be while i am spared your own loving mother so they parted and hester was driven back to folking  in forming our opinion as to others we are daily brought into difficulty by doubting how much we should allow to their convictions and how far we are justified in condemning those who do not accede to our own mrs bolton believed every word that she said there was no touch of hypocrisy about her could she without sting of conscience have gone off to folking and ate of her soninlaws bread and drank of his cup and sat in his presence no mother living would have enjoyed more thoroughly the delight of waiting upon and caressing and bending over her child she denied herself all this with an agony of spirit groaning not only over their earthly separation thinking not only of her daughters present dangers but tormented also by reflections as to dangers and possible separations in another world but she knew she was right she knew at least that were she to act otherwise there would be upon her conscience the weight of sin she did not know that the convictions on which she rested with such confidence had come in truth from her injured pridehad settled themselves in her mind because she had been beaten in her endeavours to prevent her daughters marriage she was not aware that she regarded john caldigate as a goatas one who beyond all doubt was a goatsimply because john caldigate had had his way while she had been debarred from hers such no doubt was the case and yet who can deny her praise for fidelity to her own convictions when we read of those who have massacred and tortured their opponents in religion have boiled alive the unfortunates who have differed from themselves as to the meaning of an unintelligible word or two have vigorously torn the entrails out of those who have been pious with a piety different from their own how shall we dare to say that they should be punished for their fidelity mrs bolton spent much of that afternoon with her knees on the hard boardsthinking that a hassock would have taken something from the sanctity of the actionwrestling for her child in prayer and she told herself that her prayer had been heard she got up more than ever assured that she must not touch pitch lest she should be defiled let us pray for what we will with earnestnessthough it be for the destruction of half of a worldwe are sure to think that our prayers have been heard     chapter xxiii  the new heir    things went on smoothly at folking or with apparent smoothness for three months during which john caldigate surprised both his friends and his enemies by the exemplary manner in which he fulfilled his duties as a parish squire he was put on the commission and was in the way to become the most active justice of the peace in those parts he made himself intimate with all the tenants and was almost worshipped by mr ralph holt his nearest neighbour to whose judgment he submitted himself in all agricultural matters he shot a little but moderately having no inclination to foster what is called a head of game and he went to church very regularly having renewed his intimacy with mr bromley the parson a gentleman who had unfortunately found it necessary to quarrel with the old squire because the old squire had been so manifestly a pagan  there had been unhappiness in the parish on this head and especially unhappiness to mr bromley who was a good man that mr caldigate should be what he called a pagan had been represented by mr bromley to his friends as a great misfortune and especially a misfortune to the squire himself but he would have ignored that in regard to social lifeso mr bromley said when discussing the matterif the pagan would have desisted from arguing the subject but when mr caldigate insisted on the parson owning the unreasonableness of his own belief and called upon him to confess himself to be either a fool or a hypocrite then the parson found himself constrained to drop all further intercourse it is the way with all priests said the old squire triumphantly to the first man he could get to hear him the moment you disagree with them they become your enemies at once and would straightway kill you if they had the power he probably did not know how very disagreeable he had made himself to the poor clergyman  but now matters were on a much better footing and all the parish rejoiced the new squire was seen in his pew every sunday morning and often entertained the parson at the house the rumour of this change was indeed so great that more than the truth reached the ears of some of the boltons and advantage was taken of it by those who desired to prove to mrs bolton that the man was not a goat what more would she have he went regularly to morning and evening servicehere it was that rumour exaggerated our heros virtuesdid all his duty as a country gentleman and was kind to his wife the daniels who were but lukewarm people thought that mrs bolton was bound to give way mrs robert declared among her friends that the poor woman was becoming mad from religion and the old banker himself was driven very hard for a reply when robert asked him whether such a soninlaw as john caldigate ought to be kept at arms length the old man did in truth hate the name of john caldigate and regretted bitterly the indiscretion of that day when the spendthrift had been admitted within his gates though he had agreed to the marriage partly from a sense of duty to his child partly under the influences of his son he had since that been subject to his wife for nine or ten months she had not been able to prevail against him in action but no earthly power could stop her tongue now when these new praises were dinned into his ears when he did convince himself that as far as worldly matters went his soninlaw was likely to become a prosperous and respected gentleman he would fain have let the question of hostility drop there need not have been much intercourse between puritan grange and folking but then also there need be no quarrel he was desirous that caldigate should be allowed to come to the house and that even visits of ceremony should be made to folking but mrs bolton would have nothing to do with such half friendship in the time that was coming she must be everything or nothing to her daughter and she could not be brought to think that one who had been so manifestly a goat should cease to be a goat so suddenly in other words she could not soften her heart towards the man who had conquered her therefore when the time came for the baby to be born there had been no reconciliation between puritan grange and folking  mrs babington had been somewhat less stern immediately on the return of the married couple to their own home she had still been full of wrath and had predicted every kind of evil but when she heard that all tongues were saying all good things of this nephew of hers and when she was reminded by her husband that blood is thicker than water and when she reflected that it is the duty of christians to forgive injuries she wrote to the sinner as follows       babington hall november 187      my dear johnwe are all here desirous that bygones should be     bygones and are willing to forgivethough we may not perhaps be     able to forget i am quite of opinion that resentments should not be     lasting let them have been ever so well justified by circumstances     at first      your uncle bids me say that he hopes you will come over and shoot     the puddinghall coverts with humphry and john they propose thursday     next but would alter the day if that does not suit      we have heard of your wifes condition of course and trust that     everything may go well with her i shall hope to make her     acquaintance some day when she is able to receive visitors      i am particularly induced at the present moment to hold out to you     once more the right hand of fellowship and family affection by the     fact that dear julia is about to settle herself most advantageously     in life she is engaged to marry the rev augustus smirkie the     rector of plumcumpippins near woodbridge in this county we all     like mr smirkie very much indeed and think that julia has been     most fortunate in her choice these words were underscored doubly     by way of showing how very much superior was mr augustus smirkie to     mr john caldigate i may perhaps as well mention to avoid     anything disagreeable at present that julia is at this time staying     with mr smirkies mother at ipswichyour affectionate aunt      maryanne babington   caldigate was at first inclined to send in answer to this letter a reply which would not have been agreeable to his aunt but was talked into a better state of mind by his wife telling me that she will forgive me the question is whether i will forgive her let that be the question said his wife and do forgive her she wants to come round and of course she has to make the best of it for herself tell her from me that i shall be delighted to see her whenever she chooses to come  poor julia said caldigate laughing  of course you think so john thats natural enough perhaps i think so too but what has that to do with it  its rather unfortunate that i know so much about mr smirkie he is fifty years old and has five children by his former wife  i dont see why he shouldnt be a good husband for all that  and plumcumpippins is less than £300 ayear poor dear julia  i believe you are jealous john  well yes look at the way she has underscored it of course im jealous nevertheless he wrote a courteous answer promising to go over and shoot the coverts and stay for one night  he did go over and shoot the coverts and stayed for one night but the visit was not very successful aunt polly would talk of the glories of the plumcumpippins rectory in a manner which implied that dear julias escape from a fate which once threatened her had been quite providential when he alludedas he did but should not have doneto the young smirkies she spoke with almost ecstatic enthusiasm of the dear children caldigate knowing the while that the eldest child must be at least sixteen and then though aunt polly was kind to him she was kind in an almost insulting manneras though he were to be received for the sake of auld lang syne in spite of the step he had taken downwards in the world he did his best to bear all this with no more than an inward smile telling himself that it behoved him as a man to allow her to have her little revenge but the smile was seen and the more that was seen of it the more often was he reminded that he had lost that place in the babington elysium which might have been his had he not been too foolish to know what was good for him and a hint was given that the boltons a short time since had not been aristocratic whereas it was proved to him from burkes landed gentry that the smirkies had been established in suffolk ever since cromwells time no doubt their land had gone but still there had been smirkies  how did you get on with them his father asked as he passed home through cambridge  much the same as usual of course in such a family a soninlaw elect is more thought of than a useless married man  they snubbed you  aunt polly snubbed me a little and i dont think i had quite so good a place for the shooting as in the old days but all that was to be expected i quite agree with aunt polly that family quarrels are foolish things  i am not so sure some people doom themselves to an infinity of annoyance because they wont avoid the society of disagreeable people i dont know that i have ever quarrelled with any one i have never intended to do so but when i find that a man or woman is not sympathetic i think it better to keep out of the way that was the squires account of himself those who knew him in the neighbourhood were accustomed to say that he had quarrelled with everybody about him  in december the baby was born just twelve months after the marriage and there was great demonstrations of joy and ringing of bells in the parishes of utterden and netherden the baby was a boy and all was as it ought to be john caldigate himself when he came to look at his position and to understand the feeling of those around him was astonished to find how strong was the feeling in his own favour and how thoroughly the tenants had been outraged by the idea that the property might be made over to a more distant member of the family what was it to them who lived in the house at folking why should they have been solicitous in the matter they had their leases and there was no adequate reason for supposing that one caldigate would be more pleasant in his dealing with them than another and yet it was evident to him now that this birth of a real heir at the squires house with a fair prospect that the acres would descend in a right line was regarded by them all with almost superstitious satisfaction the bells were rung as though the churchtowers were going to be pulled down and there was not a farmer or a farmers wife who did not come to the door of folking to ask how the young mother and the baby were doing  this is as it should be squoire said ralph holt who was going about in his sunday clothes as though it was a day much too sacred for muck and work he had caught hold of caldigate in the stable yard and was now walking with him down towards the ferry  yesshes doing very well they tell me said the newlymade father  in course shell do well why not a healthy lass like she if i may make so free there aint nothing like having them strong and young with no townbred airs about em i never doubted as she wouldnt do well i can tell from their very walk what sort of mothers theyll be mr holt had long been known as the most judicious breeder of stock in that neighbourhood but it aint only that squoire  the youngun will do well too i hope  in course he will why not the foals take after their dams for a time pretty much always but what i mean iswe be all glad youve come back from them outotheway parts  i had to go there holt  wellwe dont know much about that sir and i dont mean nothing about that  to tell the truth my friend i should not have done very well here unless i had been able to topdress the english acres with a little australian gold  like enough squoire like enough but i wasnt making bold to say nothing about that for a young gentleman to go out a while and then to come back was all very well most of em does it but when there was a talk as you wernt to come back and that master george was to take the placewhy then it did seem as things was very wrong  master george might have been quite as good as i  it wasnt the proper thing squoire it wasnt straight if you hadnt never a been sir or if the lord almighty had taken you as he did the others god bless em nobody wouldnt have had a right to say nothing but as you was to the fore it wouldnt have been straight and no one wouldnt have thought it straight instigated by this john caldigate looked a good deal into the matter that day and began to feel that having been born squire of folking he had perhaps no right to deal with himself otherwise then various thoughts passed through his mind as to other dealings which had taken place how great had been the chance against his being squire of folking when he started with dick shand to look for australian gold and how little had been the chance of his calling hester bolton his wife when he was pledging his word to mrs smith on board the goldfinder but now it had all come round to him just as he would have had it there was his wife upstairs in the big bedroom with her babythe wife as to whom he had made that romantic resolution when he had hardly spoken to her and there had been the bells ringing and the tenants congratulating him and everything had been pleasant his father who had so scorned himwho in the days of davis and newmarket had been so well justified in scorning himwas now his closest friend thinking of all this he told himself that he had certainly received better things than he had deserved  a day or two after the birth of the baby mrs robert came out to see the new prodigy and on the following day mrs daniel mrs robert was of course very friendly and disposed to be in all respects a good sisterinlaw hesters great grief was in regard to her mother she was steadfast enough in her resolution to stand in all respects by her husband if there must be a separationbut the idea of the separation robbed her of much of her happiness mrs robert was aware that a great effort was being made with mrs bolton the young squires respectability was so great and his conduct so good that not only the boltons themselves but neighbours around who knew aught of the bolton affairs were loud in denouncing the woman for turning up her nose at such a soninlaw the great object was to induce her to say that she would allow caldigate to enter the house at chesterton you know i never see her now said mrs robert im too much of a sinner to think of entering the gates  do not laugh at her margaret said hester  i do not mean to laugh at her it is simply the truth robert and i have made up our minds that it is better for us all that i should not put myself in her way  think how different it must be for me  of course it is it is dreadful to think that she should be soprejudiced but what can i do dear if they will go on persevering she will of course have to give way the they spoken of were the daniels and old mr bolton himself and latterly the nicholases all of whom were of opinion that the separation of the mother from her daughter was very dreadful especially when it came to be understood that the squire of folking went regularly to his parish church  on the next day mrs daniel came out and though she was much less liked by hester than her younger sisterinlaw she brought more comfortable tidings she had been at the grange a day or two before and mrs bolton had almost consented to say that she would see john caldigate you shouldnt be in a hurry you know my dear said mrs daniel  but what has john done that there should be any question about all this  i suppose he was a littlejust a littlewhat they call fast once  he got into debt when he was a boy said the wife and then paid off everything and a great deal more by his own industry it seems to me that everybody ought to be proud of him  i dont think your mother is proud of him my dear  poor mamma  i hope hell go when hes told to do so  john of course hell go if i ask him theres nothing he wouldnt do to make me happy but really when i talk to him about it at all i am ashamed of myself poor mamma the result of this visit was however very comforting mrs daniel had seen mrs bolton and had herself been witness to the fact that mrs bolton had mitigated the sternness of her denial when asked to receive her soninlaw at puritan grange it was said mrs daniel the settled opinion of the bolton family that in the course of another month or so the woman would be induced to give way under the pressure put upon her by the family generally     chapter xxiv  news from the gold mines    it was said at the beginning of the last chapter that things had gone on smoothly or with apparent smoothness at folking since the return of the caldigates from their wedding tour but there had in truth been a small cloud in the folking heavens over and beyond that babington haze which was now vanishing and the storm at chesterton as to which hopes were entertained that it would clear itself away it will perhaps be remembered that caldigates offer for the sale of his interest in the polyeuka mine had been suddenly accepted by certain enterprising persons in australia and that the money itself had been absolutely forthcoming this had been in every way fortunate as he had been saved from the trouble of another journey to the colony and his money matters had been put on such a footing as to make him altogether comfortable but just when he heard that the money had been lodged to his accountand when the money actually had been so paidhe received a telegram from mr crinkett begging that the matter might be for a time postponed this of course was out of the question his terms had been acceptedwhich might have gone for very little had not the money been forthcoming but the cash was positively in his hands who ever heard of a man postponing an arrangement in such circumstances let them do what they might with polyeuka he was safe he telegraphed back to say that there could be no postponement as far as he was concerned the whole thing was settled then there came a multiplicity of telegrams very costly to the crinkett interestcostly also and troublesome to himself for he though the matter was so pleasantly settled as far as he was concerned could not altogether ignore the plaints that were made to him then there came very long letters long and loud letters not only from crinkett but from others telling him that the polyeuka gold had come to an end the lode disappearing altogether as lodes sometimes do disappear the fact was that the crinkett company asked to have back half its money offering him the polyeuka mine in its entirety if he chose to accept it  john caldigate though in england he could be and was a liberal gentleman had been long enough in australia to know that if he meant to hold his own among such men as mr crinkett he must make the best of such turns of fortune as chance might give him under no circumstances would crinkett have been generous to him had polyeuka suddenly become more prolific in the precious metal than any mine in the colony the crinkett company would have laughed at any claim made by him for further payment when a bargain has been fairly made the parties must make the best of it he was therefore very decided in his refusal to make restitution though he was at the same time profuse in his expressions of sorrow  then there came a threatnot from crinkett but from mrs euphemia smith and the letter was not signed euphemia smithbut euphemia caldigate and the letter was as follows       in spite of all your treachery to me i do not wish to ruin you or     to destroy your young wife by proving myself in england to have     been married to you at ahalala but i will do so unless you assent     to the terms which crinkett has proposed he and i are in     partnership in the matter with two or three others and are willing     to let all that has gone before be forgotten if we have means given     us to make another start you cannot feel that the money you have     received is fairly yours and i can hardly think you would wish to     become rich by taking from me all that i have earned after so many     hardships if you will do as i propose you had better send out an     agent on paying us the money he shall not only have the     marriagecertificate but shall stand by and see me married to     crinkett who is now a widower after that of course i can make no     claim to you if you will not do this both i and crinkett and the     other man who was present at our marriage and anne young who has     been with me ever since will go at once to england and the law     must take its course      i have no scruple in demanding this as you owe me so much more      allan the wesleyan who married us has gone out of the colony no     one knows wherebut i send you the copy of the certificate and     all the four of us who were there are still together and there were     others who were at ahalala at the time and who remember the     marriage well dick shand was not in the chapel but dick knew all     about it there is quite plenty of evidence      send back by the wire word what you will do and let your agent     come over as soon as possible      euphemia caldigate   however true or however false the allegations made in the above letter may have been for a time it stunned him greatly this letter reached him about a month before the birth of his son and for a day or two it disturbed him greatly he did not show it to his wife but wandered about the place alone thinking whether he would take any notice of it and what notice at last he resolved that he would take the letter to his brotherinlaw robert and ask the attorneys advice how much of it is true demanded robert when he read the letter twice from beginning to end  a good deal said caldigateas much as may be with the exception that i was never married to the woman  i suppose not that robert bolton as he spoke was very grave but did not at first seem disposed to be angry had you not better tell me everything do you think  it is for that purpose that i have come and brought you the letter you understand about the money  i suppose so  there can be no reason why i should return a penny of it  certainly not now you certainly must not return it under a threateven though the woman should be starving there can be no circumstances and as he spoke he dashed his hand down upon the tableno circumstances in which a man should allow money to be extorted from him by a threat for hesters sake you must not do that  nono i must not do that of course  and now tell me what is true there was something of authority in the tone of his voice something perhaps of censure something too of doubt which went much against the grain with caldigate he had determined to tell his story feeling that counsel was necessary to him but he wished so to tell it as to subject himself to no criticism and to admit no fault he wanted assistance but he wanted it on friendly and sympathetic terms he had a great dislike to beingblown up as he would probably have expressed it himself and he already thought that he saw in his companions eye a tendency that way turning all this in his mind he paused a moment before he began to tell his tale you say that a good deal in this womans letter is true had you not better tell me what is true  i was very intimate with her  did she ever live with you  yes she did  as your wife  well yes it is of course best that you should know all then he gave a tolerably true account of all that had happened between himself and mrs smith up to the time at which as the reader knows he found her performing at the sydney theatre  you had made her a distinct promise of marriage on board the ship  i think i had  you think  yes i think i did can you not understand that a man may be in great doubt as to the exact words that he may have spoken at such a time  hardly  then i dont think you realise the mans position i wish to let you know the truth as exactly as i can you had better take it for granted that i did make such a promise though probably no such promise was absolutely uttered but i did tell her afterwards that i would marry her  afterwards  yes when she followed me up to ahalala  did richard shand know her  of course he didon board the shipand he was with me when she came to ahalala  and she lived with you  yes  and you promised to marry her  yes  and was that all  i did not marry her of course said caldigate  who heard the promise  it was declared by her in the presence of that wesleyan minister she speaks of he went to her to rebuke her and she told him of the promise then he asked me and i did not deny it at the moment when he taxed me with it i was almost minded to do as i had promised  you repeated your promise then to him  nothing of the kind i did not deny it and i told him at last to mind his own business life up there was a little rough at that time  so it seems indeed and then after that  i had given her money and she had some claims in a goldmine when she was successful for a time she became so keen about her money that i fancy she hardly wished to get herself married then we had some words and so we parted  did she call herselfmrs caldigate  i never called her so  did she herself assume the name  it was a wild kind of life up there robert and this was apparent in nothing more than in the names people used i daresay some of the people did call her mrs caldigate but they knew she was not my wife  and this man crinkett  he knew all about it  he had a wife did his wife know her  he had quarrelled with his wife at that time and had sent her away from nobble mrs smith was then living at nobble and crinkett knew more about her than i did she was mad after gold and it was with crinkett she was working i gave her a lot of shares in another mine to leave me  what mine  the old stickinthemud they called it i had been in partnership with crinkett and wanted to get out of the thing and go in altogether for polyeuka at that time the woman cared little for husbands or lovers she had been bitten with the fury of goldgambling and like so many of them filled her mind with an idea of unlimited wealth and she had a turn of luck i suppose she was worth at one time eight or ten thousand pounds  but she did not keep it  i knew but little of her afterwards i kept out of her way and though i had dealings with crinkett i dropped them as soon as i could then he pausedbut robert bolton held his peace with anything but a satisfied countenance now i think you know all about it  it is a most distressing story  all attempts at robbery and imposition are of course distressing  there is so much in it that isdisgraceful  i deny it altogetherif you mean disgraceful to me  if it had all been known as it is known nowas it is known even by your own telling do you think that i should have consented to your marriage with my sister  why not robert bolton shrugged his shoulders and i think moreover that had you refused your consent i should have married your sister just the same  then you know very little about the matter  i dont think there can be any good in going into that it is at any rate the fact that your sister is my wife as this demand has been made upon me it was natural that i should wish to discuss it with some one whom i can trust i tell you all the facts but i am not going to listen to any faultfinding as to my past life  poor hester  why is she poor she does not think herself so  because there is a world of sorrow and trouble before her and because all that you have told to me must probably be made known to her  she knows it alreadythat is she knows what you mean i have not told her of the womans lie nor of this demand for money but i shall when she is strong enough to hear it and to talk of it you are very much mistaken if you think that there are secrets between me and hester  i dont suppose you will be pleased to hear the story of such a life told in all the public papers  certainly notbut it will be an annoyance which i can bear you or any one else would be very much mistaken who would suppose that life out in those places can go on in the same regular way that it does here gold beneath the ground is a dangerous thing to touch and few who have had to do with it have come out much freer from misfortune than myself as for these people i dont suppose that i shall hear from them again i shall send them both word that not a shilling is to be expected from me  there was after this a long discussion as to the nature of the messages to be sent there was no absolute quarrel between the two men and the attorney acknowledged to himself that it was now his duty to give the best advice in his power to his brotherinlaw but their manner to each other was changed it was evident that robert did not quite believe all that caldigate told him and evident also that caldigate resented this want of confidence but still each knew that he could not do without the other their connection was too firm and too close to be shaken off and therefore though their tones were hardly friendly still they consulted as to what should be done it was at last decided that two messages should be sent by caldigate one to crinkett and the other to mrs smith and each in the same words no money will be sent you on behalf of the polyeuka mine and that this should be all any letter robert bolton thought would be inexpedient then they parted and the two messages were at once sent  after a day or two caldigate recovered his spirits we all probably know how some trouble will come upon us and for a period seem to quell all that is joyous in our life and that then by quick degrees the weight of the trouble will grow less till the natural spring and vivacity of the mind will recover itself and make little or nothing of that which a few hours ago was felt to be so grievous a burden so it had been with john caldigate he had been man enough to hold up his head when telling his story to robert bolton and to declare that the annoyance would be one that he could bear easilybut still for some hours after that he had been unhappy if by sacrificing some considerable sum of moneyeven a large sum of money say ten thousand poundshe could at that moment have insured the silence of crinkett and the woman he would have paid his money he knew the world well enough to be aware that he could insure nothing by any such sacrifice he must defy these claimantsand then if they chose to come to england with their story he must bear it as best he could those who saw him did not know that aught ailed him and robert bolton spoke no word of the matter to any one at cambridge  but robert bolton thought very much of itso much that on the following day he ran up to london on purpose to discuss the matter with his brother william how would it be with them and what would be his duty if the statement made by the woman should turn out to be true what security had they after the story told by caldigate himself that there had been no marriage by his own showing he had lived with the woman had promised to marry her had acknowledged his promise in the hearing of a clergyman and had been aware that she had called herself by his name then he had given her money to go away this had been his own story do you believe him he said to his brother william  yes i do in the first place though i can understand from his antecedents and from his surroundings at the time that he should have lived a loose sort of life when he was out there i dont think that he is a rascal or even a liar  one wouldnt wish to think so  i do not think so he doesnt look like it or talk like it or act like it  how many cases do we know in which some abominable unexpected villainy has destroyed the happiness and respectability of a family  but what would you do asked the barrister she is married to him you cannot separate them if you would  nopoor girl if it be so her misery is accomplished but if it be so she should at once be taken away from him what a triumph it would be to her mother  that is a dreadful thing to say robert  but nevertheless true think of her warnings and refusals and of my persistence but if it be so not the less must we all insist upondestroying him if it be so he must be punished to the extent of the law  william bolton however would not admit that it could be so and robert declared that though he suspectedthough in such a case he found himself bound to suspecthe did not in truth believe that caldigate had been guilty of so terrible a crime all probability was against itbut still it was possible then after much deliberation it was decided that an agent should be sent out by them to new south wales to learn the truth as far as it could be learned and to bring back whatever evidence might be collected without making too much noise in the collection of it then there arose the question whether caldigate should be told of thisbut it was decided that it should be done at the joint expense of the two brothers without the knowledge of hesters husband     chapter xxv  the babys sponsors    is there anything wrong between you and robert hester asked this question of her husband one morning in january as he was sitting by the side of her sofa in their bedroom the baby was in her arms and at that moment there was a question as to the godfathers and godmother for the baby  the letter from mrs smith had arrived on the last day of october nearly two months before the birth of the baby and the telegrams refusing to send the money demanded had been despatched on the 1st novemberso that at this time caldigates mind was accustomed to the burden of the idea from that day to this he had not often spoken of the matter to robert boltonnor indeed had there been much conversation between them on other matters robert had asked him two or three times whether he had received any reply by the wires no such message had come and of course he answered his brotherinlaws questions accordinglybut he had answered them almost with a look of offence the attorneys manner and tone seemed to him to convey reproach and he was determined that none of the boltons should have the liberty to find fault with him it had been suggested some weeks since before the baby was born that an effort should be made to induce mrs bolton to act as godmother and since that among the names of many other relatives and friends those of uncle babington and robert bolton had been proposed hester had been particularly anxious that her brother should be asked becauseas she so often said to her husbandhe had always been her firm friend in the matter of her marriage but now when the question was to be settled john caldigate shook his head  i was afraid there was something even before baby was born said the wife  there is something my pet  what is it john you do not mean to keep it secret from me  i have not the slightest objection to your asking him to standbut i think it possible that he may refuse  why should he refuse  because as you say there is something wrong between us there have been applications for money about the polyeuka mine i would not trouble you about it while you were ill  does he think you ought to give back the money  nonot that we are quite agreed about the money but another question has come upand though we are i believe agreed about that too still there has been something a little uncomfortable  would not baby make that all right  i think if you were to ask your brother william it would be better  may i not know what it is now john  i have meant you to know alwaysfrom the moment when it occurredwhen you should be well enough  i am well now  i hardly know and yet i cannot bear to keep it secret from you  there was something in his manner which made her feel at once that the subject to which he alluded was of the greatest importance whether weak or strong of course she must be told now let the shock of the tidings be what it might the doubt would be worse she felt all that and she knew that he could feel it i am quite strong she said you must tell me now  is baby asleep put him in the cradle  is it so bad as that  i do not say that it is bad at all there is nothing bad in itexcept a lie let me put him in the cradle  then he took the child very gently and deposited him fast asleep among the blankets he had already assumed for himself the character of being a good male nurse and she was always delighted when she saw the baby in his arms then he came and seated himself close to her on the sofa and put his arm round her waist there is nothing badbut a lie  a lie may be so very bad  yes indeed and this lie is very bad do you remember my telling youabout a woman  that mrs smiththe dancing woman  yesher  of course i remember  she was one of those it seems who bought the polyeuka mine  oh indeed  she with crinkett and others now they want their money back again  but can they make you send it and would it be very badto lose it  they cannot make me send it they have no claim to a single shilling and if they could make me pay it that would not be very bad  what is it then you are afraid to tell me  yes my darlingafraid to speak to you of what is so wickedafraid to shock you to disgust you but not afraid of any injury that can be done to you no harm will come to you  but to you  nor to menone to you or to me or to baby there as he said this she clutched his hand with hers no harm dearest and yet the thing is so abominable that i can hardly bring myself to wound your ears with it  you must tell now john  yes i must tell you i have thought about it much and i know that it is better that you should be told he had thought much about it and had so resolved but he had not quite known how difficult the telling would be and now he was aware that he was adding to the horror she would feel by pausing and making much of the thing and yet he could not tell it as though it were a light matter if he could have declared it all at onceat first with a smile on his face then expressing his disgust at the womans falsehoodit would have been better that woman has written me a letter in which she declares herself to bemy wife  your wife john your wife these exclamations came from her almost with a shriek as she jumped up from his arms and for a moment stood before him  come back to me he said then again she seated herself you did not leave me then because you doubted me  oh no she cried throwing herself upon him and smothering him with kissesno no it was surprise at such horrid wordsnot doubt not doubt of you i will never doubt you  it was because i was sure of you that i have ventured to tell you this  you may be sure of me she said sobbing violently the while you are sure of me are you not and now tell it me all how did she say so why did she say so is she coming to claim you tell me all oh john tell me everything  the why is soon told because she wants money she had heard no doubt of my marriage and thought to frighten me out of money i do not think she would do it herself the man crinkett has put her up to it  what does she say  just thatand then she signs herselfeuphemia caldigate  oh john  now you know it all  may i not see the letter  for what good but you shall see it if you wish it i have determined that nothing shall be kept back from you in all that there may ever be to trouble us the best comfort will be in perfect confidence he had already learned enough of her nature to be sure that in this way would he best comfort her and most certainly ensure her trust in himself  oh yes she cried if you will tell me all i will never doubt you then she took the letter from his hand and attempted to read it but her excitement was so great that though the words were written very clearly she could not bring her mind to understand them treachery ruin married to you what is it all do you read it to meevery word of it then he did read it every word of it she says that she will marry the other man how can she marry him when she says that she isyour wife  just so my pet but you see what she says it does not matter much to her whether it be true or false so that she can get my money from me but hester i would fain be just even to her no doubt she wrote the letter  who else would have written it  she wrote it i know her hand and these are her wordsbecause they are properly expressed but it is all his doingthe mans doing he has got her in his power and he is using her in this way  if you sent her money  not a shillingnot though she were starving not now a man who gives money under a threat is gone if i were to send her money everyone would believe this tale that she tells your brother robert would believe it  he knows it  i took the letter to him instantly but i made up my mind that i would not show it you till baby was born you can understand that she only pressed closer to him as he said this i showed it to robert and altogether we are not quite such friends since as we were before  you do not mean that he believes it  no not that he does not believe it if he did i do not see how he and i could ever speak to each other again i dont think he believes it at all but i had to tell him the whole story and that perhaps offended him the whole story had not been told to hester nor did he think it necessary that it should be told there was no reason why these details which robert had elicited by his questions should be repeated to herthe promise of marriage the interference of the wesleyan minister the use made of his nameof all this he said nothing but she had now been told that which to her had been very dreadful and she was not surprised that her brother should have been offended when he heard the same sad story she of course had at once pardoned the old offence a young wife when she is sure of her husband will readily forgive all offences committed before marriage and will almost be thankful for the confidence placed in her when offences are confessed but she could understand that a brother could not be thankful and she would naturally exaggerate in her own mind the horror which he would feel at such a revelation then the husband endeavoured to lighten the effect of what he had said offence perhaps is the wrong word but he was stiff and masterful if you know what i mean  you would not bear that certainly john  no i have to own that i do not love the assumption of authorityexcept from you  you do not like it from anybody john  you would not wish me to submit myself to your brother  no but i think i might ask him to be babys godfather  as you please only you would be unhappy if he refused  then there came a little wail from the cradle and the baby was taken up and for some minutes his little necessities occupied the mother to the exclusion even of that terrible letter but when caldigate was about to leave the room she asked him another question will she do anything more john  i can hardly say i should think not  what does robert think  he has not told me i sent an immediate refusal by the telegraph wires and have heard nothing since  is henervous about it  i hardly know it dwells in his mind no doubt  are you nervous  it dwells in my mind that is all  may i speak to him about it  why should you what good would it do i would rather you did not nevertheless if you feel frightened if you think that there is anything wrong it will be natural that you should go to him for assistance i will not forbid it as he said this he stood back away from her it was but by a foot or two but still there was a sign of separation which instantly made itself palpable to her  wrong how wrong she said following him and clinging to him you do not suppose that i would go to him because i think you wrong do you not know that whatever might come i should cling to you what is he to me compared to you no i will never speak to him about it  he returned her caress with fervour and stroked her hair and kissed her forehead my dearest my own my darling but what i mean is that if some other mans opinion on this subject is necessary to your comfort you may go to him  no other mans opinion shall be necessary to me about anything i will not speak about it to robert or to any one but if more should come of it you will tell me  you shall know everything that comes i have never for a moment had the idea of keeping it back from you but because of baby and because baby had to be born i delayed it this was an excuse which as the mother of her child she could not but accept with thankfulness  i think i will ask him she said that night referring again to the vexed question of godfathers uncle babington had some weeks since very generously offered his services and of course they had been generously accepted among the babys relations he was the man of highest standing in the world and then this was a mark of absolute forgiveness in reference to the wrongs of poor julia and a long letter had been prepared to mrs bolton written by hesters own hand not without much trouble in which the babys grandmother was urged to take upon herself the duties of godmother all this had been discussed in the family so that the nature of the petition was well known to mrs bolton for some time before she received it mrs daniel who had consented to act in the event of a refusal from puritan grange had more than once used her influence with her stepmotherinlaw but no hint had as yet come to folking as to what the answer might be it had also been suggested that robert should be the other godfatherthe proposal having been made to mrs robert but there had come upon all the boltons a feeling that robert was indifferent perhaps even unwilling to undertake the task and yet no one knew why mrs robert herself did not know why  the reader however will know why and will understand how it was that mrs robert was in the dark the attorney though he was suspicious though he was frightened though he was in truth very angry with this new brotherinlaw through whose antenuptial delinquencies so much sorrow was threatened to the bolton family nevertheless kept the secret from all the cambridge boltons it had been necessary to him to seek counsel with some one but he had mentioned the matter only to his brother william but he did not wish to add to the bond which now tied him to folking if this horror this possible horror should fall upon themif it should turn out that he had insisted on giving his sister in marriage to a man already marriedthenthenthen such possible future incidents were too terrible to be considered closely but with such a possibility he would not add to the bonds at puritan grange they would throw all the responsibility of what had been done upon him this feeling was mingled with his love for his sisterwith the indignation he would not only feel but show if it should turn out that she had been wronged i will destroy himi will destroy him utterly he would sometimes say to himself as he thought of it  and now the godfather question had to be decided no he said to his wife i dont care about such things i wont do it you write and tell her that i have prejudices or scruples or whatever you choose to call it  there is to be a little tarradiddle told and i am to tell it  i have prejudices and scruples  about the religion of the thing she knewas of course she was bound to knowthat he had at any rate a round dozen of godchildren somewhere about the country there were the young williams and the young daniels and her own nephews and nieces with the parents of all of whom uncle robert had been regarded as the very man for a godfather the silversmith in trumpington street knew exactly the weight of the silver cup that was to be given to the boy or to a girl the bible and prayerbooks were equally well regulated mrs robert could not but smile at the idea of religious scruples i wish i knew what it was that has come over you of late i fancy you have quarrelled with john caldigate  if you think that then you can understand the reason  what is it about  i have not quarrelled with him it is possible that i may have to do so but i do not mean to say what it is about then he smiled i dont want you to ask any more questions but just to write to hester as kindly as you can saying i dont mean to be godfather any more it will be a good excuse in regard to all future babies mrs robert was a good wife and did as she was bid she worded her refusal as cautiously as she could andon that occasionasked her husband no further question  the prayer that was addressed to the lady of puritan grange became the subject of much debate of great consideration and i may say also of lengthened prayer to mrs bolton this position of godmother implied much of the old sacred responsibility which was formerly attached to it and which robert bolton like other godfathers and godmothers of the day had altogether ignored she had been already partly brought round nearly persuaded in regard to the acceptance of john caldigate as her soninlaw it did not occur to her to do other than hate him how was it possible that such a woman should do other than hate the man who had altogether got the better of her as to the very marrow of her life the very apple of her eye but she was alive to her duty towards her daughter and when she was told that the man was honest in his dealings welltodo in the world a professing christian who was constant in his parish church she did not know how to maintain her opinion that in spite of all this he was an unregenerate castaway therefore although she was determined still to hate him she had almost made up her mind to enter his house with these ideas she wrote a long letter to hester in which she promised to have herself taken out to folking in order that she might be present as godmother at the babys baptism she would lunch at folking but must return to chesterton before dinner even this was a great thing gained  then it was arranged that daniel bolton should stand as second godfather in place of his brother robert     chapter xxvi  a stranger in cambridge    i am sorry you will not come out to us tomorrow on the day before the christening which was at last fixed for a certain tuesday in the middle of february john caldigate went into cambridge and at once called upon the attorney at his office this he did partly instigated by his own feelings and partly in compliance with his wifes wishes before that letter had come he and his brotherinlaw had been fast friends and now though for a day or two he had been angry with what he had thought to be unjustifiable interference he regretted the loss of such a friend more than three months had now passed since the letter had come but his mind was far from being at ease and he felt that if trouble should come it would be very well for him to have robert bolton on his side  margaret is going said the attorney  why do you not bring her  days are days with me my boy i cant afford to give up a morning for every baby that is born  that of course may be true and if that is the reason i have nothing more to say as he spoke he looked in his brotherinlaws face so as almost to prevent the possibility of continued pretence  well caldigate it isnt the reason altogether said the other if you would have allowed it to pass without further explanation so would i but if the truth must be spoken in so many words i will confess that i would rather not go out to folking till i am sure we shall be no more troubled by your friends in australia  why not why should you not go out to folking  simply because i may have to take an active part against you i do not suppose it will come to that but it is possible i need not say that i trust there may be nothing of the kind but i cannot be sure it is on the cards  i think that is a hard judgment do you mean to say that you believe that womans statement not only against mine but against the whole tenor of my life and character  no i do not believe the womans statement if i did i should not be talking to you now the woman has probably lied and is probably a tool in the hands of others for raising money as you have already suggested but according to your own showing there has been much in your life to authorise the statement i do not know what does or does not constitute a marriage there  the laws are the same as ours  there at any rate you are wrong their marriage laws are not the same as ours though how they may differ you and i probably do not accurately know and they may be altered at any time as they may please let the laws be what they will it is quite possible after what you have told me that they may bring up evidence which you would find it very difficult to refute i dont think it will be so if i did i should use all my influence to remove my sister at once  you couldnt do it said caldigate very angrily  i tell you what i should endeavour to do you must excuse me if i stand aloof just at present i dont suppose you can defend such a condition of things as you described to me the other day  i do not mean to be put upon my defenceat any rate by you said caldigate very angrily and then he left the office  he had come into cambridge with the intention of calling at puritan grange after he had left the attorney and when he found himself in the street he walked on in the direction of chesterton he had wished to thank his wifes mother for her concession and had been told by hester that if he would call mrs bolton would certainly see him now had there been no letter from the woman in australia he would probably not have obeyed his wifes behest in this matter his heart and spirit would then have been without a flaw and proud in his own strength and his own rectitude he would have declared to himself that the absurd prejudices of a fanatic woman were beneath his notice but that letter had been a blow and the blow though it had not quelled him had weakened his forces he could conceal the injury done him even from his wife but there was an injury he was not quite the man that he had been before from day to day and from hour to hour he was always remonstrating with himself because it was so he was conscious that in some degree he had been cowed and was ever fighting against the feeling his tenderness to his wife was perhaps increased because he knew that she still suffered from the letter but he was almost ashamed of his own tenderness as being a sign of weakness he made himself very busy in these daysbusy among his brother magistrates busy among his farming operations busy with his tenants busy among his books so as to show to those around him that he was one who could perform all the duties of life and enjoy all the pleasures with an open brow and a clear conscience he had been ever bold and selfasserting but now he was perhaps a little overbold but through it all the australian letter and the australian woman were present to him day and night  it was this resolution not to be quelled that had made him call upon the attorney at his office and when he found himself back in the street he was very angry with the man if it pleases him let it be so he said to himself i can do in the world without him and then he thought of that threatwhen the attorney had said that he would remove his sister remove her by heavens he had a stick in his hand and as he went he struck it angrily against a post remove his wife all the boltons in cambridgeshire could not put a hand upon her unless by his leave for some moments his anger supported him but after a while that gave way to the old feeling of discomfort which pervaded him always she was his wife and nobody should touch her nevertheless he might find it difficult as robert bolton had said to prove that that other woman was not his wife  robert boltons office was in a small street close to pembroke college and when he came out of it he had intended to walk direct through trumpington street and trinity street to chesterton but he found it necessary to compose himself and so to arrange his thoughts that he might be able to answer such foolish questions as mrs bolton would probably ask him without being flurried he was almost sure that she had heard nothing of the woman he did not suspect robert bolton of treachery in that respect but she would probably talk to him about the iniquity of his past life generally and he must be prepared to answer her it was incumbent upon him to shake off before he reached chesterton that mixture of alarm and anger which at present dominated him and with this object instead of going straight along the street he turned into the quadrangle of kings college and passing through the gardens and over the bridge wandered for a while slowly under the trees at the back of the college he accused himself of a lack of manliness in that he allowed himself to be thus cowed did he not know that such threats as these were common was it not just what might have been expected from such a one as crinkett when crinkett was driven to desperation by failing speculations as he thought of the woman he shook his head looking down upon the ground the woman had at one time been very dear to him but it was clearly now his duty to go on as though there were no such woman as euphemia smith and no such man as thomas crinkett and as for robert bolton he would henceforth treat him as though his anger and his suspicions were unworthy of notice if the man should choose of his own accord to reassume the old friendly relationswell and good no overtures should come from himcaldigate and if the anger and the suspicions endured why then he caldigate could do very well without robert bolton  as he made these resolutions he turned in at a little gate opening into a corner of st johns gardens with the object of passing through the college back into the streets of the town it was not quite his nearest way but he loved the old buildings and the trees and the river even in winter it still was winter being now the middle of february but as it happened the air was dry and mild and the sun was shining still he was surprised at such a time of the year to see an elderly man apparently asleep on one of the benches which are placed close to the path but there he was asleep with his two hands on a stick and his head bent forward over his stick it was impossible not to look at the man sleeping there in that way but caldigate would hardly have looked would hardly have dared to look could he have anticipated what he would see the elderly man was thomas crinkett as he passed he was quite sure that the man was thomas crinkett when he had gone on a dozen yards he paused for a moment to consider what he would do a dozen different thoughts passed through his mind in that moment of time why was the man there why indeed could he have come to england except with the view of prosecuting the demand which he and the woman had made his presence even in england was sufficient to declare that this battle would have to be fought but to cambridge he could have come with no other object than that of beginning the attack at once and then had he already commenced his work he had not at any rate been to robert bolton to whom any one knowing the family would have first referred him and why was he sleeping there why was he not now at work upon his project again would it be better at the present moment that he should pass by the man as though he had not seen him or should he go back and ask him his purpose as the thought passed through his mind he stayed his step for a moment on the pathway and looked round the man had moved his position and was now sitting with his head turned away but evidently not asleep then it occurred to caldigate that crinketts slumbers had been only a pretence that the man had seen and recognised him and at the moment had not chosen to make himself known and it occurred to him also that in a matter of such importance as this he should do nothing on the spur of the momentnothing without consideration a word spoken to crinkett a word without consideration might be fatal to him so he passed on having stood upon the path hardly more than a second or two  before he had got up to the new buildings of st johns a cold sweat had come out all over him he was conscious of this and conscious also that for a time he was so confounded by the apparition of his enemy as to be unable to bring his mind to work properly on the subject let him do his worst he kept on saying to himself let him do his worst but he knew that the brave words though spoken only to himself were mere braggadocio no doubt the man would do his worst and very bad it would be to him at the moment he was so cowed by fear that he would have given half his fortune to have secured the womans silenceand the mans how much better would it have been had he acceded to the mans first demand as to restitution of a portion of the sum paid for polyeuka before the womans name had been brought into the matter at all  but reflections such as these were now useless and he must do something it was for his wifes sakehe assured himselffor his wifes sake that he allowed himself to be made thus miserable by the presence of this wretched creature what would she not be called upon to suffer the woman no doubt would be brought before magistrates and judges and would be made to swear that she was his wife the whole story of his life in australia would be made publicand there was so much that could not be made public without overwhelming her with sorrow his own father too who had surrendered the estate to him must know it all his father hitherto had not heard the name of mrs smith and had been told only of crinketts dishonest successes and dishonest failures when caldigate had spoken of crinkett to his father he had done so with a triumph as of a man whom he had weighed and measured and made use ofwhose frauds and cunning he had conquered by his own honesty and better knowledge now he could no longer weigh and measure and make use of crinkett crinkett had been a joke to him in talking with his father but crinkett was no joke now  while walking through the college quad he was half stupefied by his confusion and was aware that such was his condition but going out under the gate he paused for a moment and shook himself he must at any rate summon his own powers to his aid at the moment and resolve what he would do however bad all this might be there was a better course and a worse if he allowed this confusion to master him he would probably be betrayed into the worse course now at this moment in what way would it become him to act he drew himself together shaking his head and shouldersso as to shake off his weaknesspressing his foot for a moment on the earth so as to convince himself of his own firmness and then he resolved  he was on the way out to see his motherinlaw but he thought that nothing now could be gained by going to chesterton it was not impossible that crinkett might have been there if so the man would have told something of his story and his wifes mother was the last person in the world whom under such circumstances he could hope to satisfy he must tell no lie to any one he must at least conceal nothing of the things as they occurred now he must not allow it to be first told by crinkett that they two had seen each other in the gardens but he could not declare this to mrs bolton for the present the less he saw of mrs bolton the better she would come to the christening tomorrowunless indeed crinkett had already told enough to induce her to change her mindbut after that any intimacy with the house at chesterton had better be postponed till this had all been settled  but how much would have to be endured before that robert bolton had almost threatened to take his wife away from him no one could take his wife away from himunless indeed the law were to say that she was not his wife but how would it be with him if she herself under the influence of her family were to wish to leave him the law no doubt would give him the custody of his own wife till the law had said that she was not his wife but could he keep her if she asked him to let her go and should she be made to doubtshould her mind be so troubled as it would be should she once be taught to think it possible that she had been betrayedwould she not then want to go from him would it not be probable that she would doubt when she should be told that this woman had been called by her husbands name in australia and when he should be unable to deny that he had admitted or at least had not contradicted the appellation  on a sudden when he turned away from the street leading to chesterton as he came out of the college he resolved that he would at once go back to robert bolton the man was offensive suspicious and selfwilled but nevertheless his good services if they could be secured would be allimportant for his wifes sake as caldigate said to himselffor his wifes sake he must bear much i have come to tell you something that has occurred since i was here just now said caldigate meeting his brotherinlaw at the door of the office would you mind coming back  i am rather in a hurry  it is of importance and you had better hear it said caldigate leading the way imperiously to the inner room it is for your sisters sake that man crinkett is in cambridge  in cambridge  i saw him just now  and spoke to him the attorney asked  no i passed him and i do not know even whether he recognised me but he is here in cambridge  and the woman  i have told you all that i know he has not come here for nothing  probably not said the attorney with a scornful smile you will hear of him before long  of course i shall i have come to you now to ask a question i must put my case at once into a lawyers hands crinkett no doubt will commit perjury and i must undergo the annoyance and expense of proving him to be a perjurer she probably is here also and will be ready to commit perjury of course i must have a lawyer will you act for me  i will act for my sister  your sister and i are one and i am obliged therefore to ask again whether you will act for me of course i should prefer it though you are i think hard to me in this matter i can trust you implicitly it will be infinitely better for hester that it should be so but i must have some lawyer  and so must she  hers and mine must be the same as to that i will not admit any question can you undertake to fight this matter on my behalfand on hers if you feel absolutely hostile to me you had better decline for myself i cannot understand why there should be such hostility  caldigate had so far conquered his own feelings of abasement as to be able to say this with a determined face looking straight into the attorneys eyes at any rate without sign of fear  it wants thinking about said robert bolton  tomorrow the baby is to be christened and for hesters sake i will endeavour to put this matter asidebut on wednesday i must know  on wednesday morning i will answer your question but what if this man comes to me in the meantime  listen to him or speak to him just as seems good to you you know everything that there is to tell and may therefore know whether he lies or speaks the truth  then caldigate went to the inn got his horse and rode back to folking     chapter xxvii  the christening    the next day was the day of the christening caldigate on his return home from cambridge had felt himself doomed to silence he could not now at this moment tell his wife that the man had comethe man who would doubtless work her such terrible misery she was very strong she had gone through the whole little event of her babys birth quite as well as could be expected and had been just what all her friends might have wished her to be but that this blow had fallen upon herbut that these ill news had wounded hershe would now have been triumphant her mother was at last coming to her her husband was all that a husband should be her baby was to her thinking sweeter brighter more satisfactory than any other baby ever had been but the first tidings had been told to her she had seen the letter signed euphemia caldigate and of course she was ill at ease knowing how vexatious the matter was to her husband she had spoken of it but seldomhaving asked but a question now and again when the matter pressed itself too severely on her mind he understood it all both her reticence and her sufferings her sufferings must of course be increased she must know before long that crinkett and probably the woman also were in her neighbourhood but he could not tell her now when she was preparing her baby for his ceremony in the church  the bells were rung and the baby was prepared and mrs bolton came out to folking according to her promise though robert was not there many of the boltons were present as was also uncle babington he had come over on the preceding evening making on this occasion his first journey to folking since his wifes sister had died and the old squire was there in very good humour though he excused himself from going to the church by explaining that as he had no duty to perform he would only be in the way amongst them all daniel and mrs bolton had also been at folking that night and had then for the first time been brought into contact with the babington grandeur the party had been almost gay the old squire having taken some delight in what he thought to be the absurdities of his brotherinlaw mr babington himself was a man who was joyous on most occasions and always gay on such an occasion as this he had praised the mother and praised the baby and praised the house of folking generally graciously declaring that his wife looked forward to the pleasure of making acquaintance with her new niece till old mr caldigate had been delighted with these manifestations of condescension folking is a poor place said he but babington is really a countryhouse  yes replied the other squire much gratified babington is what you may call really a good countryhouse  you had to laugh very hard at him before you could offend uncle babington in all this john caldigate was obliged to assist knowing all the time feeling all the time that crinkett was in cambridge and through all this the young mother had to appear happy knowing the existence of that letter signed euphemia caldigatefeeling it at every moment and they both acted their parts well caldigate himselfthough when he was alone the thought of what was coming would almost crush himcould always bear himself bravely when others were present  on the morning before they went to church when the bells were ringing old mr bolton came in a carriage with his wife from cambridge she of course condescended to give her hand to her soninlaw but she did it with a look which was full of bitterness she did not probably intend to be specially bitter but bitterness of expression was common to her she was taken however at once up to the baby and then in the presence of her daughter and grandchild it may be presumed that she relaxed a little at any rate her presence in the house made her daughter happy for the time  then they all went to the church except the squire who as he himself pleaded had no duty to perform there mrs bolton as she was taken through the hall saw him and recognised him but would not condescend even to bow her head to him though she knew how intimate he had been with her husband she still feltthough she had yielded for this day this day which was to make her grandchild a christianthat there must be and should be a severance between people such as the boltons and people such as the caldigates  as the service went on and as the water was sprinkled and as the prayers were said caldigate felt thankful that so much had been allowed to be done before the great trouble had disclosed itself the doubt whether even the ceremony could be performed before the clap of thunder had been heard through all cambridge had been in itself a distinct sorrow to him had crinkett showed himself at chesterton neither mrs bolton nor daniel bolton would have been standing then at the font had crinkett been heard of at babington uncle babington would not now have been at folking all this was passing through his mind as he was standing by the font when the ceremony of making the young daniel humphrey caldigate a christian was all but completed he fancied that he saw old mr boltons eyes fixed on something in the church and he turned his head suddenly with no special purpose but simply looking as one is apt to look when another looks there he saw on a seat divided from himself by the breadth of the little nave thomas crinkett sitting with another man  there was not a shadow of a doubt on his mind as to the identity of the australiannor as to that of crinketts companion at the moment he did not remember the mans name but he knew him as a miner with whom he had been familiar at ahalala and who had been in partnership both with himself and crinkett at nobbleas one who had alas been in his society when euphemia smith had been there also at that instant he remembered the fact that the man had called euphemia smith mrs caldigate in his presence and that he had let the name pass without remonstrance the memory of that moment flashed across him now as he quickly turned back his face towards his child who was still uttering his little wail in the arms of the clergyman  utterden church is not a large building the seat on which crinkett had placed himself was one usually occupied by parish boys at the end of the row of appropriated seats and near to the door less than halfadozen yards from it at the other side of the way leading up the church stood the font so that the stranger was almost close to caldigate when he turned they were so near that others there could not but have observed them even the clergyman however absorbed he might have been in his sacred work could not but have observed them it was not there as it might have been in a town any stranger even on a sunday would be observed by all in utterden churchhow much then at a ceremony which as a rule none but friends attend and crinkett was looking on with all his eyes leaning forward over his stick and watching closely caldigate had taken it all in even in that moment the other man was sitting back gazing at nothing as though the matter to him were indifferent caldigate could understand it all the man was there simply to act or to speak when he might be wanted  as the ceremony was completed john caldigate stood by and played with all proper words and actions the part of the young father no one standing there could see by his face that he had been struck violently that he had for a few moments been almost unable to stand but he himself was aware that a cold sweat had broken out all over him as before though he leaned over the baby lying in his mothers arms and kissed it and smiled on the young mother he did so as some great actor will carry out his part before the public when nearly sinking to the ground from sudden suffering what would it be right that he should do nownownow no one there had heard of crinkett except his wife and even she herself had no idea that the man of whom she had heard was in england should he speak to the man or should he endeavour to pass out of the church as though he had not recognised him could he trust himself even to make the endeavour when he should have turned round and when he would find himself face to face with the man  and then what should he say and how should he act if the man addressed him in the church the man had not come out there to utterden for nothing and probably would so address him he had determined on telling no lieno lie at any rate as to present circumstances that life of his in australia had been necessarily rough and though successful had not been quite as it should have been as to that he thought that it ought to be permitted to him to be reticent but as to nothing since his marriage would he lie if crinkett spoke to him he must acknowledge the manbut if crinkett told his story about euphemia smith in the church before them all how should he then answer there was but a moment for him to decide it all the decision had to be made while he was handing back his babe to its mother with his sweetest smile  as the party at the font was broken up the eyes of them all were fixed upon the two strangers a christening in a public church is a public service and open to the world at large there was no question to be asked them but each person as he looked at them would of course think that somebody else would recognise them they were decently dresseddressed probably in such garments as gentlemen generally wear on winter morningsbut any one would know at a glance that they were not english gentlemen and they were of an appearance unfamiliar to any one there but caldigate himselfclean but rough not quite at home in their clothes which had probably been bought readymade with rough ignoble facesfaces which you would suspect but faces nevertheless which had in them something of courage as the little crowd prepared to move from the font the two men got up and stood in their places  caldigate took the opportunity to say a word to mr bromley before he turned round so that he might yet pause before he decided at that moment he resolved that he would recognise his enemy and treat him with the courtesy of old friendship it would be bad to do at the moment but he thought that in this way he might best prepare himself for the future crinkett had appealed to him for money but crinkett himself had said nothing to him about euphemia smith the man had not as yet accused him of bigamy the accusation had come from her and it still might be that she had used crinketts name wrongfully at any rate he thought that when the clap of thunder should have come it would be better for him not to have repudiated a man with whom it would then be known that his relations had once been so intimate  he addressed himself therefore at once to his old associate i am surprised to see you here mr crinkett this he said with a smile and a pleasant voice putting out his hand to him how hard it was to summon up that smile how hard to get that tone of voice even those commonplace words had been so difficult of selection was it you i saw yesterday in the college gardens  yes it was me no doubt  i turned round and then thought that it was impossible we have just been christening my child will you come up to our breakfast  you remember jack adamsoneh  of course i do said caldigate giving his hand to the second man who was rougher even than crinkett i hope he will come up also this is my uncle mr babington and this is my fatherinlaw mr bolton these were two of my partners at nobble he said turning to the two old gentlemen who were looking on with astonished eyes they have come over here i suppose with reference to the sale i made to them lately of my interests at polyeuka  thats about it said adamson  we wont talk business just at this moment because we have to eat our breakfast and drink our boys health but when that is done ill hear what you have to sayor come into cambridge tomorrow just as you please youll walk up to the house now and ill introduce you to my wife  we dont mind if we do eat a bitdo we jack said crinkett jack bobbed his head and so they walked back to folking the three of them together while the two mr boltons and uncle babington followed behind the ladies and the baby had been taken in a carriage  the distance from the church to the house at folking was less than half a mile but caldigate thought that he would never reach his hall door how was he to talk to the menwith what words and after what fashion and what should he say about them to his wife when he reached home she had seen him speak to them had known that he had been obliged to stay behind with them when it would have been so natural that he should have been at her side as she got into the carriage of that he was aware but he could not know how far their presence would have frightened her yes he said in answer to some question from crinkett the property round here is not exactly mine but my fathers  they tell me as its yours now said crinkett  you havent to learn today that in regard to other peoples concerns men talk more than they know the land is my fathers estate but i live here  and him asked adamson  he lives in cambridge  thats what we meanaint it crinkett said adamson youre boss here  yes im boss  and a deuced good time you seem to have of it said crinkett  ive nothing to complain of replied caldigate feeling himself at the moment to be the most miserable creature in existence  it was fearful workwork so cruel that his physical strength hardly enabled him to support it he already repented his present conduct telling himself that it would have been better to have treated the men from the first as spies and enemiesthough in truth his conduct had probably been the wisest he could have adopted at last he had the men inside the hall door and introducing them hurriedly to his father he left them that he might rush up to his wifes bedroom the nurse was there and her mother and at the moment she only looked at him she was too wise to speak to him before them but at last she succeeded in making an opportunity of being alone with her husband you stay here nurse ill be back directly mamma and then she took him across the passage into his own dressingroom who are they john who are they  they are men from the mines as they were my partners i have asked them to come in to breakfast  and the woman as she spoke she held on to the back of a chair by which she stood and only whispered her question  no woman is with them  is it the mancrinkett  yes it is crinkett  in this house and i am to sit at table with him  it will be best so listen dearest all that i know all that we know of crinkett is that he is asking money of me because the purchase he made of me has turned out badly for him  but he is to marry that woman who says that she is then she stopped looking into his face with agony she could not bring herself to utter the words which would signify that another woman claimed to be her husbands wife  you are going too fast hester i cannot condemn the man for what the woman has written until i know that he says the same himself he was my partner and i have had his moneyi fear all his money he as yet has said nothing about the woman as it is so it behoves me to be courteous to him that i am suffering much you must be well aware i am sure you will not make it worse for me  no no she said embracing him i will not i will be brave i will do all that i can but you will tell me everything  everything he said then he kissed her and went back again to his unwelcome guests she was not long before she followed him bringing her baby in her arms then she took the child round to be kissed by all its relatives and afterwards bowed politely to the two men and told them that she was glad to see her husbands old friends and fellowworkmen  yes mum said jack adamson weve been fellowworkmen when the work was hard enough t young squire seems to have got over his difficulties pretty tidy then she smiled again and nodded to them and retreated back to her mother  mrs bolton scowled at them feeling certain that they were godless personsin which she was right the old banker drawing his son daniel out of the room whispered an inquiry but daniel bolton knew nothing theres been something wrong as to the sale of that mine said the banker daniel bolton thought it probable that there had been something wrong  the breakfast was eaten and the childs health was drunk and the hour was passed it was a bad time for them all but for caldigate it was a very bitter hour to him the effort made was even more difficult than to heras was rightfor she at any rate had been blameless then the boltons went away as had been arranged and also uncle babington while the men still remained  if you dont mind squire ill take a turn with you said crinkett at last while jack can sit anywhere about the place  certainly said caldigate and so they took their hats and went off and jack adamson was left sitting anywhere about the place     chapter xxviii  tom crinkett at folking    caldigate thought that he had better take his companion where there would be the least chance of encountering many eyes he went therefore through the garden into the farmyard and along the road leading back to the dike and then he walked backwards and forwards between the ferry over the wash and the termination of the private way by which they had come the spot was not attractive as far as rural prettiness was concerned they had on one hand or the other as they turned the long straight deep dike which had been cut at right angles to the middle wash and around the fields were flat plashy and heavylooking with the mud of february but crinkett for a while did not cease to admire everything and them are all yourn he said pointing to a crowd of cornstacks standing in the haggard  yes theyre mine i wish they were not  what do you mean by that  as prices are at present a man doesnt make pinch by growing corn and keeping it to this time of the year  and where them chimneys isis that yourn this he said pointing along the straight line of the road to farmer holts homestead which showed itself on the other side of the wash  it belongs to the estate said caldigate  by jingo and how i remember your acoming and talking to me across the gate at polyeuka hall  i remember it very well  i didnt know as you were an estated gent in those days  i had spent a lot of money when i was young and the estate as you call it was not large enough to bear the loss so i had to go out and work and get back what i had squandered  and you did it  yes i did it  my word yes what a lot of money you took out of the colony caldigate  im not going to praise myself but i worked hard for it and when i got it i didnt run riot  not with drink  nor in any other way i kept my money  welli dont know as you was very much more of a joseph than anybody else then crinkett laughed most disagreeably and caldigate turning over various ideas rapidly in his mind thought that a good deed would be done if a man so void of feeling could be drowned beneath the waters of the black deep dike which was slowly creeping along by their side any way you was luckyinfernally lucky  you did not do badly yourself when i first reached nobble you had the name of more money than i ever made  whos got it now eh caldigate whos got my money now  it would take a clever man to tell that  it dont take much cleverness for me to tell who has got more of it nor anybody else and it dont take much cleverness for me to tell that i aint got none of it left myselfnone of it caldigate not a d hundred pounds this he said with terrible energy  im sorry its so bad as that with you crinkett  yesyou is sorry i daresay youve acted sorry in all you said and done since i got taken in last by that  minehavent you welli have got just a few hundreds what i could scrape together to bring me and a few others as might be wanted over to england theres jack adamson with me and  just two more they may be wanted squire  the attack now was being commenced and how was he to repel it or to answer it only on one ground had he received from robert bolton a decided opinion under no circumstances was he to give money to these persons were he to be guilty of that weakness he would have delivered himself over into their hands and not only did he put implicit trust in the sagacity of robert bolton but he himself knew enough of the worlds opinion on such a matter to be aware that a man who has allowed himself to be frightened out of money is supposed to have acknowledged some terrible delinquency he had been very clear in his mind when that letter came from euphemia smith that he would not now make any rebate till that attack had come it might have been open to him to be generousbut not now and yet when this man spoke of his own loss and reminded him of his wealthwhen crinkett threw it in his teeth that by a happy chance he had feathered his nest with the spoils taken from the wretched man himselfthen he wished that it was in his power to give back something  is that said as a threat he asked looking round on his companion and resolving that he would be brave  thats as you take it squire we dont want to threaten nothing  because if you do youd better go and do what you have to do away from here  dont you be so rough now with an old pal you wont do no good by being rough i wasnt rough to you when you came to polyeuka hall without very much in your pocket this was untrue for crinkett had been rough and caldigates pockets had been full of money but there could be no good got by contradicting him on small trifles i was a good mate to you then you wouldnt even have got your finger into the old stickinthemud nor yet into polyeuka but for me i was the making of your fortin caldigate i was  my fortune such as it is was made by my own industry  industry be blowed i dont know that you were so much better than anybody else wasnt i industrious wasnt i thinking of it morning noon and night and nothing else you was smart i do allow that caldigate you was very smart  did you ever know me dishonest  pooh whats honesty theres nothing so smart as honesty whatever you got you got a sure hold of thats what you mean by honesty you was clever enough to take care as you had really got it now about this polyeuka business ill tell you how it is i and jack adamson and anotheras he alluded to the other he winkedwe believed in polyeuka we did d the cussed hole wellwhen you was gone we thought wed try it it was not easy to get the money as you wanted but we got it one of the banks down at sydney went shares but took all the plant as security then the cussed place ran out the moment the money was paid it was just as though fortin had done it a purpose if you dont believe what im asaying ive got the documents to show you  caldigate did believe what the man said it was a matter as to which he had in the way of business received intelligence of his own from the colony and he was aware that he had been singularly lucky as to the circumstances and time of the sale but there had been nothing smart about it those in the colony who understood the matter thought at the time that he was making a sacrifice of his own interests by the terms proposed he had thought so himself but had been willing to make it in order that he might rid himself of further trouble he had believed that the machinery and plant attached to the mine had been nearly worth the money and he had been quite certain that crinkett himself when making the bargain had considered himself to be in lucks way but such property as he well knew was by its nature precarious and liable to sudden changes he had been fortunate and the purchasers had been the reverse of that he had no doubt though probably the man had exaggerated his own misfortune when he had been given to understand how bad had been the fate of these old companions of his in the matter with the feelings of a liberal gentleman he was anxious to share with them the loss had crinkett come to him explaining all that he now explained without any interference from euphemia smith he would have been anxious to do much but nowhow could he do anything now i do not at all disbelieve what you tell me about the mine he said  and yet you wont do anything for us you aint above taking all our money and seeing us starve and that when you have got everything round you here like an estated gentleman as you are  there was a touch of eloquence in this a soundness of expostulation which moved him much he could afford to give back half the price he had received for the mine and yet be a welltodo man  he paid over to his father the rents from folking but he had the house and homefarm for nothing and the sum which he had received for polyeuka by no means represented all his savings he did not like to think that he had denuded this man who had been his partner of everything in order that he himself might be unnecessarily rich it was not pleasant to him to think that the fatness of his opulence had been extracted from jack adamson and fromeuphemia smith when the application for return of the money had been first made to him from australia he hadnt known what he knew now there had been no eloquence thenno expostulation now he thoroughly wished that he was able to make restitution a threat has been used to me he muttered almost anxious to explain to the man his exact position  a threat i aint threatened nothing but i tell you there will be threats and worse than threats fair means first and foul means afterwards thats about it caldigate  if he could have got this man to say that there was no threat to be simply piteous he thought that he might even yet have suggested some compromise but that was impossible when he was told that worse than threats was in store for him he was silent for some moments thinking whether it would not be better for him to rush into that matter of euphemia smith himself but up to this time he had no absolute knowledge that crinkett was aware of the letter which had been written no doubt that in speaking of another as being joined with himself and adamson he had intended that euphemia smith should be understood but till her name had been mentioned he could not bring himself to mention it he could not bring himself to betray the fear which would become evident if he spoke of the woman  i think you had better go to my lawyer he said  we dont want no lawyering the plunder is yours no doubt whether youll have so much law on your side in other mattersthats the question crinkett did not in the least understand the state of his companions mind to crinkett it appeared that caldigate was simply anxious to save his money  i do not know that i can say anything else to you just at present the bargain was a fair bargain and you have no ground for any claim you come to me with some mysterious threat  you understand said crinkett  i care nothing for your threats i can only bid you go and do your worst  thats what we intend  that you should have lost money by me is a great sorrow to me  you look sorry squire  but after what you have said i can make you no offer if you will go to my brotherinlaw mr robert bolton  thats the ladys brother  my wifes brother  i know all about it caldigate i wont go to him at all whats he to us it aint likely that i am going to ask him for money to hold our tongues not a bit of it youve had sixty thousand pounds out of that mine the bank found twenty and took all the plant theres forty gone will you share the loss give us twenty and well be off back to australia by the first ship and ill take a wife back with me you understand ill take a wife back with me then we shall be all square all round  with what delight would he have given the twenty thousand pounds had he dared had there been no question about the woman he would have given the money to satisfy his own conscience as to the injury he had involuntarily done to his old partners but he could not do it now he could make no suggestion towards doing it to do so would be to own to all the boltons that mrs euphemia smith was his wife and were he to do so how could he make himself secure that the man and the woman would go back to australia and trouble him no more all experience forbade him to hope for such a result and then the payment of the money would be one of many damning pieces of evidence against him they had now got back for the second time to the spot at which the way up to the house at folking turned off from the dike here he paused and spoke what were intended to be his last words i have nothing more to say crinkett i will not promise anything myself a threatened man should never give way you know that yourself but if you will go to my brotherinlaw i will get him to see you  d your brotherinlaw he aint your brotherinlaw no more than i am  now the sword had been drawn and the battle had been declared after that said caldigate walking on in front i shall decline to speak to you any further he went back through the farmyard at a quick pace while crinkett kept up with him but still a few steps behind in the front of the house they found jack adamson who in obedience to his friends suggestion had been sitting anywhere about the place  im blowed if he dont mean to stick to every lump hes robbed us of said crinkett in a loud voice  he do do he then we know what weve got to be after  ive come across some of em precious mean continued crinkett but a meaner skunk nor this estated gent who is a justice of the peace and a squire and all that i never did come across and i dont suppose i never shall and then they stood looking at him jeering at him and the gardener who was then in the front of the house heard it all  darvell said the squire open the gate for these gentlemen darvell of course knew that they had been brought from the church to the house and had been invited in to the christening breakfast  if i were darvell i wouldnt take wages from such a skunk as you said crinkett a man as has robbed his partners of every shilling and has married a young lady when he has got another wife living out in the colony at least she was out in the colony she aint there now darvell shes somewhere else now thats what your master is darvell youll have to look out for a place because your masterll be in quod before long how much is it they gets for bigamy jack three years at the treadmillthats about it but i pities the young lady and the poor little bastard  what was he to do a sense of what was fitting for his wife rather than for himself forbade him to fly at the man and take him by the throat and now of course the wretched story would be told through all cambridgeshire nothing could prevent that now darvell he said as he turned towards the hall steps you must see these men off the premises the less you say to them the better  well only just tell him all about it as we goes along comfortable said adamson darvell who was a good sort of man in his wayslow rather than stupid weighted with the ordinary respect which a servant has for his masterhad heard it all but showed no particular anxiety to hear more he accompanied the men down to the causeway hardly opening his mouth to them while they were loud in denouncing the meanness of the man who had deserted a wife in australia and had then betrayed a young lady here in england  what were they talking about said his wife to him when they were alone i heard their voices even here  they were threatening methreatening me and you  about that woman  yes about that woman not that they have dared yet to mention her namebut it was about that woman  and she  ive heard nothing from her since that letter i do not know that she is in england but i suppose that she is with them  does it make you unhappy john  very unhappy  does it frighten you  yes it makes me fear that you for a while will be made miserableyou whom i had thought that i could protect from all sorrow and from all care o my darling of course it frightens me but it is for you  what will they do first john  they have already said words before the man there which will of course be spread about the country  what words  then he paused but after pausing he spoke very plainly they said that you were not my wife  but i am  indeed you are  tell me all truly though i were not i would still be true to you  but hesterhester you are do not speak as though that were possible  i know that you love me i am sure of that nothing should ever make me leave younothing you are all the world to me now whatever you may have done i will be true to you only tell me everything  i think i have he said hoarsely then he remembered that he had told much to robert bolton which she had not heard i did tell her that i would marry her  you did  yes i did  is not that a marriage in some countries  i think nowherecertainly not there and the people hearing of it all used to call her by my name  o johnwill not that be against us  it will be against mein the minds of persons like your mother  i will care nothing for that i know that you have repented and are sorry i know that you love me now  i have always loved you since the first moment that i saw you  never for a moment believe that i will believe them let them do what they will i will be your wife nothing shall take me away from you but it is sad is it not on that the very day that poor baby has been christened then they sat and wept together and tried to comfort each other but nothing could comfort him he was almost prostrated at the prospect of his coming miseryand of hers     chapter xxix  just by telling me that i am    the thunderbolt had fallen now caldigate when he left his wife that he might stroll about the place after the dusk had fallen told himself again and again that the thunderbolt had certainly fallen now there could be no longer a doubt but that this woman would claim him as her husband a whole world of remorse and regrets oppressed his conscience and his heart he looked back and remembered the wise counsels which had been given him on board the ship when the captain and mrs callender and poor dick shand had remonstrated with him and called to mind his own annoyance when he had bidden them mind their own affairs and then he remembered how he had determined to break away from the woman at sydney and to explain to her as he might then have done without injustice that they two could be of no service the one to the other and that they had better part it seemed now as he looked back to have been so easy for him then to have avoided danger so easy to have kept a straight course but nownow surely he would be overwhelmed  and then how easy it would have been had he been more careful at the beginning of these troubles to have bought these wretches off he had been he now acknowledged too peremptory in his first refusal to refund a portion of the money to crinkett the application had indeed been made without those proofs as to the condition of the mine which had since reached him and he had distrusted crinkett crinkett he had known to be a man not to be trusted but yet even after receiving the letter from euphemia smith the matter might have been arranged when he had first become assured that the new polyeuka company had failed he should have made an offer even though euphemia smith had then commenced her threats with skill might he not have done it on this very day might he not have made the man understand that if he would base his claim simply on his losses and make it openly on that ground then his claim should be considered but now it was too late and the thunderbolt had fallen  what must he do first robert bolton had promised to tell him on the morrow whether he would act for him as his lawyer he felt sure now that his brotherinlaw would not do so but it would be necessary that he should have an answer and that necessity would give him an excuse for going into cambridge and showing himself among the boltons let his sufferings or his fears be what they might he would never confess to the world that he suffered or that he was frightened by shutting himself up he would be seen about cambridge walking openly as though no reports no rumours had been spread about concerning him he would go to the houses of his wifes relations until he should be told that he was not welcome  john his wife said to him that night bear it like a man  am i not bearing it like a man  it is crushing your very heart i see it in your eyes  can you bear it he asked his question with a stern voice but as he asked it he turned to her and kissed her  yes she said yes while i have you with me and baby i can bear anything while you will tell me everything that happens i will bear everything and john when you were out just now and when i am alone and trying to pray i told myself that i ought not to be unhappy for i would sooner have you and baby and all these troubles than be back at chestertonwithout you  i wish you were back there i wish you had never seen me  if you say that then i shall be crushed  for your sake my darling for your sakefor your sake how shall i comfort you when all those around you are saying that you are not my wife  by telling me that i am she said coming and kneeling at his feet and looking up into his face if you say so you may be sure that i shall believe no one who says the contrary  it was thus and only now that he began to know the real nature of the woman whom he had succeeded in making his own and of whom he found now that even her own friends would attempt to rob him i will bear it he said as he embraced her i will bear it if i can like a man  oh maam those men were saying horrid things her nurse said to her that night  yes very horrid things i know it all it is part of a wicked plot to rob mr caldigate of his money it is astonishing the wickedness that people will contrive it is very very sad i dont know how long it may be before mr caldigate can prove it all  but he can prove it all maam  of course he can the truth can always be proved at last i trust there will be no one about the place to doubt him if there were such a one i would not speak to himthough it were my own father though it were my own mother then she took the baby in her arms as though fearing that the nurse herself might not be loyal  i dont think there will be any as knows master will be wrong enough for that said the nurse understanding what was expected of her after that but not quite readily the baby was once more trusted to her  on the following morning caldigate rode into the town and as he put his horse up at the inn he felt that the very ostler had heard the story as he walked along the street it seemed to him that everyone he met knew all about it robert bolton would of course have heard it but nevertheless he walked boldly into the attorneys office his fault at the time was in being too bold in manner in carrying himself somewhat too erect in assuming too much confidence in his eye and mouth to act a part perfectly requires a consummate actor and there are phases in life in which acting is absolutely demanded a man cannot always be at his ease but he should never seem to be discomfited for petty troubles the amount of acting necessary is so common that habit has made it almost natural but when great sorrows come it is hard not to show themand harder still not to seem to hide them  when he entered the private room he found that the old man was there with his son he shook hands of course with both of them and then he stood a moment silent to hear how they would address him but as they also were silent he was compelled to speak i hope you got home all right sir yesterday and mrs bolton  the old man did not answer but he turned his face round to his son i hear that you had that man crinkett out at folking yesterday said robert  he was there certainly to my sorrow  and another with him  yes and another with him whom i had also known at nobble  and they were brought in to breakfast  yes  and they afterwards declared that you had married a wife out there in the colony  that also is true  they have been with my father this morning  i am very very sorry sir said caldigate turning to the old man that you should have been troubled in so disagreeable a business  now caldigate i will tell you what we propose it was still the attorney who was speaking for the old man had not as yet opened his mouth since his soninlaw had entered the room there can i think be no doubt that this woman intends to bring an accusation of bigamy against you  she is threatening to do it i think it very improbable that she will be fool enough to make the attempt  from what i have heard i feel sure that the attempt will be made depositions in fact will be made before the magistrates some day this week crinkett and the woman have been with the mayor this morning and have been told the way in which they should proceed caldigate when he heard this felt that he was trembling but he looked into the speakers face without allowing his eyes to turn to the right or left i am not going to say anything now about the case itself indeed as i know nothing i can say nothing you must provide yourself with a lawyer  you will not act for me  certainly not i must act for my sister now what i propose and what her father proposes is thisthat she shall return to her home at puritan grange while this question is being decided  certainly not said the husband  she must said the old man speaking for the first time  we shall compel it said the attorney  compel how will you compel it she is my wife  that has to be proved public opinion will compel it if nothing else you cannot make a prisoner of her  oh she shall go if she wishes it you shall have free access to her bring her mother bring your carriage she shall dispose of herself as she pleases god forbid that i should keep her though she be my wife against her will  i am sure she will do as her friends shall advise her when she hears the story said the attorney  she has heard the story she knows it all and i am sure that she will not stir a foot said the husband you know nothing about her this he said turning to his wifes halfbrother and then again he turned to the old man you sir no doubt are well aware that she can be firm to her purpose nothing but death could take her away from me if you were to carry her by force to chesterton she would return to folking on foot before the day was over she knows what it is to be a wife i am not a bit afraid of her leaving me this he was able to say with a high spirit and an assured voice  it is quite out of the question that she should stay with you while this is going on  of course she must come away said the banker not looking at the man whom he now hated as thoroughly as did his wife  consult your own friends and let her consult hers they will all tell you so ask mrs babington ask your own father  i shall ask no onebut her  think what her position will be all the world will at least doubt whether she be your wife or not  there is one person who will not doubtand that is herself  very good if it be so that will be a comfort to you no doubt but for her sake while other people doubt will it not be better that she should be with her father and mother look at it all round  i think it would be better that she should be with me replied caldigate  even though your former marriage with that other woman were proved  i will not presume that to be possible though a jury should so decide their decision would be wrong such an error could not effect us i will not think of such a thing  and you do not perceive that her troubles will be lighter in her fathers house than in yours  certainly not to be away from her own house would be such a trouble to her that she would not endure it unless restrained by force  if you press her she would go cannot you see that it would be better for her name  her name is my name he said clenching his fist in his violence and my name is hers she can have no good name distinct from meno name at all she is part and parcel of my very self and under no circumstances will i consent that she shall be torn away from me no word from any human being shall persuade me to itunless it should come from herself  we can make her said the old man  no doubt we could get an order from the court said the attorney thinking that anything might be fairly said in such an emergency as this but it will be better that she should come of her own accord or by his direction are you aware how probable it is that you may be in prison within a day or two  to this caldigate made no answer but turned round to leave the room he paused a moment at the doorway to think whether another word or two might not be said in behalf of his wife it seemed hard to him or hard rather upon her that all the widestretching solid support of her family should be taken away from her at such a crisis as the present he knew their enmity to himself he could understand both the old enmity and that which had now been newly engendered both the one and the other were natural he had succeeded in getting the girl away from her parents in opposition to both father and mother and now almost within the first year of his marriage she had been brought to this terrible misery by means of disreputable people with whom he had been closely connected was it not natural that robert bolton should turn against him if hester had been his sister and there had come such an interloper what would he have felt was it not his duty to be gentle and to give way if by any giving way he could lessen the evil which he had occasioned i am sorry to have to leave your presence like this he said turning back to mr bolton  why did you ever come into my presence  what has been done is done even if i would give her back i cannot for better or for worse she is mine we cannot make it otherwise now but understand this when you ask that she shall come back to you i do not refuse it on my own account though i should be miserable indeed were she to leave me i will not even ask her to stay but i know she will stay though i should try to drive her out she would not go goodbye sir the old man only shook his head goodbye robert  goodbye you had better get some lawyer as soon as you can if you know any one in london you should send for him if not mr seely here is as good a man as you can have he is no friend of mine but he is a careful attorney who understands his business then caldigate left the room with the intention of going at once to mr seely  but standing patiently at the door just within the doorway of the house he met a tall man in dark plain clothes whom he at once knew to be a policeman the man who was aware that caldigate was a county magistrate civilly touched his hat and then with a few whispered words expressed his opinion that our hero had better go with him to the mayors office had he a warrant yes he had a warrant but he thought that probably it might not be necessary for him to show it i will go with you of course said caldigate i suppose it is on the allegation of a man named crinkett  a lady sir i think said the policeman  one mrs smith  she called herselfcaldigate sir said the policeman then they went together without any further words to the mayors court and from thence before he heard the accusation made against him he sent both for his father and for mr seely  he was taken through to a private room and thither came at once the mayor and another magistrate of the town with whom he was acquainted this is a very sad business mr caldigate said the mayor  very sad indeed i suppose i know all about it two men were with me yesterday threatening to indict me for bigamy if i did not give them a considerable sum of money i can quite understand that they should have been here as i know the nature of the evidence they can use the policeman tells me the woman is here too  oh yesshe is here and has made her deposition indeed there are two men and another woman who all declare that they were present at her marriage then after some further conversation the accusers were brought into the room before him so that their depositions might be read to him the woman was closely veiled so that he could not see a feature of her face but he knew her figure well and he remembered the other woman who had been halfcompanion halfservant to euphemia smith when she had come up to the diggings and who had been with her both at ahalala and at nobble the womans name as he now brought to mind was anna young crinkett also and adamson followed them into the room each of whom had made a deposition on the matter is this the mr caldigate said the mayor whom you claim as your husband  he is my husband said the woman he and i were married at ahalala in new south wales it is false said caldigate  would you wish to see her face asked the mayor  no i know her voice well she is the woman in whose company i went out to the colony and whom i knew while i was there it is not necessary that i should see her what does she say  that i am your wife john caldigate  then the deposition was read to him which stated on the part of the woman that on a certain day she was married to him by the rev mr allan a wesleyan minister at ahalala that the marriage took place in a tent belonging as she believed to mr crinkett and that crinkett adamson and anna young were all present at the marriage then the three persons thus named had taken their oaths and made their depositions to the same effect and a document was produced purporting to be a copy of the marriage certificate as made out by mr allancopy which she the woman stated that she obtained at the time the register itself which consisted simply of an entry in a small book having been carried away by mr allan in his pocket crinkett when asked what had become of mr allan stated that he knew nothing but that he had left ahalala from that day to this none of them had heard of mr allan  then the mayor gave caldigate to understand that he must hold himself as committed to stand his trial for bigamy at the next assizes for the county     chapter xxx  the conclave at puritan grange    john caldigate was committed and liberated on bail this occurred in cambridge on the wednesday after the christening and before the saturday night following all the boltons were thoroughly convinced that this wretched man who had taken from them their daughter and their sister was a bigamist and that poor hester though a mother was not a wife the evidence against him already named was very strong but they had been put in possession of other and as they thought more damning evidence than any to which he had alluded in telling his version of the story to robert bolton the woman had produced and had shown to robert bolton the envelope of a letter addressed in john caldigates handwriting to mrs caldigate ahalala nobble which letter had been dated inside from sydney and which envelope bore the sydney postmark caldigates handwriting was peculiar and the attorney declared that he could himself swear to it the letter itself she also produced but it told less than the envelope it began as such a letter might begin dearest feemy and ended yours ever and always jc as she herself had pointed out a man such as caldigate does not usually call his wife by that most cherished name in writing to her the letter itself referred almost altogether to money matters though perhaps hardly to such as a man generally discusses with his wife certain phrases seemed to imply a distinct action she had better sell these shares or those if she could for a certain priceand suchlike but she explained that they both when they married had been possessed of mining shares represented by scrip which passed from hand to hand readily and that each still retained his or her own property but among the various small documents which she had treasured up for use should they be needed for some possible occasion such as this was a note which had not indeed been posted but which purported to have been written by the minister allan to caldigate himself offering to perform the marriage at ahalala but advising him to have the ceremony performed at some more settled place where an established church community with a permanent church or chapel admitted the proper custody of registers nothing could be more sensible or written in a better spirit than this letter though the language was not that of an educated man this letter caldigate had she said showed to her and she had retained it then she brought forward two handkerchiefs which she herself had marked with her new name euphemia caldigate and the date of the year this had been done she declared immediately after her marriage and the handkerchiefs seemed by their appearance to justify the assertion caldigate had admitted a promise admitted that he had lived with the woman admitted that she had passed by his name admitted that there had been a conversation with the clergyman in regard to his marriage and now there were three others besides the woman herself who were ready to swearwho had swornthat they had witnessed the ceremony  a clerk had been sent out early in november by robert and william bolton to make inquiry in the colony and he could not well return before the end of march and if the accused man should ask for delay it would hardly be possible to refuse the request as it might be necessary for his defence that he too should get evidence from the colony the next assizes would be in april and it would hardly be possible that the trial should take place so soon and if not there would be a delay of three or four months more even that might hardly suffice should a plea be made on caldigates behalf that prolonged inquiry was indispensable a thousand allegations might be made as to the characters of these witnessescharacters which doubtless were open to criticism as to the probability of forgery as to the necessity of producing allan the clergyman as to mrs smiths former positionwhether or no she was in truth a widow when she was living at ahalala richard shand had been at ahalala and must have known the truth caldigate might well declare that richard shands presence was essential to his defence there would and must be delay  but what in the meantime would be the condition of hesterhester bolton as they feared that they would be bound in duty to call herof hester and her infant the thing was so full of real tragedytrue human nature of them all was so strongly affected that for a time family jealousies and hatred had to give way to father and mother and to the brothers and to the brothers wife it was equally a catastrophe terrible limitless like an earthquake or the falling upon them of some ruined tower one thing was clear to them allthat she and her child must be taken away from folking her continued residence there would be a continuation of the horror the man was not her husband not one of them was inspired by a feeling of mercy to allege that in spite of all that they had heard he still might be her husband even mrs robert who had been most in favour of the caldigate marriage did not doubt for an instant the man had been a gambler at home on racecourses and then had become a gambler at the goldmines in the colony his life then by his own admission had been disreputable who does not know that vices which may be treated with tenderness almost with complaisance while they are kept in the background became monstrous prodigious aweinspiring when they are made public a gentleman shall casually let slip some profane word and even some friendly parson standing by will think but little of it but let the profane word through some unfortunate accident find its way into the newspapers and the gentleman will be held to have disgraced himself almost for ever had nothing been said of a marriage between caldigate and mrs smith little would have been thought by robert bolton little perhaps by robert boltons father little even by robert boltons wife of the unfortunate alliance which he had admitted but now everything was added to make a pile of wickedness as big as a mountain  from the conclave which was held on saturday at puritan grange to decide what should be done it was impossible to exclude mrs bolton she was the young mothers mother and how should she be excluded from the first moment in which something of the truth had reached her ears it had become impossible to silence her or to exclude her to her all those former faults would have been black as vice itself even though there had been no question of a former marriage outside active sins to which it may be presumed no temptation allured herself were abominable to her evil thoughts hardness of heart suspicions unforgivingness hatred being too impalpable for denunciation in the decalogue but lying nearer to the hearts of most men than murder theft adultery and perjury were not equally abhorrent to her she had therefore allowed herself to believe all evil of this man and from the very first had set him down in her heart as a hopeless sinner the others had opposed herbecause the man had money in the midst of her shipwreck in the midst of her misery through all her maternal agony there was a certain triumph to her in this she had been rightright from first to last right in everything her poor old husband was crushed by the feeling that they had among them allowed this miscreant to take their darling away from themthat he himself had assented but she had not assented she was not crushed before monday night all cambridge had heard something of the story and then it had been impossible to keep her in the dark and now when the conclave met of course she was one the old man was there and robert bolton and william the barrister who had come down from london to give his advice and both mr and mrs daniel mrs daniel of all the females of the family was the readiest to endure the severity of the stepmother and she was now giving what comfort she could by her attendance at the grange  of course she should come home said the barrister up to this moment no one had seen hester since the evil tidings had been made known but a messenger had been sent out to folking with a long letter from her mother in which the poor nameless one had been implored to come back with her baby to her old home till this matter had been settled the writer had endeavoured to avoid the saying of hard things against the sinner but her feelings had been made very clear your father and brothers and all of us think that you should come away from him while this is pending nay we do not hesitate to say that it is your bounden duty to leave him  i will never never leave my dearest dearest husband if they were to put my husband into gaol i would sit at the door till they had let him out that repeated over and over again had been the purport of her reply and that word husband she used in almost every line having only too clearly observed that her mother had not used it at all dearest mother she said ending her letter i love you as i have always done but when i became his wife i swore to love him best i did not know then how strong my love could be i have hardly known till now when he is troubled of what devotion i was capable i will not leave him for a momentunless i have to do so at his telling  such being her determination and so great her obstinacy it was quite clear that they could not by soft words or persuasive letters bring her to their way of thinking she would not submit to their authority but would claim that as a married woman she owed obedience only to her husband and it would certainly not be within their power to make her believe that she was not caldigates wife they believed it they felt that they knew the facts to them any continuation of the alliance between their poor girl and the false traitor was abominable they would have hung the man without a moments thought of mercy had it been possible there was nothing they would not have done to rescue their hester from his power but how was she to be rescued till the dilatory law should have claimed its victim cant she be made to come away by the police asked the mother  the barrister shook his head couldnt the magistrates give an order asked the father mr bolton had been a magistrate himselfwas one still indeed although for some years he had not sat upon the benchbut he had no very clear idea of a magistrates power the barrister again shook his head you seemed to think that something of the kind could be done he said turning to robert when he wanted advice he would always turn to robert especially in the presence of the barrister intending to show that he thought the lower branch of the profession to be at any rate more accurate than the higher  i said something about an order from the vicechancellor but i fear we should not succeed in getting it the barrister again shook his head  do you mean to say that nothing can be done exclaimed mrs bolton rising up from her seat that no steps can be taken  if she were once here perhaps you couldprevent her return whispered the barrister  persuade her not to go back suggested mrs daniel  wellthat might come after a time but i think you would have the feeling of the community with you if you succeededwell not violence you understand  no not violence said the father  i could be violent with him said mrs bolton  just do not let her leave the house continued the barrister of course it would be disagreeable  i should not mind that said mrs bolton in doing my duty i could bear anything to separate her from him i could undergo any trouble  but he would have the power to fetch her asked the father doubtfully  no doubtby law he would have such power but the magistrates would be very loath to assist him the feeling of the community as i said would be in your favour she would be cowed and when once she was away from him he would probably feel averse to increase our enmity by taking strong measures for her recovery mrs bolton seemed to declare by her face that it would be quite impossible for him to increase her enmity  but we cant lock her up said the old man  practically you can take her bonnet awayor whatever she came in dont let there be a vehicle to carry her back let the keys be turned if it be necessary the servants must know of course what you are doing but they will probably be on your side i dont mean to say that if she be resolute to escape at any cost you can prevent her but probably she will not be resolute like that it requires a deal of resolution for a young woman to show herself in the streets alone in so wretched a plight as hers it depends on her disposition  she is very determined said hesters mother  and you can be equally so to this assertion mrs bolton assented with a little nod you can only try it it is one of those cases in which unfortunately publicity cannot be avoided we have to do the best we can for her poor dear according to our conscience i should induce her to come on a visit to her mother and then i should if possible detain her  it was thus that william bolton gave his advice and as robert bolton assented it was determined that this should be the line of action nor can it be said that they were either cruel or unloving in their projected scheme believing as they did that the man was not her husband it must be admitted that it was their duty to take her away from him if possible but it was not probable that hester herself would look upon their care of her in the same light she would beat herself against the bars of her cage and even should she be prevented from escaping by the motives and reasons which william bolton had suggested she would not the less regard her father and mother as wicked tyrants the mother understood that very well and she though she was hard to all the world besides had never been hard to her girl no tenderest female bosom that ever panted at injustice done to her offspring was more full than hers of pity love and desire to save her hester from sin and suffering she would willingly lay down her life and she knew that in carrying out the scheme that had been proposed she must appear to her girl to be an enemyto be the bitterest of all enemies i have seen a mother force open the convulsively closed jaws of her child in order that some agonising torture might be appliedwhich though agonising would tend to save her sick infants life she did it though the child shrank from her as from some torturing fiend this mother resolved that she would do the samethough her child too should learn to hate her  william bolton undertook to go out to folking and give the invitation by which she was to be allured to come to puritan grangeonly for a day and night if longer absence was objectionable only for a morning visit if no more could be achieved it was all treachery and falsehooda doing of certain evil that possible good might come from it she will hate me for ever but yet it ought to be done said william bolton who was a good man an excellent husband and father and regarded in his own profession as an honourable trustworthy man  she will never stay the old man said to his wife when the others had gone and they two were left together  i dont know  i am sure she will never stay  i will try  mrs robert said the same thing when the scheme was explained to her do you think anybody could keep me a prisoner against my willunless they locked me up in a cell do you think i would not scream  the husband endeavoured to explain that the screaming might depend on the causes which had produced the coercion i think you would scream and scream till you were let loose if the person locking you up had nothing to justify him but if you felt that the world would be all against you then you would not scream and would not be let out  mrs robert however seemed to think that no one could keep her in any house against her own will without positive bolts bars and chains  in the meantime much had been settled out at folking or had been settled at cambridge so that the details were known at folking mr seely had taken up the case and had of course gone into it with much more minuteness than robert bolton had done caldigate owned to the writing of the envelope and to the writing of the letter but declared that that letter had not been sent in that envelope he had written the envelope in some foolish joke while at ahalalahe remembered doing it well but he was quite sure that it had never passed through the sydney postoffice the letter itself had been written from sydney he remembered writing that also and he remembered posting it at sydney in an envelope addressed to mrs smith when mr seely assured him that he himself had seen the postoffice stamp of sydney on the cover caldigate declared that it must have been passed through the postoffice for fraudulent purposes after it had left his hands then said mr seely the fraud must have been meditated and prepared three years agowhich is hardly probable  as to the letter from the clergyman allan of which mr seely had procured a copy caldigate declared that it had certainly never been addressed to him he had never received any letter from mr allanhad never seen the mans handwriting he was quite sure that if he were in new south wales he could get a dozen people to swear that there had never been such a marriage at ahalala he did name many people especially dick shand then mr seely proposed to send out an agent to the colony who should take the depositions of such witnesses as he could find and who should if possible bring dick shand back with him and at whatever cost search should be made for mr allan and mr allan should if found be brought to england if money could bring him if mr allan could not be found some document written by him might perhaps be obtained with reference to his handwriting but through it all mr seely did believe that there had been some marriage ceremony between his client and mrs euphemia smith  all this down to the smallest detail was told to hesterhester bolton or hester caldigate whichever she might be and there was no word uttered by the man she claimed as her husband which she did not believe as though it were gospel     chapter xxxi  hester is lured back    on the monday morning mr william bolton the barrister who had much to his own inconvenience remained at cambridge for the purpose of carrying out the scheme which he had proposed went over to folking in a fly he had never been at the place before and was personally less well acquainted with the family into which his sister had married than any other bolton had everything been pleasant nothing could have been more natural than such a visit but as things were very far from pleasant hester was much surprised when he was shown into her room it had been known to robert bolton that caldigate now came every day into cambridge to see either his lawyer or his father and that therefore he would certainly not be found at home about the middle of the day it was henceforth to be a law with all the boltons at any rate till after the trial that they would not speak to or if possible see john caldigate not without very strong cause would william bolton have entered his house but that strong cause existed  oh william i am so glad to see you said hester rushing into her brothers arms  i too am glad to see you hester though the time is so sad to us all  yes yes it is sadoh so sad is it not terrible that there should be people so wicked and that they should be able to cause so much trouble to innocent persons  with all my heart i feel for you said the brother caressing his young sister  with quickest instinct she immediately perceived that a slight emphasis given to the word you implied the singular number she drew herself back a little still feeling however that no offence had as yet been committed against which she could express her indignation but it was necessary that a protest should be made at once i am so sorry that my husband is not here to welcome you he has gone into cambridge to fetch his father poor mr caldigate is so troubled by all this that he prefers now to come and stay with us  ah indeed i dare say it will be better that the father and the son should be together  father and son or even mother and daughter are not like husbands and wives are they  no they are not said the barrister not quite knowing how to answer so very selfevident a proposition but understanding accurately the line of thought which had rendered it necessary for the poor creature to reassert at every moment the bond by which she would fain be bound to the father of her child  but mr caldigate is so goodso good and gentle to me and baby that i am delighted that he should be here with john you know of all this  yes i know of course  and will feel all that john has to suffer  it is very bad very bad for everybody concerned by his own showing his conduct  william said she let this be settled in one word i will not hear a syllable against my husband from you or any one else i am delighted to see youi cannot tell you how delighted oh if papa would comeor mamma dear dear mamma you dont suppose but what i love you all  i am sure you do  but not from papa or mamma even will i hear a word against him would fannyfanny was the barristers wifelet her people come and say things behind your back  i hope not  then believe that i can be as stout as fanny but we need not quarrel you will come and see baby and have some lunch i am afraid they will not be here till three or four but they will be so glad to see you if you will wait  he would not wait of course but he allowed himself to be taken away to see baby and did eat his lunch then he brought forward the purport of his mission your mother is most anxious to see you hester you will go and visit her  oh yes said hester unaware of any danger but i wish she would come to me  my dear girl as things are at present that is impossible you can understand as much as that there must be a trial  i suppose so  and till that has been held your mother would be wrong to come here i express no judgment against any one  i should have thought mamma would have been the first to support meme and baby she said sobbing  certainly if you were homeless  but i am not my husband gives me a house to live in and i want none other  what i wish to explain is that if you were in want of anything  i am in want of nothingbut sympathy  you have it from me and from all of us but pray listen for a moment she cannot come to you till the trial be over i am sure mr caldigate would understand that  he comes to me she said alluding to her fatherinlaw and not choosing to understand that her brother should have called her husband mr caldigate  but there can be no reason why you should not go to chesterton  just to see mamma  for a day or two he replied blushing inwardly at his own lie could you go tomorrow  oh nonot to stay of course i must ask my husband im sure hell let me go if i ask it but not tomorrow why tomorrow  only that your mother longs to see you he had been specially instigated to induce her to come as soon as possible you may imagine how anxious she is  poor mamma yesi know she suffers i know mammas feelings mamma and i must must must quarrel if we talk about this of course i will go to see her but will you tell her thisthat if she cannot speak of my husband with affection and respect it will be better thatshe should not mention him at all i will not submit to a word even from her  when he took his departure it was settled that she should with her husbands permission go over to chesterton for a couple of nights in the course of the next week but that she could not fix the day till she had seen him then when he was taking his departure and kissing her once again she whispered a word to him try and be charitable william i sometimes think that at chesterton we hardly knew what charity meant  that evening the proposed visit to chesterton was discussed at folking the old man had very strongly taken up his sons side and was of opinion that the boltons were not only uncharitable but perversely illconditioned in the view which they took to his thinking crinkett adamson and the woman were greedy fraudulent scoundrels who had brought forward this charge solely with the view of extorting money he declared that the very fact that they had begun by asking for money should have barred their evidence before any magistrates the oaths of the four scoundrels were according to him worth nothing the scrap of paper purporting to be a copy of the marriage certificate and the clergymans pretended letter were mere forgeries having about them no evidence or probability of truth any one could have written them as to that envelope addressed to mrs caldigate with the sydney postmark he had his own theory he thought but little of the intercourse which his son acknowledged with the woman but was of opinion that his son had been an ass in writing those words but a man does not marry a woman by simply writing his own name with the word mistress prefixed to it on an envelope any other woman might have adduced the envelope as evidence of his marriage with her it was he said monstrous that any one should give credence to such bundles of lies therefore his words were gospel and his wishes were laws to hester she clung round him and hovered over him and patted him like a very daughter insisting that he should nurse the baby and talking of him to her husband as though he were manifestly the wisest man in cambridgeshire she forgot even that little flaw in his religious belief to her thinking at the present moment a man who would believe that her baby was the honest son of an honest father and mother had almost religion enough for all purposes  quite right that you should go said the old man  i think so said the husband though i am afraid they will trouble her  the only question is whether they will let her come back  what exclaimed hester  whether they wont keep you when theyve got you  i wont be kept i will come back you dont suppose id let them talk me over  no my dear i dont think theyll be able to do that but there are such things as bolts and bars  impossible said his son  do you mean that theyll send me to prison asked hester  no they cant do that they wouldnt take you in at the county jail but they might make a prison of puritan grange i dont say they will but they might try it  i should get out of course  i daresay you would but there might be trouble  papa would not allow that said hester papa understands better than that ive a right to go where i like just as anybody elsethat is if john tells me the matter was discussed at some length but john caldigate was of opinion that no such attempt as the old man had suggested was probableor even possible the idea that in these days any one should be kept a prisoner in a private houseany one over whom no one in that house possessed legitimate authorityseemed to him to be monstrous that a husband should lock up his wife might be possible or a father his unmarried and dependent daughter but that any one should venture to lock up another mans wife was he declared out of the question mr caldigate again said that he should not be surprised if it were attempted but acknowledged that the attempt could hardly be successful  as hester was anxious to make the visit it was arranged that she should go it was not that she expected much pleasure even in seeing her motherbut that it was expedient at such a time to maintain what fellowship might still be possible with her own family the trial would of course liberate them from all their trouble and then when the trial should be over it would be very sad if an entire rupture between herself and her parents should have been created she would be true to her husband as true as a part must be to the whole as the heart must to the brain they two were and ever would be one but if her mother could be spared to her if she could be saved from a lasting quarrel with her mother it would be so much to her tears came into the eyes even of the old man as he assented and her husband swore to her that for her sake he would forgive every injury from any one bearing the name of bolton when all this should be over  a day was therefore fixed and a note was written and on the last day of february she and her baby and her nurse were taken over to puritan grange in the meantime telegrams at a very great cost had been flying backwards and forwards between cambridge and sydney william and robert bolton had determined among them that at whatever expense to the family the truth must be ascertained and to this the old banker had assented so far they were right no doubt if the daughter and sister was not in truth a wifeif by grossest by most cruel illusage she had been lured to a ruin for which there could be no remedy in this worldit would be better that the fact should be known at once so that her life might be pure though it could never again be bright but it was strange that with all these boltons there was a desire an anxiety to prove the mans guilt rather than his innocence mrs bolton had always regarded him as a guilty manthough guilty of she knew not what she had always predicted misery from a marriage so distasteful to her and her husband though he had been brought to oppose her and to sanction the marriage had from the moment in which the sanction was given been induced by her influence to reject it robert bolton when the charge was first made when the letter from the woman was first shown to him had become aware that he had made a mistake in allowing this trouble to come upon the family and then as from point to point the evidence had been opened out to him he had gradually convinced himself that the soninlaw and brotherinlaw whom he had as it were forced into the family was a bigamist there was present to them all an intense desire to prove the mans guilt which was startling to all around who heard anything of the matter up to this time the bolton telegrams and the caldigate telegrams had elicited two factsthat allan the wesleyan minister had gone to the fiji islands and had there died and that they at nobble who had last known dick shands address now knew it no longer caldigate had himself gone to pollington and had there ascertained that no tidings had been received from dick by any of the shand family for the last twelve months it had been decided that the trial must be postponed at any rate till the summer assizes which would be held in cambridge about the last week in august and it was thought by some that even then the case would not be ready there was no doubt an opinion prevalent in cambridge that the unfortunate young mother should be taken home to her own family till the matter should be decided and among the ladies of the town john caldigate himself was blamed severely for not allowing her to place herself under her fathers protection but the ladies of the town generally were not probably well acquainted with the disposition and temper of the young wife herself  things were in this condition when hester and her baby went to her fathers house though that suspicion as to some intended durance which mr caldigate had expressed was not credited by her still as she was driven up to the house the idea was in her mind she looked at the door and she looked at the window and she could not conceive it possible that such a thing should be attempted she thought of her own knowledge of the house how if it were necessary she could escape from the back of the garden into the little field running down to the river and how she could cross the ferry of course she knew every outlet and inlet about the place and was sure that confinement would be impossible but she did not think of her bonnet nor of her boots nor of the horror which it would be to her should she be driven to wander forth into the town and to seek a conveyance back to folking in the public streets  she went on a monday with an understanding that she was to remain there till wednesday mrs bolton almost wished that a shorter visit had been arranged in order that she might at once commence her hostile operations without any intermediate and hypocritical pretences she had planned her campaign thoroughly in her own mind and had taken the cook into her confidence the cook being the oldest and most religious servant in the house when the day of departure should have come the cook was to lock the doors and the gardener was to close the little gate at the bottom of the garden and the bonnet and other things were to be removed and then the mother would declare her purpose but in the meantime allusions to that intended return to folking must be accepted and listened to with false assent it was very grievous but so it was arranged as soon as hester was in the house the mother felt how much better it would have been to declare to her daughter at once that she was a prisonerbut it was then too late to alter their proposed plans  it very nearly came to pass that hester left her mother on the morning of her arrival they had both determined to be cautious reticent and forbearing but the difference between them was so vital that reticence was impossible at first there was a profusion of natural tears and a profusion of embraces each clung to the other for a while as though some feeling might be satisfied by mere contact and then the woe of the thing the woe of it was acknowledged on both sides they could agree that the wickedness of the wicked was very wicked wherever might lie the sin of fraud and falsehood the unmerited misfortunes of poor hester were palpable enough they could weep together over the wrongs inflicted on that darling baby but by degrees it was impossible to abstain from alluding to the cause of their sorrowand such allusion became absolutely necessary when an attempt was made to persuade hester to remain at her old home with her own consent this was done by her father on the evening of her arrival in compliance with the plan that had been arranged no papa no i cannot do that she said with a tone of angry determination  it is your duty hester all your friends will tell you so  my duty is to my husband she said and in such a matter i can allow myself to listen to no other friend she was so firm and fixed in this that he did not even dare to go on with his expostulation  but afterwards when they were upstairs together mrs bolton spoke out more at length and with more energy mamma it is of no use said hester  it ought to be of use do you know the position in which you are  very well i am my husbands wife  if it be so well but if it be not so and if you remain with him while there is a doubt upon the matter then you are his mistress  if i am not his wife then i will be his mistress said hester standing up and looking as she spoke much as her mother would look in her most determined moments  my child  what is the use of all this mamma nothing shall make me leave him others may be ashamed of me but because of this i shall never be ashamed of myself you are ashamed of me  if you could mean what you said just now i should be ashamed of you  i do mean it though the juries and the judges should say that he was not my husband though all the judges in england should say it i would not believe them they may put him in prison and so divide us but they never shall divide my bone from his bone and my flesh from his flesh as you are ashamed of me i had better go back tomorrow  then mrs bolton determined that early in the morning she would look to the bolts and bars but when the morning came matters had softened themselves a little     chapter xxxii  the babington wedding    it is your dutyespecially your dutyto separate them this was said by mr smirkie the vicar of plumcumpippin to mr bromley the rector of utterden and the words were spoken in the park at babington where the two clergymen were taking a walk together mr smirkies first wife had been a miss bromley a sister of the clergyman at utterden and as julia babington was anxious to take to her bosom all her future husbands past belongings mr bromley had been invited to babington it might be that aunt polly was at this time well inclined to exercise her hospitality in this direction by a feeling that mr bromley would be able to talk to them about this terrible affair mr bromley was intimate with john caldigate and of course would know all about it there was naturally in aunt pollys heart a certain amount of selfcongratulation at the way in which things were going mr smirkie no doubt had had a former wife but no one would call him a bigamist in what a condition might her poor julia have been but for that interposition of providence for aunt polly regarded poor hester bolton as having been quite a providential incident furnished expressly for the salvation of julia hitherto mr bromley had been very short in his expressions respecting the folking tragedy having simply declared that judging by character he could not conceive that a man such as caldigate would have been guilty of such a crime but now he was being put through his facings more closely by his brotherinlaw  why should i want to separate them  because the evidence of his guilt is so strong  that is for a jury to judge  yes and if a jury should decide that there had been no australian marriagewhich i fear we can hardly hopebut if a jury were to decide that then of course she could go back to him but while there is a doubt i should have thought tom you certainly would have seen it even though you never have had a wife of your own  i think i see all that there is to see said the other if the poor lady has been deceived and betrayed no punishment can be too heavy for the man who has so injured her but the very enormity of the iniquity makes me doubt it as far as i can judge caldigate is a highspirited honest gentleman to whom the perpetration of so great a sin would hardly suggest itself  but ifbut if think of her condition tom  you would have to think of your own if you were to attempt to tell her to leave him  that means that you are afraid of her  it certainly means that i should be very much afraid if i thought of taking such a liberty if i believed it to be my duty i hope that i would do it  you are her clergyman  certainly i christened her child i preach to her twice every sunday and if she were to die i should bury her  is that all  pretty nearlyexcept that i generally dine at the house once a week  is there nothing further confided to you than that  if she were to come to me for advice then it would be my duty to give her what advice i thought to be best and then  well then  then i should have to make up my mindwhich i have not done at presenti should have to make up my mind not as to his guilt for i believe him to be innocent but as to the expediency of a separation till a jury should have acquitted him but i am well aware that she wont come to me and from little words which constantly drop from her i am quite sure that nothing would induce her to leave her husband but a direct command from himself  you might do it through him  i am equally sure that nothing would induce him to send her away  but such a conviction as this was not sufficient for mr smirkie he was alive to the factuncomfortably alive to the factthat the ordinary life of gentlefolk in england does not admit of direct clerical interference as a country clergyman he could bestow his admonitions upon his poorer neighbours but upon those who were welltodo he could not intrude himself unasked unless as he thought in cases of great emergency here was a case of very great emergency he was sure that he would have courage for the occasion if folking were within the bounds of plumcumpippin it was just the case in which counsel should be volunteeredin which so much could be said which would be gross impertinence from others though it might be so manifest a duty to a clergyman but mr bromley could not be aroused to a sense either of his duty or of his privileges all this was sad to mr smirkie who regretted those past days in which as he believed the delinquent soul had been as manifestly subject to ecclesiastical interference as the delinquent body has always been to the civil law  but with julia who was to be his wife he could be more imperative she was taught to give thanks before the throne of grace because she had been spared the ignominy of being married to a man who could not have made her his wife and had had an unstained clergyman of the church of england given to her for her protection for with that candour which is so delightful and so common in these days everything had been told to mr smirkiehow her young heart had for a time turned itself towards her cousin how she had been deceived and then how rejoiced she was that by such deceit she had been reserved for her present more glorious fate and wont mr bromley speak to her julia asked  it is a very difficult questiona very difficult question indeed said mr smirkie shaking his head he was quite sure that were folking in his parish he would perform the duty though mr caldigate and the unfortunate lady might be as a lion and a lioness in opposition to him but he was also of opinion that sacerdotal differences of opinion should not be discussed among laymenshould not be discussed by a clergyman even with the wife of his bosom  at babington opinion was somewhat divided aunt polly and julia were of course certain that john caldigate had married the woman in australia but the two other girls and their father were not at all so sure indeed there had been a little misunderstanding among the babingtons on the subject which was perhaps strengthened by the fact that mr smirkie had more endeared himself to julias mother than to julias father or sisters and that mr smirkie himself was very clear as to the criminality of the bigamist i suppose you are often there mr babington said to his guest the parson of utterden  yes i have seen a good deal of them  do you think it possible  not probable said the clergyman  i dont said the squire i suppose he was a little wild out there but that is a very different thing from bigamy young men when they get out to those places are not quite so particular as they ought to be i daresay when i was young perhaps i was not as steady as i ought to have been but by george here is a man comes over and asks for a lot of money and then the woman asks for money and then they say that if they dont get it theyll swear the fellow was married in australia i cant fancy that any jury will believe that  i hope not  and yet madamethe squire was in the habit of calling his wife madame when he intended to insinuate anything against herhas got it settled in her head that this young woman isnt his wife at all i think its uncommon hard a man ought to be considered innocent till he has been found guilty i shall go over and see him one of these days and say a kind word to her  there was at that moment some little difference of opinion which was coming to a head in reference to a very delicate matter when the conversations above related took place the babington wedding had been fixed to take place in a weeks time should cousin john be invited or should he not julia was decidedly against it she did not think she said that she could stand up at the altar and conduct herself on an occasion so trying if she were aware that he were standing by her mr smirkie of course was not askedwas not directly asked but equally of course he was able to convey his own opinion through his future bride aunt polly thought that the county would be shocked if a man charged with bigamy was allowed to be present at the marriage but the squire was a man who could have an opinion of his own and after having elicited that of mr bromley insisted that the invitation should be sent  it will be a pollution said julia sternly to her younger sisters  you will be a married woman almost before you have seen him said georgiana the second and so it wont matter so much to you we must get over it as we can  julia had been thought by her sisters not to bear the smirkie triumph with sufficient humility and they therefore were sometimes a little harsh to her i dont think you understand it at all said julia you have no conception what should be the feelings of a married woman especially when she is going to become the wife of one of gods ministers  but in spite of all this aunt polly wrote to her nephew as follows       dear johnour dearest julia is to be married on tuesday next you     know how anxious we all have been to maintain affectionate family     relations with you and we therefore do not like the idea of our     sweet child passing from her present sphere to other duties without     your presence will you come over on monday evening and stay till     after the breakfast it is astonishing how many of our friends from     the two counties have expressed their wish to grace the ceremony by     their company i doubt whether there is a clergyman in the diocese     of ely more respected and thought of by all the upper classes than     augustus smirkie      i do not ask mrs caldigate because under present circumstances     she would not perhaps wish to go into company and because augustus     has never yet had an opportunity of making her acquaintance i will     only say that it is the anxious wish of us all here that you and she     together may soon see the end of these terrible troublesbelieve     me to be your affectionate aunt      maryanne babington   the writing of this letter had not been effected without much difficulty the squire himself was not good at the writing of letters and though he did insist on seeing this epistle so that he might be satisfied that caldigate had been asked in good faith he did not know how to propose alterations thats all my eye he said referring to his soninlaw that was to be hes as good as another but i dont know that hes any better  that my dear said aunt polly is because you do not interest yourself about such matters if you had heard what the archdeacon said of him the other day you would think differently  hes another parson said the squire of course they butter each other up then he went on to the other paragraph i wouldnt have said anything about his wife  that would not have been civil said aunt polly and as you insist on my asking him i do not wish to be rude and so the letter was sent as it was written  it reached caldigate on the day which hester was passing with her mother at chestertonon the tuesday she had left folking on the monday intending to return on the wednesday caldigate was therefore alone with his father they might as well have left that undone said he throwing the letter over the table  its about the silliest letter i ever read said the old squire but it is intended for civility she means to show that she does not condemn you there are many people who do not know when to speak and when to be silent i shouldnt go  no i shant go  but i should take it as meant in kindness  then john caldigate wrote back as followsall this that has befallen my wife and me prevents us from going anywhere she is at the present moment with her own people at chesterton but when she returns i shall not leave her give my kindest love to julia and ask her from me to accept the little present which i send her  julia declared that she would much rather not have accepted the brooch and that she would never wear it but animosity against such articles wears itself out quickly and it may be expected that the little ornament will be seen in the houses of the suffolk gentry among whom mr smirkie is so popular  whether it was mr smirkies popularity or the general estimation in which the babington family were held or the delight which is taken by the world at large in weddings there was a very great gathering at babington church and in the squires house afterwards though it was early in marcha time of the year which in the eastern counties of england is not altogether propitious to outofdoors festivitythough the roads were muddy and the park sloppy and the church abominably open to draughts still there was a crowd the young ladies in that part of the world had been slow in marrying lately and it was felt that the present occasion might give a little fillip to the neighbourhood this was the second suffolk young lady that mr smirkie had married and he was therefore entitled to popularity he certainly had done as much as he could and there was probably no one around who had done more  i think the dear child will be happy said mrs babington to her old friend mrs mundaythe wife of archdeacon munday the clerical dignitary who had given mr smirkie so good a character  of course she will said mrs munday who had already given three daughters in marriage to three clergymen and who had as it were become used to the transfer  and that she will do her duty in it  why not theres nothing difficult in it if she only sees that he has his surplice and bands properly got up he is not on the whole a badtempered man and though the children are rough theyll grow out of that and she ought to make him take two or perhaps three glasses of port wine on sundays mr smirkie is not as young as he used to be and two whole duties with the sunday school which must be looked into do take a good deal out of a man the archdeacon of course has a curate but i suppose mr smirkie could hardly manage that just at present  the views which had hitherto been taken at babington of the brides future life had been somewhat loftier than this the bands and the surplice and the port wine seemed to be small after all that had been said the mother felt that she was in some degree rebukednot having yet learned that nothing will so much lessen the enthusiasm one may feel for the work of a barrister or a member of parliament or a clergyman as a little domestic conversation with the wife of the one or the other but mrs munday was a lady possessing much clerical authority and that which she said had to be endured with equanimity  mr smirkie seemed to enjoy the occasion and held his own through the day with much dignity the archdeacon and the clergyman of the parish and mr bromley all assisted and nothing was wanting of outward ceremony which a small country church could supply when his health was drunk at the breakfast he preached quite a little sermon as he returned thanks holding his brides hands in his the while performing his part in the scene in a manner which no one else would have dared to attempt  then there was the parting between the mother and daughter upstairs before she was taken away for her ten days weddingtour to brighton my darlingit is not so far but that i can come and see you very often  pray do mamma  and i think i can help you with the children  i am not a bit afraid of them mamma i intend to have my way with them and that will be everything i dont mean to be weak of course augustus will do what he thinks best in the parish but he quite understands that i am to be mistress at home as for mrs munday mamma i dont suppose that she knows everything i believe i can manage quite as well as mrs munday  then there was a parting joint congratulation that she had not yielded to the allurements of her cousin john caldigate oh no mamma that would never have done  think where you might have been now  i am sure i should have found out his character in time and have broken from him let it have cost what it might a man that can do such things as that is to me quite horrible what is to become of her and her babyand perhaps two she added in a whisper holding up her hands and shaking her head the ceremony through which she had just passed had given her courage to hint at such a possibility i suppose shell have to be called miss bolton again of course there was some wellfounded triumph in the bosom of the undoubted mrs augustus smirkie as she remembered what her own fate might have been then she was carried away in the family carriage amidst a deluge of rice and a shower of old shoes  that same night mr bromley gave an account of the wedding to john caldigate at folking telling him how well all the personages had performed their parts poor julia she at any rate will be safe  safe enough i should think said the clergyman  what i mean is that she has no dangers to fear such as my poor wife has encountered whomever i think of now i cannot but compare them to ourselves no woman surely was ever so illused as she and no man ever so unfortunate as myself  it will be all over in august  and where shall i be my own lawyer tells me that it is too probable that i shall be in prison and where will she be then     chapter xxxiii  persuasion    early on the tuesday morning hester came down into the breakfast parlour at puritan grange having with difficulty persuaded herself that she would stay the appointed hours in her mothers house on the previous evening her mother had she thought been very hard on her and she had determined to go she would not stay even with her mother if her mother insisted upon telling her that she was not her husbands wife but during the night she was able to persuade herself to bear what had been already saidto let it be as though it had been forgotten her mother was her mother but she would bear no more as to herself and her own conduct her parents might say what they pleased to her but of her husband she would endure to hear no evil word spoken in this spirit she came down into the little parlour  mrs bolton was also uphad been up and about for some time previous she was a woman who never gave way to temptations of ease a nasty dark morning at six oclock with just light enough to enable her to dress without a candle with no fire and no hot water with her husband snoring while she went through her operations was to her thinking the proper condition of things for this world not to be cold not to be uncomfortable not to strike her toes against the furniture because she could not quite see what she was about would to her have been to be wicked when her daughter came into the parlour she had been about the house for more than an hour and had had a conference both with the cook and with the gardener the cook was of opinion that not a word should be said or an unusual bolt drawn or a thing removed till the wednesday she cant carry down her big box herself maam and the likes of miss hester would never think of going without her thingsand then theres the baby a look of agony came across the mothers face as she heard her daughter called miss hesterbut in truth the woman had used the name from old association and not with any reference to her late young mistresss present position i should just tell her flat on wednesday morning that she wasnt to stir out of this but i wouldnt say nothing at all about any of it till then the gardener winked and nodded his head and promised to put a stake into the ground behind the little wicketgate which would make the opening of it impossible but take my word for it maam shell never try that shell be a deal too proud shell rampage at the front door and ll despise any escaping like that was the gardeners idea and the gardener had long known the young lady by these arguments mrs bolton was induced to postpone her prison arrangements till the morrow  when she found her daughter in the small parlour she had settled much in her mind during the early morningthat is till mr bolton should have gone into cambridgenot a word should be said about the marriage then when they two would be alone together another attempt should be made to persuade hester to come and live at chesterton till after the trial but even in making that attempt no opinion should be expressed as to john caldigates wickedness and no hint should be given as to the coming incarceration did you bring baby down with you the grandmother asked no baby had been awake ever so long and then had gone to sleep again and the nurse was now with him to protect him from the sufferings incident to waking your papa will be down soon and then we will have breakfast said mrs bolton after that there was silence between them for some time  a bond of discord if the phrase may be allowed is often quite as strong as any bond coming from concord and agreement there was to both these women a subject of such paramount importance to each that none other could furnish matter of natural conversation the one was saying to herself ever and always he is my husband let the outside world say what it may he is my husband but the other was as constantly denying to herself this assertion and saying he is not her husband certainly he is not her husband and as to the one the possession of that which she claimed was all the world and as to the other the idea of the possession without true possession entailed upon her child pollution crime and ignominy it was impossible but that the mind of each should be too full to admit of aught but forced expressions on other matters it was in vain for them to attempt to talk of the garden the house the church or of the old mans health it was in vain even to attempt to talk of the baby there are people who however full their hearts may be full of anger or full of joy can keep the fulness in abeyance till a chosen time for exhibiting it shall come but neither of these two was such a person every stiff plait in the elder womans muslin and crape declared her conviction that john caldigate was not legally married to her daughter every glance of hesters eye every motion made with her hands every little shake of her head declared her purpose of fighting for that one fact whatever might be the odds against her  when the banker came down to breakfast things were better for a little time the pouring out of his tea mitigated somewhat the starchiness of his wifes severity and hester when cutting the loaf for him could seem to take an interest in performing an old duty he said not a word against caldigate and when he went out hester as had been her custom accompanied him to the gate of course you will be here when i come he said  oh yes i do not go home till tomorrow then she parted from him and spent the next hour or two upstairs with her baby  may i come in said the mother knocking at the door  oh yes mamma dont you think baby is very like his father  i dare say i do not know that i am good at tracing likenesses he certainly is like you  so much more like his father said hester  after that there was a pause and then the mother commenced her task in her most serious voice hester my child you can understand that a duty may become so imperious that it must be performed  yes said hester pressing her lips close together i can understand that there might be a duty very necessary for her to perform though in the performance of it she should be driven to quarrel absolutely with her own mother  so it is with me whom do you think i love best in all the world  papa  i do love your father dearly and i endeavour by gods grace to do my duty by him though i fear it is done imperfectly but my child our hearts i think yearn more to those who are younger than ourselves than to our elders we love best those whom we have cherished and protected and whom we may perhaps still cherish and protect when i try to tear my heart away from the things of this vile world it clings to youto youto you  of course this could not be borne without an embrace oh mamma hester exclaimed throwing herself on her knees before her mothers lap  if you suffer must not i suffer if you rejoice would i not fain rejoice with you if i could did i not bring you into the world my only one and nursed you and prayed for you and watched you with all a mothers care as you grew up among the troubles of the world have you not known that my heart has been too soft towards you even for the due performance of my duties  you have always been good to me mamma  and am i altered now do you think that a mothers heart can be changed to her only child  no mamma  no hester that i think is impossible though for the last twelve months i have not seen you day by daythough i have not prepared the food which you eat and the clothes which you wear as i used to doyou have been as constantly in my mind you are still my child my only child  mamma i know you love me  i so love you as to know that i sin in so loving aught that is human and so loving you must i not do my duty by you when love and duty both compel me to speak how shall i be silent  you have said it mamma said hester slowly drawing herself up from off the ground  and is saying it once enough when as i think the very soul the immortal soul of her who is of all the dearest to me depends on what i may saymay be saved or oh perhaps lost for ever by the manner in which i may say it how am i not to speak when such thoughts as these are heavy within me  what is it you would say this hester asked with a low hoarse voice and a stern look as though she could not resist her mothers prayer for the privilege of speaking but at the same time was resolutely prepared not to be turned a hairsbreadth by anything that might be said  not a word about him  no mamma no unless you can tell me that you will love him as your soninlaw  not a word about him she repeated in a harsher voice she felt that that promise should have been enough and that in the present circumstances she should not have been invited to love the man she hated your father and i wish you for the next few months to come and live with us  it is quite impossible said hester standing very upright with a face altogether unlike that she had worn when kneeling at her mothers knees  you should listen to me  yes i will listen  there will be a trial  undoubtedly john at least seems to think so it is possible that these wicked people may give it up or that they may have no money to go on but i suppose there will be a trial  the woman has bound herself to prosecute him  because she wants to get money but we need not discuss that mamma john thinks that there will be a trial  till that is over will you not be better away from him how will it be with you if it should be decided that he is not your husband here hester of course prepared herself for interruption but her mother prayed for permission to continue  listen to me for one moment hester  very well mamma go on  how would it be with you in that case you must be separated then as that is possible is it not right that you should obey the ordinances of god and man and keep yourself apart till they who are in authority shall have spoken  there are no such ordinances  there are indeed if you were to ask all your friends all the married women in cambridgeshire what would they say would they not all tell you that no woman should live with a man while there is a shadow of doubt and as to the law of god you know gods law and can only defend yourself by your own certainty as to a matter respecting which all others are uncertain you think yourself certain because such certainty is a way to yourself out of your present misery  it is for my child she shouted and for him  as for your babe your darling babe whether he be yours in joy of heart or in agony of spirit he is still yours no one will rob you of him if it be as we fear would not i help you to love him help you to care for him help you to pray for him if it were so would i desert him or you because in your innocence you had been betrayed into misfortune do i not feel for your child but when he grows up and is a man and will have learned the facts of his early years let him be able to tell himself that his mother though unfortunate was pure  i am pure she said  my child my own one can i your mother think aught else of you do i not know your heart do not i know the very thoughts within you  i am pure he has become my husband and nothing can divide us i never gave a thought to another man i never had the faintest liking as do other girls when he came and told me that he had seen me and loved me and would take me for his wife i felt at once that i was all hishis to do as he liked with me his to nourish him his to worship him his to obey him his to love him let father or mother or all the world say what they would to the contrary then we were married till he was my own i never even pressed my lips upon his but i became his wife by a bond that nothing shall break you tell me of gods law by gods law i am his wife let the people say what they will i have but two to think of  yourself and him asked her mother  i have three to think ofgod and him and my child and may god be good to me and them as in this matter i will put myself away from myself altogether it is for me to obey him and i will submit myself to none other if he bids me go i will go if he bids me stay here i will stay i have become his so entirely that no judgesno judges can divide us judges i know but one judge and he is there and he has said that those whom he has joined together man shall not put asunder pure pure no one should praise herself but as a woman i do know that i am pure  then the mothers heart yearned greatly towards her daughter and yet she was no whit changed she knew nothing of phrases of logic but she felt that hester had begged the whole question those whom god had joined together true true if only one could know whether in this or the other case god had joined the couple as hester argued the matter no woman should be taken from the man she had married though he might have a dozen other wives all living and she spoke of purity as though it were a virtue which could be created and consecrated simply by the action of her own heart as though nothing outsideno ceremony no ordinancecould affect it the same argument would enable her to live with john caldigate after he should come out of prison even though as would then be the case another woman would have the legal right of calling herself mrs john caldigate on the previous day she had declared that if she could not be his wife she would be his mistress the mother knew what she meantthat let people call her by what name they might she would still be her husbands wife in the eye of god but she would not be so and then she would not be pure and to mrs bolton the worst of it was that this cloudiness had come upon her daughterthis incapacity to reason it outbecause the love of a human being had become so strong within her bosom as to have superseded and choked the love of heavenly things but how should she explain all this i am not asking you to drop his name  drop his name i will never drop it i cannot drop it it is mine i could not make myself anything but mrs john caldigate if i would and he she said taking the baby up from its cradle and pressing it to her bosom he shall be daniel caldigate to the day of his death do you think that i will take a step that shall look like robbing my child of his honest namethat will seem to imply a doubt that he is not his own fathers honest boythat he is not a fitting heir to the property which his forefathers have owned so long never they may call me what name they will but i will call myself john caldigates wife as long as i have a voice to make myself heard  it was the same protest over and over again and it was vain to answer you will not stay under your fathers roof  no i have to live under my husbands roof then mrs bolton left the room apparently in anger though her heart within might be melting with ruth still it was necessary that she should assume a look of anger on the morrow she would have to show herself angry with a vengeance if she should then still be determined to carry out her plan and she thought that she was determined what had pity to do with it or love or moving heartstirring words were not all these things temptation from the evil one if they were allowed to interfere with the strict line of hard duty when she left the room where the young mother was still standing with her baby in her arms she doubted for some minutesperhaps for some halfhourthen she wrestled with those emanations from the evil onewith pity with love and suasive tendernessand at last overcame them i know i am pure the daughter had said i know i am right said the mother  but she spoke a word to her husband when he came home i cannot bend her i cannot turn her in the least  she will not stay  not of her own accord  you have told her  oh no not till tomorrow  she ought to stay certainly said the father there had been very little intercourse between the mother and daughter during the afternoon and while the three were sitting together nothing was said about the morrow the evening would have seemed to be very sad and very silent had they not all three been used to so many silent evenings in that room hester during her wedding tour and the few weeks of her happiness at folking before the trouble had come had felt a new life and almost an ecstasy of joy in the thorough liveliness of her husband but the days of her old home were not so long ago that its old manners should seem strange to her she therefore sat out the hours patiently stitching some babys ornament till her mother told her that the time for prayer had come after worship her father called her out into the hall as he went up to his room hester he said it is not right that you should leave us tomorrow  i must papa  i tell you that it is not right you have a home in which everybody will respect you for the present you should remain here  i cannot papa he told me to go back tomorrow i would not disobey him nownot nowwere it ever so then the old man paused as though he were going on with the argument but finding that he had said all that he had to say he slowly made his way upstairs  goodnight mamma said hester returning only to the door of the sittingroom  goodnight my love as the words were spoken they both felt that there was something wrongmuch that was wrong i do not think they will do that said hester to herself as she went up the stairs to her chamber     chapter xxxiv  violence    it had been arranged at folking before hester had started that caldigate himself should drive the waggonette into cambridge to take her back on the wednesday but that he would bring a servant with him who should drive the carriage up to the grange so that he personally should not have to appear at the door of the house he would remain at mr seelys and then the waggonette should pick him up this had been explained to mrs bolton john will remain in town because he has so much to do with mr seely hester had said and richard will call here at about twelve all her plans had thus been made known and mrs bolton was aware at what hour the bolts must be drawn and the things removed  but as the time drew nearer her dislike to a sudden commencement of absolute hostilities became strongerto hostilities which would seem to have no sanction from mr bolton himself because he would then be absent and he too though as he lay awake through the dreary hours of the long night he said no word about the plan felt and felt more strongly as the dawn was breaking that it would be mean to leave his daughter with a farewell kiss knowing as he would do that he was leaving her within prisonbars leaving her to the charge of jailers the farewell kiss would be given as though he and she were to meet no more in her old home till this terrible trial should be over and some word appropriate to such a parting would then be spoken but any such parting word would be false and the falsehood would be against his own child does she expect it he said in a low voice when his wife came up to him as he was dressing  she expects nothing i am thinking that perhaps you would tell her that she could not go today  i could not say today if i tell her anything i must tell her all  will not that be best then the old man thought it all over it would be very much the best for him not to say anything about it if he could reconcile it to his conscience to leave the house without doing so and he knew well that his wife was more powerful than hegifted with greater persistence more capable of enduring a shower of tears or a storm of anger the success of the plan would be more probable if the conduct of it were left entirely to his wife but his conscience was sore within him  you will come with me to the gate he said to his daughter after their silent breakfast  oh yesto say goodbye  then he took his hat and his gloves and his umbrella very slowly lingering in the hall as he did so while his wife kept her seat firm and square at the breakfast table hester had her hat and shawl with her but mrs bolton did not suspect that she would endeavour to escape now without returning for her child therefore she sat firm and square waiting to hear from hester herself what her father might bring himself to communicate to her hester he said as he slowly walked round the sweep in front of the house hester he said you would do your duty best to god and manbest to john caldigate and to your childby remaining here  how can i unless he tells me  you have your fathers authority  you surrendered it when you gave me to him as his wife it is not that i would rebel against you papa but that i must obey him does not st paul say wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord  certainly and you cannot suppose that in any ordinary case i would interfere between you and him it is not that i am anxious to take anything from him that belongs to him then as they were approaching the gate he stood still but now in such an emergency as this when a question has risen as to his power of making you his wife  i will not hear of that i am his wife  then it may become my duty and your mothers tototo provide you with a home till the law shall have decided  i cannot leave his home unless he bids me  i am telling you of my dutyof my duty and your mothers then he passed out through the gate thus having saved his conscience from the shame of a false farewell and she slowly made her way back to the house after standing for a moment to look after him as he went she was almost sure now that something was intended he would not have spoken in that way of his duty unless he had meant her to suppose that he intended to perform it my duty he had said my duty and your mothers of course something was intended something was to be done or said more than had been done or said already during the breakfast she had seen in the curves of her mothers mouth the signs of some resolute purpose during the very prayers she had heard in her mothers voice a sound as of a settled determination she knewshe knew that something was to be done and with that knowledge she went back into her mothers room and sat herself down firmly and squarely at the table she had left her cup partly full and began again to drink her tea what did your papa say to you asked her mother  papa bade me stay here but i told him that most certainly i should go home to folking then mrs bolton also became aware of fixed will and resolute purpose on her daughters part  does his word go for nothing  how can two persons words go for anything when obedience is concerned it is like god and mammon  hester  if two people tell one differently it must be right to cling to one and leave the other no man can serve two masters i have got to obey my husband even were i to say that i would stay he could come and take me away  he could not do that  i shall not be so disobedient as to make it necessary the carriage will be here at twelve and i shall go i had better go and help nurse to put the things up so saying she left the room but mrs bolton remained there a while sitting square and firm at the table  it was not yet ten when she slowly followed her daughter upstairs she first went into her own room for a moment to collect her thoughts over again and then she walked across the passage to her daughters chamber she knocked at the door but entered as she knocked nurse she said will you go into my room for a minute or two i wish to speak to your mistress may she take the baby hester the baby was taken and then the two were alone do not pack up your things today hester  why not  you are not going today  i am going today mamma  that i should seem to be cruel to youonly seemcuts me to the heart but you cannot go back to folking today  when am i to go  ah hester  tell me what you mean mamma is it that i am to be a prisoner  if you would be gentle i would explain it  i will not be gentle you mean to keep meby violence but i mean to go my husband will come i will not be kept oh mamma you would not desire me to quarrel with you openly before the servants before all the world i will not be kept i will certainly go back to folking would i not go back though i had to get through the windows to walk the whole way to call upon the policemen even to help me  no one will help you hester every one will know that for the present this should be your home  it never shall be my home again said hester bursting into tears and rushing after her baby  then there were two hours of intense misery in that houseof misery to all who were concerned the servants down to the girl in the scullery and the boy who cleaned the boots were made aware that master and mistress were both determined to keep their married daughter a prisoner in the house the servants of the house sided with their mistress generally having all of them been induced to regard john caldigate with horror hesters nurse of course sympathised with her and her baby during these two hours the packing was completed but hester found that her strong walkingboots and her bonnet had been abstracted did they really think that at such a time as this boots and bonnets would be anything to her they could know nothing of her nature they could not understand the sort of combat she would carry on if an attempt were made to take from her her libertyan attempt made by those who had by law no right to control her when once she had learned what was being done she would not condescend to leave her room till the carriage should have come that that would come punctually at twelve she was sure then she would go down without her bonnet and without her boots and see whether any one would dare to stand in her way as with her baby in her arms she would attempt to walk forth through the front door  but it had not occurred to her that other steps might be taken just before twelve the gardener stationed himself on the road before the housea road which was half lane and half street belonging to the suburban village of chestertonand there awaited the carriage at a spot some yards away from the gate it was well that he was early because richard was there a few minutes before the time appointed she aint agoing back today said the gardener laying his hands gently on the horses back  who aint not agoing back asked the coachman  miss hester aint  mrs john aint agoing home  noi was to come out and tell you as master dont like wheels on the gravel if it can be helped we aint got none of our own  missus aint agoing home why master expects her for certain  i was to say she aint agoing today  the man who was driving passed the reins into his whiphand and raising his hat began to scratch his head with the other he knew at once that there was something wrongthat this prolonged staying away from home was not merely a pleasantly lengthened visit his master had been very urgent with him as to punctuality and was evidently intent upon the return of his wife all the facts of the accusation were known to the man and the fact also that his masters present wife was entirely in accord with his master it could not be that she should have determined to prolong her visit and then have sent him back to her husband with such a message as this if youll hold the hosses just a minute he said ill go in and see my missus  but the grange gardener was quite as intent on his side of the question as was the folking coachman on the other to him the horrors of bigamy were manifest he was quite of opinion that miss hesterwho never ought to have been married in that way at allshould now be kept a prisoner in her fathers house it aint no use your going inand you cant said the gardener i aint agoing to hold the horses and theres nobody as will  whats up mate  i dont know as im mate to you nor yet to no one like you and as to whats up ive told you all as im bade to tell you and i aint agoing to tell you no more you cant turn your horses there youd better drive round into the village and there youll get the highroad back to cambridge then the gardener retreated within a little gate of his own which led from the lane into the precincts close to his own cottage the man was an honest loyal old fanatic who would scruple at nothing in carrying out the orders of his mistress in so good a cause and personally his feelings had been acerbated in that he had been called mate by a man not half his age  the coachman did as he was bid seeing before him no other possible course he could not leave his horses but when he was in front of the iron gates he stopped and examined the premises the gates were old and were opened and closed at ordinary times by an ordinary ancient lock but now there was a chain passed in and out with a padlockevidently placed there to prevent him from entering in opposition to the gardeners instructions there was clearly no course open to him but to drive the carriage back to his master  at a quarter before twelve hester left her own roomwhich looked backwards into the garden as did all the pleasanter rooms of the housewith the intention of seating herself in a spare room looking out to the front from which she could have seen the carriage as it entered the gate had she so seen it she would certainly have called to the man from the window when he was standing in the road but the door of that front room was locked against her and when she tried the other she found that all the front rooms were locked she knew the house of course as well as did her mother and she rushed up to the attics where the servants occupied the rooms looking out to the road but they too were locked against her then it flashed upon her that the attempt to make her a prisoner was to be carried out through every possible detail  what should she do her husband would come of course but what if he were unable to force an entrance and how could he force it would the police help him would the magistrates help him she knew that the law was on her side and on histhat the law would declare him to be her lord and owner till the law should have separated them but would the law allow itself to be used readily for this purpose she too could understand that the feeling of the community would be against her and that in such a case the law might allow itself to become slow lethargic and perhaps inoperative yielding to the popular feeling she saw the points which were strong against her as clearly as william and robert bolton had seen those which were strong on their side but as she stood there beating her foot angrily on the floor of the passage she made up her mind that there should be more than one but in his favour if they kept her they should have to lock her up as in a dungeon they and all the neighbourhood should hear her voice they should be driven to do such things that the feeling of the community would be no longer on their side  various ideas passed through her mind she thought for a moment that she would refuse to take any nourishment in that house her mother would surely not see her die and would thus have to see her die or else send her forth to be fed but that thought stayed with her but for a moment it was not only for herself that she must eat and drink but for her baby then finding that she could not get to the front windows and seeing that the time had come in which the carriage should have been there she went down into the hall where she found her mother seated on a highbacked old oak armchair the windows of the hall looked out on to the sweep before the house but she was well aware that from these lower windows the plot of shrubs in the centre of the space hindered any view of the gate without speaking to her mother she put her hand upon the lock of the door as though to walk forth but found it barred am i a prisoner she said  yes hester yes if you will use such a word as to your fathers house you are a prisoner  i will not remain so you will have to chain me and to gag me and to kill me oh my babyoh my child nurse nurse bring me my boy then with her baby in her arms she sat down in another highbacked oak armchair looking at the halldoor there she would sit till her husband should come he surely would come he would make his way up to those windows and there she could at any rate hear his commands if he came for her surely she would be able to escape  the coachman drove back to the town very quickly and went to the inn at which his horses were generally put up thinking it better to go to his master thence on foot but there he found john caldigate who had come across from mr seelys office where is mrs caldigate he said as the man drove the empty carriage down the entrance to the yard the man touching his hat and with a motion of his hand which was intended to check his masters impetuosity drove on and then when he had freed himself from the charge of his horses told his story with many whispers  the gardener said she wasnt to come  just that sir theres something up more than you think sir there is indeed he was that fractious that he wouldnt hold the hosses for me not for a minute till i could go in and see and then  well  the gates was chained sir  chained  a chain was round the bars and a padlock i never see such a thing on a gentlemans gate in my life before chained as nobody wasnt to go in nor yet nobody wasnt to come out the man as he said this wore that air of dignity which is always imparted by the possession of great tidings the truth of which will certainly not be doubted  the tidings were great the very thing which his father had suggested and which he had declared to be impossible was being done the old banker himself would not he thought have dared to propose and carry out such a project the whole bolton family had conspired together to keep his wife from him and had allured her away by the false promise of a friendly visit he knew too that the law was on his side but he knew also that he might find it very difficult to make use of the law if the world of cambridge chose to think that hester was not his wife the world of cambridge would probably support the boltons by their opinion but if she if his hester were true to him and she certainly would be true to himand if she were as courageous as he believed her to bethen as he thought no house in chesterton would be able to hold her  he stood for a moment turning in his mind what he had better do then he gave his orders to the man in a clear natural voice take the horses out richard and feed them you had better get your dinner here so that i may be sure to find you here the moment i want you  i wont stir a step from the place said the man     chapter xxxv  in prison    what should he do john caldigate as he walked out of the innyard had to decide for himself what he would do at once his first impulse was to go to the mayor and ask for assistance he had a right to the custody of his wife her father had no right to make her a prisoner she was entitled to go whither she pleased so long as she had his sanction and should she be separated from him by the action of the law she would be entitled to go whither she pleased without sanction from any one whether married or unmarried she was not subject to her father the husband was sure that he was entitled to the assistance of the police but he doubted much whether he would be able to get it and he was most averse to ask for it  and yet what other step could he take with no purpose as yet quite fixed he went to the bank thinking that he might best commence his work by expostulating with his wifes father it was mr boltons habit to walk every morning into the town unless he was deterred by heat or wet or ill health and till lately it had been his habit also to walk back his house being a mile and a half distant from the bank but latterly the double walk had become too much for him and when the time for his return came he would send out for a cab to take him home his hours were very various he would generally lunch at the bank in his own little dingy room but if things went badly with him so as to disturb his mind he would go back early in the day and generally pass the afternoon asleep on this occasion he was very much troubled so that when caldigate reached the bank which he did before one mr bolton was already getting into his cab could i speak a few words to you sir said caldigate in the street  i am not very well today said the banker hardly looking round persevering in his effort to get into the vehicle  i would not keep you for a minute sir i must see you as you are aware  there were already halfadozen people collected all of whom had no doubt heard the story of john caldigates wife there was indeed no man or woman in cambridge whose ears it had not reached in the hearing of these mr bolton was determined not to speak of his daughter and he was equally determined not to go back into the house i have nothing to say he mutterednothing nothing drive on so the cab was driven on and john caldigate was left in the street  the mans anger now produced a fixed purpose and with a quick step he walked away from the bank to robert boltons office there he soon found himself in the attorneys room are you aware of what they are doing at the grange he asked in a voice which was not so guarded as it should have been on such an occasion anger and the quickness of his walk had combined to make him short of breath and he asked the question with that flurried hasty manner which is common to angry people who are hot rather than malicious in their angers  i dont think i am said the attorney but if i were i doubt whether i should just at present be willing to discuss their doings with you  my wife has gone there on a visit  i am glad to hear it it is the best thing that my sister could do  and now it seems some difficulty is made about her returning  that i think very likely her father and mother can hardly wish that she should go back to your house at present i cannot imagine that she should wish it herself if you have the feelings of a gentleman or the heart of a man you ought not to wish it  i have not come here to be taught what is becoming either to a man or a gentleman  if you will allow me to say so while things are as they are at present you ought not to come here at all  i should not have done so but for this violence this breach of all hospitality at your fathers house my wife went there with the understanding that she was to stay for two days  and now you say they detain her i am not responsible but in doing so they have my thorough sympathy and approbation i do not know that i can help them or that they will want my help but i shall help them if i can the fact is you had better leave her there  never  i should not have volunteered my advice but as you are here i may perhaps say a word if you attempt to take her by violence from her fathers house you will have all the town all the county all england against you  i shouldi own itunless she wished to come to me if she chooses to stay she shall stay  it must not be left to her if she be so infatuated she must not be allowed to judge for herself till this trial be over she and you must live apart then if that woman does not make good her claimif you can prove that the woman is lyingthen you will have back your wife but if as everybody i find believes at present it should be proved that you are the husband of that woman and that you have basely betrayed my poor sister by a mock marriage then she must be left to the care of her father and her mother and may heaven help her in her misery all this he said with much dignity and in a manner with which even caldigate could not take personal offence you must remember he added that this poor injured one is their daughter and my sister  i say that she has been in no wise injured butas i also am injuredby a wicked plot and i say that she shall come back to me unless she herself elects to remain with her parents then he left the office and went forth again into the streets  he now took at once the road to chesterton trying as he did so to make for himself in his own mind a plan or map of the premises it would he thought be impossible but that his wife would be able to get out of the house and come to him if he could only make her aware of his presence but then there was the baby and it would be necessary not only that she should escape herself but that she should bring her child with her would they attempt to hold her could it be that they should have already locked her up in some room upstairs and if she did escape out of some window even with her baby in her arms how would it be with them then as they made their way back into the town thinking of this he hurried back to the inn and told richard to take the carriage into chesterton and wait there at the turn of the lane where the lane leads down from the main road to the grange he was to wait there though it might be all the day till he heard from or saw his master the man who was quite as keen for his master as was the old gardener for his mistress on the other side promised accurate obedience then he retraced his steps and walked as fast as he could to the grange  during all this time the mother and the daughter kept their weary seats in the hall hester having her baby in her arms she had quite determined that nothing should induce her again to go upstairslest the key of the room should be turned upon her for a long time they sat in silence and then she declared her purpose  i shall remain here mamma  if so i must remain too  i shall not go up to my bedroom again you may be sure of that  you will go up tonight i hope  certainly not nurse shall take baby up to his cradle i do not suppose you will be cruel enough to separate me from my child  cruel do you not know that i would do anything for you or your childthat i would die for you or your child  i suppose you will let them bring me food here you would not wish him to be starved  hester  well what would you have me say are you not my jailer  i am your mother according to my conscience i am acting for you as best i know how do you not know that i mean to be good to you  i know you are not good to me nobody can be good who tries to separate me from my husband i shall remain here till he comes and tells me how i am to be taken away then mr bolton returned and made his way into the house with the assistance of the gardener through the kitchen he found the two women sitting in the hall each in the highbacked armchair and his daughter with her baby in her armsa most piteous sight the two of them thus together papa she said as he came up into the hall from the kitchen you are treating me badly cruelly unjustly you have no right to keep me here against my will i am my husbands wife and i must go to my husband  it is for the best hester  what is wrong cannot be for the best do you suppose that he will let me be kept here in prison of course he will come why do you not let me go  it is right that you should be here hester he said as he passed upstairs to his own bedroom it was a terrible job of work for which he had no strength whatever himself and as to which he was beginning to doubt whether even his wifes strength would suffice as for her as for hester perhaps it would be well that she should be wearied and broken into submission but it was fearful to think that his wife should have to sit there the whole day saying nothing doing nothing merely watching lest her daughter should attempt to escape through some window  it will kill your father i think said the mother  why does he not let me go then i have to think of my husband and my child then again there was silence when they had been seated thus for two hours all the words that had been spoken between them had not spread themselves over ten minutes and mrs bolton was looking forward to hour after hour of the same kind it did not seem to her to be possible that hester should be forced up into her own room even she with all her hardihood could not ask the men about the place to take her in their arms and carry her with violence up the stairs nor would the men have done it if so required nothing but a policemans garb will seem to justify the laying of a hand upon a woman and even that will hardly do it unless the woman be odiously disreputable mrs bolton saw clearly what was before her should hester be strong in her purpose to remain seated as at present she also must remain seated weariness and solicitude for her baby might perhaps drive the young mother to bed then she also would go to her bedand would rest with one eye ever open with her ears always on the alert she was somewhat sure of herself her life had not been so soft but that she could endure muchand of her purpose she was quite sure nothing would trouble her conscience if she could succeed in keeping her daughter separated from john caldigate  caldigate in his hot haste walked up to the iron gates and found them chained it was in vain that he shook them and in vain that he looked at them the gates were fully twelve feet high and spiked at the top at each side of the gates ran a wall surmounted by iron railingsextending to the gardeners cottage on the one side and to the coachhouse on the other the drive up to the house which swept round a plot of thick shrubs lay between the various officesthe stables and coachhouse being on one side and the laundry and gardeners cottage on the other from the road there was no mode of ingress for him to this enclosure unless he could get over the railings this might perhaps have been possible but it would have been quite impossible for him to bring his wife back by the same way there was a bell at the gardeners little gate which he rang loudly but no one would come to him at last he made his way round into the kitchengarden by a corner where access was made by climbing a moderately high gate which gave an entrance to the fields from thence he had no difficulty in making his way on to the lawn at the back of the house and up by halfadozen stone steps to the terrace which ran along under the windows here he found that the lower shutters were barred on the inside throughout so that he could not look into any of the rooms but he could rap at the windows which he did loudly and it was in his power to break them if he pleased he rapped very loudly but poor hester who sat at the front hall heard nothing of the noise  he knew that from the backgarden he could make his way to the front with more or less of violence between the gardeners cottage and the laundry there was a covered passage leading to the front the buildings above being continuous but leaving a way through for the convenience of the servants this however was guarded by a trelliswork gate but even on this gate the gardener had managed to fix a lock when caldigate reached the spot the man was standing idle and observant at his own cottage door you had better open this gate said caldigate or i shall kick it open  you mustnt do that mr caldigate its masters orders as its to be locked its masters orders as you aint to be in here at all then caldigate raised his foot and the trelliswork gate was very soon despatched very well said the manvery well mr caldigate thatll have to come agin you when the other things come its my belief as its burglorious then caldigate went up before the house windows and the gardener followed him  the front door was approached by halfadozen stone steps which were guarded on each side by a curved iron rail along the whole front of the house passing under the steps there ran a narrow shallow area contrived simply to give light to the kitchen and offices in the basement storey but this area was again guarded by an iron rail which was so constructed as to make it impossible that any one less expert than a practised housebreaker should get in or out of any of the windows looking that way from the hall there were no less than four windows looking to the front but they were all equally unapproachable  the moment that caldigate appeared coming round the curve of the gravel road hester saw him jumping up from her chair with her baby she rushed to the window and called to him aloud tapping at the window as she did so john i am here come to me come to me take me out they have shut me in and will not let me come to you then she held up the baby mamma let him in so that he come to his own baby you dare not keep the father away from his own child at this time the nurse was in the hall as was also the cook but the front door was locked as well as chained and the key was in mrs boltons own pocket she sat perfectly silent rigid without a motion she had known that he would come and show himself and she had determined that she would be rigid silent and motionless she would not move or speak unless hester should endeavour to make her way down into the kitchen but just in the passage which led to the top of the kitchen stairs stood the cookstrong solid almost twice the weight of hestera pious determined woman on whom her mistress could depend that she would remain there impervious  they could talk to each other now hester and caldigate each explaining or suggesting what had been done or should be done but they could converse only so that their enemies around them should hear every word that was spoken no john no i will not stay she said when her husband told her that he would leave the decision to her unless it be to do your bidding i will not stay here willingly and john i will not move upstairs i will remain here and if they choose to give me food they may bring it to me unless they carry me i will not go to my bedroom and they shall tear me to pieces before i will let them carry me poor baby poor baby i know he will be ill she said moaning but still so that he standing beyond the railings should hear her through the window i know he will be ill but what can i do they do not care for my baby if he should die it will be nothing to them during all this mrs bolton kept her resolve and sat there rigid with her eyes fixed on vacancy speaking no word apparently paying no attention to the scene around her her back was turned to the front door so that she could not see john caldigate nor would she attempt to look at him he could not get in nor could the other get out if that were so she would endeavour to bear it all in the meantime the old man was sitting in his armchair up in his bedroom reduced almost to inanity of mind by the horror of the occasion when he could think of it all he would tell himself that he must let her go he could not keep the mother and her baby a prisoner in such a condition as this  then there came dinner let misfortunes be what they may dinner will come the old man crawled downstairs and hester was invited into the diningroom no she said if you choose to send it to me here because of baby i will eat then neither would mrs bolton go to her husband but both of them seated in their highbacked armchairs ate their food with their plates upon their laps  during this time caldigate still remained outside but in vain as circumstances were at present he had no means of approaching his wife he could kick down a slight trelliswork gate but he could bring no adequate force to bear against the stout front door at last when the dusk of evening came on he took his departure assuring his wife that he would be there again on the following morning     chapter xxxvi  the escape    during the whole of that night hester kept her position in the hall holding her baby in her arms as long as the infant would sleep in that position and then allowing the nurse to take it to its cradle upstairs and during the whole night also mrs bolton remained with her daughter tea was brought to them which each of them took and after that neither spoke a word to the other till the morning before he went to bed mr bolton came down and made an effort for their joint comfort hester he said why should you not go to your room you can do yourself no good by remaining there no she said sullenly no i will stay you will only make yourself illyou and your mother  she can go though i should die i will stay here  nor could he succeed better with his wife if she is obstinate so must i be said mrs bolton it was in vain that he endeavoured to prove to her that there could be no reason for such obstinacy that her daughter would not attempt to escape during the hours of the night without her baby  you would not do that said the old man turning to his daughter but to this hester would make no reply and mrs bolton simply declared her purpose of remaining to her mind there was present an idea that she would at any rate endure as much actual suffering as her daughter there they both sat and in the morning they were objects pitiable to be seen  macbeth and sancho have been equally eloquent in the praise of sleep sleep that knits up the ravelled sleave of care but sleep will knit up effectually no broken stitches unless it be enjoyed in bed blessings on him who invented sleep said sancho but the great inventor was he who discovered mattresses and sheets and blankets these two unfortunates no doubt slept but in the morning they were weary comfortless and exhausted towels and basins were brought to them and then they prepared themselves to watch through another day it seemed to be a trial between them which could outwatch the other the mother was of course much the older but with poor hester there was the baby to add to her troubles never was there a woman more determined to carry out her purpose than mrs bolton or one more determined to thwart the purpose of another than she who still called herself hester caldigate in the morning mrs bolton implored her husband to go into cambridge as usual but he felt that he could not leave the house with such inmates so he sat in his bedroom dozing wretchedly in his armchair  caldigate appeared before the house at nine oclock no further attempt having been made to exclude his entrance by the side gate and asked to see mr bolton papa is upstairs said hester through the window but the old man would not come down to see his visitor nor would he send any message then caldigate declared his purpose of going at once to the mayor and demanding assistance from the police he at any rate would return with the carriage as early as he could after his visit to the magistrates office he went to the mayor and inflicted much trouble on that excellent officer who however at last with the assistance of his clerkand of robert bolton whom he saw on the slycame to the decision that his own authority would not suffice for the breaking open of a mans house in order that his married daughter should be taken by violence from his custody no doubt he said no doubt when caldigate pleaded that mr boltons daughter was at any rate for the present his own wife and that a mans right to have his wife is undoubted those words no doubt were said very often but no other words were said then the clerk expressed an opinion that the proper course would be for mr caldigate to go up to london and get an order from the vicechancellor which was of course tantamount to saying that his wife was to remain at chesterton till after the trialunless she could effect her own escape  but not on that account was he inclined to yield he had felt from the first as had she also that she would make her way out of the house or would not make it as she might or might not have the courage to be persistent in demanding it this indeed had been felt both by william and robert bolton when they had given their counsel she is a woman with a baby and when in your house will be subject to your influences she will be very angry at first but will probably yield after a time to your instructions she will at last give an unwilling assent to the course you propose that is what may be expected but if she should be firmer than we think if there should be in her bosom a greater power of resistance than we expect should she dash herself too violently against the cagethen you must let her go that was intended to be the gist of the advice given though it perhaps was not so accurately expressed it was in that way understood by the old man but mrs bolton would not so understand it she had taken the matter in hand and as she pressed her lips together she told herself that she intended to go through with it  and so did hester but as this day went on hester became at times almost hysterical in her efforts to communicate with her husband through the window holding up her baby and throwing back her head and was almost in convulsions in her efforts to get at him he on the other side thundered at the door with the knocker till that instrument had been unscrewed from within but still he could knock with his stick and shout with his voice while the people outside the iron gates stood looking on in a crowd in the course of the day robert bolton endeavoured to get an order from the magistrates for the removal of caldigate by the police but the mayor would not assent either to that old mr bolton was the owner of the house and if there was a nuisance to be complained of it was he that must complain the mayor during these days was much tried the steady married people of the boroughthe shopkeepers and their wives the doctors and lawyers and clergymenwere in favour of mr and mrs bolton it was held to be fitting that a poor lady in hesters unfortunate position should be consigned to the care of her parents till the matter had been settled but the people generally sympathised with the young husband and young wife and were loud in denouncing the illegality of the bankers proceedings and it was already rumoured that among the undergraduates caldigates side was favoured it was generally known that crinkett and the woman had asked for money before they had brought their accusation and on that account sympathy ran with the squire of folking the mayor therefore did not dare to give an order that caldigate should be removed from off the premises at puritan grange knowing that he was there in search of a wife who was only anxious to place herself in his custody  but nothing was done all that day about four in the afternoon while caldigate was still there and at a moment in which poor hester had been reduced by the continuance of her efforts to a state of hysterical prostration the old man summoned his wife upstairs she with a motion to the cook who still guarded the stairs obeyed the order and for a moment left her watch  you must let her go said the old man with tremulous anxiety beating with his fingers on his knees as he spoke you must let her go  no no  it will kill her  if i let her go i shall kill her soul said the determined woman is not her soul more than her body  they will say wemurdered her  who will say it and what would that be but the breath of a man does not our father who is in heaven know that i would die to do her a service if the service accorded with his will does he not know that i am cruel to her here in order that she may be saved from eternal she was going to say in the natural fervour of her speech from eternal cruelty to come but she checked herself to have admitted that such a judgment could be worse than just worse even than merciful would be blasphemy to her oh he knows he knows and if he knows what matters what men say that i have done to her  i cannot have it go on like this said he still whispering  she will be wearied out and then we will take her to her bed  but mr bolton succeeded in demanding that a telegram should be sent up to william requesting him to come down to the grange as early as possible on the following morning this was sent and also a message to robert bolton in cambridge telling him that william had been summoned during these two days he had not been seen at the grange though he knew much of what was being done there had he however been aware of all that his sister and stepmother were enduring he would probably have appeared upon the scene as it was he had justified his absence by pleading to himself mrs boltons personal enmity and the understanding which existed that he should not visit the house then when it was dark caldigate with the carriage again returned to the town where he slept as he had done on the previous night again their food was brought to the two women in the hall and again each of them swallowed a cup of tea as they prepared themselves for the work of the night  in the hall there was a gasstove which was kept burning and gave a faint glimmer so that each could see the outline of the other light beyond that there was none in the weary long hours of nights such as these nights passed on the seats of railway carriages or rougher nights such as some of us remember on the outside of coaches or sitting by the side of the sick sleep will come early and will early go the weariness of the past day will produce some forgetfulness for an hour or two and then come the slow cold sad hours through which the dawn has to be expected between two and three these unfortunates were both awake the poor baby having been but lately carried back from its mother to its cradle then suddenly mrs bolton heard rather than saw her daughter slip down from her chair on to the ground and stretch herself along upon the hard floor hester she said but hester did not answer hester are you hurt when there was still no answer the mother got up with limbs so stiff that she could hardly use them and stood over her child hester speak to me  i will never speak to you more said the daughter  my child why will you not go to your comfortable wholesome bed  i will not go i will die here  the door shall not be locked you shall have the key with you i will do nothing to hurt you if you will go to your bed  i will not go leave me alone you cannot love me mamma or you would not treat me like this  love you oh my child if you knew if you could understand why am i doing this is it not because i feel it to be my duty will you let me take you to your bed  no never i too can do my dutymy duty to my husband it is to remain here till i can get to him even though i should die then she turned her poor limbs on the hard floor and the mother covered her with a cloak and placed a cushion beneath her head then after standing a while over her child she returned to her chair and did not move or speak again till the old cook came with the first glimmer of the morning to inquire how the night had been passed  i cannot allow this i cannot allow this said mr bolton when he shuffled down in his slippers the old servant had been up to him and had warned him that such sufferings as these might have a tragic endtoo probably an end fatal to the infant if the mothers strength should altogether fail her would it not go badly with the baby so the cook had argued who had been stern enough herself anxious enough to secure miss hester from the wickedness of john caldigate but she was now cowed and frightened and had acknowledged to herself that if miss hester would not give way then she must be allowed to go forth let the wickedness be what it might  there must be an end to this said the old man  what end asked his wife let her obey her parents  i will obey only my husband said hester  of course there must be an end let her go to her bed and weary as i am i will wait upon her as only a mother can wait upon her child have i not prayed for her through the watches of the night that she might be delivered from this calamity that she might be comforted by him in her sorrow what have i done these two last weary days but pray to the lord god that he might be merciful to her  let me go said hester  i will not let you go said the mother rising from her seat i too can suffer i too can endure i will not be conquered by my own child there spoke the human being that was the utterance natural to the woman in this struggle hard as it is i will not be beat by one who has been subject to my authority in all those prayersand she had prayedthere had been the prayer in her heart if not in her words that she might be saved from the humiliation of yielding  early in the day caldigate was again in front of the house and outside there was a close carriage with a pair of horses standing at the gardeners little gate and at the front gate which was still chained there was again the crowd at about one both william and robert bolton came upon the scene and were admitted by the gardener and cook through the kitchendoor into the house they were close to caldigate as they entered neither did they speak to him or he to them at that moment hester was standing with the baby at the window and saw them now i shall be allowed to go she exclaimed mrs bolton was still seated with her back to the windows but she had heard the steps on the gravel and the opening of the kitchendoor and she understood hesters words and was aware that her husbands sons were in the house  they had agreed as to what should be done and at once made their way up into the hall william you will make them let me go you will make them let me go said hester rushing at once to the elder of the two and holding out her baby as though for him to take she was now in a state so excited so nervous so nearly hysterical that she was hardly able to control herself you will not let them kill me williamme and my baby he kissed her and said a kind word or two and then inquiring after his father passed on upstairs then mrs bolton followed him leaving robert in the hall with hester i know that you have turned against me said hester  indeed no i have never turned against you i have thought that you would be better here than at folking for the present  that is being against me a woman should be with her husband you told them to do this and they have nearly killed meme and my baby  in the meantime william bolton upstairs was very decided in his opinion that they must at once allow caldigate to take her back to folking she had as he said proved herself to be too strong for them the experiment had been tried and had failed no doubt it would be betterso he thoughtthat she should remain for the present at the grange so much better that a certain show of force had been justified but as things were going no further force would be justified she had proved her power and must be allowed to go mrs bolton however would not even yet acknowledge that she was beaten in a few more hours she thought hester would allow herself to be taken to her bed and then all might be well but she could not stand against the combined force of her husband and his two sons and so it was decided that the front door should be opened for the prisoner and that the chains should be removed from the gate i should be afraid of the people william bolton said to his father  it was not till this decision had been given that mrs bolton felt that the struggle of the last three days had been too much for her now at last she threw herself upon her bed weeping bitter tears tears of a broken spirit and there she lay prostrate with fatigue and misery nor would she go down to say a word of farewell how could she say adieu to her daughter leaving her house in such circumstances i will give her your love said william bolton  say nothing to her she does not care for my love nor for the love of her father in heaven she cares only for that adulterer  the door was opened from within and the chains were taken away from the gate oh johnoh my husband she exclaimed as she leaped down the steps into his arms never let me go again not for a daynot for an hour then her boxes were brought down and the nurse came with the child whom the mother at once took and placed in his fathers arms and the carriage was brought in and the luggage was placed on it and the nurse and the baby were seated i will go up to poor mamma for one moment she said she did go to her mothers room and throwing herself upon the wretched woman wept over her and kissed her but the mother though in some sort she returned the caress said not a word as her daughter left the room and she went also to her father and asked his blessing he muttered a word or two blessing her no doubt with inarticulate words he also had been thoroughly vanquished  then she got into the carriage and was taken back to folking lying in john caldigates arms     chapter xxxvii  again at folking    thus hester prevailed and was taken back to the house of the man who had married her by this time very much had been said about the matter publicly it had been impossible to keep the questionwhether john caldigates recent marriage had been true or fraudulentout of the newspapers and now the attempt that had been made to keep them apart by force gave an additional interest to the subject there was an opinion very general among elderly educated people that hester ought to have allowed herself to be detained at the grange we do not mean to lean heavily on the unfortunate young lady said the isleofelychurchintelligencer but we think that she would have better shown a becoming sense of her position had she submitted her self to her parents till the trial is over then the full sympathy of all classes would have been with her and whether the law shall restore her to a beloved husband or shall tell her that she has become the victim of a cruel seducer she would have been supported by the approval and generous regard of all men it was thus for the most part that the elderly and the wise spoke and thought about it of course they pitied her but they believed all evil of caldigate declaring that he too was bound by a feeling of duty to restore the unfortunate one to her father and mother until the matter should have been set at rest by the decision of a jury  but the peopleespecially the people of utterden and netherden and of chesterton and even of cambridgewere all on the side of caldigate and hester as a married couple they liked the persistency with which he had claimed his wife and applauded her to the echo for her love and firmness of course the scene at puritan grange had been much exaggerated the two nights were prolonged to intervals varying from a week to a fortnight during that time she was said always to have been at the window holding up her baby and mrs bolton was accused of cruelties which she certainly had not committed some details of the affair made their way into the metropolitan pressso that the expected trial became one of those causes célèbres by which the public is from time to time kept alive to the value and charm of newspapers  during all this john caldigate was specially careful not to seclude himself from public view or to seem to be afraid of his fellowcreatures he was constantly in cambridge generally riding thither on horseback and on such occasions was always to be seen in trumpington street and trinity street between him and the boltons there was by tacit consent no intercourse whatever after the attempted imprisonment he never showed himself at robert boltons office nor when they met in the street did they speak to each other indeed at this time no gentleman or lady held any intercourse with caldigate except his father and mr bromley the clergyman the babingtons were strongly of opinion that he should have surrendered the care of his wife and aunt polly went so far as to write to him when she first heard of the affair at chesterton recommending him very strongly to leave her at the grange then there was an angry correspondence ended at last by a request from aunt polly that there might be no further intercourse between babington and folking till after the trial  caldigate though he bore all this with an assured face with but little outward sign of inward misgiving suffered muchmuch even from the estrangement of those with whom he had hitherto been familiar to be cut by any one was a pain to him not to be approved of not to be courted not to stand well in the eyes of those around him was to him positive and immediate suffering he was supported no doubt by the full confidence of his father by the friendliness of the parson and by the energetic assurances of partisans who were all on his sidesuch as mr ralph holt the farmer while caldigate had been in cambridge waiting for his wifes escape holt and one or two others were maturing a plan for breaking into puritan grange and restoring the wife to her husband all this supported him without it he could hardly have carried himself as he did but with all this still he was very wretched it is that so many people should think me guilty he said to mr bromley  she bore it betterthough of course now that she was safe at folking she had but little to do as to outward bearing in the first place no doubt as to his truth ever touched her for a momentand not much doubt as to the result of the trial it was to her an assured fact that john caldigate was her husband and she could not realise the idea that such being the fact a jury should say that he was not but let all that be as it might they two were one and to adhere to him in every word in every thought in every little action was to her the only line of conduct possible she heard what mr bromley said she knew what her fatherinlaw thought she was aware of the enthusiasm on her side of the folk at folking it seemed to her that this opposition to her happiness was but a continuation of that which her mother had always made to her marriage the boltons were all against her it was a terrible sorrow to her but she knew how to bear it bravely in the tenderness of her husband who at this time was very tender to her she had her great consolation  on the day of her return she had been very illso ill that caldigate and his father had been much frightened during the journey home in the carriage she had wept and laughed hysterically now clutching her baby and then embracing her husband before reaching folking she had been so worn with fatigue that he had hardly been able to support her on the seat but after rest for a day or two she had rallied completely and she herself had taken pleasure and great pride in the fact that through it all her baby had never really been ill he is a little man she said boasting to the boys father and knows how to put up with troubles and when his mamma was so bad he didnt peak and pine and cry so as to break her heart did he my own own brave little man and she could boast of her own health too thank god i am strong john i can bear things which would break down other women you shall never see me give way because i am a poor creature certainly she had a right to boast that she was not a poor creature  caldigate no doubt was subject to troubles of which she knew nothing it was quite clear to him that mr seely his own lawyer did in truth believe that there had been some form of marriage between him and euphemia smith the attorney had never said so muchhad never accused him it would probably have been opposed to all the proprieties in such a matter that any direct accusation should have been made against him by his own attorney but he could understand from the mans manner that his mind was not free from a strong suspicion mr seely was eager enough as to the defence but seemed to be eager as against opposing evidence rather than on the strength of evidence on his own side he was not apparently desirous of making all the world know that such a marriage certainly never took place but that whether such a marriage had taken place or not the jury ought not to trust the witnesses he relied not on the strength of his own client but on the weakness of his clients adversaries it might probably be capable of proof that crinkett and adamson and the woman had conspired together to get money from john caldigate and if so then their evidence as to the marriage would be much weakened and he showed himself not averse to any tricks of trade which might tend to get a verdict could it be proved that john crinkett had been dishonest in his mining operations had euphemia smith allowed her name to be connected with that of any other man in australia what had been her antecedents was it not on the cards that allan the minister had never undergone any ceremony of ordination and if not might it not be shown that a marriage service performed by him would be no marriage service at all could not the jury be made to thinkor at least some of the jurythat out there in that rough lawless wilderness marriage ceremonies were very little understood these were the wiles to which he seemed disposed to trust whereas caldigate was anxious that he should instruct some eloquent indignant advocate to declare boldly that no english gentleman could have been guilty of conduct so base so dastardly and so cruel you see mr caldigate the lawyer said on one occasion to make the best of it our own hands are not quite clean you did promise the other lady marriage  no doubt no doubt i was a fool and i paid for my folly i bought her off having fallen into the common scrapehaving been pleased by her prettinesses and clevernesses and womens waysi did as so many other men have done i got out of it as best i could without treachery and without dishonour i bought her off had she refused to take my money i should probably have married herand probably have blown my brains out afterwards all that has to be acknowledgedmuch to my shame most of us would have to blush if the worst of our actions were brought out before us in a court of law but there was an end of it then they come over here and endeavour to enforce their demand for money by a threat  that envelope is so unfortunate said the lawyer  most unfortunate  perhaps we shall get some one before the day comes who will tell the jury that any marriage up at ahalala must have been a farce  all this was unsatisfactory and became so more and more as the weeks went by the confidential clerk whom the boltons had sent out when the first threat reached them early in novemberthe threat conveyed in that letter from the woman which caldigate had shown to robert boltonreturned about the end of march the two brothers robert and william decided upon sending him to mr seely so that any information obtained might be at caldigates command to be used if of any use in his defence but there was in truth very little of it the clerk had been up to nobble and ahalala and had found no one there who knew enough of the matter to give evidence about it the population of mining districts in australia is peculiarly a shifting population so that the most of those who had known caldigate and his mode of life there were gone the old woman who kept hennikers hotel at nobble had certainly heard that they were married but then she had added that many people there called themselves man and wife from convenience a woman would often like a respectable name where there was no parson near at hand to entitle her to it then the parsons would be dilatory and troublesome and expensive and a good many people were apt to think that they could do very well without ceremonies she evidently would have done no good to either side as a witness this clerk had found ahalala almost desertedoccupied chiefly by a few chinese who were contented to search for the specks of gold which more ambitious miners had allowed to slip through their fingers the woman had certainly called herself mrs caldigate and had been called so by many but she had afterwards been called mrs crinkett when she and crinkett had combined their means with the view of buying the polyeuka mine she was described as an enterprising greedy woman upon whom the love of gold had had almost more than its customary effect and she had for a while been noted and courted for her success having been the only female miner who was supposed to have realised money in these parts she had been known to the banks at nobble also even at sydney and had been supposed at one time to have been worth twenty or thirty thousand pounds then she had joined herself with crinkett and all their money had been supposed to vanish in the polyeuka mine no doubt there had been enough in that to create animosity of the most bitter kind against caldigate he in his search for gold had been uniformly successfulwas spoken of among the nobble miners as the one man who in gold digging had never had a reverse he had gone away just before the bad time came on polyeuka and then had succeeded after he had gone in extracting from these late unfortunate partners of his every farthing that he had left them there was ample cause for animosity  allan the minister who certainly had been at ahalala was as certainly dead he had gone out from scotland as a presbyterian clergyman and no doubt had ever been felt as to his being that which he called himselfand a letter from him was produced which had undoubtedly been written by himself robert bolton had procured a photograph of the note which the woman produced as having been written by allan to caldigate the handwriting did not appear to him to be the same but an expert had given an opinion that they both might have been written by the same person of dick shand no tidings had been found it was believed that he had gone from queensland to some of the islandsprobably to the fijis but he had sunk so low among men as to have left no trace behind him in australia no one cares to know whence a shepherd has come or whither he goes a miner belongs to a higher class and is more considered the result of all which was in the opinion of the boltons adverse to john caldigate and in discussing this with his client mr seely acknowledged that nothing had as yet come to light sufficient to shake the direct testimony of the woman corroborated as it was by three persons all of whom would swear that they had been present at the marriage  no doubt they endeavoured to get money from you said mr seely and i may be well assured in my own mind that money was their sole object but then it cannot be denied that their application to you for money had a sound basisone which though you might fairly refuse to allow it takes away from the application all idea of criminality crinkett has never asked for money as a bribe to hold his tongue in a matter of trade between them and you you were very successful they were very unfortunate a man asking for restitution in such circumstances will hardly be regarded as dishonest  it was to no purpose that caldigate declared that he would willingly have remitted a portion of the money had he known the true circumstances he had not done so and now the accusation was made the jury feeling that the application had been justifiable would probably keep the two things distinct that was mr seelys view and thus in these days caldigate gradually came to hate mr seely there was no comfort to be had from mr seely  mr bromley was much more comfortable though unfortunately in such a matter less to be trusted  as to the ministers handwriting he said that will go for nothing even if he had written the note  which he didnt said caldigate  exactly but should it be believed to have been his it would prove nothing and as to the envelope i cannot think that any jury would disturb the happiness of a family on such evidence as that it all depends on the credibility of the people who swear that they were present and i can only say that were i one of the jury and were the case brought before me as i see it now i certainly should not believe them there is here one letter to you declaring that if you will comply with her demands she will not annoy you and declaring also her purpose of marrying some one else how can any juryman believe her after that  mr seely says that twelve men will not be less likely to think me a bigamist because she has expressed her readiness to commit bigamy that if alone she would not have a leg to stand upon but that she is amply corroborated whereas i have not been able to find a single witness to support me it seems to me that in this way any man might be made the victim of a conspiracy  then mr bromley said that all that would be too patent to a jury to leave any doubt upon the matter but john caldigate himself though he took great comfort in the society of the clergyman did in truth rely rather on the opinion of the lawyer  the old squire never doubted his son for a moment and in his intercourse with hester showed her all the tenderness and trust of a loving parent but he too manifestly feared the verdict of a jury according to him things in the world around him generally were very bad what was to be expected from an ordinary jury such as cambridgeshire would supply but prejudice thickheaded stupidity or at the best a strict obedience to the dictum of a judge it is a case he said in which no jury about here will have sense enough to understand and weigh the facts there will be on one side the evidence of four people all swearing the same thing it may be that one or more of them will break down under crossexamination and that all will then be straight but if not the twelve men in a box will believe them because they are four not understanding that in such a case four may conspire as easily as two or three there will be the judge no doubt but english judges are always favourable to convictions the judge begins with the idea that the man before him would hardly have been brought there had he not been guilty  in all this and very much more that he said both to mr bromley and his son he was expressing his contempt for the world around him rather than any opinion of his own on this particular matter i often think said he that we have to bear more from the stupidity than from the wickedness of the world  it should be mentioned that about a week after hesters escape from chesterton there came to her a letter from her mother       dearest hesteryou do not think that i do not love you because     i tried to protect you from what i believe to be sin and evil and     temptation you do not think that i am less your mother because i     caused you suffering if your eye offend you pluck it out was i     not plucking out my own eye when i caused pain to you you ought to     come back to me and your father you ought to do so even now but     whether you come back or not will you not remember that i am the     mother who bore you and have always loved you and when further     distress shall come upon you will you not return to meyour     unhappy but most loving mother      mary bolton   in answer to this hester in a long letter acknowledged her mothers love and said that the memory of those two days at chesterton should lessen neither her affection nor her filial duty but she went on to say that in whatever distress might come upon her she should turn to her husband for comfort and support whether he should be with her or whether he should be away from her but she added concluding her letter beyond my husband and my child you and papa will always be the dearest to me     chapter xxxviii  bollum    there was not much to enliven the house at folking during these days caldigate would pass much of his time walking about the place applying his mind as well as he could to the farm and holding up his head among the tenants with whom he was very popular he had begun his reign over them with hands not only full but free he had drained and roofed and put up gates and repaired roads and shown himself to be an active man anxious to do good and now in his trouble they were very true to him but their sympathy could not ease the burden at his heart though by his words and deeds among them he seemed to occupy himself fully there was a certain amount of pretence in every effort that he made he was always affecting a courage in which he felt himself to be deficient every smile was false every brave word spoken was an attempt at deceit when alone in his walksand he was mostly alonehis mind would fix itself on his great trouble and on the crushing sorrow which might only too probably fall upon that loved one whom he had called his wife oh with what regret now did he think of the good advice which the captain had given him on board the goldfinder and of the sententious timid wisdom of mrs callender had shehis hester ever uttered to him one word of reproachhad she ever shuddered in his sight when he had acknowledged that the now odious woman had in that distant land been in his own hearing called by his own nameit would have been almost better her absolute faith added a sting to his sufferings  then as he walked alone about the estate he would endeavour to think whether there might not yet be some mode of escapewhether something might not be done to prevent his having to stand in the dock and abide the uncertain verdict of a jury with mr seely he was discontented mr seely seemed to be opposed to any great effortwould simply trust to the chance of snatching little advantages in the court he had money at command if fifty thousand poundsif double that sumwould have freed him from this trouble he thought that he could have raised it and was sure that he would willingly pay it twenty thousand pounds two months since when crinkett appeared at the christening would have sent these people away the same sum no doubt would send them away now but then the arrangement might have been possible but nowhow was it now could it still be done then the whole thing might have been hidden buried in darkness now it was already in the mouths of all men but still if these witnesses were made to disappearif this woman herself by whom the charge was made would take herself awaythen the trial must be abandoned there would be a whispering of evilor too probably the saying of evil without whispering a terrible injury would have been inflicted upon her and his boybut the injury would be less than that which he now feared  and there was present to him through all this a feeling that the money ought to be paid independently of the accusation brought against him had he known at first all that he knew nowhow he had taken their all from these people and how they had failed absolutely in the last great venture they had madehe would certainly have shared their loss with them he would have done all that crinkett had suggested to him when he and crinkett were walking along the dike crinkett had said that on receiving twenty thousand pounds he would have gone back to australia and would have taken a wife with him that offer had been quite intelligible and if carried out would have put an end to all trouble but he had mismanaged that interview he had been too proud too desirous not to seem to buy off a threatening enemy now as the trouble pressed itself more closely upon himupon him and his hesterhe would so willingly buy off his enemy if it were possible they ought to have the money he said to himself if only i could contrive that it should be paid to them  one day as he was entering the house by a side door darvell the gardener told him that there was a gentleman waiting to see him the gentleman was very anxious to see him and had begged to be allowed to sit down darvell when asked whether the gentleman was a gentleman expressed an affirmative opinion he had been driven over from cambridge in a hired gig which was now standing in the yard and was dressed as darvell expressed it quite accordingly and genteel so caldigate passed into the house and found the man seated in the diningroom  perhaps you will step into my study said caldigate thus the two men were seated together in the little room which caldigate used for his own purposes  caldigate as he looked at the man distrusted his gardeners judgment the coat and hat and gloves even the whiskers and head of hair might have belonged to a gentleman but not as he thought the mouth or the eyes or the hands and when the man began to speak there was a mixture of assurance and intended complaisance an effected familiarity and an attempt at ease which made the master of the house quite sure that his guest was not all that darvell had represented the man soon told his story his name was bollum richard bollum and he had connections with australiawas largely concerned in australian goldmines when caldigate heard this he looked round involuntarily to see whether the door was closed were tiled of course said bollum caldigate with a frown nodded his head and bollum went on he hadnt come there he said to speak of some recent troubles of which he had heard he wasnt the man to shove his nose into other peoples matters it was nothing to him who was married to whom caldigate shivered but sat and listened in silence but mr bollum had had dealingsmany dealingswith timothy crinkett indeed he was ready to say that timothy crinkett was his uncle he was not particularly proud of his uncle but nevertheless timothy crinkett was his uncle didnt mr caldigate think that something ought to be done for timothy crinkett  yes i do said caldigate finding himself compelled to say something at the moment and feeling that he could say so much with positive truth  then bollum continued his story showing that he knew all the circumstances of polyeuka it was hard on them wasnt it mr caldigate  i think it was  every rap they had among them mr caldigate you left them as bare as the palm of my hand  it was not my doing i simply made him an offer which every one at the time believed to be liberal  just so we grants all that but still you got all their moneyold pals of yours too as they say out there  it is a matter of most intense regret to me as soon as i knew the circumstances mr bollum i should have been most happy to have divided the loss with them  thats itthats it thats whatd be right between man and man said mr bollum interrupting him  had no other subject been introduced  i know nothing about other subjects i havent come here to meddle with other subjects im as it were a partner of crinketts any way i am acting as his agent im quite above board mr caldigate and in what i say i mean to stick to my own business and not go beyond it twenty thousand pounds is what we askso that we and you may share the loss you agree to that  i should have agreed to it two months since said caldigate fearing that he might be caught in a trapanxious to do nothing mean unfair or contrary to the lawcraving in his heart after the bold upright conduct of a thoroughly honourable english gentleman and yet desirous also to use if it might be used the instrumentality of this man  and why not now you see said bollum becoming a little more confidential how difficult it is for me to speak things aint altered youve got the money theyve lost the money there isnt any illwill mr caldigate as for crinkett hes a rough diamond of course what am i to say about the lady  i dont see that you need say anything  thats just it of course shes one of them thats all if there is to be money shell have her share hes an old fool and perhaps theyll make a match of it as he said this he winked at any rate theyll be off to australia together and what i propose is this mr caldigate then he paused  what do you propose  make the money payable in bills to their joint order at sydney they dont want to be wasting any more time here theyll start at once this is the 12th april isnt it tuesday the 12th caldigate assented the old goldfinder leaves plymouth this day week from this he was sure that bollum had heard all the story from euphemia smith herself or he would not have talked of the old goldfinder let them have the bills handed to them on board and theyll go let me have the duplicates here you can remit the money by july to your agentsto take up the bills when due just let me be with you when the order is given to your banker in london and everything will be done its as easy as kiss  caldigate sat silent turning it over in his own mind trying to determine what would be best here was another opportunity but it was one as to which he must come to a decision on the spur of the moment he must deal with the man now or never the twenty thousand pounds were nothing had there been no question about his wife he would have paid the money moved by that argument as to his old palsby the conviction that the result of his dealing with them had in truth been to leave them as bare as the palm of his hand they were welcome to the money and if by giving the money he could save his hester how great a thing it would be was it not his duty to make the attempt and yet there was in his bosom a strong aversion to have any secret dealing with such a man as thisto have any secret dealing in such a matter to buy off witnesses in order that his wifes name and his boys legitimacy might be halfonly halfestablished for even though these people should be made absolutely to vanish though the sea should swallow them all that had been said would be known and too probably believed for ever  and then too he was afraid if he did this thing alone without counsel would he not be putting himself into the hands of these wretches might he not be almost sure that when they had gotten his money they would turn upon him and demand more would not the payment of the money be evidence against him to any jury would it be possible to make judge or jury believe to make even a friend believe that in such an emergency he had paid away so large a sum of money because he had felt himself bound to do so by his conscience  well squire said bollum i think you see your way through it dont you  i dont regard the money in the least they would be welcome to the money  thats a great point anyway  but  ay but youre afraid they wouldnt go you come down to plymouth and dont put the bills into their hands or mine till the vessel is under weigh with them aboard then you and i will step into the boat and be back ashore when they know the moneys been deposited at a bank in london theyll trust you as far as that the goldfinder wont put back again when shes once off wont that make it square  i was thinking of something else  well yes theres that trial acoming on isnt there  these people have conspired together to tell the basest lie  i know nothing about that mr caldigate i havent got so much as an opinion people tell me that all the things look very strong on their side  liars sometimes are successful  you can be quit of themand pay no more than what you say you kind of owes i should have thought crinkett might have asked forty thousand but crinkett though hes roughi do own hes roughbut hes honest after a fashion crinkett wants to rob no man but he feels it hard when hes got the better of lies or no lies can you do better  i should like to see my lawyer first said caldigate almost panting in his anxiety  what lawyer i hate lawyers  mr seely my case is in his hands and i should have to tell him  tell him when you come back from plymouth and hold your peace till thats done no good can come of lawyers in such a matter as this you might as well tell the towncrier why should he want to put bread out of his own mouth and if there is a chance of hard words being said why should he hear them hell work for his money no doubt but what odds is it to him whether your lady is to be called mrs caldigate or miss bolton he wont have to go to prison his boy wont beyou know what this was terrible but yet it was all so true ill tell you what it is squire we cant make it lighter by talking about it all round i used to do a bit of hunting once and i never knew any good come of asking what there was the other side of the fence youve got to have it or youve got to leave it alone thats just where you are of course it isnt nice  i dont mind the money  just so but it isnt nice for a swell like you to have to hand it over to such a one as crinkett just as the ships starting and then to bolt ashore along with me the odds are it is all talked about lets own all that but then its not nice to have to hear a woman swear that shes your wife when youve got anotherspecially when shes got three men as can swear the same it aint nice for you to have me sitting here im well aware of that theres the choice of evils you know what that means im aputting it about as fair as a man can put anything its a pity you didnt stump up the money before but its not altogether quite too late yet  ill give you an answer tomorrow mr bollum  i must be in town tonight  i will be with you in london tomorrow if you will give me an address all that you have said is true but i cannot do this thing without thinking of it  youll come alone  yesalone  as a gentleman  on my word as a gentleman i will come alone  then bollum gave him an addressnot the place at which he resided but a certain coffeehouse in the city at which he was accustomed to make appointments and dont you see any lawyer said bollum shaking his finger you cant do any good that way it stands to reason that no lawyer would let you pay twenty thousand pounds to get out of any scrape he and you have different legs to stand upon then mr bollum went away and was driven back in his gig to the cambridge hotel  as soon as the front door was closed hester hurried down to her husband whom she found still in the hall he took her into his own room and told her everything that had passedeverything as accurately as he could and remember he said though i do not owe them money that i feel bound by my conscience to refund them so much i should do it now i know the circumstances if no charge had been brought against me  they have perjured themselves and have been so wicked  yes they have been very wicked  let them come and speak the truth and then let them have the money  they will not do that hester  prove them to be liars and then give it to them  my own girl i am thinking of you  and i of you shall it be said of you that you bought off those who had dared to say that your wife was not your wife i would not do that what if the people in the court should believe what they say  it would be bad for you then dearest  but i should still be your wife and baby would still be your own own honest boy i am sometimes unhappy but i am never afraid let the devil do his worst but never speak him fair i would scorn them till it is all over then if money be due to them let them have it as she said this she had drawn herself a little apart from hima little away from the arm which had been round her waist and was looking him full in the face never before even during the soft happiness of their bridal tour had she seemed to him to be so handsome  but her faith her courage and her beauty did not alter the circumstances of the case because she trusted him he was not the less afraid of the jury who would have to decide or of the judge who with stern eyes would probably find himself compelled to tell the jury that the evidence against the prisoner was overwhelming in choosing what might be best to be done on her account he could not allow himself to be guided by her spirit the possibility that the whole gang of them might be made to vanish was present to his mind nor could he satisfy himself that in doing as had been proposed to him he would be speaking the devil fair he would be paying money which he ought to pay and would perhaps be securing his wifes happiness  he had promised at any rate that he would see the man in london on the morrow and that he would see him alone but he had not promised not to speak on the subject to his attorney therefore after much thought he wrote to mr seely to make an appointment for the next morning and then told his wife that he would have to go to london on the following day  not to buy those men off she said  whatever is done will be done by the advice of my lawyer he said peevishly you may be sure that i am anxious enough to do the best when one has to trust to a lawyer one is bound to trust to him this seemed to be so true that hester could say nothing against it     chapter xxxix  restitution    he had still the whole night to think about itand throughout the whole night he was thinking about it he had fixed a late hour in the afternoon for his appointment in london so that he might have an hour or two in cambridge before he started by the midday train it was during his drive into the town that he at last made up his mind that he would not satisfy himself with discussing the matter with mr seely but that he would endeavour to explain it all to robert bolton no doubt robert bolton was now his enemy as were all the boltons but the brother could not but be anxious for his sisters name and his sisters happiness if a way out of all this misery could be seen it would be a way out of misery for the boltons as well as for the caldigates if only he could make the attorney believe that hester was in truth his wife still even yet there might be assistance on that side but he went to mr seely first the hour of his appointment requiring that it should be so  but mr seely was altogether opposed to any arrangement with mr bollum no good was ever done he said by buying off witnesses the thing itself is disreputable and would to a certainty be known to every one  i should not buy them off i regard the money as their own i will give crinkett the money and let him go or stay as he pleases when giving him the money i will tell him that he may do as he pleases  you would only throw your money away you would do much worse than throw it away their absence would not prevent the trial the boltons will take care of that  they cannot want to injure their own side mr seely  they want to punish you and to take her away they will take care that the trial shall go on and when it was proved as it would be proved that you had given these people a large sum of money and had so secured their absence do you think that the jury would refuse to believe their sworn depositions and whatever other evidence would remain the fact of your having paid them money would secure a verdict against you the thing would in my mind be so disreputable that i should have to throw up the case i could not defend you  it was clear to him that bollum had understood his own side of the question in deprecating any reference to an attorney the money should have been paid and the four witnesses sent away without a word to any oneif any attempt in that direction were made at all nevertheless he went to robert boltons office and succeeded in obtaining an interview with his wifes brother but here as with the other attorney he failed to make the man understand the state of his own mind he had failed in the same way even with his wife if it were fit that the money should be paid it could not be right that he should retain it because the people to whom it was due had told lies about him and if this could be explained to the jury surely the jury would not give a verdict against him on insufficient evidence simply because he had done his duty in paying the money  robert bolton listened to him with patience and without any quick expression of hot anger though before the interview was over he had used some very cruel words we should think ourselves bound to prevent their going if possible  of course i have no idea of going down to plymouth as the man proposed or of taking any steps to secure their absence  your money is your own and you can do what you like with it it certainly is not for me to advise you if you tell me that you are going to pay it i can only say that i shall look very sharp after them  why should you want to ruin your sister  you have ruined her that is our idea we desire now to rescue her as far as we can from further evil you have opposed us in every endeavour that we have made when in the performance of a manifest duty we endeavoured to separate you till after the trial you succeeded in thwarting us by your influence  i left it to her  had you been true and honest and upright you would have known that as long as there was a doubt she ought to have been away from you  i should have sent her away  certainly  so as to create a doubt in her mind so as to disturb her peace so as to make her think that i having been found out was willing to be rid of her it would have killed her  better so than this  and yet i am as truly her husband as you are the husband of your wife if you would only teach yourself to think that possible then you would feel differently  not as to a temporary separation  if you believed me you would said caldigate  but i do not believe you in a matter like this as you will come to me i must be plain i do not believe you i think that you have betrayed and seduced my sister looking at all the evidence and at your own confession i can come to no other conclusion i have discussed the matter with my brother who is a clear coolheaded most judicious man and he is of the same opinion in our own private court we have brought you in guiltyguilty of an offence against us all which necessarily makes us as bitter against you as one man can be against another you have destroyed our sister and now you come here and ask me my advice as to buying off witnesses  it is all untrue as there is a god above me i am her loyal loving husband i will buy off no witness  if i were you i would make no such attempt it will do no good i do not think that you have a chance of being acquittednot a chance and then how much worse it will be for hester when she finds herself still in your house  she will remain there  even she will feel that to be impossible your influence will then probably be removed and i presume that for a time you will have no home but we need not discuss that as you are here i should not do my duty were i not to assure you that as far as we are concernedhesters familynothing shall be spared either in trouble or money to insure the conviction and punishment of the man whom we believe to have brought upon us so terrible a disgrace  caldigate when he got out into the street felt that he was driven almost to despair at first he declared to himself most untruly that there was no one to believe himno not one then he remembered how faithful was his wife and as he did so in his misery he told himself that it might have been better for her had she been less faithful looking at it all as he now looked at it after hearing the words of that hard man he almost thought that it would have been so everybody told him that he would be condemned and if so what would be the fate of that poor young mother and her child it was very well for her to declare with her arms round his neck that even should he be dragged away to prison she would still be his true wife and that she would waitin sorrow indeed and mourning but still with patiencetill the cruel jailers and the harsh laws had restored him to her if the law declared him a bigamist she could not then be his wife the law must decidewhether rightly or wrongly still must decide and then how could they live together an evil done must be endured let it be ever so unendurable but against fresh evils a man may guard was it not his duty his manifest his chief duty to save her as far as she could be saved from further suffering and increased disgrace perhaps after all robert bolton was right when he told him that he ought to have allowed hester to remain at chesterton  whatever he might do when he got to london he felt it to be his duty to go up and keep his appointment with bollum and he brought with him from home securities and certificates for stock by which he knew that he could raise the sum named at a moments warning should he at last decide upon paying the money when he got into the train and when he got out of the train he was still in doubt those to whom he had gone for advice had been so hard to him that he felt himself compelled to put on one side all that they had said bollum had suggested in his graphic manner that a lawyer and his client stood upon different legs caldigate acknowledged to himself that bollum was right his own lawyer had been almost as hard to him as his brotherinlaw who was his declared enemy but what should he do as to precautions to be taken in reference to the departure of the gang all that was quite out of the question they should go to australia or stay behind as they pleased there should be no understanding that they were to goor even that they were to hold their tongues because the money was paid to them it should be fully explained to them that the two things were distinct then as he was taken to the inn at which he intended to sleep that night he made up his mind in the cab that he would pay the money to crinkett  he got to london just in time to reach the bank before it was closed and there made his arrangements he deposited his documents and securities and was assured that the necessary sum should be placed to his credit on the following day then he walked across a street or two in the city to the place indicated by bollum for the appointment it was at the jericho coffee house in levant courta silent secluded spot lying between lombard street and cornhill here he found himself ten minutes before the time and asking for a cup of coffee sat down at a table fixed to the ground in a little separate box the order was given to a young woman at a bar in the room then an ancient waiter hobbled up to him and explained that coffee was not quite ready in truth coffee was not often asked for at the jericho coffee house the house said the waiter was celebrated for its sherry would he take half a pint of sherry so he ordered the sherry which was afterwards drunk by bollum  bollum came punctual to the moment and seated himself at the table with goodhumoured alacrity well mr caldigate how is it to be i think you must have seen that what i have proposed will be for the best  i will tell you what i mean to do mr bollum said caldigate very gravely it cannot be said that i owe mr crinkett a shilling  certainly not but it comes very near owing doesnt it  so near that i mean to pay it  thats right  so near that i dont like to feel that i have got his money in my pocket as far as money goes i have been a fortunate man  wonderful said bollum enthusiastically  and as i was once in partnership with your uncle i do not like to think that i enriched myself by a bargain which impoverished him  it aint nice is itthat you should have it all and he nothing  feeling that very strongly continued caldigate merely shaking his head in token of displeasure at bollums interruption i have determined to repay mr crinkett an amount that seems to me to be fair he shall have back twenty thousand pounds  hes a lucky fellow and hell be off like a shotlike a shot  he and others have conspired to rob me of all my happiness thinking that they might so most probably get this money from me they have invented a wicked liea wicked damnable liea damnable lie they are miscreantsfoul miscreants  come come mr caldigate  foul miscreants but they shall have their money and you shall hear me tell them when i give it to themand they must both be here to take it from my handsthat i do not at all require their absence there is to be no bargain between us they are free to remain and swear their false oaths against me whether they go or whether they stay will be no affair of mine  theyll go of course mr caldigate  not at my instance i will take care that that shall be known they must both come and into their joint hands will i give the cheque and they must come prepared with a receipt declaring that they accept the money as restitution of the loss incurred by them in purchasing the polyeuka mine from me do you understand and i shall bring a witness with me to see them take the money bollum who was considerably depressed by his companions manner said that he did understand  i suppose i can have a private room here at noon tomorrow asked caldigate turning to the woman at the bar  when that was settled he assured bollum that a cheque for the amount should be placed in the joint hands of timothy crinkett and euphemia smith if he and they with him would be there at noon on the following day bollum in vain attempted to manage the payment without the personal interview but at last agreed that the man and the woman should be forthcoming  that night caldigate dined at his club one of the university clubs at which he had been elected just at the time of his marriage he had seldom been there but now walked into the dinnerroom resolving that he would not be ashamed to show himself he fancied that everybody looked at him and probably there were some present who knew that he was about to stand his trial for bigamy but he got his dinner and smoked his cigar and before the evening was over he had met an old college friend he was in want of a friend and explained his wants he told something of his immediate story and then asked the man to be present at the scene on the morrow  i must have a witness gray said he and you will do me a kindness if you will come then mr gray promised to be present on the occasion  on the following morning he met gray at the club having the cheque ready in his pocket and together they proceeded to levant court again he was a little before his time and the two sat together in the gloomy little room upstairs bollum was the first to come and when he saw the stranger was silentthinking whether it might not be best to escape and warn crinkett and the woman that all might not be safe but the stranger did not look like a detective and as he told himself why should there be danger so he waited and in a few minutes crinkett entered the room with the woman veiled  well caldigate said crinkett how is it with you  if you please mrs smith said caldigate i must ask you to remove your veilso that i may be sure that it is you  she removed her veil very slowly and then stood looking him in the facenot full in the face for she could not quite raise her eyes to meet his and though she made an effort to brazen it out she could not quite succeed she attempted to raise her head and carry herself with pride but every now and again there was a slight quiverslight but still visible the effort too was visible but there she stood looking at him and to be looked atbut without a word during the whole interview she never once opened her lips  she had lost all her comeliness it was now nearly seven years since they two had been on the goldfinder together and then he had found her very attractive there was no attraction now she was much aged and her face was coarse as though she had taken to drinking but there was still about her something of that look of intellect which had captivated him more perhaps than her beauty since those days she had become a slave to goldand such slavery is hardly compatible with good looks in a woman there she stoodready to listen to him ready to take his money but determined not to utter a word  then he took the cheque out of his pocket and holding it in his hand spoke to them as follows i have explained to mr bollum and have explained to my friend here mr gray the reasons which induce me to pay to you timothy crinkett and to you euphemia smith the large sum of twenty thousand pounds the nature of our transactions has been such that i feel bound in honour to repay so much of the price you paid for the polyeuka mine  all right caldigate all right said crinkett  and i have explained also to both of them that this payment has nothing whatever to do with the base false and most wicked charge which you are bringing against me it is not because that woman by a vile perjury claims me as her husband and because i wish to buy her silence or his that i make this restitution i restore the money of my own free will without any base bargain you can go on with your perjury or abstain from it as you may think best  we understand squire said crinkett affecting to laugh you hand over the moneythats all then the woman looked round at her companion and a frown came across her face but she said nothing turning her face again upon caldigate and endeavouring to keep her eyes steadfastly fixed upon him  have you brought a receipt signed by both of you then bollum handed him a receipt signed timothy crinkett for self and partners but caldigate demanded that the woman also should sign it  there is a difficulty about the name you see said bollum there was a difficulty about the name certainly it would not be fair he thought that he should force her to the use of a name she disowned and he did not wish to be hindered from what he was doing by her persistency in calling herself by his own name  so be it said he there is the cheque mr gray will see that i put it into both their hands this he did each of them stretching out a hand to take it and now you can go where you please and act as you please you have combined to rob me of all that i value most by the basest of lies but not on that account have i abstained from doing what i believe to be an act of justice then he left the room and paying for the use of it to the woman at the bar walked off with his friend gray leaving crinkett bollum and the woman still within the house     chapter xl  waiting for the trial    as he returned to cambridge caldigate was not altogether contented with himself he tried to persuade himself in reference to the money which he had refunded that in what he had done he had not at all been actuated by the charge made against him had there been no such accusation he would have felt himself bound to share the loss with these people as soon as he had learned the real circumstances the money had been a burden to him for the satisfaction of his own honour of his own feelings it had become necessary that the money should be refunded and the need of doing so was not lessened by the fact that a base conspiracy had been made by a gang of villains who had thought that the money might thus be most readily extracted from him that was his argument with himself and his defence for what he had done but nevertheless he was aware that he had been driven to do it nowto pay the money at this special momentby an undercurrent of hope that these enemies would think it best for themselves to go as soon as they had his money in their hands he wished to be honest he wished to be honourable he wished that all that he did could be what the world calls above board but still it was so essential for him and for his wife that they should go he had been very steady in assuring these wretched ones that they might go or stay as they pleased he had been careful that there should be a credible witness of his assurance he might succeed in making others believe that he had not attempted to purchase their absence but he could not make himself believe it  even though a jury should not convict him there was so much in his australian life which would not bear the searching light of crossexamination the same may probably be said of most of us in such trials as this that he was anticipating there is often a special cruelty in the exposure of matters which are for the most part happily kept in the background a man on some occasion inadvertently takes a little more wine than is good for him it is an accident most uncommon with him and nobody thinks much about it but chance brings the case to the notice of the police courts and the poor victim is published to the world as a drunkard in the columns of all the newspapers some young girl fancies herself in love and the man is unworthy the feeling passes away and none but herself and perhaps her mother are the wiser but if by some chance some treachery a letter should get printed and read the poor girls punishment is so severe that she is driven to wish herself in the grave  he had been foolish very foolish as we have seen on board the goldfinderand wicked too there could be no doubt about that when it would all come out in this dreaded trial he would be quite unable to defend himself there was enough to enable mrs bolton to point at him with a finger of scorn as a degraded sinner and yetyet there had been nothing which he had not dared to own to his wife in the secrecy of their mutual confidence and which in secret she had not been able to condone without a moments hesitation he had been in love with the womanin love after a fashion he had promised to marry her he had done worse than that and then when he had found that the passion for gold was strong upon her he had bought his freedom from her the story would be very bad as told in court and yet he had told it all to his wife she had admitted his excuse when he had spoken of the savageness of his life of the craving which a man would feel for some feminine society of her undoubted cleverness and then of her avarice and then when he swore that through it all he had still loved herher hester boltonwhom he had but once seen but whom having seen he had never allowed to pass out of his mind she still believed him and thought that the holiness of that love had purified him she believed himbut who else would believe him of course he was most anxious that those people should go  before he left london he wrote both to mr seely and to robert bolton saying what he had done the letter to his own attorney was long and full he gave an account in detail of the whole matter declaring that he would not allow himself to be hindered from paying a debt which he believed to be due by the wickedness of those to whom it was owing the two things have nothing to do with each other he said and if you choose to throw up my defence of course you can do so i cannot allow myself to be debarred from exercising my own judgment in another matter because you think that what i decide upon doing may not tally with your views as to my defence to robert bolton he was much shorter i think you ought to know what i have done he said at any rate i do not choose that you should be left in ignorance mr seely took no notice of the communication not feeling himself bound to carry out his threat by withdrawing his assistance from his client but robert and william bolton agreed to have crinketts movements watched by a detective policeman they were both determined that if possible crinkett and the woman should be kept in the country  in these days the old squire made many changes in his residence vacillating between his house in cambridge and the house at folking his books were at cambridge and he could not have them brought back and yet he felt that he ought to evince his constancy to his son his conviction of his sons innocence by remaining at folking and he was aware too that his presence there was a comfort both to his son and hester when john caldigate had gone up to london his father had been in cambridge but on his return he found the old squire at his old house yes he said telling the story of what he had just done i have paid twenty thousand pounds out of hand to those rascals simply because i thought i owed it to them the squire shook his head not being able to approve of the act i dont see why i should have allowed myself to be hindered from doing what i thought to be right because they were doing what they knew to be wrong  they wont go you know  i daresay not sir why should they  but the jury will believe that you intended to purchase their absence  i think i have made all that clear  i am afraid not john the man applied to you for the money and was refused that was the beginning of it then the application was repeated by the woman with a threat and you again refused then they present themselves to the magistrates and make the accusation and upon that you pay the money of course it will come out at the trial that you paid it immediately after this renewed application from bollum it would have been better to have defied them  i did defy them said john caldigate but all that his father said seemed to him to be true so that he repented himself of what he had done  he made no inquiry on the subject but early in may he heard from mr seely that crinkett and the woman were still in london and that they had abandoned the idea of going at once to australia according to mr seelys storyof the truth of which he declared himself to be by no means certaincrinkett had wished to go but had been retained by the woman as far as i can learn said mr seely she is in communication with the boltons who will of course keep her if it be possible he would get off if he could but she i take it has got hold of the money when you made the cheque payable to her order you effectually provided for their remaining here if he could have got the money without her name he would have gone and she would have gone with him  but that was not my object said caldigate angrily mr seely thereupon shrugged his shoulders early in june the man came back who had been sent out to sydney in february on behalf of caldigate he also had been commissioned to seek for evidence and to bring back with him almost at any cost whatever witness or witnesses he might find whose presence in england would serve caldigates cause but he brought no one and had learned very little he too had been at ahalala and at nobble at nobble the people were now very full of the subject and were very much divided in opinion there were crinketters and anticrinketters caldigatites and anticaldigatites a certain number of persons were ready to swear that there had been a marriage and an equal number perhaps to swear that there had been none but no new fact had been brought to light dick shand had not been foundwho had been living with caldigate when the marriage was supposed to have been solemnised nor had that register been discovered from which the copy of the certificate was supposed to have been taken all through the colonyso said this agenta very great interest was felt in the matter the newspapers from day to day contained paragraphs about it but nobody had appeared whom it was worth while to bring home mrs henniker of the hotel at nobble had offered to swear that there had been no marriage this offer she made and repeated when she had come to understand accurately on whose behalf this last agent had come to the colony but then before she had understood this she had offered to swear the reverse and it became known that she was very anxious to be carried back to the old country free of expense no credible witness could be found who had heard caldigate call the woman mrs smith after the date assigned to the marriage she no doubt had used various names had called herself sometimes mrs caldigate sometimes mrs smith but generally in such documents as she had to sign in reference to her mining shares euphemia cettini it was by that name that she had been known in sydney when performing on the stage and it was now alleged on her behalf that she had bought and sold shares in that name under the idea that she would thus best secure to herself their separate and undisturbed possession proof was brought home that caldigate himself had made over to her shares in that name but mr seely did not depend much on this as proof against the marriage  mr seely seemed to depend very little on anythingso little that caldigate almost wished that he had carried out his threat and thrown up the case does he not believe you when you tell him his wife asked caldigate was forced to confess that apparently the lawyer did not believe him in fact mr seely had even said as much in such cases a lawyer should never believe or disbelieve or if he does he should never speak of his belief it is with your acquittal or conviction that i am concerned in which matter i can better assist you by cool judgment than by any fervid assurance all this made caldigate not only angry but unhappy for he could not fail to perceive that the public around him were in the same mind as mr seely in his own parish they believed him but apparently not beyond his parish it might be possible that he should escapethat seemed to be the general opinion but then general opinion went on to declare that there was no reason for supposing that he had not married the woman merely because he said that he had not done so  then gradually there fell upon poor hesters mind a doubtand after that almost a conviction not a doubt as to her husbands truth no suspicion on that score ever troubled her for a moment but there came upon her a fear almost more than a fear that these terrible enemies would be strong enough to override the truth and to carry with them both a judge and a jury as the summer months ran on they all became aware that for any purpose of removing the witnesses the money had been paid in vain crinkett was living in all opulence at a hotel at brighton and the woman calling herself mrs caldigate had taken furnished apartments in london rumour came that she was frequently seen at the theatres and that she had appeared more than once in an open carriage in the parks there was no doubt but that caldigates money had made them very comfortable for the present the whole story of the money had been made public and of course there were various opinions about it the prevailing idea was that an attempt had been made to buy off the first wife but that the first wife had been clever enough to get the money without having to go caldigate was thought to have been very foolish on which subject bollum once expressed himself strongly to a friend clever he said caldigate clever the greatest idiot i ever came across in my life id made it quite straight for himso that there couldnt have been a wrinkle but he wouldnt have it there are men so soft that one cant understand em to do bollum justice it should be said that he was most anxious to induce his uncle and the woman to leave the country when they had got the money  though very miserable hester was very brave in the presence of her husband she would never allow herself to seem to doubt she would speak of their marriage as a thing so holy that nothing within the power of man could disturb it of course they were man and wife and of course the truth would at last prevail was not the lord able in his own good time to set all these matters right and in discussing the matter with him she would always seem to imply that the lords good time would be the time of the trial she would never herself hint to him that there might be a period of separation coming though in secrecy she was preparing for what might befall him turning over in her womans mind how she might best relieve the agony of his jail she let no sign escape her that she looked forward to such misery she let no such sign escape her in her intercourse with him but with his father she could speak more freely it had indeed come to be understood between her and the old squire that it would be best that they should discuss the matter openly arrangements must be made for their future life so that when the blow came they might not be unprepared hester declared that nothing but positive want of shelter should induce her to go back to chesterton they think him to be all thats bad she said i know him to be all thats good how is it possible that we should live together the old man had of course turned it over much in his mind if it could be true that that woman had in truth become his sons wife and that this dear sweet young mother had been deceived betrayed and cheated out of her very existence then that house at folking could be no proper home for her her grave would be best but till that might be reached any home would be better than folking but he was almost sure that it was not so and her confidenceold as he was and prone to be suspiciousmade him confident  when the moment came he could not doubt how he would answer her he could not crush her spirit by seeming for a moment to have a suspicion your home of course shall be here he said it shall be your own house  and you  it shall be my house too if it should come to that we will be at any rate together you shall not be left without a friend  it is not for myself she said but for his boy and for himwhat will be best for them i would take a cabin at the prisongate so as to be nearest to himif it were only myself and so it was settled between them that should that great misery fall upon them she would remain at folking and he would remain with her nothing that judge or jury could do would deprive her of the right to occupy her husbands house  in this way the months of may and june and the first fortnight of july wore themselves away and then the time for the trial had come up to the last it had been hoped that tidings might be heard either by letter or telegram from dick shand but it seemed that he had vanished from the face of the earth no suggestion of news as to his whereabouts was received on which it might have been possible to found an argument for the further postponement of the trial mr seely had been anxious for such postponementperhaps thinking that as the hotel at brighton and the carriages in the park were expensive crinkett and the lady might take their departure for australia without saying a word to the lawyer who had undertaken the prosecution but there was no adequate ground for delay and on tuesday the 17th july the trial was to be commenced on the previous day caldigate at his own request was introduced to sir john joram who had been brought down special to cambridge for his defence mr seely had advised him not to see the barrister who was to defend him leaving it however quite at his option to do so or not as he pleased sir john will see you but i think he had rather not said mr seely but caldigate had chosen to have the interview i have thought it best to say just one word to you said caldigate  i am quite at your service said sir john  i want you to hear from my own lips that a falser charge than this was never made against a man  i am glad to hear it said sir johnand then he paused that is to say mr caldigate i am bound in courtesy to you to make some such civil reply as i should have made had i not been employed in your case and had circumstances then induced you to make such a statement to me but in truth as i am so employed no statement from your lips ought to affect me in the least for your own sake i will say that no statement will affect me it is not for me to believe or disbelieve anything in this matter if carried away by my feelings i were to appeal to the jury for their sympathy because of my belief i should betray your cause it will be my duty not to make the jury believe you who in your position will not be expected even to tell the truth but to induce them if possible to disbelieve the witnesses against you who will be on their oath secondhand protestations from an advocate are never of much avail and in many cases have been prejudicial i can only assure you that i understand the importance of the interests confided to me and that i will endeavour to be true to my trust  caldigate who wanted sympathy who wanted an assurance of confidence in his word was by no means contented with his counsellor but he was too wise at the present moment to quarrel with him      chapter xli  the first day    then came the morning on which caldigate and hester must part very little had been said about it but a word or two had been absolutely necessary the trial would probably take two days and it would not be well that he should be brought back to folking for the sad intervening night and thenshould the verdict be given against him the prison doors would be closed against her his wife more rigidly than against any other friend who might knock at them inquiring after his welfare her at any rate he would not be allowed to see all the prison authorities would be bound to regard her as the victim of his crime and as the instrument of his vice the law would have locked him up to avenge her injuriesof her whose only future joy could come from that distant freedom which the fraudulent law would at length allow to him all this was not put into words between them but it was understood it might be that they were to be parted now for a term of years during which she would be as a widow at folking while he would be alone in his jail  there are moments as to which it would be so much better that their coming should never be accomplished it would have been better for them both had they been separated without that last embrace he was to start from folking at eight that he might surrender himself to the hands of justice in due time for the trial at ten she did not come down with him to the breakfast parlour having been requested by him not to be there among the servants when he took his departure but standing there in her own room with his baby in her arms she spoke her last word you will keep up your courage john  i will try hester  i will keep up mine i will never fail for your sake and hishere she held the child a moment away from her bosomi will never allow myself to droop to be your wife and his mother shall be enough to support me even though you should be torn from both of us for a time  i wish i were as brave as you he said  you will leave me here she continued mistress of your house and if god spares me here you will find me they cant move me from this your father says so they may call me what they will but they cannot move me there is the lord above us and before him they cannot make me other than your wifeyour wifeyour wife as she repeated the name she put the boy out to him and when he had taken the child she stretched out her hands upwards and falling on her knees at his feet prayed to god for his deliverance let him come back to us o my god deliver him from his enemies and let him come back to us  one kiss my own he said as he raised her from the ground  oh yesand a thousand shall be in store for you when you come back to us yes kiss him too your boy shall hear the praises of his father every day till at last he shall understand that he may be proud of you even though he should have learned why it is that you are not with him now go my darling go and support yourself by remembering that i have got that within me which will support me then he left her  the old squire had expressed his intention of being present throughout the trial and now was ready for the journey when counselled to remain at home both by mr seely and by his son he had declared that only by his presence could he make the world around him understand how confident he was of his sons innocence so it was arranged and a place was kept for him next to the attorney the servants all came out into the hall and shook hands with their young master and the cook wiping her eyes with her apron declared that she would have dinner ready for him on the following day at the front door mr holt was standing having come over the ferry to greet the young squire before his departure they may say what they will there squire but they wont make none of us here believe that youve been the man to injure a lady such as she up there then there was another shaking of hands and the father and son got into the carriage  the court was full of course mr justice bramber by whom the case was to be tried was reputed to be an excellent judge a man of no softnessesable to wear the black cap without convulsive throbbings anxious also that the law should run its courseaverse to mercy when guilt had been proved but as clearsighted and as just as minos a man whom nothing could turn one way or anotherwho could hang his friend but who would certainly not mulct his enemy because he was his enemy it had reached caldigates ears that he was unfortunate in his judge by which they who had so said had intended to imply that this judges mind would not be perverted by any sentiments as to the prisoner as to the sweet young woman who called herself his wife at home or as to want of sweetness on the part of the other woman who claimed him  the jury was sworn in without more than ordinary delay and then the trial was commenced that which had to be done for the prosecution seemed to be simple enough the first witness called was the woman herself who was summoned in the names of euphemia caldigate alias smith she gave her evidence very clearly and with great composuresaying how she had become acquainted with the man on board the ship how she had been engaged to him at melbourne how he had come down to her at sydney how in compliance with his orders she had followed him up to ahalala and how she had there been married to him by mr allan then she brought forth the documents which professed to be the copy of the register of the marriage made by the minister in his own book and the envelopethe damning envelopewhich caldigate was prepared to admit that he had himself addressed to mrs caldigate and the letter which purported to have been written by the minister to caldigate recommending him to be married in some better established township than that existing at ahalala she did it well she was very correct and at the same time very determined giving many details of her early theatrical life which it was thought better to get from her in the comparative ease of a direct examination than to have them extracted afterwards by an adverse advocate during her evidence in chief which was necessarily long she seemed to be quite at ease but those around her observed that she never once turned her eyes upon him whom she claimed as her husband except when she was asked whether the man there before her was the man she had married at ahalala then looking at him for a moment in silence she replied very steadily yes that is my husband john caldigate  to caldigate and his friendsand indeed to all those collected in the courtthe most interesting person of the day was sir john joram in a sensational cause the leading barrister for the defence is always the hero of the plotthe actor from whom the best bit of acting is expectedthe person who is most likely to become a personage on the occasion the prisoners are necessarily mute and can only be looked at not heard the judge is not expected to do much till the time comes for his charge and even then is supposed to lower the dignity of the bench if he makes his charge with any view to effect on his own behalf the barrister who prosecutes should be tame or he will appear to be vindictive the witnesses however interesting they may be in detail are but episodes each comes and goes and there is an end of them but the part of the defending advocate requires action through the whole of the piece and he may be impassioned he is bound to be on the alert everything seems to depend on him they who accuse can have or should have no longing for the condemnation of the accused one but in regard to the other an acquittal is a matter of personal prowess of professional triumph and possibly of well simulated feeling  sir john joram was at this time a man of considerable dignity above fifty years of age having already served the offices of solicitor and attorneygeneral to his party to his compeers and intimate friends it seemed to be but the other day since he was jacky joram one of the jolliest little fellows ever known at an evening party up to every kind of fun always rather short of money and one of whom it was thought that because he was goodlooking he might some day achieve the success of marrying a woman with money on a sudden he married a girl without a shilling and men shook their heads and sighed as they spoke of poor jacky joram but again on a suddenquite as suddenlythere came tidings that jacky had been found out by the attorneys and that he was earning his bread as we grow old things seem to come so quickly his friends had hardly realised the fact that jacky was earning his bread before he was in parliament and had ceased to be jacky and the celerity with which he became sir john was the most astonishing of all years no doubt had passed by but years at fifty are no more than months at thirtyare less than weeks in boyhood and now while some tongues by dint of sheer habit were still forming themselves into jacky sir john joram had become the leading advocate of the day and a man renowned for the dignity of his manners  in the housefor he had quite got the ear of the housea certain impressive good sense a habit of saying nothing that was not necessary to the occasion had chiefly made for him the high character he enjoyed but in the law courts it was perhaps his complaisance his peculiar courtesy of which they who praised him talked the most his aptitude to get verdicts was of course the cause of his success but it was observed of him that in perverting the course of justicewhich may be said to be the special work of a successful advocatehe never condescended to bully anybody to his own witnesses he was simple and courteous as are barristers generally but to adverse witnesses he was more courteous though no doubt less simple even to some perjured comrade of an habitual burglar he would be studiously civil but to a woman such as euphemia caldigate alias smith it was certain that he would be so smooth as to make her feel almost pleased with the amenities of her position  he asked her very many questions offering to provide her with the comfort of a seat if it were necessary she said that she was not at all tired and that she preferred to stand as to the absolute fact of the marriage she did not hesitate at all she was married in the tent at ahalala in the presence of crinkett and adamson and of her own female companion anna youngall of whom were there to give evidence of the fact whether any one else was in the tent she could not say but she knew that there were others at the entrance the tent was hardly large enough for more than five or six dick shand had not been there because he had always been her enemy and had tried to prevent the marriage and she was quite clear about the letter there was a great deal said about the letter she was sure that the envelope with the letter had come to her at ahalala by post from sydney when her husband was at the latter place the sydney postmark with the date was very plain there was much said as to the accuracy and clearness of the sydney postmark and something as to the absence of any postmark at nobble she could not account for the absence of the nobble postmark she was aware that letters were stamped at nobble generally mr allan she said had himself handed to her the copy of the register almost immediately after the marriage but she could not say by whom it had been copied the letter purporting to be from mr allan to her husband was no doubt she said in the ministers handwriting caldigate had showed it to her before their marriage and she had kept it without any opposition from him then she was asked as to her residence after her marriage and here she was less clear she had lived with him first at ahalala and then at nobble but she could not say for how long it had been off and on there had been quarrels and after a time they had agreed to part she had received from him a certain amount of mining shares and of money and had undertaken in return never to bother him any more there was a great deal said about times and dates which left an impression upon those around her in the court that she was less sure of her facts than a woman in such circumstances naturally would have been  then sir john produced the letter which she had written to caldigate and in which she had distinctly offered to marry crinkett if the money demanded were paid she must have expected the production of this letter but still for a few moments it silenced her yes she said at last i wrote it  and the money you demanded has been paid  yes it has been paid but not then it was not paid till we came over  but if it had been paid then you would havemarried mr crinkett sir johns manner as he asked the question was so gentle and so soft that it was felt by all to contain an apology for intruding on so delicate a subject but when she hesitated he did after a pause renew his inquiry in another form perhaps this was only a threat and you had no purpose of carrying it out  then she plucked up her courage i have not married him she said  but did you intend it  i did what were the laws to me out there he had left me and had taken another wife i had to do the best for myself i did intend it but i didnt do it a woman cant be tried for her intentions  no said sir john but she may be judged by her intentions  then she was asked why she had not gone when she had got the money according to her promise he defied us she said and called us bad namesliars and perjurers he knew that we were not liars and then we were watched and told that we might not go as he said that he was indifferent i was willing enough to stay and see it out  you cannot give us he asked againand this was his last questionany clearer record of those months which you lived with your husband  no she said i cannot i kept no journal then she was allowed to go and though she had been under examination for three hours it was thought she had escaped easily  crinkett was the next who swore that he had been caldigates partner in sundry mining speculationsthat they had been in every way intimatethat he had always recommended caldigate to marry mrs smith thinking as he said that respectability paid in the long runand that having so advised him he had become caldigates special friend at the time to the exclusion of dick shand who was generally drunk and who whether drunk or sober was opposed to the marriage he had been selected to stand by his friend at the marriage and he thinking that another witness would be beneficial had taken adamson with him his only wonder was that any one should dispute a fact which was at the time so notorious both at ahalala and at nobble he held his head high during his evidence in chief and more than once called the prisoner caldigatecaldigate knew thisand caldigate did that it was past four when he was handed over for crossexamination but when it was said that another hour would suffice for it the judge agreed to sit for that other hour  but it was nearly two hours before the gentleman who was with sir john had finished his work during which mr crinkett seemed to suffer much the gentleman was by no means so complacent as sir john and asked some very disagreeable questions had crinkett intended to commit bigamy by marrying the last witness knowing at the time that she was a married woman i never said that i intended to marry her said crinkett what she wrote to caldigate was nothing to me he could not be made to own as she had done in a straightforward way that he had intended to set the law at defiance his courage failed him and his presence of mind and he was made to declare at last that he had only talked about such a marriage with the view of keeping the woman in good humour but that he had never intended to marry her then he was asked as to bollumhad he told bollum that he intended to marry the woman at last he owned that he might have done so of course he had been anxious to get his money and he had thought that he might best do so by such an offer he was reduced to much misery during his crossexamination but on the one main statement that he had been present at the marriage he was not shaken  at six oclock the trial was adjourned till the next day and the two caldigates were taken in a fly to a neighbouring inn at which rooms had been provided for them here they were soon joined by mr seely who explained however that he had come merely to make arrangements for the morrow how is it going asked caldigate  the question was very natural but it was one which mr seely was not disposed to answer i couldnt give an opinion he said in such cases i never do give an opinion the evidence is very clear and has not been shaken but the witnesses are people of a bad character character goes a long way with a jury it will depend a good deal on the judge i should say but i cannot give an opinion  no opinion one way or the other was expressed to the father or sonwho indeed saw no one else the whole evening but robert bolton in discussing the matter with his father expressed a strong conviction that caldigate would be acquitted he had heard it all and understood the nature of such cases i do not in the least doubt that they were married said robert bolton all the circumstances make me sure of it but the witnesses are just of that kind which a jury always distrusts the jury will acquit him not because they do not believe the marriage but out of enmity to crinkett and the woman  what shall we do then asked the old man to this robert bolton could make no answer he only shook his head and turned away     chapter xlii  the second day    the court had been very full on the first day of the trial but on the following morning it was even more crowded so that outsiders who had no friend connected with justice had hardly a chance of hearing or seeing anything many of the circumstances of the case had long been known to the public but matters of new and of peculiar interest had been elicitedthe distinct promise made by the woman to marry another man so as to render her existing husband safe in his bigamy by committing bigamy herselfthe payment to these people by caldigate of an immense sum of moneythe fact that they two had lived together in australia whether married or notall this which had now been acknowledged on both sides added to the romance of the occasion while it could hardly be doubted on the one side that caldigate had married the womanso strong was the evidenceit could not be at all doubted on the other side that the accusation had been planned with the view of raising money and had been the result of a base conspiracy and then there was the additional marvel that though the money had been paidthe whole sum demandedyet the trial was carried on the general feeling was exactly that which robert bolton had attributed to the jury people did believe that there had been a marriage but trusted nevertheless that caldigate might be acquittedso that his recent marriage might be established no doubt there was a feeling with many that anything done in the wilds of australia ought not to count here at home in england  caldigate with his father was in court a little before ten and at that hour punctually the trial was recommenced the first business was the examination of adamson who was quite clear as to the marriage he had been concerned with crinkett in money operations for many years and had been asked by him to be present simply as a witness he had never been particularly intimate with caldigate and had had little or nothing to do with him afterwards he was crossexamined by the second gentleman but was not subjected to much annoyance he had put what little money he possessed into the polyeuka mine and had come over to england because he had thought that by so doing he might perhaps get a portion of his money back had there been a conspiracy and was he one of the conspirators well he rather thought that there had been a conspiracy and that he was one of the conspirators but then he had only conspired to get what he thought to be his own he had lost everything in the polyeuka mine and as the gentleman no doubt had married the lady he thought he might as well come forwardand that perhaps in that way he would get his money he did not mind saying that he had received a couple of thousand pounds which was half what he had put into polyeuka he hoped that after paying all his expenses he would be able to start again at the diggings with something above a thousand this was all straight sailing the purpose which he had in view was so manifest that it had hardly been worth while to ask him the questions  anna young was the next and she encountered the sweet courtesies of sir john joram these sweet courtesies were prolonged for above an hour and were not apparently very sweet to miss young of the witnesses hitherto examined she was the worst she had been flippantly confident in her memories of the marriage ceremony when questioned on behalf of the prosecution but had forgotten everything in reference to her friends subsequent married life she had forgotten even her own life and did not quite know where she had lived and at last she positively refused to answer questions though they were asked with the most engaging civility she said that of course a lady had affairs which she could not tell to everybody no she didnt mean loversshe didnt care for the men at all yes she did mean money she had done a little mining and hoped to do a little more she was to have a thousand pounds and her expenses but she hadnt got the money yetand so on probably of all the witnesses yet examined miss young had amused the court the most  there were many others no doubt necessary for the case but hardly necessary for the telling of the story captain munday was there the captain of the goldfinder who spoke of caldigates conduct on board and of his own belief that they two were engaged when they left the ship as we are prepared to acknowledge that there was an engagement i do not think that we need trouble you captain munday said sir john we only deny the marriage then the cheque for twenty thousand pounds was produced and clerks from the bank to prove the payment and the old waiter from the jericho coffeehouseand others of whom sir john joram refused to take any notice whatever all that had been acknowledged of course the money had been paid of course the intimacy had existed no doubt there had been those interviews both at folking and up in london but had there ever been a marriage in that tent at ahalala that and that only was the point to which sir john joram found it necessary to give attention  a slight interval was allowed for lunch and then sir john rose to begin his speech it was felt on all sides that his speech was to be the great affair of the trial would he be able so to represent these witnesses as to make a jury believe that they had sworn falsely and that the undoubted and acknowledged conspiracy to raise money had been concocted without any basis of truth there was a quarter of an hour during which the father remained with his son in the precincts of the prison and then the judge and the lawyers and all they whose places were assured to them trooped back into court they who were less privileged had fed themselves with pocketed sandwiches not caring to risk the loss of their seats  sir john joram began by holding extended in his fingers towards the jury the envelope which had undoubtedly been addressed by caldigate to mrs caldigate ahalala nobble and in which a certain letter had been stated to have been sent by him to her the words written on that envelope said he are to my mind the strongest evidence i have ever met of the folly to which a man may be reduced by the softness of feminine intercourse i acknowledge on the part of my client that he wrote these words i acknowledge that if a man could make a woman his wife by so describing her on a morsel of paper this man would have made this woman his wife i acknowledge so much though i do not acknowledge though i deny that any letter was ever sent to this woman in the envelope which i hold in my hand his own story is that he wrote those words at a moment of soft and foolish confidence when they two together were talking of a future marriagea marriage which no doubt was contemplated and which probably had been promised then he wrote the address showing the woman the name which would be hers should they ever be marriedand she has craftily kept the document that is his story that is my story now i must show you why i think it also should be your story the womani must describe her in this way lest i should do her an injustice by calling her mrs smith or do my client an injustice by calling her mrs caldigatehas told you that this envelope with an enclosure which she produced reached her at nobble through the post from sydney to that statement i call upon you to give no credit a letter so sent would as you have been informed bear two postmarks those of sydney and of nobble this envelope bears one only but that is not all i shall call before you two gentlemen experienced in affairs of the postoffice and they will tell you that the postmarks on this envelope both that of the town sydney and that by which the postage stamp is obliterated are cleaner finer and better perceived than they would have been had it passed in ordinary course through the postoffice letters in the postoffice are hurried quickly through the operation of stamping so that one passing over the other while the stamping ink is still moist will to some extent blot and blur that with which it has come in contact he will produce some dozens taken at random and will show that with them all such has been the case this blotting this smudging is very slight but it exists it is always there he will tell you that this envelope has been stamped as one and aloneby itselfwith peculiar careand i shall ask you to believe that the impression has been procured by fraud in the sydney postoffice if that be so if in such a case as this fraud be once discovered then i say that the whole case will fall to the ground and that i shall be justified in telling you that no word that you have heard from these four witnesses is worthy of belief  nothing worthy of belief has been adduced against my client unless that envelope be so that those four persons have conspired together for the sake of getting money is clear enough to their evidence i shall come presently and shall endeavour to show you why you should discredit them at present i am concerned simply with this envelope on which i think that the case hangs as for the copy of the register it is nothing it would be odd indeed if in any conspiracy so much as that could not be brought up had such a register been found in the archives of any church however humble and had an attested copy been produced that would have been much but this is nothing nor is the alleged letter from mr allan anything were the letter genuine it would show that such a marriage had been contemplated not that it had been solemnised we have however no evidence to make us believe that the letter is genuine but this envelopeand he again stretched it out towards the juryis evidence the impression of a postoffice stamp has often been accepted as evidence but the evidence may be false evidence and it is for us to see whether it may not probably be so now  in the first place such evidence requires peculiar sifting which unfortunately cannot be applied to it in the present case because it has been brought to us from a great distance had the envelope been in our possession from the moment in which the accusation was first made we might have tested it either by sending it to sydney or by obtaining from sydney other letters or documents bearing the same stamp affixed undoubtedly on the date here represented but that has not been within our power the gentlemen whom i shall bring before you will tell you that these impressions or stamps have a knack of verifying themselves which makes it very dangerous indeed for fraudulent persons to tamper with them a stamp used in june will be hardly the same as it will be in july some little bruise will have so altered a portion of the surface as to enable detection to be made with a microscope and the stamp used in 1870 will certainly have varied its form in 1871 now i maintain that time and opportunity should have been given to us to verify this impression copies of all impressions from day to day are kept in the sydney postoffice and if it be found that on this day named the 10th of may no impression in the sydney office is an exact facsimile of this impression then i say that this impression has been subsequently and fraudulently obtained and that the only morsel of corroborative evidence offered to you will be shown to be false evidence we have been unable to get impressions of this date opportunities have not been given to us but i do not hesitate to tell you that you should demand such opportunities before you accept that envelope as evidence on which you can send my client to jail and deprive that young wife whom he has made his own of her husband and afford the damning evidence of your verdict towards robbing his son of his legitimacy  he said very much more about the envelope clearly showing his own appreciation of its importance and declaring again and again that if he could show that a stain of perjury affected the evidence in any one point all the evidence must fall to the ground and that if there were ground to suspect that the envelope had been tampered with then that stain of perjury would exist after that he went on to the four conspirators as he called them justifying the name by their acknowledged object of getting money from his client that they came to this country as conspirators with a fraudulent purpose my learned friend will not deny  i acknowledge nothing of the kind said the learned friend  then my learned friend must feel that his is a case in which he cannot safely acknowledge anything i do not doubt gentlemen but that you have made up your mind on that point he went on to show that they clearly were conspiratorsthat they had confessed as much themselves it is no doubt possible that my client may have married this female conspirator and she is not the less entitled to protection from the law because she is a conspirator nor because she is a conspirator should he be less amenable to the law for the terrible injury he would then have done to that other lady but if they be conspiratorsif it be shown to you that they came to this countrynot that the woman might claim her husband not that the others might give honest testimony against a great delinquentbut in order that they might frighten him out of money then i am entitled to tell you that you should not rest on their evidence unless it be supported and that the fact of their conspiracy gives you a right nay makes it your imperative duty to suspect perjury  the remainder of the day was taken up with sir johns speech and with the witnesses which he called for the defence he certainly succeeded in strengthening the compassion which was felt for caldigate and for the unfortunate young mother at folking it was very well he said for my learned friend to tell you of the protection which is due to a married woman when a husband has broken the law and betrayed his trust by taking another wife to himself as this man is accused of having done but there is another aspect in which you will regard the question think of that second wife and of her child and of the protection which is due to her you well know that she does not suspect her husband that she fears nothing but a mistaken verdict from youthat she will be satisfied much more than satisfied if you will leave her in possession of her home her husband and the unalloyed domestic happiness she has enjoyed since she joined her lot with his look at the one woman and then at the other remember their motives their different lives their different joys and what will be the effect of your verdict upon each of them if you are satisfied that he did marry that woman that vile woman the nature of whose life has been sufficiently exposed to you of course your verdict must be against him the law is the law and must be vindicated in that case it will be your duty your terrible duty to create misery to destroy happiness to ruin a dear innocent young mother and her child and to separate a loving couple every detail of whose life is such as to demand your sympathy and this you must do at the bidding of four greedy foul conspirators innocent sweet excellent in all feminine graces as is the one wifeunlovely unfeminine and abhorrent as is the otheryou must do your duty god forbid that i should ask you to break an oath even for the sake of that young mother but in such a case i do think i may ask you to be very careful as to what evidence you accept i do think that i may again point out to you that those four witnesses bound as they are together by a bond of avarice should be regarded but as oneand as one to whose sworn evidence no credit is due unless it be amply corroborated i say that there is no corroboration this envelope would be strong corroboration if it had been itself trustworthy when he sat down the feeling in court was certainly in favour of john caldigate  then a cloud of witnesses were brought up for the defence each of whom however was soon despatched the two clerks from the postoffice gave exactly the evidence which sir john had described and exposed to the jury their packet of old letters in their opinion the impression on the envelope was finer and cleaner than that generally produced in the course of business each of them thought it not improbable that the impression had been surreptitiously obtained but each of them acknowledged on crossexamination that a stamp so clean and perfect might be given and maintained without special care and each of them said that it was quite possible that a letter passing through the postoffice might escape the stamp of one of the offices in which it would be manipulated  then there came the witnesses as to character and evidence was given as to hesters determination to remain with the man whom she believed to be her husband as to this there was no crossexamination that caldigates life had been useful and salutary since his return to folking no one doubtednor that he had been a loving husband if he had committed bigamy it was no doubt for the public welfare that such a crime should be exposed and punished but that he should have been a bigamist would be a pityoh such a pity the pity of it oh the pity of it for now there had been much talk of hester and her home at folking and her former home at chesterton and people everywhere concerned themselves for her peace for her happiness for her condition of life     chapter xliii  the last day    after sir john jorams speech and when the work of the second day had been brought to a close caldigate allowed his hopes to rise higher than they had ever mounted since he had first become aware that the accusation would in truth be brought against him it seemed to be almost impossible that any jury should give a verdict in opposition to arguments so convincing as those sir john had used all those details which had appeared to himself to be so damning to his own cause now melted away and seemed to be of no avail and even mr seely when he came to see his client in the evening was less oppressive than usual he did not indeed venture to express hope but in his hopelessness he was somewhat more hopeful than before you must remember mr caldigate he said that you have not yet heard the judge and that with such a jury the judge will go much further than any advocate i never knew a cambridgeshire jury refuse to be led by judge bramber  why a cambridgeshire jury asked old mr caldigate and why judge bramber especially  we are a little timid i think here in the eastern countiesa little wanting in selfconfidence an advocate in the north of england has a finer scope because the people like to move counter to authority a lancashire jury will generally be unwilling to do what a judge tells them and then judge bramber has a peculiar way of telling a jury if he has a strong opinion of his own he never leaves the jury in doubt about it some judges arewhat i call flabby mr caldigate they are a little afraid of responsibility and leave the jury and the counsel to fight it out among them sir john did it very well no doubtvery well he made the best he could of that postage stamp though i dont know that it will go for much the point most in our favour is that those australians are a rough lot to look at the woman has been drinking and has lost her good looksso that the jurymen wont be soft about her caldigate when he heard this thought of euphemia smith on board the goldfinder when she certainly did not drink when her personal appearance was certainly such as might touch the heart of any juryman gold and drink together had so changed the woman that he could hardly persuade himself that she was that forlorn attractive female whom he had once so nearly loved  before he went to bed caldigate wrote to his wife as he had done also on the preceding evening there is to be another long tedious terrible day and then it may be that i shall be able to write no more for your sake almost more than for my own i am longing for it to be over it would be vain for me to attempt to tell you all that took place i do not dare to give you hope which i know may be fallacious and yet i feel my own heart somewhat higher than it was when i wrote last night then he did tell her something of what had taken place speaking in high praise of sir john joram and now my own own wife my real wife my beloved one i have to call you so perhaps for the last time for years if these men shall choose to think that i married that woman we shall have to be so parted that it would be better for us to be in our graves but even then i will not give up all hope my father has promised that the whole colony shall be ransacked till proof be found of the truth and then though i shall have been convicted i shall be reinstated in my position as your husband may god almighty bless you and our boy till i may come again to claim my wife and my child without disgrace  the old man had made the promise i would go myself said he were it not that hester will want my support here for there had been another promise madethat by no entreaty no guile no force should hester be taken from folking to chesterton  early on the third day judge bramber began his charge and in doing so he told the jury that it would occupy him about three hours and in exactly three hours time he had completed his task in summing up the case he certainly was not flabbyso little so that he left no doubt on the minds of any who heard him of the verdict at which he had himself arrived he went through the evidence of the four chief witnesses very carefully and then said that the antecedents of these people or even their guilt if they had been guilty had nothing to do with the case except in so far as it might affect the opinion of the jury as to their veracity they had been called conspirators even though they had conspired to raise money by threats than which nothing could be more abominableeven though by doing so they should have subjected themselves to criminal proceedings and to many penaltiesthat would not lessen the criminality of the accused if such a marriage as that described had in truth taken place this said the judge is so much a matter of course that i should not insist upon it had it not been implied that the testimony of these four persons is worth nothing because they are conspirators it is for you to judge what their testimony is worth and it is for you to remember that they are four distinct witnesses all swearing to the same thing then he went into the question of the money there could be no doubt that the four persons had come to england with the purpose of getting money out of the accused and that they had succeeded with their mode of doing thiswhether criminal or innocentthe jury had nothing to do except as it affected their credit but they were bound to look to caldigates motive in paying so large a sum it had been shown that he did not owe them a shilling and that when the application for money reached him from australia he had refused to give them a shilling then when they had arrived here in england accusation was made and when they had offered to desert the case if paid the money then the money was paid the prisoner when paying it had no doubt intimated to those who received it that he made no bargain with them as to their going away and he had taken a friend with him who had given his evidence in court and this friend had manifestly been taken to show that the money was not secretly paid the jury would give the prisoner the benefit of all thatif there was benefit to be derived from it but they were bound to remember in coming to their verdict that a very large sum of money had been paid to the witnesses by the prisoner which money certainly was not due to them  he dwelt also at great length on the stamp on the envelope but contrived at last to leave a feeling on the minds of those who heard him that sir john had shown the weakness of his case by trusting so much to such allegations as he had made it has been represented said judge bramber that the impression which you have seen of the sydney postoffice stamp has been fraudulently obtained some stronger evidence should i think be shown of this before you believe it two clerks from the london postoffice have told you that they believed the impression to be a false one but i think they were hardly justified in their opinion they founded it on the clearness and cleanness of the impression but they both of them acknowledged afterwards that such clearness and cleanness is simply unusual and by no means impossiblenot indeed improbable but how would it have been if the envelope had been brought to you without any postoffice impression simply directed to mrs caldigate by the man who is alleged to have made the woman his wife shortly before the envelope was written would it not in that case have been strong evidence if any fraud were provedsuch a fraud as would be that of getting some postoffice official falsely to stamp the envelopethen the stain of perjury would be there but it will be for you to consider whether you can find such stain of perjury merely because the impression on the envelope is clear and clean  when he came to the present condition of caldigates wife and child at folking he was very tender in his speechbut even his tenderness seemed to turn itself against the accused  of that poor lady i can only speak with that unfeigned respect which i am sure you all feel that she was happy in her marriage till this accusation reached her ears no one can doubt that he to whom she was given in marriage has done his duty by her treating her with full affection and confidence has been proved to us who can think that such a condition of things shall be disturbed that happiness so perfect is to be turned to misery and misfortune without almost an agony of regret but not on that account can you be in any way released from your duty in this case you are not entitled to think of the happiness or unhappiness of individuals you have to confine yourself to the evidence and must give your verdict in accordance with that  john caldigate as he heard the words told himself at once that the judge had in fact desired the jury to find a verdict against him not a single point had been made in his favour and every point had been made to tell against him the judge had almost said that a mans promise to marry a woman should be taken as evidence of marriage but the jury at any rate did not show immediate alacrity in obeying the judges behest they returned once or twice to ask questions and at three oclock caldigate was allowed to go to his inn with an intimation that he must hold himself in readiness to be brought back and hear the verdict at a moments notice i wish they would declare it at once he said to his father the suspense is worse than all  during the afternoon the matter was discussed very freely throughout the borough i thought they would have agreed almost at once said the mayor at about four oclock to mr seely who at this moment had retired to his own office where the great magistrate of the borough was closeted with him the mayor had been seated on the bench throughout the trial and had taken much interest in the case i never imagined that there could be much doubt after judge brambers summing up  i hear that theres one man holding out said the attorney in a low voice  who is it whispered the mayor the mayor and mr seely were very intimate  i suppose its jones the tanner at ely they say that the caldigates have had dealings with his family from generation to generation i knew all about it and when they passed his name i wondered that burder hadnt been sharper mr burder was the gentleman who had got up the prosecution on the part of the crown  it must be something of that kind said the mayor nothing else would make a jury hesitate after such a charge as that i suppose he did marry her mr seely shrugged his shoulders i have attended very closely to the case and i know i should have been against him on a jury god bless my soul did any man ever write to a woman as his wife without having married her  it has been done i should think  and that nobody should have been got to say that they werent man and wife  i really have hardly formed an opinion said mr seely still whispering i am inclined to think that there was probably some ceremony and that caldigate salved his conscience when he married boltons daughter by an idea that the ceremony wasnt valid but theyll convict him at last when he told me that he had been up to town and paid that money i knew it was all up with him how can any juryman believe that a man will pay twenty thousand pounds which he doesnt owe to his sworn enemy merely on a point of conscience  at the same time the old banker was sitting in his room at the bank and robert bolton was with him there cannot be a doubt of his guilt said robert bolton  no nonot a doubt  but the jury may disagree  what shall we do then said the banker  there must be another trial we must go on till we get a verdict  and hester what can we do for hester  she is very obstinate and i fear we have no power even though she is declared not to be his wife she can choose her own place of living if he is convicted i think that she would come back of course she ought to come back  of course of course  old caldigate too is very obstinate but it may be that we should be able to persuade him he will know that she ought to be with her mother  her poor mother her poor mother and when he comes out of prison  her very nature will have been altered by that time said the attorney she will i trust have consented before that to take up her residence under your roof  i shall be dead said the old man disgrace and years together will have killed me before that time comes  the smirkies were staying at babington and the desire for news there was very intent mr smirkie was full of thought on the matter but was manifestly in favour of a conviction yes the poor young woman is very much to be pitied he said in answer to the squire who had ventured to utter a word in favour of hester a young woman who falls into the hands of an evil man must always be pitied but it is to prevent the evil men from preying upon the weaker sex that examples such as these are needed when we think what might have been the case here in this house we have all of us a peculiar reason to be thankful for the interposition of divine providence here mr smirkie made a little gesture of thanksgiving thanking heaven for its goodness to his wife in having given her himself julia my love you have a very peculiar reason to be thankful and i trust you are so yeswe must pity the poor young lady but it will be well that the offender should be made subject to the outraged laws of his country mrs smirkie as she listened to these eloquent words closed her eyes and hands in token of her thankfulness for all that providence had done for her  if she knew how to compare her condition with that of poor hester at this time she had indeed cause for thankfulness hester was alone with her baby and with no information but what had been conveyed to her by her husbands letters as she read the last of the two she acknowledged to herself that too probably she would not even see his handwriting again till the period of his punishment should have expired and then what would come then sitting alone at the open window of her bedroom with her boy on her lap she endeavoured to realise her own position she would be a mother without a husbandwith her bastard child however innocent he might be such would be her position under the law it did not suffice that they too should be man and wife as thoroughly as any whom god had joined together if twelve men assembled together in a jurybox should say otherwise she had told him that she would be bravebut how should she be brave in such a condition as this what should she do how should she look forward to the time of his release could anything ever again give her back her husband and make him her own in the eyes of men could anything make men believe that he had always been her own and that there had been no flaw she had been very brave when they had attempted to confine her to hold her by force at chesterton then she had been made strong had always been comforted by opposition the determination of her purpose to go back had supported her but nowhow should it be with her now and with her boy and with him  the old man was very good good and eager in her cause and would let her live at folking but what would they call her when they wrote to her from chesterton how would they address her letters never never would she soil her fingers by touching a document that called her by any other name than her own yes her ownlet all the jurymen in all the counties let all the judges on the bench say what they would to the contrary though it should be for all her lifethough there should never come the day on which theytheythe world at large would do him justice and her though they should call her by what hard name they would still up there in the courts of her god she would be his wife she would be a pure woman there and there would her child be without a stain and here here in this world though she could never more be a wife in all things she would be a wife in love a wife in care a wife in obedience a wife in all godly truth and though it would never be possible for her to show her face again among mankind never for her surely the world would be kinder to her boy they would not begrudge him his name and when it should be told how it had come to pass that there was a blot upon his escutcheon they would not remind him of his mothers misery but above all there should be no shade of doubt as to her husband i know she said speaking aloud but not knowing that she spoke aloud i know that he is my husband then there was a knock at the door well yeshas it come do you know  no nothing was known there at that moment but in another minute all would be known the wheels of the old squires carriage had been heard upon the gravel no maam no you shall not leave the room said the nurse stay here and let him come to you  is he alone she asked but the woman did not know the wheels of the carriage had only been heard  alas alas he was alone his heart too had been almost broken as he bore the news home to the wife who was a wife no longer  father she said when she saw him  my daughtero my daughter and then with their hands clasped together they sat speechless and alone while the news was spread through the household which the old man did not dare to tell to his sons wife  it was very slowly that the actual tidings reached her ears mr caldigate when he tried to tell them found that the power of words had left him old as he was and prone to cynic indifference as he had shown himself he was affected almost like a young girl he sobbed convulsively as he hung over her embracing her my daughter he said my daughter my daughter  but at last it was all told caldigate had been declared guilty and the judge had condemned him to be confined to prison for two years judge bramber had told him that in his opinion the jury could have found no other verdict but he went on to say that looking for some excuse for so terrible a deed as that which had been doneso terrible for that poor lady who was now left nameless with a nameless infanthe could imagine that the marriage though legally solemnised had nevertheless been so deficient in the appearances of solemnity as to have imbued the husband with the idea that it had not meant all that a marriage would have meant if celebrated in a church and with more of the outward appurtenances of religion on that account he refrained from inflicting a severer penalty     chapter xliv  after the verdict    when the verdict was given caldigate was at once marched round into the dock having hitherto been allowed to sit in front of the dock between mr seely and his father but standing in the dock he heard the sentence pronounced upon him i never married the woman my lord he said in a loud voice but what he said could be of no avail and then men looked at him as he disappeared with the jailers down the steps leading to regions below and away to his prison and they knew that he would no more be seen or heard of for two years he had vanished but there was the lady who was not his wife out at folkingthe lady whom the jury had declared not to be his wife what would become of her  there was an old gentleman there in the court who had known mr caldigate for many yearsone mr ryder who had been himself a practising barrister but had now retired in those days they seldom saw each other but nevertheless they were friends caldigate he said you had better let her go back to her own people  she shall stay with me he replied  better not believe me she had better not if so how will it be with her when he is released the two years will soon go by and then she will be in his house if that woman should die he might marry herbut till then she had better be with her own people  she shall stay with me the old man said again repeating the words angrily and shaking his head he was so stunned by the blow that he could not argue the matter but he knew that he had made the promise and that he was resolved to abide by it  she had better go back to her own people all the world was saying it she had no husband now everybody would respect her misfortune everybody would acknowledge her innocence all would sympathise with her all would love her but she must go back to her own people there was not a dissentient voice of course she must go back to you now nicholas bolton said to her father and nicholas bolton seldom interfered in anything the poor lady will of course be restored to her family the judge had said in private to his marshal and the marshal had of course made known what the judge had said on the next morning there came a letter from william bolton to robert of course hester must come back now nothing else is possible everybody decided that she must come back it was a matter which admitted of no doubt but how was she to be brought to chesterton  none of them who decided with so much confidence as to her future understood her ideas of her position as a wife i am bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh she said to herself made so by a sacrament which no jury can touch what matters what the people say they may make me more unhappy than i am they may kill me by their cruelty but they cannot make me believe myself not to be his wife and while i am his wife i will obey him and him only  what she called their cruelty manifested itself very soon the first person who came to her was mrs robert bolton and her visit was made on the day after the verdict when hester sent down word begging to be permitted in her misery to decline to see even her sisterinlaw mrs robert sent her up a word or two written in pencilmy darling whom have you nearer who loves you better than i then the wretched one gave way and allowed her brothers wife to be brought to her she was already dressed from head to foot in black and her baby was with her  the arguments which mrs robert bolton used need not be repeated but it may be said that the words she used were so tender and that they were urged with so much love so much sympathy and so much personal approval that hesters heart was touched but he is my husband hester said the judge cannot alter it he is my husband  i will not say a word to the contrary but the law has separated you and you should obey the law you should not even eat his bread now becausebecause oh hester you understand  i do understand she said rising to her feet in her energy and i will eat his bread though it be hard and i will drink of his cup though it be bitter his bread and his cup shall be mine and none other shall be mine i do understand i know that these wicked people have blasted my life i know that i can be nothing to him now but his child shall never be made to think that his mother had condemned his father yes margaret she said again i do love you and i do trust you and i know that you love me but you do not love him you do not believe in him if they came to you and took robert away would you go and live with other people i do love papa and mamma but this is his house and he bids me stay here the very clothes which i wear are his clothes i am his and though they were to cut me apart from him still i should belong to him noi will not go to mamma of course i have forgiven her because she meant it for the best but i will never go back to chesterton  then there came letters from the mother one letter hot upon the other all appealing to those texts in scripture by which the laws of nations are supposed to be supported give unto caesar the things which are caesars it was for the law to declare who were and who were not man and wife and in this matter the law had declared after this how could she doubt or how could she hesitate as to tearing herself away from the belongings of the man who certainly was not her husband and there were dreadful words in these letters which added much to the agony of her who received themwords which were used in order that their strength might prevail but they had no strength to convert though they had strength to afflict then mrs bolton who in her anxiety was ready to submit herself to any personal discomfort prepared to go to folking but hester sent back word that in her present condition she would see nobodynot even her mother  but it was not only from the family of the boltons that these applications and entreaties came even mr seely took upon himself to tell mr caldigate that under existing circumstances hester should not be detained at folking  i do not know that either she or i want advice in the matter mr caldigate replied but as a stone will be worn hollow in time by the droppings of many waters so was it thought that if all cambridge would continue firm in its purpose then this stone might at last be made to yield the world was so anxious that it resolved among itself that it would submit to any amount of snubbing in carrying out its object even the mayor wrote dear mr caldigate greatly as i object to all interference in families i think myself bound to appeal to you as to the unfortunate condition of that young lady from chesterton then followed all the arguments and some of the textsboth of which were gradually becoming hackneyed in the matter mr caldigates answer to this was very characteristic dear mr mayor if you have an objection to interfere in families why do you do it the mayor took the rebuke with placid goodhumour feeling that his little drop might also have done something towards hollowing the stone  but of all the counsellors perhaps mr smirkie was the most zealous and the most trusting he felt himself to be bound in a peculiar manner to folkingby double ties was not the clergyman of the parish the brother of his dear departed one and with whom better could he hold sweet counsel and then that second dear one who had just been vouchsafed to himhad she not as it were by a miracle been rescued from the fate into which the other poor lady had fallen and obtained her present thoroughly satisfactory position mr smirkie was a clergyman who understood it to be his duty to be urgent for the good cause in season and out of season and who always did his duty so he travelled over to utterden and discussed the matter at great length with mr bromley i do believe in my heart said mr bromley that the verdict is wrong but mr smirkie with much eloquence averred that that had nothing to do with the question mr bromley opened his eyes very wide nothing at all said mr smirkie it is the verdict of the jury confirmed by the judge and the verdict itself dissolves the marriage whether the verdict be wrong or right that marriage ceremony is null and void they are not man and wifenot now even if they ever were of course you are aware of that  mr smirkie was altogether wrong in his law such men generally are mr bromley in vain endeavoured to point out to him that the verdict could have no such power as was here claimed for it and that if any claim was to be brought up hereafter as to the legitimacy of the child the fact of the verdict could only be used as evidence and that that evidence would or would not be regarded as true by another jury according to the views which that other jury might take mr smirkie would only repeat his statements with increased solemnitythat marriage is no marriage that poor lady is not mrs john caldigate she is miss hester bolton and therefore every breath of air which she draws under that roof is a sin as he said this out upon the dikeside he looked about him with manifest regret that he had no other audience than his brotherinlaw  and at last after much persevering assiduity mr smirkie succeeded in reaching mr caldigate himself and expressed himself with boldness he was a man who had at any rate the courage of his opinions you have to think of her future life in this world and in the next he said and in the next he repeated with emphasis when mr caldigate paused  as to what will affect her happiness in this world sir said the old man very gravely i think you can hardly be a judge  good repute suggested the clergyman  has she done anything that ought to lessen the fair fame of a woman in the estimation of other women and as to the next world in the rewards and punishments of which you presume it to be your peculiar duty to deal has she done anything which you think will subject her to the special wrath of an offended deity this question he asked with a vehemence of voice which astounded his companion she has loved her husband with a peculiar love he continued she has believed herself to be joined to him by ties which you shall call romantic if you willsuperstitious if you will  i hope noti hope not said mr smirkie holding up both his hands not at all understanding the old mans meaning but intending to express horror at superstition which he supposed to be a peculiar attribute of the roman catholic branch of the christian church not that i hope  i cannot fathom and you apparently cannot at all understand her idea of the sanctity of the marriage vow but if you knew anything about her i think you would refrain from threatening her with divine wrath and as you know nothing about her i regard such threats coming from you as impertinent unmanly inhuman and blasphemous mr caldigate had commenced this conversation though vehemently still in so argumentative a manner and in his allusions to the ladys romantic and superstitious ideas had seemed to yield so much that the terrible vigour of his last words struck the poor clergyman almost to the ground one epithet came out after another very clearly spoken with a pause between each of them and the speaker as he uttered them looked his victim close in the face then he walked slowly away leaving mr smirkie fixed to the ground what had he done he had simply made a gentle allusion to the next world as surely it was his duty to do whether this old pagan did or did not believe in a next world himself he must at any rate be aware that it is the peculiar business of a clergyman to make such references as to impertinent and unmanly he would let them go by he was he conceived bound by his calling to be what people called impertinent and manliness had nothing to do with him but inhuman and blasphemous why had he come all the way over from plumcumpippins at considerable personal expense except in furtherance of that highest humanity which concerns itself with eternity and as for blasphemy it might he thought as well be said that he was blasphemous whenever he read the bible aloud to his flock his first idea was to write an exhaustive letter on the subject to mr caldigate in which he would invite that gentleman to recall the offensive words but as he drove his gig into the parsonage yard at plumcumpippins he made up his mind that this too was among the things which a christian minister should bear with patience  but the dropping water always does hollow the stonehollow it a little though the impression may not be visible to the naked eye even when rising in his wrath mr caldigate had crushed the clergyman by the violence of his languagehaving been excited to anger chiefly by the thickheadedness of the man in not having understood the rebuke intended to be conveyed by his earlier and gentler wordseven when leaving the man with a full conviction that the man was crushed the old squire was aware that he the stone was being gradually hollowed hester was now very dear to him from the first she had suited his ideas of a wife for his son and her constancy in her misery had wound itself into his heart he quite understood that her welfare should now be his great care there was no one else from whom she would listen to a word of advice from her husband whose slightest word would have been a law to her no word could now come from her own family she was entirely estranged having been taught to regard them simply as enemies in this matter she loved her mother but in this matter her mother was her declared enemy his voice and his voice alone could now reach her ears as to that great hereafter to which the clergyman had so flippantly alluded he was content to leave that to herself much as he differed from her as to details of a creed he felt sure that she was safe there to his thinking she was the purest human being that had ever come beneath his notice whatever portion of bliss there may be for mankind in a life after this life the fullest portion of that bliss would be hers whether by reason of her creed or in spite of it accustomed to think much of things it was thus that he thought of her in reference to the world to come but as to this world he was not quite so sure if she could die and have that other bliss at once that would be bestonly for the child only for the child but he did doubt would it do for her to ignore that verdict altogether when his son should be released from jail and be to him as though there had been no verdict would not the finger of scorn be pointed at herand as he thought of itpossibly at future children might it not be better for her to bow to the cruelty of fate and consent to be apart from him at any rate while that woman should be alive and again if such would be better then was it not clear that no time should be lost in beginning that new life if at last it should be ruled that she must go back to her mother it would certainly be well that she should do so now at once so that people might know that she had yielded to the verdict in this way the stone was hollowedthough the hollowing had not been made visible to the naked eye of mr smirkie  he was a man whose conscience did not easily let him rest when he believed that a duty was incumbent on him it was his duty now he thought not to bid her go not to advise her to gobut to put before her what reasons there might be for her going  i am telling you he said what other people say  i do not regard what other people say  that might be possible for a man hester but a woman has to regard what the world says you are young and may have a long life before you we cannot hide from ourselves the fact that a most terrible misfortune has fallen upon you altogether undeserved but very grievous  god when he gave me my husband she replied did me more good than any man can do me harm by taking him away i never cease to tell myself that the blessing is greater than the misfortune  but my dearest  i know it all father i know what you would tell me if i live here after he comes out of prison people will say that i am his mistress  not that not that he cried unable to bear the contumely of the word even from her lips  yes father that is what you mean that is what they all mean that is what mamma means and margaret let them call me what they will it is not what they call me but what i am it is bad for a woman to have evil said of her but it is worse for her to do evil it is your house and you of course can bid me go  i will never do that  but unless i am turned out homeless on to the roads i will stay here where he left me i have only one sure way of doing right and that is to obey him as closely as i can he cannot order me now but he has left his orders he has told me to remain under this roof and to call myself by his name and in no way to derogate from my own honour as his wife by gods help i will do as he bids me nothing that any of them can say shall turn me an inch from the way he has pointed out you are good to me  i will try to be good to you  you are so good to me that i can hardly understand your goodness trusting to that i will wait here till he shall come again and tell me where and how i am to live  after that the old squire made no further attempt in the same direction finding that no slightest hollow had been made on that other stone     chapter xlv  the boltons are much troubled    the condition of the inhabitants of puritan grange during the six weeks immediately after the verdict was very sad indeed i have described badly the character of the lady living there if i have induced my readers to think that her heart was hardened against her daughter she was a woman of strong convictions and bitter prejudices but her heart was soft enough when she married circumstances had separated her widely from her own family in which she had never known either a brother or a sister and the burden of her marriage with an old man had been brightened to her by the possession of an only childof one daughter who had been the lamp of her life the solitary delight of her heart the single relief to the otherwise solitary tedium of her monotonous existence she had indeed attended to the religious training of her girl with constant carebut the yearnings of her maternal heart had softened even her religion so that the laws and dogmas and texts and exercises by which her husband was oppressed and her servants afflicted had been made lighter for hestersometimes not without pangs of conscience on the part of the selfconvicted parent she had known as well as other mothers how to gloat over the sweet charms of the one thing which in all the world had been quite her own she had revelled in kisses and soft touches her hesters garments had been a delight to her till she had taught herself to think that though sackcloth and ashes were the proper wear for herself and her husband nothing was too soft too silken too delicate for her little girl the roses in the garden and the goldfish in the bowl and the pet spaniel had been there because such surroundings had been needed for the joyousness of her girl and the theological hardness of the literature of the house had been somewhat mitigated as hester grew into reading so that watt was occasionally relieved by wordsworth and thomsons seasons was alternated with george witherss hallelujah  then had come first the idea of the marriage and immediately consequent upon the idea the marriage itself the story of that has been told but the reader has perhaps hardly been made to understand the utter bereavement which it brought on the mother it is natural that the adult bird should delight to leave the family nest and that the mother bird should have its heartstrings torn by the separation it must be so alas even when the divulsions are made in the happiest manner but here the tearing away had nothing in it to reconcile the mother she was suddenly told that her daughter was to be no longer her own her stepson had interfered and her husband had become powerful over her with a sudden obstinacy she had had no hand in the choice she would fain have postponed any choice and would then fain have herself made the choice but a man was brought who was distasteful to her at all points and she was told that that man was to have her daughter he was thoroughly distasteful he had been a spendthrift and a gamblerthen a seeker after gold in wild godless countries and to her thinking not at all the better because he had been a successful seeker she believed the man to be an atheist she was told that his father was an infidel and was ready to believe the worst of the son and yet in this terrible emergency she was powerless the girl was allowed to see the man and declared almost at once that she would transfer herself from her mothers keeping to the keeping of this wicked one she was transferred and the mother had been left alone  then came the blowvery quickly the blow which as she now told herself morning noon and night was no worse than she had expected another woman claimed the man as her husband and so claimed him that the world all around her had declared that the claim would be made good and the man himself had owned enough to make him unfitas she thoughtto have the custody of any honest woman then she acknowledged to herself the full weight of the misfortune that had fallen upon themthe misfortune which never would have fallen upon them had they listened to her counseland she had immediately put her shoulders to the wheel with the object of rescuing her child from the perils from the sin from the degradation of her position and could she have rescued her could she have induced her daughter to remain at puritan grange there would even then have been consolation it was one of the tenets of her lifethe strongest perhaps of all those doctrines on which she built her faiththat this world is a world of woe that wailing and suffering if not gnashing of teeth is and should be the condition of mankind preparatory to eternal bliss for eternal bliss there could she thought be no other preparation she did not want to be happy here or to have those happy around her whom she loved she had stumbled and gone astrayshe told herself hourly now that she had stumbled and gone astrayin preparing those roses and ribbons and other lightnesses for her young girl it should have been all sackcloth and ashes had it been all sackcloth and ashes there would not have been this terrible fall but if the loved one would now come back to sackcloth and ashesif she would assent to the blackness of religious asceticism to penitence and theological gloom and would lead the life of the godly but comfortless here in order that she might insure the glories and joys of the future life then there might be consolationthen it might be felt that this tribulation had been a precious balm by which an erring soul had been brought back to its due humility  but wordsworth and thomson though upon the whole moral poets had done their work or if not done altogether by them the work had been done by the latitude which had admitted them so that the young wife when she found herself breathing the free air with which her husband surrounded her was able to burst asunder the remnants of those cords of fanaticism with which her mother had endeavoured to constrain her she looked abroad and soon taught herself to feel that the world was bright and merry that this mortal life was by no means necessarily a place of gloom and the companionship of the man to whom providence had allotted her was to her so happy so enjoyable so sufficient that she found herself to have escaped from a dark prison and to be roaming among shrubs and flowers and running waters which were ever green which never faded and the music of which was always in her ears when the first tidings of euphemia smith came to folking she was in all her thoughts and theories of life poles asunder from her mother there might be suffering and tribulationsuffering even to death but her idea of the manner in which the suffering should be endured and death awaited was altogether opposed to that which was hot within her mothers bosom  but not the less did the mother still pray still struggle and still hope they neither of them quite understood each other but the mother did not at all understand the daughter she the mother knew what the verdict had been and was taught to believe that by that verdict the very ceremony of her daughters marriage had been rendered null and void it was in vain that the truth of the matter came to her from robert bolton diluted through the vague explanations of her husband it does not alter the marriage robert says so it was that the old man told his tale not perfectly understanding not even quite believing what his son had told him  how can he dare to say so demanded the indignant mother of the injured woman not alter the marriage when the jury have declared that the other woman is his wife in the eyes of god she is not his wife that cannot be imputed as sin to hernot thatbecause she did it not knowing she poor innocent was betrayed but now that she knows it every mouthful that she eats of his bread is a sin  it is the old mans bread said this older man weakly  what matter it is the bread of adultery it may certainly be said that at this time mrs bolton herself would have been relieved from none of her sufferings by any new evidence which would have shown that crinkett and the others had sworn falsely though she loved her daughter dearly though her daughters misery made her miserable yet she did not wish to restore the husband to the wife any allusion to a possibility that the verdict had been a mistaken verdict was distasteful to her her own original opinion respecting caldigate had been made good by the verdict the verdict had proved her to be right and her husband with all his sons to have been wrong the triumph had been very dark to her but still it had been a triumph it was to her an established fact that john caldigate was not her daughters husband and therefore she was anxious not to rehabilitate her daughters position but to receive her own miserable child once more beneath the shelter of her own wing that they two might pray together struggle together together wear their sackcloth and ashes and together console themselves with their hopes of eternal joys while they shuddered not altogether uncomfortably at the torments prepared for othersthis was now the only outlook in which she could find a gleam of satisfaction and she was so assured of the reasonableness of her wishes so convinced that the house of her parents was now the only house in which hester could live without running counter to the precepts of her own religion and counter also to the rules of the wicked outside world that she could not bring herself to believe but that she would succeed at last merely to ask her child to come to repeat the invitation and then to take a refusal was by no means sufficient for her energy she had failed grievously when she had endeavoured to make her daughter a prisoner at the grange after such an attempt as that it could hardly be thought that ordinary invitations would be efficacious but when that attempt had been made it was possible that hester should justify herself by the law according to law she had then been caldigates wife there had been some ground for her to stand upon as a wife and as a wife she had stood upon it very firmly but now there was not an inch of ground the man had been convicted as a bigamist and the other woman the first woman had been proved to be his wife mrs bolton had got it into her head that the two had been dissevered as though by some supernal power and no explanation to the contrary brought to her by her husband from robert had any power of shaking her conviction it was manifest to all men and to all women that she who had been seduced betrayed and sacrificed should now return with her innocent babe to the protection of her fathers roof and no stone must be left unturned till the unfortunate one had been made to understand her duty  the old banker in these days had not a good time nor indeed had the boltons generally mrs bolton though prone to grasp at power on every side was apt like some other women who are equally grasping to expect almost omnipotence from the men around her when she was desirous that something should be done by them in accordance with her own bidding knowing her husband to be weak from age and sorrow she could still jeer at him because he was not abnormally strong and though her intercourse with his sons and their families was now scanty and infrequent still by a word here and a line there she could make her reproaches felt by them all robert who saw his father every day heard very much of them daniel was often stung and even nicholas and the reproaches reached as far as william the barrister up in london  i am sure i dont know what we can do said the miserable father sitting huddled up in his armchair one evening towards the end of august it was very hot but the windows were closed because he could not bear a draught and he was somewhat impatiently waiting for the hour of prayers which were antecedent to bed where he could be silent even if he could not sleep  there are five of you one should be at the house every day to tell her of her duty  i couldnt go  they could goif they cared if they cared they would go they are her brothers  mr caldigate would not let them enter the house said the old man  do you mean that he would separate her from her brother and her parents  not if she wished to see them she is her own mistress and he will abet her in whatever she may choose to do that is what robert says  and what robert says is to be law  he knows what he is talking about mr bolton as he said this shook his head angrily because he was fatigued  and he is to be your guide even when your daughters soul is in jeopardy this was the line of argument in reference to which mr bolton always felt himself to be as weak as water before his wife he did not dare to rebel against her religious supremacy not simply because he was a weak old man in presence of a strong woman but from fear of denunciation he too believed her creed though he was made miserable by her constant adherence to it he believed and would fain have let that suffice she believed and endeavoured to live up to her belief and so it came to pass that when she spoke to him of his own soul of the souls of those who were dear to him or even of souls in general he was frightened and paralysed he had more than once attempted to reply with worldly arguments but had suffered so much in the encounter that he had learned to abstain i cannot believe that she would refuse to see us i shall go myself but if we all went we should surely persuade her in answer to this the poor man only groaned till the coming in of the old servant to arrange the chairs and put the big bible on the table relieved him from something of his misery  i certainly will not interfere robert bolton said to his father on the next morning i will not go to folking because i am sure that i should do no good hester no doubt would be better at your housemuch better there is nothing i would not do to get her back from the caldigates altogetherif there was a chance of success but we have no powernone whatever  no power at all said the banker shaking his head and feeling some satisfaction at the possession of an intelligible word which he could quote to his wife  she is controller of her own actions as completely as are you and i we have already seen how inefficacious with her are all attempts at persuasion and she knows her position if he were out of prison tomorrow he would be her husband  but he has another wife  of that the civil law knows nothing if money were coming to her he could claim it and the verdict against him would only be evidence to be taken for what it was worth it would have been all very well had she wished to sever herself from him but as she is determined not to do so any interference would be useless the question as to the marriage or no marriage was not made quite clear to the bankers mind but he did understand that neither he nor his wife nor his sons had any power and of that argument he was determined to make use  william the barrister in london was induced to write a letter a very lengthy and elaborate epistle having come from mrs bolton to his wife in which the religious duty of all the boltons was set forth in strong language and in which he was incited to do something it was almost the first letter which mrs william bolton had ever received from her stepmother whatever trifling correspondence there might have been between them having been of no consequence they too felt that it would be better that hester should return to her old home but felt also that they had no power of course she wont said mrs william  she has a will of her own said the barrister  why should she think of the gloom of that home at chesterton and her absolute independence at folking no doubt it would be better the position is so frightful that even the gloom would be better but she wont we all know that  the barrister however feeling that it would be better thought that he should perform his duty by expressing his opinion and wrote a letter to hester which was intended to be if possible persuasiveand this was the answer       dear williamif you were carried away to prison on some horrible     false accusation would fanny go away from you and desert your     house and your affairs and return to her parents you ask her and     ask her whether she would believe anything that anybody could say     against you if they told her that her children were nameless would     she agree to make them so by giving up your name wouldnt she cling     to you the more the more all the world was against you i     would said fanny with tearful energy fanny was of course     mrs william bolton and was the happy mother of five nearly     grownup sons and daughters and certainly stood in no peril as to     her own or their possession of the name of bolton the letter was     being read aloud to her by her husband whose mind was also stirred     in his sisters favour by the nature of the arguments used if     so continued the writer why shouldnt i be the same i dont     believe a word the people said i am sure i am his wife and as     when he was taken away from me he left a house for his wife and     child to live in i shall continue to live in it      all the same i know you mean to be good to me give my best love     to fanny and believe me your affectionate sister      hester caldigate   in every letter and stroke of the name as she wrote it there was an assertion that she claimed it as her own and that she was not ashamed of it  upon my word said mrs william bolton through her tears i am beginning to think that she is almost right there was so much of conjugal proper feeling in this that the husband could only kiss his wife and leave her without further argument on the matter     chapter xlvi  burning words    no power at all none whatever the banker said when he was next compelled to carry on the conversation this was immediately upon his return home from cambridge for his wife never allowed the subject to be forgotten or set aside every afternoon and every evening it was being discussed at all hours not devoted to prayers and every morning it was renewed at the breakfasttable  that comes from robert mr bolton was not able to deny the assertion what does he mean by no power  we cant make her do it the magistrates cant interfere  magistrates has it been by the interference of magistrates that men have succeeded in doing great things was it by order from the magistrates that the lessons of christ have been taught over all the world is there no such thing as persuasion has truth no power is she more deaf to argument and eloquence than another  she is very deaf i think said the father doubting his own eloquence  it is because no one has endeavoured to awaken her by burning words to a true sense of her situation when she said this she must surely have forgotten much that had occurred during those weary hours which had been passed by her and her daughter outside there in the hall no power she repeated it is the answer always made by those who are too sleepy to do the lords work it was because men said that they had no power that the grain fell upon stony places where they had not much earth it is that aversion to face difficulties which causes the broad path to be crowded with victims i at any rate will go i may have no power but i will make the attempt  soon after that she did make the attempt mr bolton though he was assured by robert that such an attempt would produce no result could not interfere to prevent it had he been far stronger than he was in his own house he could hardly have forbidden the mother to visit the daughter hester had sent word to say that she did not wish to see even her mother but this had been immediately after the verdict when she was crushed and almost annihilated by her misery some weeks had now passed by and it could not be that she would refuse to admit the visitor when such a visitor knocked at her door they had loved each other as mothers and daughters do love when there is no rival in the affectionwhen each has no one else to love there never had been a more obedient child or a more loving parent much no doubt had happened since to estrange the daughter from the mother a husband had been given to her who was more to her than any parentas a husband should be and then there had been that terrible opposition that struggle that battle in the hall but the mothers love had never waned because of that she was sure that her child would not refuse to see her  so the fly was ordered to take her out to folking and on the morning fixed she dressed herself in her blackest black she always wore brown or blackbrown being the colour suitable for the sober and sad domesticities of her weekdays which on ceremonies and sabbath was changed for a more solemn black but in her wardrobe there were two such gowns one of which was apparently blacker than the other nearer to a guise of widowhoodmore fit at any rate for general funereal obsequies there are women who seem always to be burying someone and mrs bolton as she went forth to visit her daughter was fit to bury any one short of her husband  it was a hot day in august and the fly travelled along the dusty road very slowly she had intended to reach folking at twelve so that her interview might be over and that she might return without the need of eating there is always some idea of festivity connected with food eaten at a friends table and she did not wish to be festive she was too most unwilling to partake of john caldigates bread but she did not reach the house till one and when she knocked at the door hesters modest lunch was about to be put upon the table  there was considerable confusion when the servant saw mrs bolton standing in the doorway it was quite understood by everyone at folking that for the present there was to be no intercourse between the boltons and the caldigates it was understood that there should be no visitors of any kind at folking and it had been thought that mr smirkie had forced an entrance in an impertinent manner but yet it was not possible to send mrs bolton from her own daughters door with a mere not at home of course she was shown inand was taken to the parlour in which the lunch was prepared while word was taken up to hester announcing that her mother was there  mr caldigate was in the housein his own bookroom as it used to be calledand hester went to him first mamma is herein the diningroom  your mother  i long to see mamma  of course you do  but she will want me to go away with her  she cannot take you unless you choose to go  but she will speak of nothing else i know it i wish she had not come  surely hester you can make her understand that your mind is made up  yes i shall do that i must do that but father it will be very painful you do not know what things she can say it nearly killed me when i was at the grange you will not see her i suppose  if you wish it i will she will not care to see me and as things are at present what room is there for friendship  you will come if i send for you  certainly if you send for me i will come at once  then she crept slowly out of the room and very slowly and very silently made her way to the parlourdoor though she was of a strong nature unusually strong of heart and fixed of purpose now her heart misgave her that terrible struggle with all its incidents of weariness and agony was present to her mind her mother could not turn the lock on her now but as she had said it would be very dreadful her mother would say words to her which would go through her like swords then she opened the door and for a moment there was the sweetness of an embrace there was a prolonged tenderness in the kiss which even to mrs bolton had a charm for the moment to soften her spirit oh mamma my own mamma  my child  yes mammaevery day when i pray for you i tell myself that i am still your childi do  my only one my only oneall that i have then again they were in each others arms yet when they had last met one had been the jailer and the other the prisoner and they had fought it out between them with a determined obstinacy which at moments had almost amounted to hatred but now the very memory of these sad hours increased their tenderness hester through it all do you not know that my heart yearns for you day and nightthat in my prayers i am always remembering you that my dreams are happy because you are with me that i am ever longing for you as ruth longed for naomi i am as rachel weeping for her children who would not be comforted because they are not day and night my heartstrings are torn asunder because my eyes behold you not  it was trueand the daughter knew it to be true but what could be done there had grown up something for her holier greater more absorbing even than a mothers love happily for most young wives though the new tie may surmount the old one it does not crush it or smother it the mother retains a diminished hold and knowing what nature has intended is content she too with some subsidiary worship kneels at the new altar and all is well but here though there was abundant love there was no sympathy the cause of discord was ever present to them both unless john caldigate was acknowledged to be a fitting husband not even the mother could be received with a full welcome and unless john caldigate were repudiated not even the daughter could be accepted as altogether pure parental and filial feelings sufficed for nothing between them beyond the ecstasy of a caress  as hester was standing mute still holding her mothers hand the servant came to the door and asked whether she would have her lunch  you will stay and eat with me mamma but you will come up to my room first  i will go up to your room hester  then we will have our lunch hester said turning to the servant so the two went together to the upper chamber and in a moment the mother had fetched her baby and placed it in her mothers arms  i wish he were at the grange said mrs bolton then hester shook her head but feeling the security of her position left the baby with its grandmother i wish he were at the grange it is the only fitting home for him at present  no mamma that cannot be  it should be so hester it should be so  pray do not speak of it dear mamma  have i not come here on purpose that i might speak of it sweet as it is to me to have you in my arms do you not know that i have come for that purposefor that only  it cannot be so  i will not take such an answer hester i am not here to speak of pleasure or delightsnot to speak of sweet companionship or even of a return to that more godly life which i think you would find in your fathers house had not this ruin come unhappy though i might have been and distrustful i should not have interfered those whom god has joined together let not man put asunder  it is what i say to myself every hour god has joined us and no man no number of men shall put us asunder  but my own darlinggod has not joined you when he pretended to be joined to you he had a wife then livingstill living  no  will you set up your own opinion against evidence which the jury has believed which the judge has believed which all the world has believed  yes i will said hester the whole nature of whose face was now altered and who looked as she did when sitting in the hallchair at puritan grangei will though i were almost to know that he had been false i should still believe him to be true  i cannot understand that hester  but i know him to be truequite true she said wishing to erase the feeling which her unguarded admission had made not to believe him to have been true would be death to me and for my boys sake i would wish to live but i have no doubt and i will listen to no onenot even to you when you tell me that god did not join us together  you cannot go behind the law hester as a citizen you must obey the law  i will live hereas a citizentill he has been restored to me  but he will not then be your husband people will not call you by his name he cannot have two wives she will be his wife oh hester have you thought of it  i have thought of it she said raising her face looking upwards through the open window out away towards the heavens and pressing her foot firmly upon the floor i have thought of itvery much and i have askedthe lordfor counsel and he has given it me he has told me what to believe what to know and how to live i will never again lie with my head upon his bosom unless all that be altered but i will serve him as his wife and obey him and if i can i will comfort him i will never desert him and not all the laws that were ever made nor all the judges that ever sat in judgment shall make me call myself by another name than his  the mother had come there to speak burning words and she had in some sort prepared them but now she found herself almost silenced by the energy of her daughter and when her girl told her that she had applied to her god for counsel and that the lord had answered her prayersthat the lord had directed her as to her future lifethen the mother hardly knew how to mount to higher ground so as to seem to speak from a more exalted eminence and yet she was not at all convinced that the lord should give bad counsel she knew to be impossible that the lord would certainly give good counsel to such a suppliant if asked aright she was quite sure but they who send others to the throne of heaven for direct advice are apt to think that the asking will not be done aright unless it be done with their spirit and their biaswith the spirit and bias which they feel when they recommend the operation no one has ever thought that direct advice from the lord was sufficient authority for the doing of that of which he himself disapproved it was mrs boltons daily custom to kneel herself and ask for such counsel and to enjoin such asking upon all those who were subject to her influence but had she been assured by some young lady to whom she had recommended the practice that heavenly warrant had thus been secured for balls and theatres she would not have scrupled to declare that the lord had certainly not been asked aright she was equally certain of some defalcation now she did not doubt that hester had done as she had said that the prayer had been put up with energetic fervour she was sure but energetic fervour in prayer was she thought of no usenay was likely to be most dangerous when used in furtherance of human prepossessions and desires had hester said her prayers with a proper feeling of selfnegationin that religious spirit which teaches the poor mortal here on earth to know that darkness and gloom are safer than mirth and comfortthen the lord would have told her to leave folking to go back to puritan grange and to consent once more to be called hester bolton this other counsel had not come from the lordhad come only from hesters own polluted heart but she was not at the moment armed with words sufficiently strong to explain all this  hester she said does not all this mean that your own proud spirit is to have a stronger dominion over you than the experience and wisdom of all your friends  perhaps it does but at any rate my proud spirit will retain its pride  you will be obstinate  certainly i will nothing on earth shall make me leave this house till i am told by its owner to go  who is its owner old mr caldigate is its owner  i hardly know though john has explained it again and again i am so bad at such things that i am not sure but i can do what i please with it i am the mistress here as you say that the grange is your house i can say that this is mine it is the abode appointed for me and here i will abide  then hester i can only tell you that you are sinning it is a heavy grievous and most obvious sin  dear motherdear mamma i knew how it would be if you came it is useless for me to say more were i to go away that to me would be the sin why should we discuss it any more there comes a time to all of us when we must act on our own responsibility my husband is in prison and cannot personally direct me no doubt i could go were i so pleased his father would not hinder me though he is most unwilling that i should go i must judge a little for myself but i have his judgment to fall back upon he told me to stay and i shall stay  then there was a pause during which mrs bolton was thinking of her burning wordswas remembering the scorn with which she had treated her husband when he told her that they had no power she had endeavoured herself not to be sleepy in doing the lords work but her seed too had fallen upon stony places she was powerless to do or even to say anything further then i may go she muttered  you will come and eat with me mamma  no my dearno  you do not wish that there should be a quarrel  there is very much hester that i do not wish i have long ceased to trust much to any wishes there is a great gulf between us and i will not attempt to bridge it by the hollow pretence of sitting at table with you i will still pray that you may be restored to me then she went to the door  mamma you will kiss me before you go  i will cover you with kisses when you return to your own home but in spite of this hester went down with her into the hall holding by her raiment and as mrs bolton got into the fly she did succeed in kissing her mothers hand  she has gone said hester going to her fatherinlaws room though i was so glad to see her i wish she had not come when people think so very very differently on a matter which is so very very important it is better that they should not meet let them love each other ever so  as far as hester and mr caldigate were concerned the visit had in truth been made without much inconvenience there had been no absolute violenceno repetition of such outward quarrelling as had made those two days at the grange so memorable there was almost a feeling of relief in hesters bosom when her mother was driven away after that successful grasp at the parting hand though they had differed much they had not hated each other during that last halfhour hester had been charged with sinwhich however had been a matter of course but in mrs boltons heart there was a feeling which made her return home very uncomfortable having twitted her husband with his lack of power she had been altogether powerless herself and now she was driven to confess to herself that no further step could be taken she is obstinate she said to her husbandstiffnecked in her sin as are all determined sinners i can say no more to her it may be that the lord will soften her heart when her sorrows have endured yet for a time but she said no more of burning words or of eloquence or of the slackness of the work of those who work as though they were not in earnest     chapter xlvii  curlydown and bagwax    there had been a sort of pledge given at the trial by sir john joram that the matter of the envelope should be further investigated he had complained in his defence that the trial had been hurried onthat time had not been allowed for full inquiries seeing that the character of the deed by which his client had been put in jeopardy depended upon what had been done on the other side of the globe this crime he had said if it be a crime was no doubt committed in the parish church of utterden in the early part of last year but all the evidence which has been used or which could be used to prove it to have been a crime has reference to things done long ago and far away time has not been allowed us for rebutting this evidence by counterevidence and yet much time had been allowed the trial had been postponed from the spring to the summer assizes and then the offence was one which from its very nature required speedy notice the boltons who became the instigators of the prosecution demanded that the illused woman should be relieved as quickly as possible from her degradation there had been a general feeling that the trial should not be thrown over to another year and as we are aware it had been brought to judgment and the convicted criminal was in jail but sir john still persevered and to this perseverance he had been instigated very much by a certain clerk in the postoffice  two postoffice clerks had been used as witnesses at the trial of whom the elder mr curlydown had been by no means a constant or an energetic witness a witness when he is brought up for the defence should not be too scrupulous or he will be worse than useless in a matter of fact a man can only say what he saw or tell what he heard or declare what he knew he should at least do no more though it be to save his father he should not commit perjury but when it comes to opinion if a man allows himself to waver he will be taken as thinking the very opposite of what he does think such had been the case with mr curlydown he had intended to be very correct he had believed that the impression of the sydney stamp was on the whole adverse to the idea that it had been obtained in the proper way and yet he had when crossexamined acknowledged that it might very probably have been obtained in the proper way it certainly had not been smudged at all and such impressions generally did become smudged but then he was made to say also that impressions very often did not become smudged and as to the word nobble which should have been stamped upon the envelope he thought that in such a case its absence was very suspicious but still he was brought to acknowledge that postmasters in provincial offices far away from inspection frequently omit that part of their duty all this had tended to rob the envelope of those attributes of deceit and conspiracy which sir john joram attributed to it and had justified the judge in his opinion that mr curlydowns evidence had told them little or nothing but even mr curlydown had found more favour with the judge than samuel bagwax the junior of the two postoffice witnesses samuel bagwax had perhaps been a little too energetic he had made the case his own and was quite sure that the envelope had been tampered with i think that the counsel for the crown pressed his witness unfairly when he asked mr bagwax whether he was absolutely certain that an envelope with such an impression could not have passed through the postoffice in the ordinary course of business nothing is impossible mr bagwax had replied is it not very much within the sphere of possibility the learned gentleman had asked the phrase was misleading and mr bagwax was induced to say that it might be so but still his assurance would probably have had weight with the jury but for the overstrained honesty of his companion the judge had admonished the jury that in reference to such a point they should use their own commonsense rather than the opinion of such a man as mr bagwax a man of ordinary commonsense would know how the mark made by a die on a letter would be affected by the sort of manipulation to which the letter bearing it would be subjectedand so on from all which it came to pass that the judge was understood to have declared that that special envelope might very well have passed in ordinary course through the sydney postoffice  but samuel bagwax was not a man to be put down by the injustice of lawyers he knew himself to have been illtreated he was confident that no man alive was more competent than himself to form an opinion on such a subject and he was sure quite sureperhaps a little too surethat there had been some dishonesty with that envelope and thus he became a strong partisan of john caldigate and of mrs john caldigate if there had been tampering with that envelope then the whole thing was fraudulent false and the outcome of a base conspiracy many points were present to his mind which the lawyers between them would not allow him to explain properly to a jury when had that die been cut by which so perfect an impression had been formed if it could be proved that it had been cut since the date it bore then of course the envelope would be fraudulent but it was only in sydney that this could be ascertained he was sure that a weeks ordinary use would have made the impression less perfect some letters must of course be subjected to new dies and this letter might in due course have been so subjected but it was more probable that a new stamp should have been selected for a surreptitious purpose all this could be ascertained by the book of daily impressions kept in the sydney postofficebut there had not been time to get this evidence from sydney since this question of the impression had been ventilated it was he who had first given importance to the envelope and being a resolute and almost heroic man he was determined that no injustice on the part of a crown prosecutor no darkness in a judges mind no want of intelligence in a jury should rob him of the delight of showing how important to the world was a proper understanding of postoffice details he still thought that that envelope might be made to prove a conspiracy on the part of crinkett and the others and he succeeded in getting sir john joram to share that belief  the envelope itself was still preserved among the sacred archives of the trial that had not been bodily confided to samuel bagwax but various photographs had been made of the document which no doubt reproduced exactly every letter every mark and every line which was to be seen upon it by the closest inspection there was the direction which was admitted to be in caldigates handwritingthe postagestamp with its obliterating linesand the impression of the sydney postmark that was nearly all the paper of the envelope had no watermarks bagwax thought that if he could get hold of the envelope itself something might be done even with that but here sir john could not go along with him as it had been fully acknowledged that the envelope had passed from the possession of caldigate into the hands of the woman bearing the written address if anything could be done it must be done by the postmarksand those postmarks bagwax studied morning noon and night  it had now been decided that bagwax was to be sent out to sydney at the expense of the caldigates there had been difficulty as to leave of absence for such a purpose the man having been convicted the postmastergeneral was bound to regard him as guilty and hesitated to allow a clerk to be absent so long on behalf of a man who was already in prison but the secretary of state overruled this scruple and the leave was to be given bagwax was elatefirst and chiefly because he trusted that he would become the means of putting right a foul and cruel wrong for in these days bagwax almost wept over the hardships inflicted on that poor lady at folking but he was elated also by the prospect of his travels and by the godsend of a six months leave of absence he was a little proud too at having had this personal attention paid to him by the secretary of state all this was very gratifying but that which gratified him was not so charming to his brother clerks they had never enjoyed the privilege of leaving that weary office for six months they were not allowed to occupy themselves in contemplating an envelope they were never specially mentioned by the secretary of state of course there was a little envy and a somewhat general feeling that bagwax having got to the weak side of sir john joram was succeeding in having himself sent out as a firstclass overland passenger to sydney merely as a job paris to be seen and the tunnel and the railways through italy and the suez canalall these places not delightful to the wives of indian officers coming home or going out were an elysium to the postoffice mind his expenses to be paid for six months on the most gentlemanlike footing and his salary going on all the time official human nature good as it generally is cannot learn that such glories are to be showered on one not specially deserving head without something akin to enmity the general idea therefore in the office was that bagwax would do no good in sydney that others would have been better than bagwaxin fact that of all the clerks in all the departments bagwax was the very last man who ought to have been selected for an enterprise demanding secrecy discretion and some judicial severity  curlydown and bagwax occupied the same room at the office in st martinslegrand and there it was their fate in life to arrange inspect and generally attend to those apparently unintelligible hieroglyphics with which the outside coverings of our correspondence are generally bedaubed curlydowns hair had fallen from his head and his face had become puckered with wrinkles through anxiety to make these markings legible and intelligible the popular newspaper the popular member of parliament and the popular novelistthe name of charles dickens will of course present itself to the reader who remembers the circumlocution officehave had it impressed on their several mindsand have endeavoured to impress the same idea on the minds of the public generallythat the normal government clerk is quite indifferent to his work no greater mistake was ever made or one showing less observation of human nature it is the nature of a man to appreciate his own work the felon who is made simply to move shot perishes because he knows his work is without aim the fault lies on the other side the policeman is ambitious of arresting everybody the lawyer would rather make your will for you gratis than let you make your own the general can believe in nothing but in welltrained troops curlydown would willingly have expended the whole net revenue of the postofficeand his ownin improving the machinery for stamping letters but he had hardly succeeded in life he had done his duty and was respected by all he lived comfortably in a suburban cottage with a garden having some private means and had brought up a happy family in prosperitybut he had done nothing new bagwax who was twenty years his junior had with manifest effects added a happy drop of turpentine to the stampingoiland in doing so had broken curlydowns heart the bagwax stamping mixture had absolutely achieved a name which was printed on the official list of stores curlydowns mind was vacillating between the new river and a pensionbetween death in the breach and acknowledged defeatwhen a new interest was lent to his life by the caldigate envelope it was he who had been first sent by the postmastergeneral to sir john jorams chambers but the matter had become too large for himself alone and in an illfated hour bagwax had been consulted now bagwax was to be sent to sydneyalmost with the appointments of a lawyer  they still occupied the same rooma fact which infinitely increased the torments of curlydowns position they ought to have been moved very far asunder curlydown was still engaged in the routine ordinary work of the day seeing that the proper changes were made in all the stamps used during the various hours of the dayassuring himself that the crosses and letters and figures upon which so much of the civilisation of europe depended were properly altered and arranged and it may well be that his own labours were made heavier by the devotion of his colleagues to other matters and yet from time to time bagwax would ask him questions never indeed taking his advice but still demanding his assistance curlydown was not naturally a man of illtemper or an angry heart but there were moments in which he could hardly abstain from expressing himself with animosity  on a certain morning in august bagwax was seated at his table which as usual was laden with the envelopes of many letters there were some hundreds before him the marks on which he was perusing with a strong magnifyingglass it had been arranged that he was to start on his great journey in the first week in september and he employed his time before he went in scanning all the envelopes bearing the sydney postmark which he had been able to procure in england he spent the entire day with a magnifyingglass in his handbut as curlydown was also always armed in the same fashion that was not peculiar they did much of their work with such tools  the date on the envelopethe date conveyed by the impression to which so much attention had been givenwas 10th may 1873 bagwax had succeeded in getting covers bearing dates very close to that the 7th of may had been among his treasures for some time and now he had acquired an entire letter envelope and all which bore the sydney impression of the 13th may this was a great triumph i have brought it within a week he said to curlydown bending down over his glass and inspecting at the same time the two dates  whats the good of that asked curlydown as he passed rapidly under his own glass the stamps which it was his duty to inspect from day to day  all the good in the world said bagwax brandishing his own magnifier with energy it is almost conclusive now the argument with bagwax was thisthat if he found in the sydney postmarks of 7th may and in those of 13th may the same deviations or bruises in the die those deviations must have existed also on the days between these two datesand as the impression before him was quite perfect without any deviation did it not follow that it must have been obtained in some manner outside the ordinary course of business  there are a dozen stamps in use at the sydney office said curlydown  perhaps so or at any rate three or four but i can trace as well as possible the times at which new stamps were supplied look here then he threw himself over the multitude of envelopes all of which had been carefully arranged as to dates and began to point out the periods here you see in 1873 there is nothing that quite tallies with the caldigate letter i have measured them to the twentieth part of an inch and i am sure that early in may 73 there was not a stamp in use in the sydney office which could have made that impression i have eighteen mays 73 and not one of them could have been made by the stamp that did this as he spoke thus he rapped his finger down on the copy of the sacred envelope which he was using is not that conclusive  if it was not conclusive to keep a man from going to prison said curlydown remembering the failure of his own examination it will not be conclusive to get him out again  there i differ no doubt further evidence is necessary and therefore i must go to sydney  if it is conclusive i dont see why you should go to sydney at all if your proof is so perfect why should that fellow be kept in prison while you are running about the world  this idea had also occurred to bagwax and he had thought whether it would be possible for him to be magnanimous enough to perfect his proof in england so as to get a pardon from the secretary of state at once to his own manifest injury what would satisfy you and me said bagwax wouldnt satisfy the ignorant to the conductor of an omnibus on the surrey side of the river the man who does not know what the castle means is ignorant the outsider who is in a mist as to the former question or the order of the day is ignorant to the member of parliament to have no definite date conveyed by the term rogation sunday is to the clerical mind gross ignorance the horsey man thinks you have been in bed all your life if the near side is not as descriptive to you as the left hand to bagwax and curlydown not to distinguish postmarks was to be ignorant i fear it wouldnt satisfy the ignorant said bagwax thinking of his projected journey to sydney  proof is proof said curlydown i dont think youll ever get him out the time has gone by but you may do just as much here as there  im sure we shall get him out ill never rest in my bed till we have got him out  mr justice bramber wont mind whether you rest in your bed or notnor yet the secretary of state  sir john joram began bagwax in these discussions sir john joram was always his main staff  sir john joram has got other fish to fry before this time its a marvel to me bagwax that they should give way to all this nonsense if anything could be done it could be done in half the timeand if anything could be done it could be done here by the time youre back from sydney caldigates time will be half out why dont you let sir john see your proof you dont want to lose your trip i suppose  caldigate was languishing in prison and that poor nameless lady was separated from her husband and he had the proof lying there on the table before himsufficient proof as he did in his heart believe but how often does it fall to the lot of a postoffice clerk to be taken round the world free of expense the way curlydown put it was illnatured and full of envy bagwax was well aware that curlydown was instigated solely by envy but still these were his own convictionsand bagwax was in truth a softhearted conscientious man  i do think it ought to be enough for any secretary of state said he and ill go to sir john joram tomorrow of course i should like to see the worldwho wouldnt but id rather be the means of restoring that fellow to his poor wife than be sent to all the four quarters of the globe with a guinea aday for personal expenses in this way he nobly made up his mind to go at once to sir john joram     chapter xlviii  sir john jorams chambers    mr curlydowns insinuations had been very cruel but also very powerful bagwax as he considered the matter that night in his bed did conscientiously think that a discreet and humane secretary of state would let the unfortunate husband out of prison on the evidence which he bagwax had already collected my readers will not perhaps agree with him the finding of a jury and the sentence of a judge must be regarded seriously by secretaries of state and it is probable that bagwaxs theory would not make itself clear to that great functionary a good many ifs were necessary if the woman claiming caldigate as her husband would swear falsely to anything in that matter then she would swear falsely to everything if this envelope had never passed through the sydney postoffice then she would have sworn falsely about the letterand therefore her evidence would have been altogether false if this postmark had not been made in the due course of business and on the date as now seen then the envelope had not passed regularly through the sydney office so far it was all clear to the mind of bagwax and almost clear that the postmark could not have been made on the date it bore the result for which he was striving with true faith had taken such a hold of his mind he was so adverse to the smithcrinkett interest and so generously anxious for john caldigate and the poor lady at folking that he could not see obstacleshe could not even clearly see the very obstacles which made his own going to sydney seem to others to be necessary and yet he longed to go to sydney with all his heart he would be almost brokenhearted if he were robbed of that delight  in this frame of mind he packed all his envelopes carefully into a large handbag and started in a cab for sir john jorams chambers where are you going with them now curlydown asked somewhat disdainfully just as bagwax was starting curlydown had taken upon himself of late to ridicule the envelopes and had become almost an anticaldigatite bagwax vouchsafed to make him no reply on the previous afternoon he had declared his purpose of going at once to sir john and had written as curlydown well knew a letter to sir johns clerk to make an appointment sir john was known to be in town though it was the end of august being a laborious man who contented himself with a little partridgeshooting by way of holiday it had been understood that he was to see bagwax before his departure all this had been known to curlydown and the question had been asked only to exasperate there was a sarcasm in the now which determined bagwax to start without a word of reply  as he went down to the temple in the cab he turned over in his mind a great question which often troubles many of us how far was he bound to sacrifice himself for the benefit of others he had done his duty zealously in this matter and now was under orders to continue the work in a manner which opened up to him a whole paradise of happiness how grand was this opportunity of seeing something of the world beyond st martinslegrand and then the pecuniary gain would be so great hitherto he had received no pay for what he had done he was a simple postoffice clerk and was paid for his time by the crownvery moderately on this projected journey all his expenses would be paid for him and still he would have his salary sir john joram had declared the journey to be quite necessary the secretary of state had probably not occupied his mind much with the matter but in the mind of bagwax there was a fixed idea that the secretary thought of little else and that the secretary had declared that his hands were tied till bagwax should have been to sydney but his conscience told him that the journey was not necessary and that the delay would be cruel in that cab bagwax made up his mind that he would do his duty like an honest man  sir johns chambers in pump court were gloomy without though commodious and ample within bagwax was now well known to the clerk and was received almost as a friend i think ive got it all as clear as running water mr jones he said feeling no doubt that sir johns clerk mr jones must feel that interest in the case which pervaded his own mind  that will be a good thing for the gentleman in prison mr bagwax  and for the lady poor lady i dont know whether i dont think almost more of her than of him mr jones was returning to his work having sent in word to sir john of this visitors arrival but bagwax was too full of his subject and of his own honesty for that i dont think that i need go out after all mr jones  oh indeed  of course it will be a great sell for me  will it now  sydney i am told is an elysium upon earth  its much the same as botany bay isnt it asked jones  oh not at all quite a different place i was reading a book the other day which said that sydney harbour is the most beautiful thing god ever made on the face of the globe  i know there used to be convicts there said mr jones very positively  perhaps they had a few once but never many they have oranges there and a parliament almost as good as our own and a beautiful new postoffice but i shant have to go mr jones of course a man has to do his duty  some do and more dont thats as far as i see mr bagwax  im all for nelsons motto mr jonesengland expects that every man this day shall do his duty in repeating these memorable words bagwax raised his voice  sir john dont like to hear anything through the partition mr bagwax  i beg pardon but whenever i think of that glorious observation i am apt to become a little excited itll go a long way mr jones in keeping a man straight if hell only say it to himself often enough  but not to roar it out in an eminent barristers chambers he didnt hear you i daresay only i thought id just caution you  quite right mr jones now i mean to do mine i think we can get the party out of prison without any journey to sydney at all and im not going to stand in the way of it i have devoted myself to this case and im not going to let my own interest stand in the way mr jones let a man be ever so humble england does expectthat hell do his duty  by george hell hear you mr bagwaxhe will indeed but at that moment sir johns bell was rung and bagwax was summoned into the great mans room sir john was sitting at a large officetable so completely covered with papers that a whole chaos of legal atoms seemed to have been deposited there by the fortuitous operation of ages bagwax who had his large bag in his hand looked forlornly round the room for some freer and more fitting board on which he might expose his documents but there was none there were bookshelves filled with books and a large sofa which was covered also with papers and another table laden with what seemed to be a concrete chaoswhereas the chaos in front of sir john was a chaos in solution sir john liked bagwax though he was generally opposed to zealous cooperators there was in the man a mixture of intelligence and absurdity of real feeling and affectation of genuine humility as to himself personally and of thorough confidence in himself postofficially which had gratified sir john and sir john had been quite sure that the postoffice clerk had intended to speak the absolute truth with an honest manly conviction in the innocence of his client and in the guilt of the witnesses on the other side he was therefore well disposed towards bagwax well mr bagwax he said so i understand you have got a little further in the matter since i saw you last  a good deal further sir john  as how perhaps you can explain it shortly  this was troublesome bagwax did not think that he could explain the matter very shortly he could not explain the matter at all without showing his envelopes and how was he to show them in the present condition of that room he immediately dived into his bag and brought forth the first bundle of envelopes perhaps sir john i had better put them out upon the floor he said  must i see all those  there were many more bundles within which bagwax was anxious that the barrister should examine minutely it is very important sir john it is indeed it is really altogether a case of postmarksaltogether we have never in our branch had anything so interesting before if we can show that that envelope certainly was not stamped with that postmark in the sydney postoffice on the 10th may 1873 then we shall get him outshant we  it will be very material mr bagwax said sir john cautiously  they will all have sworn falsely and then somebody must have obtained the postmark surreptitiously there must have been a regular plant the stamp must have been made up and dated on purposeso as to give a false date some official in the sydney postoffice must have been employed  thats what we want you to find out over there said sir john who was not quite so zealous perhaps not quite so conscientious as his more humble assistantwhose mind was more occupied with other matters youll find out all that at sydney  the temptation was very great sir john wanted him to gotold him that he ought to go sir john was the man responsible for the whole matter he bagwax had done his best could it be right for him to provoke sir john by contesting the mattercontesting it so much to his own disadvantage had he not done enough for honestyenough to satisfy even that grand idea of duty as he turned the bundle of documents round in his hand he made up his mind that he had not done enough there was a little gurgle in his throat almost a tear in his eye as he replied i dont think i should be wanted to go if you would look at these envelopes  sir john understood it all at onceand there was much to understand he knew how anxious the man was to go on this projected journey and he perceived the cause which was inducing him to surrender his own interests he remembered that the journey must be made at a great expense to his own client he ran over the case in his mind and acknowledged to himself that conclusive evidenceevidence that should be quite conclusiveof fraud as to the envelope might possibly suffice to release his client at once from prison he told himself also that he could not dare to express an opinion on the matter himself without a close inspection of those postmarksthat a close inspection might probably take two hours and that the two hours would finally have to be abstracted from the already curtailed period of his nightly slumbers then he thought of the state of his tables and the difficulties as to space perhaps that idea was the one strongest in his mind against the examination  but then what a hero was bagwax what selfabnegation was there should he be less ready to devote himself to his clienthe who was paid for his workthan this postoffice clerk who was as pure in his honesty as he was zealous in the cause there are a great many of them i suppose he said almost whining  a good many sir john  have at it said the queens counsel and late attorneygeneral springing up from his chair bagwax almost jumped out of the way so startled was he by the quick and sudden movement sir john rang his bell but not waiting for the clerk began to hurl the chaos in solution on to the top of the concrete chaos bagwax naturally attempted to assist him for gs sake dont you touch them said sir john as though avenging himself by a touch of scorn for the evil thing which was being done to him then jones hurried into the room and with more careful hands assisted his master trying to preserve some order with the disturbed papers in this way the large officetable was within three minutes made clear for the bagwaxian strategy mr jones declared afterwards that it was seven years since he had seen the entire top of that table now go ahead said sir john who seemed during the operation to have lost something of his ordinary dignity  bagwax who since that little check had been standing perfectly still with his open bag in his hands at once began his work the plain before him was immense and he was able to marshal all his forces in the centre and nearest to sir john as he sat in his usual chair were exposed all the mays 73 for it was thus that he denominated the envelopes with which he was so familiar there were 71s and 72s and 74s and 75s but the 73s were all arranged in months and then in days he began by explaining that he had obtained all these envelopes promiscuously as he said there had been no selection none had been rejected then courteously handing his official magnifyingglass to the barrister he invited him to inspect them all generallyto make as it were a first cursory inspectionso that he might see that there was not one perfect impression perfect as that impression on the caldigate envelope was perfect not one said bagwax beating his bosom in triumph  that seems perfect said sir john pointing with the glass to a selected specimen  your eyes are very good sir johnvery good indeed you have found the cleanest and truest of the whole lot but if youll examine the tail of the y youll see its been rubbed a little and then if youll follow with your eye the circular line which makes up the round of the postmark youll find a dent on the outside bar i go more on the dents in those bars sir john than i do on the figures all the bars are dented more or lessparticularly the mays 73 they dont remain quite true sir johnnot after a days fair use theyve taken a new stamp out of the store to do the caldigate envelope they couldnt get at the stamps in use thats how it has been  sir john listened in silence as he continued to examine one envelope after another through the glass now sir john if we come to the mays 73 we shall find that just about that time there has been no new stamp brought into use there isnt one either that is exactly the caldigate breadth ive brought a rule by which you can get to the fiftieth of an inch here bagwax brought out a little ivory instrument marked all over with figures of course theyre intended to be of the same pattern but gradually very gradually the circle has always become smaller isnt that conclusive the caldigate impression is a little very littleever so littlebut a little smaller than any of the mays 73 isnt that conclusive  if i understand it mr bagwax you dont pretend to say that you have got impressions of all the stamps which may have been in use in the sydney office at that time but in sydney if i understand the matter rightly they keep daily impressions of all the stamps in a book  just sojust so sir john said bagwax feeling that every word spoken to the lawyer renewed his own hopes of going out to sydneybut feeling also that sir john would be wrong very wrong if he subjected his client to so unnecessarily prolonged a detention in the cambridge county prison they do keep a book which would be quite conclusive i could have the pages photographed  would not that be best and you might probably find out who it was who gave this fraudulent aid  i could find out everything said bagwax energetically but  but what  it is all found out there it is indeed sir john if i could get you to go along with me you would see that that letter couldnt have gone through the sydney postoffice  i think i do see it but it is so difficult mr bagwax to make others see things  and if it didntand it never didbut if it didnt why did they say it did why did they swear it did isnt that enough to make any secretary let him go  the energy the zeal the true faith of the man were admirable sir john was half disposed to rise from his seat to embrace the man and hail him as his brotheronly that had he done so he would have made himself as ridiculous as bagwax zeal is always ridiculous i think i see it all he said  and wont they let the man go  there were four persons who swore positively that they were present at the marriage one of them being the woman who is said to have been married that is direct evidence with all our search we have hitherto found no one to give us any direct evidence to rebut this then they brought forward to corroborate these statements a certain amount of circumstantial evidenceand among other things this letter  the caldigate envelope said bagwax eagerly  what you call the caldigate envelope it was unnecessary perhaps and if fraudulent certainly foolish they would have had their verdict without it  but they did it said bagwax in a tone of triumph  it is a pity mr bagwax you were not brought up to our profession you would have made a great lawyer  oh sir john  yes they did it and if it can be proved that they have done it fraudulently no doubt that fraud will stain their direct evidence but we have to remember that the verdict has been already obtained we are not struggling now with a jury but with an impassive emblem of sovereign justice  and therefore the real facts will go the further sir john  well argued mr bagwaxadmirably well argued if you should ever be called i hope i may not have you against me very often but i will think of it all you can take the envelopes away with you because you have impressed me vividly with all that they can tell me my present impression is that you had better take the journey but within the next few days i will give a little more thought to it and you shall hear from me then he put out his hand which was a courtesy mr bagwax had never before enjoyed you may believe me mr bagwax when i say that i have come across many remarkable men in many cases which have fallen into my handsbut that i have rarely encountered a man whom i have more thoroughly respected than i do you  mr bagwax went away to his own lodging exultingbut more than ever resolved that the journey to sydney was unnecessary as usual he spent a large portion of that afternoon in contemplating the envelopes and then as he was doing so another idea struck himan idea which made him tear his hairs with disgust because it had not occurred to him before there was now opened to him a new scope of inquiry an altogether different matter of evidence but the idea was by far too important to be brought in and explained at the fagend of a chapter     chapter xlix  all the shands    there had been something almost approaching to exultation at babington when the tidings of caldigates alleged australian wife were first heard there as the anger had been great that julia should be rejected so had the family congratulation been almost triumphant when the danger which had been escaped was appreciated there had been something of the same feeling at pollington among the shandswho had no doubt allowed themselves to think that maria had been illtreated by john caldigate he ought to have married mariaat least such was the opinion of the ladies of the family who were greatly impressed with the importance of the little book which had been carried away but in regard to the australian marriage they had differed among themselves that maria should have escaped the terrible doom which had befallen mrs boltons daughter was of course a source of comfort but maria herself would never believe the evil story john caldigate had not beenwell perhaps not quite true to her so much she acknowledged gently with the germ of a tear in her eye but she was quite sure that he would not have married hester bolton while another wife was living in australia she arose almost to enthusiasm as she vindicated his character from so base a stain he had been perhaps a little unstable in his affectionsas men are so commonly but not even when the jury found their verdict could she be got to believe that the john caldigate whom she had known would have betrayed a girl whom he loved as he was supposed to have betrayed hester bolton the mother and sisters who knew the softness of marias dispositionand who had been more angry than their sister with the man who had been wicked enough to carry away thomsons seasons in his portmanteau without marrying the girl who had put it therewould not agree to this the verdict at any rate was a verdict john caldigate was in prison the poor young woman with her infant was a nameless unfortunate creature all this might have happened to their maria i should always have believed him innocent said maria wiping away the germ of the tear with her knuckle  the matter was very often discussed in the doctors house at pollingtonas it was indeed by the public generally and especially in the eastern counties but in this house there a double interest attached to it in the first place there was marias escapewhich the younger girls were accustomed to talk of as having been almost miraculous and then there was dicks absolute disappearance it had been declared at the trial on behalf of caldigate that if dick could have been put into the witnessbox he would have been able to swear that there had been no such marriage ceremony as that which the four witnesses had elaborately described on the other hand the woman and crinkett had sworn boldly that dick shand though not present at the marriage had been well aware that it had taken place and that dick could his evidence have been secured would certainly have been a witness on their side he had been outside the tentso said the womanwhen the marriage was being performed and had refused to enter by way of showing his continued hostility to an arrangement which he had always opposed but when the woman said this it was known that dick shand would not appear and the opinion was general that dick had died in his poverty and distress men who sink to be shepherds in australia because they are noted drunkards generally do die the constrained abstinence of perhaps six months in the wilderness is agonising at first and nearly fatal then the poor wretch rushes to the joys of an orgy with ten or fifteen pounds in his pocket and the stuff which is given to him as brandy soon puts an end to his sufferings there was but little doubt that such had been the fate of dickunless perhaps in the bosom of maria and of his mother  it was known too at pollington as well as elsewhere in the month of august that efforts were still to be made with the view of upsetting the verdict something had crept out to the public as to the researches made by bagwax and allusions had been frequent as to the unfortunate absence of dick shand the betting had there been betting would no doubt have been in favour of the verdict the four witnesses had told their tale in a straightforward way and though they were from their characters not entitled to perfect credit still their evidence had in no wise been shaken they were mean dishonest folk no doubt they had taken caldigates money and had still gone on with the prosecution even if there had been some sort of a marriage the woman should have taken herself off when she had received her money and left poor hester to enjoy her happiness her husband and her home at bolton that was the general feeling but it was hardly thought that bagwax with his envelope would prevail over judge bramber in the mind of the secretary of state probably there had been a marriage but it was singular that the two men who could have given unimpeachable evidence on the matter should both have vanished out of the world allan the ministerand dick shand the miner and shepherd  what will she do when he comes out maria asked mrs rewbleharrietthe curates wife was there mr rewble as curate found it convenient to make frequent visits to his fatherinlaws house and mrs posttlethwaitematildawas with them as mr posttlethwaites business in the soap line caused him to live at pollington and there were two unmarried sisters fanny and jane mrs rewble was by this time quite the matron and mrs posttlethwaite was also the happy mother of children but maria was still maria fanny already had a string to her bowand jane was expectant of many strings  she ought to go back to her father and mother of course said mrs rewble indignantly  i know i wouldnt said jane  you know nothing about it miss and you ought not to speak of such a thing said the curates wife jane at this made a grimace which was intended to be seen only by her sister fanny  it is very hard that two loving hearts should be divided said maria  i never thought so much of john caldigate as you did said mrs posttlethwaite he seems to have been able to love a good many young women all at the same time  its like tasting a lot of cheeses till you get the one that suits you said jane this offended the elder sister so grievously that she declared she did not know what their mother was about to allow such liberty to the girls and then suggested that the conversation should be changed  im sure i did not say anything wrong said jane and i suppose it is like that a gentleman has to find out whom he likes best and as he liked miss bolton best i think its a thousand pities they should be parted  ten thousand pities said maria enthusiastically  particularly as there is a baby said janeupon which mrs rewble was again very angry  if dick were to come home hed clear it all up at once said mrs posttlethwaite  dick will never come home said matilda mournfully  never said mrs rewble i am afraid that he has expiated all his indiscretions it should make us who were born girls thankful that we have not been subjected to the same temptations  i should like to be a man all the same said jane  you do not at all know what you are saying replied the monitor how little have you realized what poor dick must have suffered i wonder when they are going to let us have tea im almost famished mrs rewble was known in the family for having a good appetite they were sitting at this moment round a table on the lawn at which they intended to partake of their evening meal the doctor might or might not join them mrs shand who did not like the open air would have hers sent to her in the drawingroom mr rewble would certainly be there mr posttlethwaite who had been home to his dinner had gone back to the soapworks dont you think jane if you were to go in you could hurry them then jane went in and hurried the servant  theres a strange man with papa said jane as she returned  there are always strange men with papa said fanny i daresay he has come to have his tooth out for the doctors practice was altogether general from a baby to a backtooth he attended to everything now as he had done forty years ago  but this man isnt like a patient the door was half open and i saw papa holding him by both hands  a lunatic exclaimed mrs rewble thinking that mr rewble ought to be sent at once to her fathers assistance  he was quite quiet and just for a moment i could see papas face it wasnt a patient at all oh maria  what is it child asked mrs rewble  i do believe that dick has come back  they all jumped up from their seats suddenly then mrs rewble reseated herself jane is such a fool she said  i do believe it said jane he had yellow trousers on as if he had come from a long way off and im sure papa was very gladwhy should he take both his hands  i feel as though my legs were sinking under me said maria  i dont think it possible for a moment said mrs rewble maria you are so romantic you would believe anything  it is possible said mrs posttlethwaite  if you will remain here i will go into the house and inquire said mrs rewble but it did not suit the others to remain there for a moment the suggestion had been so awful that they had not dared to stir but when the elder sister slowly moved towards the door which led into the house from the garden they all followed her then suddenly they heard a scream which they knew to come from their mother i believe it is dick said mrs rewble standing in the doorway so as to detain the others what ought we to do  let me go in said jane impetuously he is my brother  maria was already dissolved in tears mrs posttlethwaite was struck dumb by the awfulness of the occasion and clung fast to her sister matilda  it will be like one from the grave said mrs rewble solemnly  let me go in repeated jane impetuously then she pushed by her sisters and was the first to enter the house they all followed her into the hall and there they found their mother supported in the arms of the man who wore the yellow trousers dick shand had in truth returned to his fathers house  the first thing to do with a returned prodigal is to kiss him and the next to feed him and therefore dick was led away at once to the table on the lawn but he gave no sign of requiring the immediate slaughter of a fatted calf though he had not exactly the appearance of a welltodo english gentleman he did not seem to be in want the yellow trousers were of strong material and in good order made of that colour for colonial use probably with the idea of expressing some contempt for the dingy hues which prevail among the legs of men at home he wore a very large checked waistcoat and a stout square coat of the same material there was no look of poverty and no doubt he had that day eaten a substantial dinner but the anxious mother was desirous of feeding him immediately and whispered to jane some instructions as to cold beef which was to be added to the tea and toast  as they examined him holding him by the arms and hands and gazing up into his face the same idea occurred to all of them though they knew him very well now they would hardly have known him had they met him suddenly in the streets he seemed to have grown fifteen years older during the seven years of his absence his face had become thin and long and almost hollow his beard went all round under his chin and was clipped into the appearance of a stiff thick hedgeequally thick and equally broad and equally protrusive at all parts and within this enclosure it was shorn but his mouth had sunk in and his eyes in colour he was almost darker than brown you would have said that his skin had been tanned black but for the infusion of red across it here and there he seemed to be in good present health but certainly bore the traces of many hardships and here you are all just as i left you he said counting up his sisters  not exactly said mrs rewble remembering her family and matilda has got two  not husbands i hope said dick  oh dick that is so like you said jane getting up and kissing him again in her delight then mr rewble came forward and the brothersinlaw renewed their old acquaintance  it seems just like the other day said dick looking round upon the rosebushes  oh my boy my darling darling boy said the mother who had hurried upstairs for her shawl conscious of her rheumatism even amidst the excitement of her sons return oh dick this is the happiest day of all my life wouldnt you like something better than tea this she said with many memories and many thoughts but still with a mothers love unable to refrain from offering what she thought her son would wish to have  there aint anything better said dick very solemnly  nothing half so good to my thinking said mrs rewble imagining that by a word in season she might help the good work  the mothers eyes were filled with tears but she did not dare to speak a word then there was a silence for a few moments tell us all about it dick said the father theres whisky inside if you like it dick shook his head solemnlybut as they all thought with a certain air of regret tell us what you have to say repeated the doctor  im sworn off these two years  touched nothing for two years said the mother exultingly with her arms and shawl again round her sons neck  a teetotaller said maria  anything you like to call it only what a gentlemans habits are in that respect neednt be made the subject of general remark it was evident he was a little sore and jane therefore offered him a dish full of gooseberries he took the plate in his hand and ate them assiduously for a while in silence as though unconscious of what he was doing you know all about it now dont you  oh my dearest boy ejaculated the mother  you didnt get better gooseberries than those on your travels said the doctor calling him back to the condition of the world around him  then he told them of his adventures for two terrible years he had been a shepherd on different sheepruns up in queensland then he had found employment on a sugar plantation and had superintended the work of a gang of south sea islanderscanakers they are calledmen who are brought into the colony from the islands of the pacificand who return thence to their homes generally every three years much to the regret of their employers in the transit of these men agents are employed and to this service dick had after a term found himself promoted then it had come to pass that he had remained for a period on one of these islands with the view of persuading the men to emigrate and reemigrate and had thus been resident among them for more than a couple of years they had used him well and he had liked the islandshaving lived in one of them without seeing another european for many months then the payments which had from time to time been made to him by the queensland planters were stopped and his business such as it had been came to an end he had found himself with just sufficient money to bring him home and here he was  my boy my darling boy exclaimed his mother again as though all their joint troubles were now over  the doctor remembered the adage of the rolling stone and felt that the return of a son at the age of thirty without any means of maintaining himself was hardly an unalloyed blessing he was not the man to turn a son out of doors he had always broadened his back to bear the full burden of his large family but even at this moment he was a little melancholy as he thought of the difficulty of finding employment for the wearer of those yellow trousers how was it possible that a man should continue to live an altogether idle life at pollington and still remain a teetotaller have you any plans i can help you in now he asked  of course hell remain at home for a while before he thinks of anything said the mother  i suppose i must look about me said dick bytheby what has become of john caldigate  they all at once gazed at each other it could hardly be that he did not in truth know what had become of john caldigate  havent you heard asked maria  of course he has heard said mrs rewble  you must have heard said the mother  i dont in the least know what you are talking about i have heard nothing at all  in very truth he had heard nothing of his old friendnot even that he had returned to england then by degrees the whole story was told to him i know that he was putting a lot of money together said dick enviously married hester bolton i thought he would bigamy euphemia smith married before certainly not at the diggings  he wasnt married up at ahalala asked the doctor  to euphemia smith i was there when they quarrelled and when she went into partnership with crinkett i am sure there was no such marriage john caldigate in prison for bigamy and he paid them twenty thousand pounds the more fool he  they all say that  but its an infernal plant as sure as my name is richard shand john caldigate never married that woman     chapter l  again at sir johns chambers    and this was the man as to whom it had been acknowledged that his evidence if it could be obtained would be final the return of dick himself was to the shands an affair so much more momentous than the release of john caldigate from prison that for some hours or so the latter subject was allowed to pass out of sight the mother got him upstairs and asked after his linenvain inquiryand arranged for his bed turning all the little rewbles into one small room in the long run grandmothers are more tender to their grandchildren than their own offspring but at this moment dick was predominant how grand a thing to have her son returned to her and such a sona teetotaller of two years growth who had seen all the world of the pacific ocean as he could not take whiskyandwater would he like gingerbeer before he went to bedor arrowroot dick decided in favour of gingerbeer and consented to be embraced again  it was i think to marias credit that she was the first to bring back the conversation to john caldigates marriage was she a very horrible woman maria asked referring to euphemia smith  there were a good many of em out there greedy after gold said dick but she beat em all and she was awfully clever  in what way dick asked mrs rewble because she does not seem to me to have done very well with herself  she knew more about shares than any man of them all but i think she just drank a little it was that which disgusted caldigate  he had been very fond of her suggested maria  i never knew a man so taken with a woman maria blushed and mrs rewble looked round at her younger sisters as though desirous that they should be sent to bed all that began on board the ship then he was fool enough to run after her down to sydney and of course she followed him up to the mines  i dont know why of course said mrs posttlethwaite defending her sex generally  well she did and he was going to marry her he did mean to marry hertheres no doubt of that but it was a queer kind of life we lived up there  i suppose so said the doctor mrs rewble again looked at the girls and then at her mother but mrs shand was older and less timid than her married daughter mrs rewble when a girl herself had never been sent away and was now a pattern of female discretion  and she continued dick as soon as she had begun to finger the scrip thought of nothing but gold she did not care much for marriage just then because she fancied the stuff wouldnt belong to herself she became largely concerned in the old stickinthemud that was crinketts concern and there were times at which i thought she would marry him then caldigate got rid of her altogether that was before i went away  he never married her asked the doctor  he certainly hadnt married her when i left nobble in june 73  you can swear to that dick  certainly i can i was with him every day but there wasnt anyone round there who didnt know how it was crinkett himself knew it  crinkett is one of the gang against him  and there was a man named adamson adamson knew  hes another of the conspirators said the doctor  they wont dare to say before me declared dick stoutly that mrs smith and john caldigate had become man and wife before june 73 and they hated one another so much then that it is impossible they should have come together since i can swear they were not married up to june 73  youll have to swear it said the doctor and that with as little delay as possible  all this took place towards the end of august about five weeks after the trial and a day or two subsequent to the interview between bagwax and the attorneygeneral bagwax was now vehemently prosecuting his inquiries as to that other idea which had struck him and was at this very moment glowing with the anticipation of success and at the same time brokenhearted with the conviction that he never would see the pleasant things of new south wales  on the next morning under the auspices of his father dick shand wrote the following letter to mr seely the attorney       pollington 30th august 187      siri think it right to tell you that i reached my fathers house     in this town late yesterday evening i have come direct from one of     the south sea islands via honolulu and san francisco and have not     yet been in england fortyeight hours i am an old friend of mr     john caldigate and went with him from england to the gold diggings     in new south wales my name will be known to you as i am now aware     that it was frequently mentioned in the course of the late trial it     will probably seem odd to you that i had never even heard of the     trial till i reached my fathers house last night i did not know     that caldigate had married miss bolton nor that euphemia smith had     claimed him as her husband      i am able and willing to swear that they had not become man and     wife up to june 1873 and that no one at ahalala or nobble conceived     them to be man and wife of course they had lived together but     everybody knew all about it some time before juneearly i should     say in that autumnthere had been a quarrel i am sure they were     at daggers drawn with each other all that april and may in respect     to certain mining shares as to which euphemia smith behaved very     badly i dont think it possible that they should ever have come     together again but in may 73which is the date i have heard     namedthey certainly were not man and wife      i have thought it right to inform you of this immediately on my     return and am your obedient servant      richard shand   mr seely when he received this letter found it to be his duty to take it at once to sir john joram up in london he did not believe dick shand but then he had put no trust in bagwax and had been from the first convinced in his own mind that caldigate had married the woman as soon as it was known to him that his client had paid twenty thousand pounds to crinkett and the woman he was quite sure of the guilt of his client he had done the best for caldigate at the trial as he would have done for any other client but he had never felt any of that enthusiasm which had instigated sir john now that caldigate was in prison mr seely thought that he might as well be left there quietly trusting to the verdict trusting to judge bramber and trusting still more strongly on his own early impressions this letter from dickwhom he knew to have been a ruined drunkard a disgrace to his family and an outcast from societywas to his thinking just such a letter as would be got up in such a case in the futile hope of securing the succour of a secretary of state he was sure that no secretary of state would pay the slightest attention to such a letter but still it would be necessary that he should show it to sir john and as a trip to london was not disagreeable to his professional mind he started with it on the very day of its receipt  of course we must have his deposition on oath said sir john  you think it will be worth while  certainly i am more convinced than ever that there was no marriage that postoffice clerk has been with mebagwaxand has altogether convinced me  i didnt think so much of bagwax sir john  i dare say not mr seelyan absurdly energetic manone of those who destroy by their overzeal all the credit which their truth and energy ought to produce but he has i think convinced me that that letter could not have passed through the sydney postoffice in may 73  if so sir john even that is not muchtowards upsetting a verdict  a good deal i think when the characters of the persons are considered now comes this man whom we all should have believed had he been present and tells this story you had better get hold of him and bring him to me mr seely  then mr seely hung up his hat in london for three or four days and sent to pollington for dick shand dick shand obeyed the order and both of them waited together upon sir john you have come back at a very critical point of time for your friend said the barrister  dick had laid aside the coat and waistcoat with the broad checks and the yellow trousers and had made himself look as much like an english gentleman as the assistance of a readymadeclothes shop at pollington would permit but still he did not quite look like a man who had spent three years at cambridge his experiences among the gold diggings then his period of maddening desolation as a queensland shepherd and after that his life among the savages in a south sea island had done much to change him sir john and mr seely together almost oppressed him but still he was minded to speak up for his friend caldigate had upon the whole been very good to him and dick was honest he has been badly used any way he said  you have had no intercourse with any of his friends since you have been home i think this question sir john asked because mr seely had suggested that this appearance of the man at this special moment might not improbably be what he called a plant  i have had no intercourse with anybody sir i came here last friday and i hadnt spoken a word to anybody before that i didnt know that caldigate had been in trouble at all my people at pollington were the first to tell me about it  then you wrote to mr seely you have heard of mr seely  the governorthats my fatherhe had heard of mr seely i wrote first as he told me they knew all about it at pollington as well as you do  you were surprised then when you heard the story  knocked off my pins sir i never was so much taken aback in my life to be told that john caldigate had married euphemia smith after all that i had seenand that he had been married to her in may 73 i knew of course that it was all a gotup thing and hes in prison  he is in prison certainly  for bigamy  indeed he is mr shand  and how about his real wife  his real wife as you call her  she is as sure as my name is richard shand  it is on behalf of that lady that we are almost more anxious than for mr caldigate himself in this matter she has been perfectly innocent and whoever may have been the culpritor culpritsshe has been cruelly illused  shell have her husband back again of course said dick  that will depend in part upon what faith the judge who tried the case may place in your story your deposition shall be taken and it will be my duty to submit it to the secretary of state he will probably be actuated by the weight which this further evidence will have upon the judge who heard the former evidence you will understand mr shand that your word will be opposed to the words of four other persons  four perjured scoundrels said dick with energy  just soif your story be true  it is true sir said dick with much anger in his tone  i hope sowith all my heart you are on the same side with us you know i only want to make you understand how much ground there may be for doubt it is not easy to upset a verdict and i fear many righteous verdicts would be upset if the testimony of one man could do it perhaps you will be able to prove that you only arrived at liverpool on saturday night  certainly i can  you cannot prove that you had not heard of the case before  certainly i can i can swear it sir john smiled they all knew that at pollington they told me of it the governor told me about mr seely and made me write the letter  that would not be evidence said sir john  heavens on earth i tell you i was struck all on a heap when i heard it just as much as if they had said hed been hung for murder you put crinkett and me together and then youll know i suppose you think somebodys paying me for thisthat ive got a regular tip  not at all mr shand and i quite understand that it should be difficult for you to understand when a man sees a thing clearly himself he cannot always realise the fact that others do not see it also i think i perceive what you have to tell us and we are very much obliged to you for coming forward so immediately perhaps you would not mind sitting in the other room for five minutes while i say a word to mr seely  i can go away altogether  mr seely will be glad to see you again with reference to the deposition you will have to make you shall not be kept waiting long then dick returned with a sore heart feeling half inclined to blaze out in wrath against the great advocate he had come forward to tell a plain story having nothing to gain paying his railway fare and other expenses out of his ownor rather out of his fathers pocket and was told he would not be believed it is always hard to make an honest witness understand that it may be the duty of others to believe him to be a liar and dick shand did not understand it now  there was no australian marriage sir john said as soon as he was alone with mr seely  you think not  my mind is clear about it we must get that man out if it be only for the sake of the lady  it is so very easy sir john to have a story like that made up  i have had to do with a good many madeup stories mr seelyand with a good many true stories  of course sir johnno man with more  he might be a party to making up a story there is nothing that i have seen in him to make me sure that he could not come forward with a determined perjury i shouldnt think it but it would be possible but his father and mother and sisters wouldnt join him dick had told the story of the meeting on the lawn at great length and had it been a plot he couldnt have imposed upon them he wouldnt have brought them into it and who would have got at him to arrange the plot  old caldigate  sir john shook his head neither old caldigate nor young caldigate knew anything of that kind of work and then his story tallies altogether with my hero bagwax of bagwax i am quite sure and as shand corroborates bagwax i am nearly sure of him also you must take his deposition and let me have it it should be rather full as it may be necessary to hear the depositions also of the doctor and his wife we shall have to get him out  you know best sir john  we shall have to get him out mr seely i think said sir john rising from his chair then mr seely took his leave as was intended  mr seely was not at all convinced he was quite willing that john caldigate should be released from prison and that the australian marriage should be so put out of general credit in england as to allow the young people to live in comfort at folking as man and wife but he liked to feel that he knew better himself he would have been quite content that mrs john caldigate should be mrs john caldigate to all the worldthat all the world should be imposed onso that he was made subject to no imposition in this matter sir john appeared to him to be no wider awake than a mere layman it was clear to mr seely that dick shands story was got upand very well got up he had no pang of conscience as to using it but when it came to believing it that was quite another thing the man turning up exactly at the moment and such a man and then his pretending never to have heard of a case so famous never to have heard this story of his most intimate friend and then his notorious poverty old caldigate would of course be able to buy such a man and then sir johns fatuity as to bagwax he could hardly bring himself to believe that sir john was quite in earnest but he was well aware that sir john would knowno one betterby what arguments such a verdict as had been given might be practically set aside the verdict would remain but a pardon if a pardon could be got from the secretary of state would make the condition of the husband and wife the same as though there had been no verdict the indignities which they had already suffered would simply produce for them the affectionate commendation of all england mr seely felt all that and was not at all averse to a pardon he was not at all disposed to be severe on caldigate senior if as he thought caldigate senior had bribed this convenient new witness but it was too much to expect that he should believe it all himself  you must come with me mr shand he said and we must take your story down in writing then you must swear to it before a magistrate  all right mr seely  we must be very particular you know  i neednt be particular at alland as to what sir john joram said i felt half inclined to punch his head  that wouldnt have helped us  it was only that i thought of caldigate in prison that i didnt do it because i have been roaming about the world not always quite as well off as himself he tells me that he doesnt believe my word  i dont think he said that  he didnt quite dare but what he said was as bad he told me that some one else wouldnt believe it i dont quite understand what it is theyre not to believe all i say is that they two were not married in may 73  but about your never having heard of the case till you got home  i never had heard a word about it one would think that i had done something wrong in coming forward to tell what i know the deposition however was drawn out in due form at considerable length and was properly attested before one of the london magistrates     chapter li  dick shand goes to cambridgeshire    the news of shands return was soon common in cambridge the tidings of course were told to mr caldigate and were then made known by him to hester the old man though he turned the matter much in his minddoubting whether the hopes thus raised would not add to hesters sorrow should they not ultimately be realiseddecided that he could not keep her in the dark her belief could not be changed by any statement which shand might make her faith was so strong that no evidence could shake itor confirm it but there would no doubt arise in her mind a hope of liberation if any new evidence against the australian marriage were to reach her which hope might so probably be delusive but he knew her to be strong to endure as well as strong to hope and therefore he told her at once then mr seely returned to cambridge and all the facts of shands deposition were made known at folking that will get him out at once of course said hester triumphantly as soon as she heard it but the squire was older and more cautious and still doubted he explained that dick shand was not a man who by his simple word would certainly convince a secretary of statethat deceit might be suspectedthat a fraudulent plot would be possible and that very much care was necessary before a convicted prisoner would be released  i am quite sure from mr seelys manner that he thinks i have bribed the young man said caldigate  you  yesi these are the ideas which naturally come into peoples heads i am not in the least angry with mr seely and feel that it is only too likely that the secretary of state and the judge will think the same if i were secretary of state i should have to think so  i couldnt suspect people like that  and therefore my dear you are hardly fit to be secretary of state we must not be too sanguine that is all  but hester was very sanguine when it was fully known that dick had written to mr seely immediately on his arrival at pollington and that he had shown himself to be a warm partisan in the caldigate interests she could not rest till she saw him herself and persuaded mr caldigate to invite him down to folking to folking therefore he went with the full intention of declaring john caldigates innocence not only there but all through cambridgeshire the boltons of whom he had now heard something should be made to know what an honest man had to say on the subjectan honest man and who was really on the spot at the time to dicks mind it was marvellous that the boltons should have been anxious to secure a verdict against caldigatewhich verdict was also against their own daughter and their own sister being quite sure himself that caldigate was innocent he could not understand the condition of feeling which would be produced by an equally strong conviction of his guilt nor was his mind probably imbued with much of that religious scruple which made the idea of a feigned marriage so insupportable to all hesters relations nor was he aware that when a man has taken a preconception home to himself and fastened it and fixed it as it were into his bosom he cannot easily expel iteven though personal interest should be on the side of such expulsion it had become a settled belief with the boltons that john caldigate was a bigamist which belief had certainly been strengthened by the pertinacious hostility of hesters mother dick had heard something of all this and thought that he would be able to open their eyes  when he arrived at folking he was received with open arms sir john joram had not quite liked him because his manner had been rough mr seely had regarded him from the first as a ruined man and therefore a willing perjurer even at pollington his bush manners had been a little distasteful to all except his mother mr caldigate felt some difficulty in making conversation with him but to hester he was as an angel from heaven she was never tired of hearing from him every detail as to her husbands life at ahalala and nobbleparticularly as to his life after euphemia smith had taken herself to those parts and had quarrelled with him the fact of the early infatuation had been acknowledged on all sides hester was able to refer to that as a mother boasting of her childs health may refer to the measleswhich have been bad and are past and gone euphemia smith had been her husbands measles men generally have the measles that was a thing so completely acknowledged that it was not now the source of discomfort and the disease had been very bad with him so bad that he had talked of marriagehad promised marriage crafty women do get hold of innocent men and drive them sometimes into perditionoften to the brink of perdition that was hesters theory as to her husband he had been on the brink but had been wise in time that was her creed and as it was supported by dick she found no fault with dicks mannernot even with the yellow trousers which were brought into use at folking  you were with him on that very day she said this referred to the day in april on which it had been sworn that the marriage was solemnized  i was with him every day about that time i cant say about particular days the truth isi dont mind telling you mrs caldigatei was drinking a good deal just then his present state of abstinence had of course become known at folking not without the expression of much marvel on the part of the old squire as to the quantity of tea which their visitor was able to swallow and as this abstinence had of course been admired dick had fallen into a way of confessing his past backslidings to a pretty sympathetic friendly woman who was willing to believe all that he said and to make much of him  but i suppose then she hesitated and dick understood the hesitation  i was never so bad said he but what i knew very well what was going on i dont believe caldigate and mrs smith even so much as spoke to each other all that month she had had a wonderful turn of luck  in getting gold  she had bought and sold shares till she was supposed to have made a pot of money people up there got an idea that she was one of the lucky onesand it did seem so then she got it into her head that she didnt want caldigate to know about her money and he was downright sick of her she had been goodlooking at one time mrs caldigate  i daresay most of them are so i suppose  and clever shed talk the hindlegs off a dog as we used to say out there  you had very odd sayings mr shand  indeed we had but when she got in that way about her money and then took to drinking brandy caldigate was only too glad to be rid of her crinkett believed in her because she had such a run of luck she held a lot of his sharesshares that used to be his so they got together and she left ahalala and went to polyeuka hall i remember it all as if it were yesterday when i broke away from caldigate in june and went to queensland they hadnt seen each other for two months and as for having been marriedyou might as well tell me that i had married her  if mr caldigate had ever allowed a shade of doubt to cross his mind as to his sons story dick shands further story removed it the picture of the life which was led at ahalala and nobble was painted for him clearly so that he could see or fancy that he saw what the condition of things had been and this increased faith trickled through to others mr bromley who had always believed believed more firmly than before and sent tidings of his belief to plumcumpippins and thence to babington mr holt the farmer became more than ever energetic and in a loud voice at a cambridge market ordinary declared the illusage done to caldigate and his young wife it had been said over and over again at the trial that dick shands evidence was the one thing wanted and here was dick shand to give his evidence then the belief gained ground in cambridge and with the belief there arose a feeling as to the egregious wrong which was being done  but the boltons were still assured none of them had as yet given any sign of yielding robert bolton knew very well that shand was at folking but had not asked to see him he and mr seely were on different sides and could not discuss the matter but their ideas were the same it was incredible to robert that dick shand should appear just at this moment unless as part of an arranged plan he could not read the whole plot but was sure that there was a plot it was held in his mind as a certain fact that john caldigate would not have paid away that large sum of money had he not thought that by doing so he was buying off crinkett and the other witnesses of course there had been a marriage in australia and therefore the arrival of dick shand was to him only a lifting of the curtain for another act of the play an attempt was to be made to get caldigate out of prison which attempt it was his duty to oppose caldigate had he thought deceived and inflicted a terrible stain on his family and therefore caldigate was an enemy upon whom it behoved him to be revenged this feeling was the stronger in his bosom because caldigate had been brought into the family by him  but when dick shand called upon him at his office he would not deny himself i have been told by some people that as i am here in the neighbourhood i ought to come and speak to you said dick the some people had been in the first instance mr ralph holt the farmer but dick had discussed the matter with mr bromley and mr bromley had thought that shands story should be told direct to hesters brother  if you have anything to say mr shand i am ready to hear it  all this about a marriage at ahalala between john caldigate and mrs smith is a gotup plan mr bolton  the jury did not seem to think so mr shand  i wasnt here then to let them know the truth robert bolton raised his eyebrows marvelling at the simplicity of the man who could fancy that his single word would be able to weigh down the weight of evidence which had sufficed to persuade twelve men and such a judge as judge bramber i was with caldigate all the time and im sure of what im saying the two werent on speaking terms when they were said to be married  of course mr shand as you have come to me i will hear what you may have to say but what is the use of it the man has been tried and found guilty  they can let him out again if hes innocent  the queen can pardon him no doubtbut even the queen cannot quash the conviction the evidence was as clear as noonday the judge and the jury and the public were all in one mind  but i wasnt here then said dick shand with perfect confidence robert bolton could only look at him and raise his eyebrows he could not tell him to his face that no unprejudiced person would believe the evidence of such a witness hes your brotherinlaw said dick and i supposed youd be glad to know that he was innocent  i cant go into that question mr shand as i believe him to have been guilty of as wicked a crime as any man can well commit i cannot concern myself in asking for a pardon for him my own impression is that he should have been sent to penal servitude  by george exclaimed dick i tell you that it is all a lie from beginning to end  i fear we cannot do any good by talking about it mr shand  by george dick hitched up his yellow trousers as though he were preparing for a fight he wore his yellow trousers without braces and in all moments of energy hitched them up  if you please i will say good morning to you  by george when i tell you that i was there all the time and that caldigate never spoke to the woman or so much as saw her all that month and that therefore your own sister is in honest truth caldigates wife you wont listen to me do you mean to say that im lying  mr shand i must ask you to leave my office  by george i wish i had you mr bolton out at ahalala where there are not quite so many policemen as there are here at cambridge  i shall have to send for one of them if you dont go away mr shand  heres a man who even for the sake of his own sister wont hear the truth just because he hates his sisters husband what have i got to get by lying  that i cannot tell bolton as he said this prepared himself for a sudden attack but shand had sense enough to know that he would injure the cause in which he was interested as well as himself by any exhibition of violence and therefore left the office  no said mr bromley when all this was told him he is not a cruel man nor dishonest nor even untrue to his sister but having quite made up his mind that caldigate had been married in australia he cannot release himself from the idea and as he thinks so he feels it to be his duty to keep his sister and caldigate apart  but why does he not believe me demanded dick  in answer to that i can only say that i do believe you  then there came a request from babington that dick shand would go over to them there for a day at babington opinion was divided aunt polly and her eldest daughter and with them mr smirkie still thought that john caldigate was a wicked bigamist but the squire and the rest of the family had gradually gone over to the other side the squire had never been hot against the offender having been one of those who fancied that a marriage at a very outoftheway place such as ahalala did not signify much and now when he heard of dick shands return and proffered evidence he declared that dick shand having been born a gentleman though he had been ever so much a sinner and ever so much a drunkard was entitled to credence before a host of crinketts but with aunt polly and julia there remained the sense of the old injury robbing shand of all his attributes of birth and endowing even crinkett with truth then there had been a few words and the squire had asserted himself and insisted upon asking shand to babington  did you ever see such trousers said julia to her mother i would not believe him on his oath  certainly not said mr smirkie who of the three was by far the most vehement in his adherence to the verdict the man is a notorious drunkard and he has that look of wildness which bad characters always bring with them from the colonies  he didnt drink anything but water at lunch said one of the younger girls  they never do when theyre eating said mr smirkie for the great teetotal triumph had not as yet been made known to the family at babington these regular drunkards take it at all times by themselves in their own rooms he has delirium tremens in his face i dont believe a word that he says  he certainly does wear the oddest trousers i ever saw said aunt polly  at the same time dick himself was closeted with the squire and was convincing him that there had been no australian marriage at all they didnt jump over a broomstick or anything of that kind asked the squire intending to be jocose  they did nothing at all said dick who had worked himself up to a state of great earnestness caldigate wouldnt as much as look at her at that timeand then to come home here and find him in prison because he had married her how any one should have believed it  they did believe it the women here believe it now as you perceive  its an awful shame mr babington think of her mr babington its harder on her even than him for he waswell fond of the woman once  it is hard but we must do what we can to get him out ill write to our member sir george supports the government and ill get him to see the secretary it is hard upon a young fellow just when he has got married and come into a nice property  and her mr babington  very bad indeed ill see sir george myself the odd part of it is the boltons are all against him old bolton never quite liked the marriage and his wife is a regular tartar  thus the squire was gained and the younger daughter but mr smirkie was as obdurate as ever something of his ground was cut from under his feet when dicks new and peculiar habits were observed at dinner mr smirkie did indeed cling to his doctrine that your real drunkard never drinks at his meals but when dick on being pressed in regard to wine apologised by saying that he had become so used to tea in the colonies as not to be able to take anything else at dinner the peculiarity was discussed till he was driven to own that he had drank nothing stronger for the last two years then it became plain that delirium tremens was not written on his face quite so plainly as mr smirkie had at first thought and there was nothing left but his trousers to condemn him but mr smirkie was still confident i dont think you can go beyond the verdict he said there may be a pardon of coursethough i shall never believe it till i see it but though there were twenty pardons she ought not to go back to him the pardon does not alter the crimeand whether he was married in australia or whether he was not she ought to think that he was because the jury has said so if she had any feeling of feminine propriety she would shut herself up and call herself miss bolton  i dont agree with you in the least said the squire and i hope i may live to see a dozen little caldigates running about on that lawn  and there were a few words upstairs on the subject between mr smirkie and his wifefor even mrs smirkie and aunt polly at last submitted themselves to dicks energy indeed then if he comes out said the wife i shall be very glad to see him at plumcumpippins this was said in a voice which did not admit of contradiction and was evidence at any rate that dicks visit to babington had been successful in spite of the yellow trousers     chapter lii  the fortunes of bagwax    an altogether new idea had occurred to bagwax as he sat in his office after his interview with sir john joramand it was an idea of such a nature that he thought that he saw his way quite plain to a complete manifestation of the innocence of caldigate to a certainty of a pardon and to an immediate end of the whole complication by a sudden glance at the evidence his eye had caught an object which in all his glances he had never before observed then at once he went to work and finding that certain little marks were distinctly legible he became on a sudden violently hotso that the sweat broke out on his forehead here was the whole thing disclosed at oncedisclosed to all the world if he chose to disclose it but if he did so then there could not be any need for that journey to sydney which sir john still thought to be expedient and this thing which he had now seen was not one within his own branch of workwas not a matter with which he was bound to be conversant somebody else ought to have found it out his own knowledge was purely accidental there would be no disgrace to him in not finding it out but he had found it out  bagwax was a man who in his official zeal and official capacity had exercised his intellect far beyond the matters to which he was bound to apply himself in the mere performance of his duties postmarks were his business and had he given all his mind to postmarks he would have sufficiently carried out that great doctrine of doing the duty which england expects from every man but he had travelled beyond postmarks and had looked into many things among other matters he had looked into penny stamps twopenny stamps and other stamps in postoffice phraseology there is sometimes a confusion because the affixed effigy of her majestys head which represents the postage paid is called a stamp and the postmarks or impressions indicating the names of towns are also called stamps those postmarks or impressions had been the work of bagwaxs life but his zeal his joy in his office and the general energy of his disposition had opened up to him also all the mysteries of the queens heads that stamp that effigy that twopenny queenshead which by its presence on the corner of the envelope purported to have been the price of conveying the letter from sydney to nobble on 10th may 1873 had certainly been manufactured and sent out to the colony since that date  there are signs invisible to ordinary eyes which are plain as the sun at noonday to the initiated it is so in all arts in all sciences bagwax was at once sure of his fact to his instructed gaze the little receipt for twopence was as clearly dated as though the figures were written on it and yet he had never looked at it before in the absorbing interest which the postmark had createdthat fraudulent postmark as it certainly washe had never condescended to examine the postagestamp but now he saw and was certain  if it was soand he had no doubtthen would caldigate surely be released it is hoped that the reader will follow the mind of bagwax which was in this matter very clear this envelope had been brought up at the trial as evidence that on a certain day caldigate had written to the woman as his wife and had sent the letter through the postoffice for such sending the postagestamp was necessary the postagestamp had certainly been put on when the envelope was prepared for its intended purpose but if it could be proved by the stamp itself that it had not been in existence on the date impressed on the envelope then the fraud would be quite apparent and if there had been such fraud then would the testimony of all those four witnesses be crushed into arrant perjury they had produced the fraudulent document and by it would be thoroughly condemned there could be no necessity for a journey to sydney  as it all became clear to his mind he thumped his table partly in triumphpartly in despair whats the matter with you now said mr curlydown it was a quarter past four and curlydown had not completed his daily inspections had bagwax been doing his proper share of work curlydown would have already washed his hands and changed his coat and have been ready to start for the 430 train as it was he had an hour of labour before him and would be unable to count the plums upon his wall as was usual with him before dinner  it becomes more wonderful every day said bagwax solemnlyalmost awfully  it is very wonderful to me that a man should be able to sit so many hours looking at one dirty bit of paper  every moment that i pass with that envelope before my eyes i see the innocent husband in jail and the poor afflicted wife weeping in her solitude  youll be going on to the stage bagwax before this is done  i have sometimes thought that it was the career for which i was best adapted but as to the envelope the facts are now certain  any new facts asked curlydown but he asked the question in a jeering tone not at all as though desiring confidence or offering sympathy  yes replied bagwax slowly the facts are certainly newand most convincing but as you have not given attention to the particular branch concerned there can be no good in my mentioning them you would not understand me it was thus that he revenged himself on curlydown then there was again silence between them for a quarter of an hour during which curlydown was hurrying through his work and bagwax was meditating whether it was certainly his duty to make known the facts as to the postagestamp you are so unkind said bagwax at last in a tone of injured friendship burning to tell his new discovery  you have got it all your way said curlydown without lifting his head and then as you said just nowi dont understand  id tell you everything if youd only be a little less hard  curlydown was envious he had of course been told of the civil things which sir john joram had said and though he did not quite believe all he was convinced that bagwax was supposed to have distinguished himself if there was anything to be known he would like to know it nor was he naturally quarrelsome bagwax was his old friend i dont mean to be hard he said of course one does feel oneself fretted when one has been obliged to miss two trains  can i lend a hand said bagwax  it doesnt signify now i cant catch anything before the 520 one does expect to get away a little earlier than that on a saturday what is it that youve found out  do you really care to know  of course i doif its anything in earnest i took quite as much interest as you in the matter when we were down at cambridge  you see that postagestamp bagwax stretched out the envelopeor rather the photograph of the envelope for it was no more but the queens head with all its obliterating smudges and all its marks and peculiarities were to be seen quite as plainly as on the original which was tied up carefully among the archives of the trial you see that postagestamp curlydown took his glass and looked at the document and declared that he saw the postagestamp very plainly  but it does not tell you anything particular  nothing very particularat the first glance said curlydown gazing through the glass with all his eyes  look again  i see that they obliterate out there with a kind of star  that has nothing to do with it  the bunch of hair at the back of the head isnt quite like our bunch of hair  just the sametaken from the same die said bagwax  the little holes for dividing the stamps are bigger  it isnt that  then what the d is it  there are letters at every corner said bagwax  thats of course said curlydown  can you read those letters curlydown owned that he never had quite understood what those letters meant those two ps in the two bottom corners tell me that that stamp wasnt printed before 74 it was all explained to me not long ago now the postmark is dated 73 there was an air of triumph about bagwax as he said this which almost drove curlydown back to hostility but he checked himself merely shaking his head and continued to look at the stamp what do you think of that asked bagwax  youd have to prove it  of course i should but the stamps are made here and are sent out to the colony i shall see smithers at the stampoffice on monday of course mr smithers was a gentleman concerned in the manufacture of stamps but i know my facts i am as well aware of the meaning of those letters as though i had made postagestamps my own peculiar duty now what ought i to do  you wouldnt have to go i suppose  not a foot  and yet it ought to be found out how that date got there and curlydown put his finger upon the impression10th may 1873  not a doubt about it i should do a deal of good by going if theyd give me proper authority to overhaul everything in the office out there they had the letter stamped fraudulentlyfraudulently mr curlydown perhaps if i stayed at home to give evidence theyd send you to sydney to find all that out  there was a courtesy in this suggestion which induced curlydown to ask his junior to come down and take potluck at apricot villa bagwax was delighted for his heart had been sore at the coolness which had grown up between him and the man under whose wing he had worked for so many years he had been devoted to curlydown till growing ambition had taught him to think himself able to strike out a line for himself mr curlydown had two daughters of whom the younger jemima had found much favour in the eyes of bagwax but since the jealousy had sprung up between the two men he had never seen jemima nor tasted the fruits of curlydowns garden mrs curlydown who approved of bagwax had been angry and jemima herself had become sullen and unloving to her father on that very morning mrs curlydown had declared that she hated quarrels like poison so do i mamma said jemima breaking her silence emphatically not that mr bagwax is anything to anybody  that does look like something said curlydown whispering to his friend in the railway carriage they were sitting opposite to each other with their knees togetherand were of course discussing the envelope  it is everything when they were making up their case in australia and when the woman brought out the cover with his writing upon it with the very name mrs caldigate written by himselfcrinkett wasnt contented with that so they put their heads together and said that if the letter could be got to look like a posted lettera letter sent regularly by the postthat would be real evidence the idea wasnt bad  nothing has ever been considered better evidence than postmarks said curlydown with authority  it was a good idea then they had to get a postagestamp they little knew how they might put their foot into it there and they got hold of some young man at the postoffice who knew how to fix a datestamp with a past date how these things become clear when one looks at them long enough  only one has to have an eye in ones head  yes said bagwax as modestly as he could at such a moment a fellow has to have his wits about him before he can do anything out of the common way in any line youd tell sir john everything at oncewouldnt you curlydown raised his hat and scratched his head duty first you know duty first said bagwax  in a mans own lineyes said curlydown somebody else ought to have found that out thats not postoffice its stamps and taxes its very hard that a man should have to cut the nose off his own face by knowing more than he need know  duty duty said bagwax as he opened the carriagedoor and jumped out on to the platform  when he got up to the cottage mrs curlydovvn assured him that it was quite a cure for sore eyes to see him sophia the elder of the two daughters at home told him that he was a false truant and jemima surmised that the great attractions of the london season had prevented him from coming down to enfield it isnt that indeed he said i am always delighted in running down but the caldigate affair has been so important  you mean the trial said mrs curlydown but the man has been in prison ever so long  unjustly most unjustly  is it so really asked jemima and the poor young bride  not so much of a bride said sophia shes got one i know  and papa says youre to go out to botany bay said jemima itll be years and years before you are back again then he explained it was not botany bay and he would be back in six months and after all he wasnt going at all well i declare if papa isnt down the walk already said jemima looking out of the window  i dont think i shall go at all said bagwax in a melancholy tone as he went upstairs to wash his hands  the dinner was very pleasant and as curlydown and his guest drank their bottle of port together at the open window it was definitely settled that bagwax should reveal the mystery of the postagestamp to sir john joram at once i should have it like a lump of lead on my conscience all the time i was on the deep said bagwax solemnly  conscience is conscience to be sure said curlydown  i dont think that im given to be afraid said bagwax the ocean if i know myself would have no terrors for menot if i was doing my duty but i should hear the ships sides cracking with every blast if that secret were lodged within my breast  take another glass of port old boy  bagwax did take another glass finishing the bottle and continued farewell to those smiling shores farewell sydney and all her charms farewell to her orange groves her blue mountains and her rich goldfields  take a drop of whitewash to wind up and then well join the ladies curlydown was a strictly hospitable man and in his own house would not appear to take amiss anything his guest might say but when bagwax became too poetical over his wine curlydown waxed impatient bagwax took his drop of whitewash and then hurried on to the lawn to join jemima  and you really are not going to those distant parts  no said bagwax with all that melancholy which wine and love combined with sorrow can produce that dream is over  i am so glad  why should you be glad why should a resolve which it almost breaks my heart to make be a source of joy to you  of course you would have nothing to regret at leaving mr bagwax  very muchif i were going for ever noi could never do that unless i were to take some dear one with me but as i said that dream is over it has ever been my desire to see foreign climes and the chance so seldom comes in a mans way  youve been to ostend i know mr bagwax  oh yes and to boulogne said bagwax proudly but the desire of travel grows with the thing it feeds on i long to overcome great distancesto feel that i have put illimitable space behind me to set my foot on shores divided from these by the thickness of all the earth would give me a sense of grandeur which iwhichwhichwould be magnificent  i suppose that is natural in a man  in some men said bagwax not liking to be told that his heroic instincts were shared by all his brethren  but women of course think of the dangers suppose you were to be cast away  what matter with a father of a family of course it would be different but a lone man should never think of such things jemima shook her head and walked silently by his side if i had some dear one who cared for me i suppose it would be different with me  i dont know said jemima gentlemen like to amuse themselves sometimes but it doesnt often go very deep  things always go deep with me said bagwax i panted for that journey to the antipodespanted for it now that it is over perhaps some day i may tell you under what circumstances it has been relinquished in the meantime my mind passes to other things or perhaps i should say my heartjemima then bagwax stopped on the path  go on mr bagwax papa will be looking at you  jemima he said will you recompense me by your love for what i have lost on the other side of the globe she recompensed him and he was happy  the future father and soninlaw sat and discussed their joint affairs for an hour after the ladies had retired as to jemima and his love bagwax was allowed to be altogether triumphant mrs curlydown kissed him and he kissed sophia that was in public what passed between him and jemima no human eye saw the old postoffice clerk took the younger one to his heart and declared that he was perfectly satisfied with his girls choice ive always known that you were steady he said and thats what i look to she has had her admirers and perhaps might have looked higher but whats rank or money if a mans fond of pleasure but when that was settled they returned again to the caldigate envelope curlydown was not quite so sure as to that question of duty the proposed journey to sydney with a pound aday allowed for expenses and the travellers salary going on all the time would put a nice sum of readymoney into bagwaxs pocket it wouldnt be less than two hundred towards furnishing my boy said curlydown youll want it and as for the delay whats six months girls like to have a little time to boast about it  but bagwax had made up his mind and nothing would shake him if theyll let me go out all the same to set matters right of course id take the job i should think it a duty and would bear the delay as well as i could if jemima thought it right im sure she wouldnt complain but since i saw that letter on that stamp my conscience has told me that i must reveal it all it might be me as was in prison and jemima who was told that i had a wife in australia since ive looked at it in that light ive been more determined than ever to go to sir john jorams chambers on monday goodnight mr curlydown i am very glad you asked me down to the cottage today more glad than anything  at halfpast eleven by the last train bagwax returned to town and spent the night with mingled dreams in which sydney jemima and the envelope were all in their turns eluding him and all in their turns within his grasp     chapter liii  sir john backs his opinion    well mr bagwax im glad that its only one envelope this time this was said by sir john joram to the honest and energetic postoffice clerk on the morning of wednesday the 3d september when the lawyer would have been among the partridges down in suffolk but for the vicissitudes of john caldigates case it was hard upon sir john and went something against the grain with him he was past the time of life at which men are enthusiastic as to the wrongs of othersas was bagwax and had in truth much less to gain from the cause or to expect than bagwax he thought that the pertinacity of bagwax and the coming of dick shand at the moment of his holidays were circumstances which justified the use of a little internal strong languagesuch as he had occasionally used externally before he had become attorneygeneral in fact he haddamned dick shand and bagwax and in doing so had considered that jones his clerk was internal i wish he had gone to sydney a month ago he said to jones but when jones suggested that bagwax might be sent to sydney without further trouble sir johns conscience pricked him not to be able to shoot a suffolk partridge on the 1st of september was very cruel but to be detained wrongfully in cambridge jail was worse and he was of opinion that such cruelty had been inflicted on caldigate on the saturday dick shand had been with him he had remained in town on the monday and tuesday by agreement with mr seely early on the tuesday intimation was given to him that bagwax would come on the wednesday with further evidencewith evidence which should be positively conclusive bagwax had in the meantime been with his friend smithers at the stampoffice and was now fully prepared by the help of smithers he had arrived at the fact that the postagestamp had certainly been fabricated in 1874 some months after the date imprinted on the cover of the letter to which it was affixed  no sir johnonly one this time we neednt move anything all the chaos had been restored to its normal place and looked as though it had never been moved since it was collected  and we can prove that this queenshead did not exist before the 1st january 1874  heres the deposition said bagwax who by his frequent intercourse with mr jones had become almost as good as a lawyer himselfat least it isnt a deposition of coursebecause its not sworn  a statement of what can be proved on oath  just that sir john its mr smithers mr smithers has been at the work for the last twenty years i knew it just as well as he from the first because i attend to these sort of things but i thought it best to go to the fountainhead  quite right  sir john will want to hear it from the fountainhead i said to myself and therefore i went to smithers smithers is perhaps a little conceited but his word isgospel in a matter of postagestamps smithers is gospel  then sir john read the statement and though he may not have taken it for gospel still to him it was credible it seems clear he said  clear as the running stream said bagwax  i should like to have all that gang up for perjury mr bagwax  so should i sir johnso should i when i think of that poor dear lady and her infant babe without a name and that young father torn from his paternal acres and cast into a vile prison my blood boils within my veins and all my passion to see foreign climes fades into the distance  no foreign climes now mr bagwax  i suppose not sir john said the hero mournfully  not if this be true  its gospel sir johngospel they might send me out to set that office to rights things must be very wrong when they could get hold of a datestamp and use it in that way there must be one of the gang in the office  a bribe did it i should say  i could find it out sir john let me alone for that you could say that you have found mequicklike in this mattercouldnt you sir john bagwax was truly happy in the love of jemima curlydown but the idea of earning two hundred pounds for furniture and of seeing distant climes at the same time had taken a strong hold of his imagination  i am afraid i should have no voice in the matterunless with the view of getting evidence  and weve got thathavent we sir john  i think so  duty sir john duty said bagwax almost sobbing through his triumph  thats it mr bagwax sir john too had given up his partridgesfor a day or two  and that gentleman will now be restored to his wife  it isnt for me to say as you and i have been engaged on the same side to be told that he had been on the same side with the late attorneygeneral was almost compensation to bagwax for the loss of his journey as you and i have been on the same side i dont mind telling you that i think that he ought to be released the matter remains with the secretary of state who will probably be guided by the judge who tried the case  a stern man sir john  not softhearted mr bagwaxbut as conscientious a man as youll be able to put your hand upon the young wife with her nameless baby wont move him at all but were he moved by such consideration he would be so far unfit for his office  mercy is divine said bagwax  and therefore unfit to be used by a merely human judge you know i suppose that richard shand has come home  no  indeed he has and was with me a day or two since  can he say anything bagwax was not rejoiced at dicks opportune return he thoroughly wished that caldigate should be liberated but he wished himself to monopolise the glory of the work  he says a great deal he has sworn pointblank that there was no such marriage at the time named he and caldigate were living together then and for some weeks afterwards and the woman was never near them during the time  to think of his coming just now  it will be a great help mr bagwax but it wouldnt be enough alone he might possiblytell an untruth  perjury on the other side as it were  just that but this little queenshead here cant be untrue  no sir john no that cant be said bagwax comforted and the dated impression cant lie either the envelope is whatll do it after all  i hope so you and mr jones will prepare the statement for the secretary of state and i will send it myself with that mr bagwax took his leave and remained closeted with mr jones for much of the remainder of the day  the moment sir john was alone he wrote an almost angry note to his friend honybun in conjunction with whom and another member of parliament he had the shooting in suffolk honybun who was also a lawyer though less successful than his friend was a much better shot and was already taking the cream off the milk of the shooting i cannot conceive he said at the end of his letter that after all my experience i should have put myself so much out of my way to serve a client a man should do what hes paid to do and what it is presumed that he will do and nothing more but here i have been instigated by an insane ambition to emulate the goodnatured zeal of a fellow who is absolutely willing to sacrifice himself for the good of a stranger then he went on to say that he could not leave london till the friday  on the thursday morning he put all the details together and himself drew out a paper for the perusal of the secretary of state as he looked at the matter all round it seemed to him that the question was so clear that even judge bramber could not hesitate the evidence of dick shand was quite conclusiveif credible it was open of course to strong doubt in that it could not be sifted by crossexamination alone it certainly would not have sufficed to extort a pardon from any secretary of stateas any secretary of state would have been alive to the fact that dick might have been suborned dicks life had not been such that his single word would have been regarded as certainly true but in corroboration it was worth much and then if the secretary or the judge could be got to go into that very complicated question of the dated stamp it would sir john thought become evident to him that the impression had not been made at the time indicated this had gradually been borne in upon sir johns mind till he was almost as confident in his facts as bagwax himself but this operation had required much time and much attention would the secretary or would the judge clear his table and give himself time to inspect and to measure two or three hundred postmarks the date of the fabrication of the postagestamp would of course require to be verified by official reportbut if the facts as stated by bagwax were thus confirmed then the fraudulent nature of the envelope would be put beyond doubt it would be so manifest that this morsel of evidence had been falsely concocted that no clearheaded man let his prepossessions be what they might could doubt it judge bramber would no doubt begin to sift the case with a strong bias in favour of the jury it was for a jury to ascertain the facts and in this case the jury had done so in his opinionin judge brambers opinion as the judge had often declared ita judge should not be required to determine facts a new trial were that possible would be the proper remedy if remedy were wanted but as that was impossible he would be driven to investigate such new evidence as was brought before him and to pronounce what would in truth be another verdict all this was clear to sir john and he told himself that even judge bramber would not be able to deny that false evidence had been submitted to the jury  sir john as he occupied his mind with the matter on the thursday morning did wake himself up to some generous energy on his clients behalfso that in sending the written statements of the case to the home secretary he himself wrote a short but stronglyworded note as it is quite manifest he said that a certain amount of false and fraudulent circumstantial evidence has been brought into court by the witnesses who proved the alleged marriage and as direct evidence has now come to hand on the other side which is very clear and as far as we know trustworthy i feel myself justified in demanding her majestys pardon for my client  on the next day he went down to birdseye lodge near ipswich and was quite enthusiastic on the matter with his friend honybun i never knew bramber go beyond a jury in my life said honybun  hell have to do it now they cant keep him in prison when they find that the chief witness was manifestly perjured the woman swore on her oath that the letter reached her by post in may 1873 it certainly did not do so the cover as we see it has been fabricated since that date  i never thought the cover went for much said honybun  for very littlefor nothing at all perhapstill proved to be fraudulent if they had left the letter alone their case would have been strong enough for a conviction as it was they were fools enough to go into a business of this sort but they have done so and as they have been found out the falsehood which has been detected covers every word of their spoken evidence with suspicion it will be like losing so much of his hearts blood but the old fellow will have to give way  he never gave way in his life  well make him begin  ill bet you a pony he dont  ill take the bet said the late attorneygeneral but as he did so he looked round to see that not even a gamekeeper was near enough to hear him  on that friday bagwax was in a very melancholy state of mind at his office in spite of the brilliancy of his prospects with miss curlydown ill just come back to my old work he said to his future fatherinlaw theres nothing else for me to do  this was all as it should be and would have been regarded a day or two ago by curlydown as simple justice there had been quite enough of that pottering over an old envelope to the manifest inconvenience of himself and others but now the matter was altered his was a paternal and an affectionate heart and he saw very plainly the pecuniary advantage of a journey to sydney and he knew too that in official life as well as elsewhere to those who have much more is given now that bagwax was to him in the light of a son he wished bagwax to rise in the world i wouldnt give it up said he  but what would you do  id stick to it like wax till they did something for me  theres nothing to stick to  id take it for granted i was going at once to sydney id get my outfit and by george id take my place  ive told sir john i wasnt going and he said it wasnt necessary as bagwax told his sad tale he almost wept  i wouldnt mind that id have it out of them somehow why is he to have all the pay no doubt its been hundreds to him and youve done the work and got nothing  when i asked him to get me sent he said hed no powernot now its all so plain he turned his face down towards the desk to hide the tear that now was in truth running down his face but duty he said looking up again duty england expects dn it whos going to whimper when i lay my head on my pillow at night and think that i i thomas bagwax have restored that nameless one to her babe and her lord i shall sleep even though that pillow be no better than a hard bolster  jemima will look after that said the father laughing but still i wouldnt give it up never give a chance upthey come so seldom ill tell you what i should doi should apply to the secretary for leave to go to sydney at once  at my own expense said bagwax horrified  certainly notbut that you might have an opportunity of investigating all this for the public service itll get referred round in some way to the secretary of state who cant but say all that youve done when it gets out of a mans own office he dont so much mind doing a little job it sounds goodnatured and then if they dont do anything for you youll get a grievance next to a sum of money down a grievance is the best thing you can have a man who can stick to a grievance year after year will always make money of it at last  on the saturday bagwax went down to apricot lodge having been invited to stay with his beloved till the monday in the smiles of his beloved he did find much consolation especially as it had already been assured to him that sixty pounds ayear would be settled on jemima on and from her weddingday and then they made very much of him you do love me tom dont you said jemima they were sitting on campstools behind the grotto and bagwax answered by pressing the loved ones waist better than going to sydney tomdont you  it is so very different said bagwaxwhich was true  if you dont like me better than anything else in all the world however different i will never stand at the altar with you and she moved her campstool perhaps an inch away  in the way of loving of course i do  then why do you grieve when youve got what you like best  you dont understand jemima what a spirit of adventure means  i think i do or i shouldnt be going to marry you thats quite as great an adventure as a journey to sydney you ought to be very glad to get off now youre going to settle down as a married man  think what two hundred pounds would be jemimain the way of furniture  thats papas putting in i know i hate all that hankering after filthy lucre you ought to be ashamed of wanting to go so far away just when youre engaged you wouldnt care about leaving me i suppose the least  i should always be thinking of you  yes you would but suppose i wasnt thinking of you suppose i took to thinking of somebody else how would it be then  you wouldnt do that jemima  you ought to know when youre well off tom by this time he had recovered the inch and perhaps a little more you ought to feel that youve plenty to console you  so i do duty duty england expects that every man  thats your idea of consolation is it and away went the campstool half a yard  you believe in duty dont you jemima  in a husbands duty to his wife i doand in a young mans duty to his sweetheart  and in a fathers to his children  thats as may be said she getting up and walking away into the kitchengarden he of course accompanied her and before they got to the house had promised her not to sigh for the delights of sydney nor for the perils of adventure any more     chapter liv  judge bramber    a secretary of state who has to look after the police and the magistrates to answer questions in the house of commons and occasionally to make a telling speech in defence of his colleagues and in addition to this is expected to perform the duties of a practical court of appeal in criminal cases must have something to do to have to decide whether or no some poor wretch shall be hanged when in spite of the clearest evidence humanitarian petitions by the dozen overwhelm him with claims for mercy must be a terrible responsibility no your majesty i think we wont hang him i think well send him to penal servitude for lifeif your majesty pleases that is so easy and would be so pleasant why should any one grumble at so right royal a decision but there are the newspapers always so prone to complainand the secretary has to acknowledge that he must be strong enough to hang his culprits in spite of petitions or else he must give up that office but when the evidence is not clear the case is twice more difficult the jury have found their verdict and the law intends that the verdict of a jury shall be conclusive when a man has been declared to be guilty by twelve of his countrymenhe is guilty let the facts have been what they may and let the twelve have been ever so much in error majesty however can pardon guilt and hence arises some awkward remedy for the mistakes of jurymen but an unassisted majesty cannot itself investigate all thingsis not in fact in this country supposed to perform any duties of that sorta secretary of state is invested with the privilege of what is called mercy it is justice rather that is wanted if bagwax were in the right about that envelopeand the reader will by this time think that he was right and if dick shand had sworn truly then certainly our friend john caldigate was not in want of mercy it was instant justice that he requiredwith such compensation as might come to him from the indignant sympathy of all good men  i remember to have seen a man at bermuda whose fate was peculiar he was sleek fat and apparently comfortable mixing pills when i saw him he himself a convict and administering to the wants of his brother convicts he remonstrated with me on the hardness of his position either i did do it or i didnt he said it was because they thought i didnt that they sent me here and if i didnt what right had they to keep me here at all i passed on in silence not daring to argue the matter with the man in face of the warder but the man was right he had murdered his wifeso at least the jury had saidand had been sentenced to be hanged he had taken the poor woman into a little island and while she was bathing had drowned her her screams had been heard on the mainland and the jury had found the evidence sufficient some newspaper had thought the reverse and had mooted the questionwas not the distance too great for such screams to have been heard or at any rate understood so the man was again brought to trial in the court of the home office and wasnot pardoned but sent to grow fat and make pills at bermuda he had or he had not murdered his wife if he did the deed he should have been hangedand if not he should not have been forced to make extorted pills  what was a secretary of state to do in such a case no doubt he believed that the wretch had murdered his wife no doubt the judge believed it all the world believed it but the newspaper was probably right in saying that the evidence was hardly conclusiveprobably right because it produced its desired effect if the argument had been successfully used with the jury the jury would have acquitted the man then surely the secretary of state should have sent him out as though acquitted and not daring to hang him should have treated him as innocent another trial was in truth demanded  and so it was in caldigates case the secretary of state getting up early in the morning after a remarkable speech in which he vindicated his ministry from the attacks of all europe did read all the papers and took home to himself the great bagwaxian theory he mastered dicks evidenceand managed to master something also as to dicks character he quite understood the argument as to the postagestampswhich went further with him than the other arguments and he understood the perplexity of his own position if bagwax was right not a moment should be lost in releasing the illused man to think of pardon to mention pardon would be an insult instant justice with infinite regrets that the injuries inflicted admitted of no compensationthat and that only was impressively demanded how grossly would that man have been illusedhow cruelly would that woman have been injured but then againif bagwax was wrongif the cunning fraud had been concocted over here and not in sydneyif the plot had been made not to incarcerate an innocent man but to liberate a guilty man then how unfit would he show himself for his position were he to be taken in by such guile what crime could be worse than that committed by caldigate against the young lady he had betrayed if caldigate were guilty upon the whole he thought it would be safer to trust to the jury but comforted himself by the reflection that he could for a while transfer the responsibility it would perhaps be expedient to transfer it altogether so he sent all the papers on to judge bramber  judge bramber was a great man never popular he had been wise enough to disregard popularity he had forced himself into practice in opposition to the attorneys by industry and perspicuity he had attended exclusively to his profession never having attempted to set his foot on the quicker steppingstones of political life it was said of him that no one knew whether he called himself liberal or conservative at fiftyfive he was put upon the bench simply because he was supposed to possess a judicial mind here he amply justified that opinionbut not without the sneer and illwords of many he was now seventy and it was declared that years had had no effect on him he was supposed to be absolutely mercilessas hard as a nether millstone a judge who could put on the black cap without a feeling of inward disgust but it may be surmised that they who said so knew nothing of himfor he was a man not apt to betray the secrets of his inner life he was noted for his reverence for a jury and for his silence on the bench the older he grew the shorter became his charges nor were there wanting those who declared that his conduct in this respect was intended as a reproach to some who are desirous of adorning the bench by their eloquence to sit there listening to everything and subordinating himself to others till his interposition was necessary was his idea of a judges duty but when the law had declared itself he was always strong in supporting the law a man condemned for murder ought to be hangedso thought judge bramberand not released in accordance with the phantasy of philanthropists such were the requirements of the law if the law were cruel let the legislators look to that he was once heard to confess that the position of a judge who had condemned an innocent man might be hard to bear but he added that a country would be unfortunate which did not possess judges capable of bearing even that sorrow in his heart he disapproved of the attribute of mercy as belonging to the crown it was opposed to his idea of english law and apt to do harm rather than good  he had been quite convinced of caldigates guiltnot only by the direct evidence but by the concurrent circumstances to his thinking it was not in human nature that a man should pay such a sum as twenty thousand pounds to such people as crinkett and euphemia smitha sum of money which was not due either legally or morallyexcept with an improper object i have said that he was a great man but he did not rise to any appreciation of the motives which had unquestionably operated with caldigate had caldigate been quite assured when he paid the money that his enemies would remain and bear witness against him still he would have paid it in that matter he had endeavoured to act as he would have acted had the circumstances of the mining transaction been made known to him when no threat was hanging over his head but all that judge bramber did not understand he understood however quite clearly that under no circumstances should money have been paid by an accused person to witnesses while that persons guilt and innocence were in question in his summingup he had simply told the jury to consider the matterbut he had so spoken the word as to make the jury fully perceive what had been the result of his own consideration  and then caldigate and the woman had lived together and a distinct and repeated promise of marriage had been acknowledged it was acknowledged that the man had given his name to the woman so far as himself to write it whatever might be the facts as to the postmark and postagestamp the words mrs caldigate had been written by the man now in prison  four persons had given direct evidence and in opposition to them there had been nothing till dick shand had come no voice had been brought forward to throw even a doubt upon the marriage that two false witnesses should adhere well together in a story was uncommon that three should do so most rare with four it would be almost a miracle but these four had adhered they were people probably of bad characterwhose lives had perhaps been lawless but if so it would have been so much easier to prove them false if they were false thus judge bramber when he passed sentence on caldigate had not in the least doubted that the verdict was a true verdict  and now the case was sent to him for reconsideration he hated such reconsiderations he first read sir john jorams letter and declared to himself that it was unfit to have come from any one calling himself a lawyer there was an enthusiasm about it altogether beneath a great advocatecertainly beneath any forensic advocate employed otherwise than in addressing a jury he judge bramber had never himself talked of demanding a verdict even from a jury he had only endeavoured to win it but that a man who had been attorneygeneralwho had been the head of the barshould thus write to a secretary of state was to him disgusting to his thinking a great lawyer even a good lawyer would be incapable of enthusiasm as to any case in which he was employed the ignorant childish world outside would indulge in zeal and hot feelingsbut for an advocate to do so was to show that he was no lawyerthat he was no better than the outside world even spoken eloquence was in his mind almost beneath a lawyerstudied eloquence certainly was so but such written words as these disgusted him and then he came across allusions to the condition of the poor lady at folking what could the condition of the lady at folking have to do with the matter though the poor lady at folking should die in her sorrow that could not alter the facts as they had occurred in australia it was not for him or for the secretary of state to endeavour to make things pleasant all round here in england it had been the jurys duty to find out whether that crime had been committed and his duty to see that all due facilities were given to the jury it had been sir john jorams duty to make out what best case he could for his clientand then to rest contented had all things been as they should be the secretary of state would have had no duty at all in the matter it was in this frame of mind that judge bramber applied himself to the consideration of the case no juster man ever livedand yet in his mind there was a bias against the prisoner  nevertheless he went to his work with great patience and a resolve to sift everything that was to be sifted the secretary of state had done no more than his required duty in sending the case to him and he would now do his he took the counterevidence as it came in the papers in order that the two bagwaxian theories each founded on the same small document might be expounded one consecutively after the other dick shand and his deposition were produced first the judge declared to himself that dicks single oath which could not now be tested by crossexamination amounted to nothing he had been a drunkard and a pauperhad descended to the lowest occupation which the country afforded and had more than once nearly died from delirium tremens he had then come home penniless and hadproduced his story if such evidence could avail to rescue a prisoner from his sentence and to upset a verdict what verdict or what sentence could stand poor dicks sworn testimony in judge brambers mind told rather against caldigate than for him  then came the postmarksas to which the bagwaxian theory was quite distinct from that as to the postagestamp here the judge found the facts to be somewhat complicated and mazy it was long before he could understand the full purport of the argument used and even at last he hardly understood the whole of it but he could see nothing in it to justify him in upsetting the verdictnothing even to convince him that the envelope had been fraudulently handled there was no evidence that such a dated stamp had not been in use at sydney on the day named copies from the records kept daily at sydneyphotographed copiesshould have been submitted before that argument had been used  but when it came to the postagestamp then he told himself very quickly that the envelope had been fraudulently handled the evidence as to the date of the manufacture of the stamp was conclusive it could not have served to pay the postage on a letter from sydney to nobble in may 1873 seeing that it had not then been in existence and thus any necessity there might otherwise have been for further inquiry as to the postmarks was dissipated the envelope was a declared fraud and the fraud required no further proof that morsel of evidence had been fabricated and laid at any rate one of the witnesses in the last trial open to a charge of perjury so resolving judge bramber pushed the papers away from him and began to think the case over in his mind  there was certainly something in the entire case as it now stood to excuse sir john that was the first line which his thoughts took an advocate having clearly seen into a morsel of evidence on the side opposed to him and having proved to himself beyond all doubt that it was maliciously false must be held to be justified in holding more than a mere advocates conviction as to the innocence of his client sir john had of course felt that a foul plot had been contrived a foul plot no doubt had been contrived had the discovery taken place before the case had been submitted to the jury the detection of that plot would doubtless have saved the prisoner whether guilty or innocent so much judge bramber admitted  but should it necessarily serve to save him now before a jury it would have saved him whether guilty or innocent but the law had got hold of him and had made him guilty and the law need not now subject itself to the normal human weakness of a jury the case was now in his handsin his and those of the secretary and there need be no weakness if the man was innocent in gods name let him gothough as the judge observed to himself he had deserved all he had got for his folly and vice but this discovered plot by no means proved the mans innocence it only proved the determination of certain persons to secure his conviction whether by foul means or fair then he recapitulated to himself various cases in which he had known false evidence to have been added to true with the object of convincing a jury as to a real fact  it might well be that this gang of ruffiansfor it was manifest that there had been such a gangfinding the envelope addressed by the man to his wife had fraudulentlyand as foolishly as fraudulently endeavoured to bolster up their case by the postagestamp and the postmark looking back at all the facts remembering that fatal twenty thousand pounds remembering that though the postmarks were forged on that envelope the writing was true remembering the acknowledged promise and the combined testimony of the four personshe was inclined to think that something of the kind had been done in this case if it were so though he would fain see the perpetrators of that fraud on their trial for perjury their fraud in no way diminished caldigates guilt that a guilty man should escape out of the hands of justice by any fraud was wormwood to judge bramber caldigate was guilty the jury had found him so could he take upon himself to say that the finding of the jury was wrong because the prosecuting party had concocted a fraud which had not been found out before the verdict was given sir john joram whom he had known almost as a boy had demanded the release of his client the word stuck in judge brambers throat the word had been injudicious the more he thought of the word the more he thought that the verdict had been a true verdict in spite of the fraud a very honest man was judge bramberbut human  he almost made up his mindbut then was obliged to confess to himself that he had not quite done so it taints the entire evidence with perjury sir john had said the womans evidence was absolutely so taintedwas defiled with perjury and the man crinkett had been so near the woman that it was impossible to disconnect them who had concocted the fraud the woman could hardly have done so without the mans connivance it took him all the morning to think the matter out and then he had not made up his mind to reverse the verdict would certainly be a thorn in his sidea pernicious thornbut one which if necessary he would endure thorns however such as these are very persuasive  at last he determined to have inquiry made as to the woman by the police she had laid herself open to an indictment for perjury and in making inquiry on that head something further might probably be learned     chapter lv  how the conspirators throve    there had been some indiscretion among caldigates friends from which it resulted that while judge bramber was considering the matter and before the police intelligence of scotland yard even had stirred itself in obedience to the judges orders nearly all the circumstances which had been submitted to the judge had become public shand knew all that bagwax had done bagwax was acquainted with the whole of dicks evidence and hester down at folking understood perfectly what had been revealed by each of those enthusiastic allies dick as we know had been staying at folking and had made his presence notable throughout the county he had succeeded in convincing uncle babington and had been judged to be a false witness by all the boltons in that there had perhaps been no great indiscretion but when bagwax opened a correspondence with mrs john caldigate and explained to her at great length all the circumstances of the postmark and the postagestamps and when at her instance he got a days holiday and rushed down to folking then as he felt himself he was doing that of which sir john joram and mr jones would not approve but he could not restrain himself and why should he restrain himself when he had lost all hope of his journey to sydney when the prospect of that delight no longer illumined his days why should he not enjoy the other delight of communicating his tidings his own discoveriesto the afflicted lady unless he did so it would appear to her that joram had done it all and there would be no rewardabsolutely none so he told his taleat first by letter and then with his own natural eloquence yes mrs caldigate the postmarks are difficult it takes a lifetime of study to understand all the ins and outs of postmarks to me it is a b c of course when i had spent a week or two looking into it i was sure that impression had never been made in the way of business bagwax was sitting out on the lawn at folking and the bereaved wife dressed in black was near him holding in her hand one of the photographed copies of the envelope its a b c to me but i dont wonder you shouldnt see it  i think i do see a good deal said hester  but any babe may understand that said bagwax pressing forward and putting his forefinger on the obliteration of the postagestamp you see the date in the postmark  i know the date very well  weve had it proved that on the date given there this identical postagestamp had not yet been manufactured the secretary of state cant get over that ill defy him  why dont they release him at once then  between you and me mrs caldigate i think its judge bramber  he cant want to injure an innocent man  from what ive heard sir john say i fancy he doesnt like to have the verdict upset but they must do it ill defy them to get over that and again he tapped the queenshead then he told the story of his love for jemima and of his engagement of course he was praised and pettedas indeed he deserved and thus though the house at folking was a sad house he enjoyed himselfas men do when much is made of them by pretty women  but the result of all this was that every detail of the story became known to the public and was quite common down at cambridge the old squire was urgent with mr seely asking why it was that when those things were known an instant order had not come from the secretary of state for the liberation of his son mr seely had not been altogether pleased at the way in which sir john had gone to work and was still convinced of the guilt of his own client his answer was therefore unsatisfactory and the old squire proclaimed his intention of proceeding himself to london and demanding an interview with the secretary of state then the cambridge newspapers took up the subjectgenerally in the caldigate interestand from thence the matter was transferred to the metropolitan columnswhich with one exception were strong in favour of such a reversal of the verdict as could be effected by a pardon from the queen the one exception was very pellucid very unanswerable and very coldblooded it might have been written by judge bramber himself but that judge bramber would sooner have cut his hand off than have defiled it by making public aught that had come before him judicially or officially but all judge brambers arguments were there set forth dick wished his father at once to proceed against the paper for libel because the paper said that his word could not be taken for much the postmark theory was exposed to derision there was no doubt much in the postagestamp but not enough to upset the overwhelming weight of evidence by which the verdict had been obtained and so the case became really public and the newspapers were bought and read with the avidity which marks those festive periods in which some popular criminal is being discussed at every breakfasttable  much of this had occurred before the intelligence of scotland yard had been set to work in obedience to judge bramber the papers had been a day or two in the home office and three or four days in the judges hands before he could look at them to hester and the old squire at folking the incarceration of that injured darling was the one thing in all the world which now required attention to redress that terrible grievance judges secretaries thrones and parliaments should have left their wonted tracks and thought of nothing till it had been accomplished but judge bramber in the performance of his duties was never hurried and at the home office a delay but of three or four days amounted to official haste thus it came to pass that all that bagwax had done and all that shand had said were known to the public at large before the intelligence of scotland yard was at workbefore anybody had as yet done anything  among the public were euphemia smith and mr crinkettadamson also and anna young the other witness since the trial this confraternity had not passed an altogether fraternal life when the money had been paid the woman had insisted on having the half she indeed had carried the cheque for the amount away from the jericho coffeehouse it had been given into her hands and those of crinkett conjointly and she had secured the document the amount was payable to their joint order and each had felt that it would be better to divide the spoil in peace crinkett had taken his half with many grumblings because he had in truth arranged the matter and hitherto paid the expenses then the woman had wished to start at once for australia taking the other female with her but to this crinkett had objected they would certainly he said be arrested for breaking their bail at whatever port they might reachand why should they go seeing that the money had been paid to them on the distinct understanding that they were not pledged to abandon the prosecution most unwillingly the woman remainedbut did so fearing lest worse evil might betide her then there had arisen quarrels about the money between the two females and between crinkett and adamson it was in vain that crinkett showed that were he to share with adamson there would be very little of the plunder left to him adamson demanded a quarter of the whole short of a quarter of the expenses declaring that were it not paid to him he would divulge everything to the police the woman who had got her money in her hand and who was in truth spending it very quickly would give back nothing for expenses unless her expenses in england also were considered nor would she give a shilling to anna young beyond an allowance of £2 a week till as she said they were both back in the colony again but anna young did not wish to go back to the colony and so they quarrelled till the trial came and was over  the verdict had been given on the 20th july and it was about the middle of september when the newspapers made public all that shand and bagwax between them had said and done at that time the four conspirators were still in england the two men were living a wretched life in london and the women were probably not less wretched at brighton mrs smith when she learned that dick shand was alive and in england immediately understood her dangerunderstood her danger but did not at all measure the security which might come to her from the nature of dicks character she would have flown instantly without a word to any one but that the other woman watched her day and night they did not live under the same roof nor in similar style euphemia smith wore silk and endeavoured to make the best of what female charms her ill mode of life had left to her while young was content with poor apparel and poor livingbut spent her time in keeping guard on the other the woman in silk knew that were she to leave her lodgings for half a day without the knowledge of the woman in calico the woman in calico would at once reveal everything to the police but when she understood the point which had been raised and made as to the postmarkwhich she did understand thoroughlythen she comprehended also her own jeopardy and hurried up to london to see crinkett and she settled matters with young if young would go back with her to australia everything there should be made pleasant terms were made at the brighton station anna young was to receive two thousand pounds in london and would then remain as companion with her old mistress  in london there was a close conference at first between the two principals only crinkett thought that he was comparatively safe he had sworn to nothing about the letter and though he himself had prepared the envelope no proof of his handiwork was forthcoming that he had done so but he was quite ready to start again to some distant portion of the earths surfaceto almost any distant portion of the earths surfaceif she would consent to a joining of purses and who is to keep the joint purse asked mrs smith not without a touch of grand irony  me of course said crinkett a man always must have the money  id sooner have fourteen years for perjury like the claimant said mrs smith with a grand resolve that come what might she would stick to her own money  but at last it was decided adamson would not stir a step but consented to remain with two thousand pounds which crinkett was compelled to pay him crinkett handed him the money within the precincts of one of the city banks not an hour before the sailing of the julius vogel from the london docks for auckland in new zealand at that moment both the women were on board the julius vogel and the gang was so far safe crinkett was there in time and they were carried safely down the river new zealand had been chosen because there they would be further from their persecutors than at any other spot they could reach and the journey would occupy long and they were pervaded by an idea that as they had been hitherto brought in question as to no crime the officers of justice would hardly bring them back from so great a distance  the julius vogel touched at plymouth on her outward voyage how terribly inconvenient must be this habit of touching to passengers going from home such as euphemia smith and thomas crinkett and the wretched vessel which had made a quick passage round from the thames lay two days and two nights at dartmouth before it went on to plymouth our friends of course did not go on shore our friends who were known as mr catley and his two widowed sisters mrs salmon and mrs york kept themselves very quiet and were altogether wellbehaved but the women could not restrain some manifestation of their impatience why did not the vessel start why were they to be delayed then the captain made known to them that the time for starting had not yet come three oclock on that day was the time fixed for starting as the slow moments wore themselves away the women trembled huddled together on the poop of the vessel while crinkett never letting the pipe out of his mouth stood leaning against the taffrail looking towards the port gazing across the waters to see whether anything was coming towards the ship which might bode evil to his journey then there came the bustle preparatory to starting and crinkett thought that he was free at any rate for that journey but such bustle spreads itself over many minutes quarter of an hour succeeded quarter of an hour and still they were not off the last passenger came on board and yet they were not off then crinkett with his sharp eyes saw another boat pushed off from the shore and heard a voice declare that the julius vogel had received a signal not to start then crinkett knew that a time of desperate trouble had come upon him and he bethought himself what he would do were he to jump overboard they would simply pick him up nor was he quite sure that he wished to die the money which he had kept had not been obtained fraudulently and would be left to him he thought after that term of imprisonment which it might be his fate to endure but then again it might be that no such fate was in store for him he had sworn only to the marriage and not to the letter it might still be possible that he should be acquitted while the woman was condemned so he stood perfectly still and said not a word to either of his companions as to the boat which was coming he could soon see two men in the guise of policemen and another who was certainly a policeman though not in that guise he stood there very quiet and determined that he would tell his own name and those of the two women at the first question that was asked him on the day but one following crinkett and euphemia smith were committed in london to take their trial for perjury  adamson when he had read the reports in the newspapers and had learned that the postagestamp had been detected and that shand was at home also looked about him a little he talked over the matter at great length with crinkett but he did not tell crinkett all his own ideas some of them he did make known to crinkett he would not himself go to the colonies with crinkett nor would he let crinkett go till some share of the plunder had been made over to him this after many words had been fixed at two thousand pounds and the money as we have seen had been paid crinkett had been careful to make the payment at as late a moment as possible he had paid the amountvery much to his own regret when he saw that boat comingbecause he was quite sure that adamson would at once have denounced him to the police had he not done so adamson might denounce him in spite of the paymentbut the payment appeared to him to be his best chance when he saw the boat coming he knew that he had simply thrown away his two thousand pounds  in truth he had simply thrown it away there is no comfort in having kept ones word honestly when one would fain have broken it dishonestly adamson with the large roll of banknotes still in his pocket had gone at once to scotland yard and told his story at that time all the details had been sent by the judge to the policeoffice and it was understood that a great inquiry was to be made in the first place crinkett and euphemia smith were wanted adamson soon made his bargain he could tell somethingcould certainly tell where crinkett and the women were to be found but he must be assured that any little peccadillo of which he himself might have been guilty would be overlooked the peccadillo on his part had been very small but he must be assured then he was assured and told the police at once that they could stop the two travellers at plymouth and of course he told more than that there had been no marriageno real marriage he had been induced to swear that there had been a marriage because he had regarded the promise and the cohabitation as making a marriagein heaven so he had expressed himself and so excused himself but now his eyes had been opened to the error of his ways and he was free to acknowledge that he had committed perjury there had been no marriagecertainly none at all he made his deposition and bound himself down and submitted to live under the surveillance of the police till the affair should be settled then he would be able to go where he listed with two thousand pounds in his pocket he was a humble silent and generally obedient man but in this affair he had managed to thrive better than any of the others anna young was afterwards allowed to fill the same position but she failed in getting any of the money while the women were in london together and as they were starting euphemia smith had been too strong for her companion she had declared that she would not pay the money till they were afloat and then that she would not pay it till they had left plymouth when the police came on board the julius vogel anna young had as yet received nothing     chapter lvi  the boltons are very firm    while all this was going on as the general opinion in favour of caldigate was becoming stronger every day when even judge bramber had begun to doubt the feeling which had always prevailed at puritan grange was growing in intensity and converting itself from a conviction into a passion that the wicked bigamist had falsely and fraudulently robbed her of her daughter was a religion to mrs boltonand as the matter had proceeded the old banker had become ever more and more submissive to his wifes feelings all the cambridge boltons were in accord on this subjectwho had never before been in accord on any subject robert bolton who understood thoroughly each point as it was raised on behalf of caldigate was quite sure that the old squire was spending his money freely his own money and his sons with the view of getting the verdict set aside what was so clear as that dick shand and bagwax and probably also smithers from the stamps and taxes were all in the pay of old caldigate at this time the defection of adamson was not known to him but he did know that a strong case was being made with the secretary of state if it costs me all i have in the world i will expose them he said up in london to his brother william the london barrister  the barrister was not quite in accord with the other boltons he also had been disposed to think that dick shand and bagwax might have been bribed by the squire it was at any rate possible and the twenty thousand pounds paid to the accusing witnesses had always stuck in his throat when he had endeavoured to believe that caldigate might be innocent it seemed to him still that the balance of evidence was against the man who had taken his sister away from her home but he was willing to leave that to the secretary of state and to the judge he did not see why his sister should not have her husband and be restored to the worldif judge bramber should at last decide that so it ought to be no money could bribe judge bramber no undue persuasion could weaken him if that rhadamanthus should at last say that the verdict had been a wrong verdict thenfor pitys sake for loves sake in the name of humanity and for the sake of all boltons present and to comelet the man be considered innocent  but robert bolton was more intent on his purpose and was a man of stronger passion perhaps some real religious scruple told him that a woman should not live with a man who was not her true husbandlet any judge say what he might but hatred probably had more to do with it than religion it was he who had first favoured caldigates claim on hesters hand and he who had been most grievously deceived from the moment in which the conviction had come upon him that caldigate had even promised his hand in marriage to euphemia smith he had become caldigates enemyhis bitter enemy and now he could not endure the thought that he should be called upon again to receive caldigate as his brotherinlaw caldigates guilt was an idea fixed in his mind which no secretary of state no judge bramber no brother could expel  and so it came to pass that there were hard words between him and his brother you are wrong said william  how wrong you cannot say that you believe him to be innocent  if he receives the queens pardon he is to be considered as innocent  even though you should know him to have been guilty  wellyes said william slowly and perhaps indiscreetly it is a matter in which a mans guilt or innocence must be held to depend upon what persons in due authority have declared as he is now guilty of bigamy in consequence of the verdict even though he should never have committed the offence so should he be presumed to be innocent when that verdict has been set aside by the queens pardon on the advice of her proper officerseven though he committed the offence  you would have your sister live with a man who has another wife alive it comes to that  for all legal purposes he would have no other wife alive  the children would be illegitimate  there you are decidedly wrong said the barrister the children would be legitimate even at this moment without any pardon the child could claim and would enter in upon his inheritance  the next of kin would claim said the attorney  the burden of proving the former marriage would then be on him said the barrister  the verdict would be evidence said the attorney  certainly said the barrister but such evidence would not be worth a straw after a queens pardon given on the advice of the judge who had tried the former case as yet we know not what the judge may saywe do not know the facts as they have been expounded to him but if caldigate be regarded as innocent by the world at large it will be our duty so to regard him  i will never look on him as hesters husband said the attorney  i and fanny have already made up our minds that we would at once ask them to come to us for a month said the barrister  nothing on earth will induce me to speak to him said the attorney  then you will be very cruel to hester said the barrister  it is dreadful to me said the attorney that you should care so little for your sisters reputation and so they quarrelled robert leaving the house in great dudgeon went down on the following morning to cambridge  at puritan grange the matter was argued rather by rules of religion than of law but as the rules of law were made by those interested to fit themselves to expediency so were the rules of religion fitted to prejudice no hatred could be more bitter than that which mrs bolton felt for the man whom she would permit no one to call her soninlaw something as to the postagestamp and the postmarks was told her but with a womans indomitable obstinacy she closed her mind against all thatas indeed did also the banker is her position in the world to depend upon a postagestamp said the banker intending to support his wife then she arose in her wrath and was very eloquent her position in the world she said what does it matter it is her soul though all men and all women should call her a castaway it would be nothing if the lord knew her to be guiltless but she will be living as an adulteress with an adulterer the law has told her that it is so she will feel every day and every night that she is a transgressor and will vainly seek consolation by telling herself that men have pardoned that which god has condemned and again she broke forth the queens pardon what right has the queen to pardon an adulterer who has crept into the bosom of a family and destroyed all that he found there what sense of justice can any queen have in her bosom who will send such a one back to heap sin upon sin to fasten the bonds of iniquity on the soul of my child postagestamps and postmarks and an old envelope the triviality of the things as compared with the importance of everlasting life made her feel that they were unworthy to be even noticed it did not occur to her that the presence of a bodkin might be ample evidence of murder postmarks indeedwhen her daughters everlasting life was the matter in question then they told her of dick shand she too had heard of dick shand he had been a gambler so she saidwithout much truth he was known for a drunkard a spendthrift a penniless idle neerdowell who had wandered back home without clothes to his backwhich was certainly untrue as the yellow trousers had been bought at san franciscoand now she was told that the hated miscreant was to be released from prison because such a one as this was ready to take an oath she had a knack of looking on such menneerdowells like dick shand and caldigateas human beings who had as it were lost their souls before death so that it was useless to think of them otherwise than as already damned that caldigate should become a good honest loving husband or dick shand a truthspeaking witness was to her thinking much more improbable than that a camel should go through the eye of a needle she would press her lips together and grind her teeth and shake her head when any one about her spoke of a doubt the man was in prison at any rate for two yearslocked up safe for so much time as it might be a wild beast which with infinite trouble had been caged and now they were talking of undoing the bars and allowing the monster to gorge himself again with his prey  if the queen were told the truth she would never do it she said to her amazed husband the queen is a mother and a woman who kneels in prayer before her maker something should be done so that the truth may be made known to her  to illuminate all the darkness which was betrayed by this appeal to him was altogether beyond mr boltons power he appreciated the depth of the darkness he knew for instance that the queen herself would in such a matter act so simply in accordance with the advice of some one else that the pardon if given would not in the least depend on her majestys sentiments to call it the queens pardon was a simple figure of speech this was manifest to him and he was driven to endeavour to make it manifest to her she spoke of a petition to be sent direct to the queen and insinuated that robert bolton if he were anything like a real brother would force himself into her majestys presence it isnt the queen said her husband  it is the queen mercy is the prerogative of the crown even i know as much as that and she is to be made to believe that this is mercy  her majesty does what her ministers tell her  but she wouldnt if she was told the truth i do not for a moment believe that she would allow such a man as that to be let loose about the world like a roaring lion if she knew all that you and i know mercy indeed  it wont be meant for mercy my dear  what then do you not know that the man has another wife alivea wife much more suited to him than our poor darling nobody would hear my voice while there was yet time and so my child my only one was taken away from me by her own father and her own brothers and no one now will exert himself to bring her back to her home the poor old man had had but little comfort in his home since his daughters marriage and was now more miserable than ever  then there came a letter from hester to her mother since mrs boltons last visit to folking there had been some correspondence maintained a few letters had passed very sad on each side in which the daughter had assured the mother of her undying love and in which the mother had declared that day and night she prayed for her child but of caldigate neither on one side nor on the other had mention been made now hester who was full of hope and sick with hope deferred endeavoured to convince her mother that the entire charge against her husband had been proved by new evidence to be false she recapitulated all the little details with which the diligent reader must by this time be too well acquainted she made quite clear as she thought the infamous plot by which the envelope had been made to give false evidence and she added the assurance that certainly before long her dear dearest illused husband would be restored to her then she went on to implore her mothers renewed affection both for herself and him and her boy promising that bygones should all be bygones and then she ended by declaring that though the return of her husband would make her very happy she could not be altogether happy unless her parents also should be restored to her  to this there came a crushing answer as follows       puritan grange 28th september      dearest hesterit was unnecessary that you should ask for a     renewal of your mothers love there has never been a moment in     which she has not loved youmore dearly i fear than one human     creature should ever love another when i was strongest in opposing     you i did so from love when i watched you in the hall all those     hours endeavouring to save you from further contact with the man     who had injured you i did it from love you need not doubt my love      but as to all the rest i cannot agree to a word that you say they     are plotting with false evidence to rescue the man from prison i     will not give way to it when my soul tells me that it is untrue as     your mother i can only implore you to come back to me and to save     yourself from the further evil which is coming upon you it may be     that he will be enabled to escape and then you will again have to     live with a husband that is no husbandunless you will listen to     your mothers words      you are thinking of the good things of this worldof a home with     all luxuries and ease and of triumph over those who for the good     of your soul have hitherto marred your worldly joys is it thus     that you hope to win that crown of everlasting life which you have     been taught to regard as the one thing worthy of a christians     struggles is it not true that since that wretched day on which you     were taken away from me you have allowed your mind to pass from     thoughts of eternity to longings after vain joys in this bitter     fruitless vale of tears if that be so can he who has so encouraged     you have been good to you do you remember davids words some     trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember the name     of the lord our god and then again they are brought down and     fallen but we are risen and stand upright ask yourself whether     you have stood upright or have fallen since you left your fathers     house whether you have trusted in the lord your god or in horses     and chariotsthat is in the vain comforts of an easy life if it     be so can it be for your good that you have left your fathers     house and should you not accept this scourge that has fallen upon     you as a healing balm from the hands of the lord      my child i have no other answer to send you that i love you till     my very bowels yearn after you is most true but i cannot profess to     believe a lie or declare that to be good which i know to be evil      may the lord bless you and turn your feet aright and restore you     to your loving mother      mary bolton   when hester read this she was almost crushed the delay since the new tidings had come to her had not in truth been very great it was not yet quite a month since shand had been at folking and a shorter period since the discoveries of bagwax had been explained to her but the days seemed to her to be very long and day after day she thought that on that day at least the news of his promised release would be brought to her and now instead of these news there came this letter from her mother harder almost in its words than any words which had hitherto been either written or spoken in the matter even when all the world should have declared him innocentwhen the queen and the great officer of state and that stern judge should have said that he was innocenteven then her cruel mother would refuse to receive him she had been invited to ask herself certain questions as to the state of her soul and as to the teaching she had received since her marriage the subject is one on which there is no possible means of convergence between persons who have learned to differ her mothers allusions to chariots and horses was to her the enthusiasm of a fanatic no doubt teaching had come to her from her husband but it had come at the period of life at which such lessons are easily learned brought down and fallen she said to herself yes we are all brought down and fallen for she had not at all discarded the principles of her religious faithbut a woman will hardly raise herself by being untrue to her husband she too yearned for her motherbut there was never a moments doubt in her mind to which she would cling if at last it should become necessary that one should be cast off  mrs bolton when the letter had been despatched sat brooding over it in deep regret mixed with deeper anger she was preparing for herself an awful tragedy she must be severed for ever from her daughter and so severed with the opinion of all her neighbours against her but what was all that if she had done right or of what service to her would be the contrary if she were herself to thinknay to knowthat she had done wrong     chapter lvii  squire caldigate at the home office    when october came no information from the secretary of states office had yet reached folking and the two inhabitants there were becoming almost despondent as well as impatient there was nobody with whom they could communicate sir john joram had been obliged to answer a letter from the squire by saying that as soon as there was anything to tell the tidings would assuredly be communicated to him from the home office the letter had seemed to be cold and almost uncivil but sir john had in truth said all that he could say to raise hopes which after all might be fallacious would have been on his part a great fault nor in spite of his bet was he very sanguine sharing his friend honybuns opinion as to judge brambers obstinacy and there was a correspondence between the elder caldigate and the home office in which the letters from the squire were long and well argued whereas the replies which always came by return of post were short and altogether formal some assistant undersecretary would sign his name at the end of three lines in which the correspondent was informed that as soon as the matter was settled the result would be communicated  who does not know the sense of aggravated injustice which comes upon a sufferer when redress for an acknowledged evil is delayed the wronged one feels that the whole world must be out of joint in that all the world does not rise up in indignation so it was with the old squire who watched hesters cheek becoming paler day by day and who knew by her silence that the strong hopes which in his presence had been almost convictions were gradually giving way to a new despair then he would abuse the secretary of state say hard things of the queen express his scorn as to the fatuous absurdities of the english law and would make her understand by his anger that he also was losing hope  during these days preparations were being made for the committal of crinkett and euphemia smith nor would judge bramber report to the secretary till he was convinced that there was sufficient evidence for their prosecution it was not much to him that caldigate should spend another week in prison the condition of hester did not even come beneath his ken when he found allusion to it in the papers before him he treated it as a matter which should not have been adducedin bringing which under his notice there had been something akin to contempt of court as though an endeavour had been made to talk him over in private he knew his own character and was indignant that such an argument should have been used with himself he was perhaps a little more slowsomething was added to his deliberationbecause he was told that a young wife and an infant child were anxiously expecting the liberation of the husband and father it was not as yet clear to judge bramber that the woman had any such husband or that the child could claim his father  at this crisis when the first weeks in october had dragged themselves tediously along mr caldigate in a fit which was half rage and half moodiness took himself off to london he did not tell hester that he was going till the morning on which he started and then simply assured her that she should hear from him by every post till he returned  you will tell me the truth father  if i know it myself i will tell you  but you will conceal nothing  noi will conceal nothing if i find that they are all utterly unjust altogether hardhearted absolutely indifferent to the wrong they have done i will tell you even that and thus he went  he had hardly any fixed purpose in going he knew that sir john joram was not in london and that if he were in town he ought not to be made subject to visits on behalf of clients to call upon any judge in such a matter would be altogether out of place but to call upon such a judge as judge bramber would be very vain indeed he had in his head some hazy idea of forcing an answer from the officials in downing street but in his heart he did not believe that he should be able to get beyond the messengers he was one of a class not very small in numbers who from cultivating within their bosom a certain tendency towards suspicion have come to think that all government servants are idle dilatory supercilious and incompetent that some of these faults may have existed among those who took wages from the crown in the time of george iii is perhaps true and the memory of those times has kept alive the accusation the vitality of these prejudices calls to mind the story of the nottinghamshire farmer who when told of the return of charles ii asked what had become of charles i naseby worcester and the fatal day at whitehall had not yet reached him tidings of these things had only been approaching him during these twelve years the true character of the civil service is only now approaching the intelligence of those who are still shaking their heads over the delinquencies of the last century but old mr caldigate was a man peculiarly susceptible to such hard judgments from the crown down to the black helmet worn by the policeman who was occasionally to be seen on folking causeway he thought that all such headpieces were coverings for malpractices the bishops wig had he thought disappeared as being too ridiculous for the times but even for the judges wig he had no respect judge bramber was to him simply pretentious and a secretary of state no better than any other man in this frame of mind how was it probable that he should do any good at the home office  but in this frame of mind he went to the home office and asked boldly for the great man it was then eleven oclock in the morning and neither had the great man nor even any of the deputy great men as yet made their appearance mr caldigate of course fell back upon his old opinion as to public functionaries and mentally applied opprobrious epithets to men who taking the public pay could not be at their posts an hour before midday he was not aware that the great man and the first deputy great man were sitting in the house of commons at 2 am on that morning and that the office generally was driven by the necessity of things to accommodate itself to parliamentary exigencies  then he was asked his business how could he explain to a messenger that his son had been unjustly convicted of bigamy and was now in prison as a criminal so he left his card and said that he would call again at two  at that hour precisely he appeared again and was told that the great man himself could not see him then he nearly boiled over in his wrath while the messenger with all possible courtesy went on to explain that one of the deputies was ready to receive him the deputy was the honourable septimus brown of whom it may be said that the home office was so proud that it considered itself to be superior to all other public offices whatever simply because it possessed brown he had been there for forty years and for many sessions past had been the salvation of parliamentary secretaries and undersecretaries he was the uncle of an earl and the brotherinlaw of a duke and a marquis not to know brown was at the west end simply to be unknown brookss was proud of him and without him the travellers would not have been such a travellers as it is but mr caldigate when he was told that mr brown would see him almost left the lobby in instant disgust when he asked who was mr brown there came a muttered reply in which permanent was the only word audible to him he felt that were he to go away in dudgeon simply because brown was the name of the man whom he was called upon to see he would put himself in the wrong he would by so doing close his own mouth against complaint which to mr caldigate would indeed have been a cutting of his own nose off his own face with a scowl therefore he consented to be taken away to mr brown  he was in the first place somewhat scared by the room into which he was shown which was very large and very high there were two clerks with mr brown who vanished however as soon as the squire entered the room it seemed that mr brown was certainly of some standing in the office or he would not have had two armchairs and a sofa in his room mr caldigate when he first consented to see mr brown had expected to be led into an uncarpeted chamber where there would have been halfadozen other clerks  i have your card mr caldigate said the official no doubt you have called in reference to your son  the squire had determined to be very indignantvery indignant even with the secretary of state himself to whose indifference he attributed the delay which had occurredbut almost more than indignant when he found that he was to be fobbed off with mr brown but there was something in the gentlemans voice which checked his indignation there was something in mr browns eye a mixture of goodhumour and authority which made him feel that he ought not to be angry with the gentleman till he was quite sure of the occasion mr brown was a handsome hale old man with grey whiskers and greyish hair with a wellformed nose and a broad forehead carefully dressed with a light waistcoat and a checked linen cravat wearing a darkblue frockcoat and very well made bootsan old man certainly but who looked as though old age must naturally be the happiest time of life when a mans digestion is thoroughly good and his pockets adequately filled it probably is so such were the circumstances of mr brown who as the squire looked at him seemed to partake more of the nature of his nephew and brothersinlaw than of the browns generally  yes sir said mr caldigate i have called about my son who i think i may undertake to say has been wrongly condemned and is now wrongly retained in prison  you beg all the questions mr caldigate said the permanent undersecretary with a smile  i maintain that what you call the questions are now so clearly proved as not to admit of controversy no one can deny that a conspiracy was got up against my son  i shall not deny it certainly mr caldigate but in truth i know very little or nothing about it the squire who had been seated rose from his chairas in wrathabout to pour forth his indignation why was he treated in this wayhe who was there on a subject of such tragic interest to him when all the prospects reputation and condition of his son were at stake he was referred to a gentleman who began by telling him that he knew nothing about the matter if you will sit down for a moment mr caldigate i will explain all that can be explained said mr brown who was weatherwise in such matters and had seen the signs of a coming storm  certainly i will sit down  in such cases as this the secretary of state never sees those who are interested it is not right that he should do so  there might be somebody to do so  but not somebody who has been concerned in the inquiry the secretary of state if he saw you could only refuse to impart to you any portion of the information which he himself may possess because it cannot be right that he should give an opinion in the matter while he himself is in doubt you may be sure that he will open his mouth to no one except to those from whom he may seek assistance till he has been enabled to advise her majesty that her majestys pardon should be given or refused  when will that be  i am afraid that i cannot name a day you mr caldigate are i know a gentleman of position in your county and a magistrate cannot you understand how minutely facts must be investigated when a minister of the crown is called upon to accept the responsibility of either upsetting or confirming the verdict of a jury  the facts are as clear as daylight  if they be so your son will soon be a free man  if you could feel what his wife suffers in the meantime  though i did feel itthough we all felt it as probably we do for though we be officials still we are menhow should that help us you would not have a man pardoned because his wife suffers  knowing how she suffered i do not think i should let much grass grow under my feet while i was making the inquiry  i hope there is no such grass grows here the truth is mr caldigate that as a rule no person coming here on such an errand as yours is received at all the secretary of state cannot either in his own person or in that of those who are under him put himself in communication with the friends of individuals who are under sentence i am sure that you as a man conversant with the laws must see the propriety of such a rule  i think i have a right to express my natural anxiety  i will not deny it the post is open to you and though i fear that our replies may not be considered altogether satisfactory we do give our full attention to the letters we receive when i heard that you had been here and had expressed an intention of returning from respect to yourself personally i desired that you might be shown into my room but i could not have done that had it not been that i myself have not been concerned in this matter then he got up from his seat and mr caldigate found himself compelled to leave the room with thanks rather than with indignation  he walked out of the big building into downing street and down the steps into the park and going into the gardens he wandered about them for more than an hour sometimes walking slowly along the waterside and then seating himself for a while on one of the benches what must he say to hester in the letter which he must write as soon as he was back at his hotel he tried to sift some wheat out of what he was pleased to call the chaff of mr browns courtesy was there not some indication to be found in it of what the result might be if there were any such indication it was he thought certainly adverse to his son in whose bosom might be the ultimate decisionwhether in that of the secretary or the judge or of some experienced clerk in the secretarys officeit was manifest that the facts which had now been proven to the world at large for many days had none of the effects on that bosom which they had on his own could it be that shand was false that bagwax was false that the postagestamp was falseand that he only believed them to be true was it possible that after all his son had married the woman he crept back to his hotel in jermyn street and there he wrote his letter  i think i shall be home tomorrow but i will not say so for certain i have been at the home office but they would tell me nothing a man was very civil to me but explained that he was civil only because he knew nothing about the case i think i shall call on mr bagwax at the postoffice tomorrow and after that return to folking send in for the daymail letters and then you will hear from me again if i mean to stay  at ten oclock on the following day he was at the postoffice and there he found bagwax prepared to take his seat exactly at that hour thereupon he resolved with true radical impetuosity that bagwax was a much better public servant than mr brown well mr caldigateso weve got it all clear at last said bagwax  there was a triumph in the tone of the clerks voice which was not intelligible to the despondent old squire it is not at all clear to me he said  of course youve heard  heard what i know all about the postagestamp of course  if secretaries of state and judges of the court of queens bench only had their wits about them the postagestamp ought to have been quite sufficient said bagwax sententiously  what more is there  for the sake of letting the world know what can be done in our department it is a pity that there should be anything more  but there is something for gods sake tell me mr bagwax  you havent heard that they caught crinkett just as he was leaving plymouth  not a word  and the woman theyve got the lot of em mr caldigate adamson and the other woman have agreed to give evidence and are to be let go  when did you hear it  wellit is in the daily telltale but i knew it last nightfrom a particular source i have been a good deal thrown in with scotland yard since this began mr caldigate and of course i hear things then it occurred to the squire that perhaps he had flown a little too high in going at once to the home office they might have told him more perhaps in scotland yard but its all true the depositions have already been made adamson and young have sworn that they were present at no marriage crinkett they say means to plead guilty but the woman sticks to it like wax  the squire had written a letter by the daymail to say that he would remain in london that further day he now wrote again at the postoffice telling hester all that bagwax had told him and declaring his purpose of going at once to scotland yard  if this story were true then certainly his son would soon be liberated     chapter lviii  mr smirkie is illused    it was on a tuesday that mr caldigate made his visit to the home office and on the thursday he returned to cambridge on the platform whom should he meet but his brotherinlaw squire babington who had come into cambridge that morning intent on hearing something further about his nephew he too had read a paragraph in his newspaper the snapper as to crinkett and euphemia smith  thomas crinkett and euphemia smith who gave evidence against mr john caldigate in the wellknown trial at the last cambridge assizes have been arrested at plymouth just as they were about to leave the country for new zealand these are the persons to whom it was proved that caldigate had paid the enormous sum of twenty thousand pounds a few days before the trial it is alleged that they are to be indicted for perjury if this be true it implies the innocence of mr caldigate who as our readers will remember was convicted of bigamy there will be much in the whole case for mr caldigate to regret but nothing so much as the loss of that very serious sum of money it would be idle to deny that it was regarded by the jury and the judge and the public as a bribe to the witnesses why it should have been paid will now probably remain for ever a mystery  the squire read this over three times before he could quite understand the gist of it and at last perceivedor thought that he perceivedthat if this were true the innocence of his nephew was incontestable but julia who seemed to prefer the paternal mansion at babington to her own peculiar comforts and privileges at plumcumpippins declared that she didnt believe a word of it and aunt polly whose animosity to her nephew had somewhat subsided was not quite inclined to accept the statement at once aunt polly expressed an opinion that newspapers were only born to lie but added that had she seen the news anywhere else she would not have been a bit surprised the squire was prepared to swear by the tidings if such a thing was not to be put into a newspaper where was it to be put aunt polly could not answer this question but assisted in persuading her husband to go into cambridge for further information  i hope this is true said the suffolk squire tendering his hand cordially to his brotherinlaw he was a man who could throw all his heart into an internecine quarrel on a monday and forget the circumstance altogether on the tuesday  of what are you speaking asked the squire of folking with his usual placid look partly indifferent and partly sarcastic covering so much contempt of which the squire from suffolk was able to read nothing at all  about the man and the woman the witnesses who are to be put in prison at plymouth and who now say just the contrary to what they said before  i do not think that can be true said mr caldigate  then you havent seen the snapper asked mr babington dragging the paper out of his pocket look at that  they were now in a cab together going towards the town and mr caldigate did not find it convenient to read the paragraph but of course he knew the contents it is quite true he said that the persons you allude to have been arrested and that they are up in london they will i presume be tried for perjury  it is true  there is no doubt of it  and the party are splitting against each other asked mr babington eagerly  two of them have already sworn that what they swore before was false  then why dont they let him out  why not indeed said mr caldigate  i should have thought they wouldnt have lost a moment in such a case theyve got one of the best fellows in the world at the home office his name is brown if you could have seen brown im sure he wouldnt have let them delay a minute the home office has the reputation of being so very quick  in answer to this the squire of folking only shook his head he would not even condescend to say that he had seen brown and certainly not to explain that brown had seemed to him to be the most absurdlycautious and courteouslydilatory man that he had ever met in his life in trumpington street they parted mr caldigate proceeding at once to folking and mr babington going to the office of mr seely the attorney hell be out in a day or two said the man of suffolk again shaking his brotherinlaws hand and do you tell him from me that i hope it wont be long before we see him at babington ive been true to him almost from the first and his aunt has come over now there is no one against him but julia and these are things of course which young women wont forget  mr caldigate almost became genial as he accepted this assurance telling himself that his brother magistrate was as honest as he was silly  mr babington who was well known in cambridge asked many questions of many persons from mr seely he heard but little mr seely had heard of the arrest made at plymouth but did not quite know what to think about it if it was all square then he supposed his client must after all be innocent but this went altogether against the grain with mr seely if it be so mr babington he said i shall always think the paying away of that twenty thousand pounds the greatest miracle i ever came across nevertheless mr seely did believe that the two witnesses had been arrested on a charge of perjury  the squire then went to the governor of the jail who had been connected with him many years as a county magistrate the governor had heard nothing received no information as to his prisoner from any one in authority but quite believed the story as to crinkett and the woman perhaps you had better not see him mr babington said the governor as he has heard nothing as yet of all this it would not be right to tell him till we know what it will come to assenting to this mr babington took his leave with the conviction on his mind that the governor was quite prepared to receive an order for the liberation of his prisoner  he did not dare to go to robert boltons office but he did call at the bank we have heard nothing about it mr babington said the old clerk over the counter but then the old clerk added in a whisper none of the family take to the news sir but everybody else seems to think there is a great deal in it if he didnt marry her i suppose he ought to be let out  i should think he ought said the squire indignantly as he left the bank  thus fortified by what he considered to be the general voice of cambridge he returned the same evening to babington cambridge including mr caldigate had been unanimous in believing the report and if the report were true then certainly was his nephew innocent as he thought of this some appropriate idea of the injustice of the evil done to the man and to the mans wife came upon him if such were the treatment to which he and she had been subjectedif he innocent had been torn away from her and sent to the common jail and if she certainly innocent had been wrongly deprived for a time of the name which he had honestly given herthen would it not have been right to open to her the hearts and the doors at babington during the period of her great distress as he thought of this he was so melted by ruth that a tear came into each of his old eyes then he remembered the attempt which had been made to catch this man for juliaas to which he certainly had been innocentand his daughters continued wrath that a woman should be wrathful in such a matter was natural to him he conceived that it behoved a woman to be weak irascible affectionate irrational and softhearted when julia would be loud in condemnation of her cousin and would pretend to commiserate the woes of the poor wife who had been left in australia though he knew the source of these feelings he could not be in the least angry with her but that was not at all the state of his mind in reference to his soninlaw augustus smirkie sometimes as he had heard mr smirkie inveigh against the enormity of bigamy and of this bigamist in particular he had determined that some oddcomeshortly as he would call it he would give the vicar of plumcumpippins a moral pat on the head which should silence him for a time at the present moment when he got into his carriage at the station to be taken home he was not sure whether or no he should find the vicar at babington since their marriage mr smirkie had spent much of his time at babington and seemed to like the babington claret he would come about the middle of the week and return on the saturday evening in a manner which the squire could hardly reconcile with all that he had heard as to mr smirkies exemplary conduct in his own parish the squire was hospitality itself and certainly would never have said a word to make his house other than pleasant to his own girls husband but a host expects that his corns should be respected whereas mr smirkie was always treading on mr babingtons toes hints had been given to him as to his personal conduct which he did not take altogether in good part his absence from afternoon service had been alluded to and it had been suggested to him that he ought sometimes to be more careful as to his language he was not therefore illdisposed to resent on the part of mr smirkie the spirit of persecution with which that gentleman seemed to regard his nephew is mr smirkie in the house he asked the coachman he came by the 340 as usual said the man it was very much as usual thought the squire  there isnt a doubt about it said the squire to his wife as he was dressing the poor fellow is as innocent as you  he cant beinnocent said aunt polly  if he never married the woman whom they say he married he cant be guilty  i dont know about that my dear  he either did marry her or he didnt i suppose  i dont say he married her buthe did worse  no he didnt said the squire  that may be your way of thinking of it according to my idea of what is right and what is wrong he did a great deal worse  but if he didnt marry that woman he didnt commit bigamy when he married this one argued he energetically  still he may have deserved all he got  no he maynt you wouldnt punish a man for murder because he doesnt pay his debts  i wont have it that hes innocent said mrs babington  who the devil is if you come to that  you are not or you wouldnt talk in that way im not saying anything now against john if he didnt marry the woman i suppose theyll let him out of prison and i for one shall be willing to take him by the hand but to say hes innocent is what i wont put up with  he has sown his wild oats and hes none the worse for that hes as good as the rest of us i dare say  speak for yourself said the wife i dont suppose you mean to tell me that in the eyes of the creator he is as good a man as augustus  augustus be  the word was spoken with great energy mrs babington at the moment was employed in sewing a button on the wristband of her husbands shirt and in the start which she gave stuck the needle into his arm  humphrey exclaimed the agitated lady  i beg your pardon but not his said the squire rubbing the wound if he says a word more about john caldigate in my presence i shall tell him what i think about it he has got his wife and that ought to be enough for him  after that they went downstairs and dinner was at once announced there was mr smirkie to give an arm to his motherinlaw the squire took his married daughter while the other two followed as they crossed the hall julia whispered her cousins name but her father bade her be silent for the present i was sure it was not true said mrs smirkie  then youre quite wrong said the squire for its as true as the gospel then there was no more said about john caldigate till the servants had left the room  mr smirkies general appreciation of the good things provided did not on this occasion give the owner of them that gratification which a host should feel in the pleasures of his guests he ate a very good dinner and took his wine with a full appreciation of its merits such an appetite on the part of his friends was generally much esteemed by the squire of babington who was apt to press the bottle upon those who sat with him in the oldfashioned manner at the present moment he eyed his soninlaws enjoyments with a feeling akin to disappointment there was a habit at babington with the ladies of sitting with the squire when he was the only man present till he had finished his wine and at mrs smirkies instance this custom was continued when she and her husband were at the house fires had been commenced and when the dinnerthings had been taken away they clustered round the hearth the squire himself sat silent in his place out of humour knowing that the peculiar subject would be introduced and determined to make himself disagreeable  papa wont you bring your chair round said one of the girls who was next to him whereupon he did move his chair an inch or two  did you hear anything about john said the other unmarried sister  yes i heard about him you cant help hearing about him in cambridge now all the world is talking about him  and what does all the world say asked julia flippantly to this question her father at first made no answer whatever the world may say i cannot alter my opinion continued julia i shall never be able to look upon john caldigate and hester bolton as man and wife in the sight of god  i might just as well take upon myself to say that i didnt look upon you and smirkie as man and wife in the sight of god  papa screamed the married daughter  sir ejaculated the married soninlaw  my dear that is a strange thing to say of your own child whispered the mother  most strange said julia lifting both her hands up in an agony  but its true roared the squire she says that let the law say what it may these people are not to be regarded as man and wife  not by me said julia  who are you that you are to set up a tribunal of your own and if you judge of another couple in that way why isnt some one to judge of you after the same fashion  there is the verdict said mr smirkie no verdict has pronounced me a bigamist  but it might for anything i know said the squire angrily some woman might come up in plumcumpippins and say you had married her before your first wife  papa you are very disagreeable said julia  why shouldnt there be a wicked lie told in one place as well as in another there has been a wicked lie told here and when the lie is proved to have been a lie as plain as the nose on your face he is to tell me that he wont believe the young folk to be man and wife because of an untrue verdict i say they are man and wifeas good a man and wife as you and heand let me see wholl refuse to meet them as such in my house  mr smirkie had not in truth made the offensive remark it had been made by mrs smirkie but it had suited the squire to attribute it to the clergyman mr smirkie was now put upon his mettle and was obliged either to agree or to disagree he would have preferred the former had he not been somewhat in awe of his wife as it was he fell back upon the indiscreet assertion which his fatherinlaw had made some time back i at any rate sir have not had a verdict against me  what does that signify  a great deal i should say a verdict no doubt is human and therefore may be wrong  so is a marriage human  i beg your pardon sira marriage is divine  not if it isnt a marriage your marriage in our church wouldnt have been divine if youd had another wife alive  papa i wish you wouldnt  but i shall ive got to hammer it into his head somehow  mr smirkie drew himself up and grinned bravely but the squire did not care for his frowns that last backhander at the claretjug had determined him john caldigates marriage with his wife was not in the least interfered with by the verdict  it took away the ladys name from her at once said the indignant clergyman  thats just what it didnt do said the squire rising from his chairof itself it didnt affect her name at all and now that it is shown to have been a mistaken verdict it doesnt affect her position the long and the short of it is this that anybody who doesnt like to meet him and his wife as honoured guests in my house had better stay away do you hear that julia then without waiting for an answer he walked out before them all into the drawingroom and not another word was said that night about the matter mr smirkie indeed did not utter a word on any subject till at an early hour he wished them all goodnight with dignified composure     chapter lix  how the bigwigs doubted    its what i call an awful shame mr holt and parson bromley were standing together on the causeway at folking and the former was speaking the subject under discussion was of course the continued detention of john caldigate in the county prison  i cannot at all understand it said mr bromley  theres no understanding nothing about it sir every man woman and child in the county knows as there wasnt no other marriage and yet they wont let un out its sheer spite because he wouldnt vote for their man last lection  i hardly think that mr holt  im as sure of it as i stands here said mr holt slapping his thigh what else d they keep un in for its just like their ways  mr holt was one of a rare class being a liberal farmera liberal that is in politics as was also mr bromley a liberal among parsonsrava avis the caldigates had always been liberal and mr holt had been brought up to agree with his landlord he was now beyond measure acerbated because john caldigate had not been as yet declared innocent on evidence which was altogether conclusive to himself the conservatives were now in power and nothing seemed so natural to mr holt as that the home secretary should keep his landlord in jail because the caldigates were liberals mr bromley could not quite agree to this but he also was of opinion that a great injustice was being done he was in the habit of seeing the young wife almost daily and knew the havoc which hope turned into despair was making with her another week had now gone by since the old squire had been up in town and nothing yet had been heard from the secretary of state all the world knew that crinkett and euphemia smith were in custody and still no tidings cameyet the husband convicted on the evidence of these perjurers was detained in prison  hope deferred maketh the heart sick and hesters heart was very sick within her why do they not tell me something she said when her fatherinlaw vainly endeavoured to comfort her why not indeed he could only say hard things of the whole system under which the perpetration of so great a cruelty was possible and reiterate his opinion that in spite of that system they must before long let his son go free  the delay in truth was not at the home office judge bramber could not as yet quite make up his mind it is hoped that the reader has made up his but the reader knows somewhat more than the judge knew crinkett had confessed nothingthough a rumour had got abroad that he intended to plead guilty euphemia smith was constant in her assertion to all those who came near her that she had positively been married to the man at ahalala adamson and anna young were ready now to swear that all which they had sworn before was false but it was known to the police that they had quarrelled bitterly as to the division of the spoil ever since the money had been paid to the ringleaders it was known that anna young had succeeded in getting nothing from the other woman and that the man had unwillingly accepted his small share fearing that otherwise he might get nothing they were not trustworthy witnesses and it was very doubtful whether the other two could be convicted on their evidence the judge as he turned it all over in his mind was by no means sure that the verdict was a mistaken verdict it was at any rate a verdict it was a decision constitutionally arrived at from a jury this sending back of the matter to him hardly was constitutional  it was abhorrent to his naturenot that a guilty man should escape which he knew to be an affair occurring every daybut that a guilty man who had been found to be guilty should creep back through the meshes of the law he knew how many chances were given by the practice of british courts to an offender on his trial and he was quite in favour of those chances he would be urgent in telling a jury to give the prisoner the benefit of a doubt but when the transgressor with all those loopholes stopped stood before him convicted then he felt a delight in the tightness of the grip with which he held the wretch and would tell himself that the world in which he lived was not as yet all astray in that a guilty man could still be made to endure the proper reward of his guilt  it was with him as when a hunter has hunted a fox after the approved laws of venery there have been a dozen ways of killing the animal of which he has scorned to avail himself he has been careful to let him break from his covert regarding all who would stop him as enemies to himself it has been a point of honour with him that the animal should suffer no undue impediment any illtreatment shown to the favoured one in his course is an injury done to the hunter himself let no man head the fox let no man strive to drive him back upon the hounds let all be done by hunting lawin accordance with those laws which give so many chances of escape but when the hounds have run into their quarry not all the eloquence of all the gods should serve to save that doomed ones life  so it was with judge bramber and a convicted prisoner he would give the man the full benefit of every quibble of the law till he was convicted he would be severe on witnesses harsh to the police apparently a very friend to the man standing at the bartill the time came for him to array the evidence before the jury then he was inexorable and when the verdict had been once pronounced the prisoner was but as a fox about to be thrown to the hounds  and now there was a demand that this particular fox should be put back into his covert the secretary of state could put him back if he thought fit but in these matters there was so often a touch of cowardice why did not the secretary do it without asking him there had arisen no question of law there was no question as to the propriety of the verdict as found upon the evidence given at the trial the doubt which had arisen since had come from further evidence of which the secretary was as well able to judge as he no doubt the case was difficult there had been gross misdoing on both sides but if caldigate had not married the woman why had he paid those twenty thousands why had he written those words on the envelope there was doubt enough now but the time for giving the prisoner the benefit of the doubt was gone the fox had been fairly hunted and judge bramber thought that he had better die  but he hesitatedand while he was hesitating there came to him a little reminder a most gentle hint in the shape of a note from the secretary of states private secretary the old squires visit to the office had not seemed to himself to be satisfactory but he had made a friend for himself in mr brown mr brown looked into the matter and was of opinion that it would be well to pardon the young man even though there had been some jumping over a broomstick at ahalala why should things not be made comfortable here at home what harm would a pardon do to any onewhereas there were so many whom it would make happy so he asked the secretary whether that wasnt a hard case of young caldigate the secretary whispered that it was in brambers hands upon which mr brown observed that if so it was certainly hard but the conversation was not altogether thrown away for on that afternoon the private secretary wrote his note  judge bramber when he received the note immediately burned itand this he did with considerable energy of action if they would send him such cases as that what right had they to remind him of his duty he was not going to allow any private secretary or any secretary of state to hurry him there was no life or death in this matter of what importance was it that so manifest an evildoer as this young caldigate should remain in prison a day or two morea man who had attempted to bribe four witnesses by twenty thousand pounds it was an additional evil that such a one should have such a sum for such a purpose but still he felt that there was a duty thrown upon him and he sat down with all the papers before him determined to make up his mind before he rose from his chair  he did make up his mind but did so at last by referring back the responsibility to the secretary of state the question is one altogether of evidence he said and not of law any clearheaded man is as able to reach a true decision as i am it is such a question as should be left to a juryand would justify a trial on appeal if that were practicable it would be well that the case should stand over till thomas crinkett and euphemia smith shall have been tried for perjury which as i understand will take place at the next winter assizes if the secretary of state thinks that the delay would be too long i would humbly suggest that he should take her majestys pleasure in accordance with his own opinion as to the evidence  when that document was read at the home office by the few who were privileged to read it they knew that judge bramber had been in a very ill humour but there was no help for that the judge had been asked for advice and had refused to give it or had advisedif his remark on that subject was to be taken for advicethat the consideration of the matter should be postponed for another three months the case if there was any case in favour of the prisoner was not one for pardon but for such redress as might now be given for a most gross injustice the man had been put to a very great expense and had been already in prison for ten or eleven weeks and his further detention would be held to have been very cruel if it should appear at last that the verdict had been wrong the public press was already using strong language on the subject and the secretary of state was not indifferent to the public press judge bramber thoroughly despised the pressthough he would have been very angry if his times had not been ready for him at breakfast every morning and two or three questions had already been asked in the house of commons the secretary of state with that habitual strategy without which any secretary of state must be held to be unfit for the position which he holds contrived to answer the questions so as to show that while the gentlemen who asked them were the most indiscreet of individuals he was the most discreet of secretaries and he did this though he was strongly of opinion that judge brambers delay was unjustifiable but what would be thought of a secretary of state who would impute blame in the house of commons to one of the judges of the land before public opinion had expressed itself so strongly on the matter as to make such expression indispensable he did not think that he was in the least untrue in throwing blame back upon the questioners and in implying that on the side of the crown there had been no undue delay though at the moment he was inwardly provoked at the dilatoriness of the judge  public opinion was expressing itself very strongly in the press the daily telltale had a beautifully sensational article written by their very best artist the whole picture was drawn with a cunning hand the young wife in her lonely house down in cambridge which the artist not inaptly called the moated grange the noble innocent highsouled husband eating his heart out within the bars of a county prison and with very little else to eat the indignant father driven almost to madness by the wrongs done to his son and heir had the son not been an heir this point would have been much less touching and then the old evidence was dissected and the new evidence against the new culprits explained in regard to the new culprits the writer was very loud in expressing his purpose to say not a word against persons who were still to be triedbut immediately upon that he went on and said a great many words against them assuming all that was said about them to be true he asked whether the country would for a moment endure the idea that a man in mr caldigates position should be kept in prison on the evidence of such miscreants when he came to bagwax and the postmarks he explained the whole matter with almost more than accuracy he showed that the impression could not possibly have been made till after the date it conveyed he fell into some little error as to the fabrication of the postagestamp in the colony not having quite seized bagwaxs great point but it was a most telling article and the writer as he turned it off at his club and sent it down to the office of the paper was ready to bet a fivepound note that caldigate would be out before a week was over the secretary of state saw the article and acknowledged its power and then even the slipper turned round and cautiously expressed an opinion that the time had come for mercy  there could be no doubt that public opinion was running very high in caldigates favour and that the case had become thoroughly popular people were again beginning to give dinnerparties in london and at every party the matter was discussed it was a peculiarly interesting case because the man had thrown away so large a sum of money people like to have a nut to crack which is uncrackablea gordian knot to undo which cannot even be cut nobody could understand the twenty thousand pounds would any man pay such a sum with the object of buying off false witnessesand do it in such a manner that all the facts must be brought to light when he was tried it was said here and there that he had paid the money because he owed itbut then it had been shown so clearly that he had not owed any one a penny nevertheless the men were all certain that he was not guilty and the ladies thought that whether he were guilty or not did not matter much he certainly ought to be released from prison  but yet the secretary doubted in that unspoken but heartfelt accusation of cowardice which the judge had made against the great officer of state there had been some truth how would it be if it should be made to appear at the approaching trial that the two reprobates who had turned queens evidence against their associates were to break down altogether in their assertions it might possibly then become quite apparent that caldigate had married the woman and had committed bigamy when he would already have been pardoned for the last three months the pardon in that case would not do away with the verdictand the pardoned man would be a convicted bigamist what then would be the condition of his wife and child if subsequent question should arise as to the boys legitimacy as might so probably be the case in what light would he appear he who had taken upon himself on his own responsibility to extort from her majesty a pardon in opposition to a righteous and just verdictin opposition to the judge who had tried the case he had been angry with judge bramber for not deciding and was now frightened at the necessity of deciding himself  in this emergency he sent for the gentleman who had managed the prosecution on the part of the crown and asked him to read up the case again i never was convinced of the prisoners guilt said the barrister  no  it was one of those cases in which we cannot be convinced the strongest point against him was the payment of the money it is possible that he paid it from a quixotic feeling of honour  to false witnesses and that before the trial said the secretary  and there may have been a hope that in spite of what he said himself as to their staying they would take themselves off when they had got the money in that way he may have persuaded himself that as an honest man he ought to make the payment then as to the witnesses there can be little doubt that they were willing to lie even if their main story were true they were lying as to details  then you would advise a pardon  i think so said the barrister who was not responsible for his advice  without waiting for the other trial  if the perjury be then provedor even so nearly proved as to satisfy the outside worldthe mans detention will be thought to have been a hardship the secretary of state thanked the barrister and let him go he then went down to the house and amidst the turmoil of a strong party conflict at last made up his mind it was unjust that such responsibility should be thrown upon any one person there ought to be some court of appeal for such cases he was sure of that now but at last he made up his mind early on the next morning the queen should be advised to allow john caldigate to go free     chapter lx  how mrs bolton was nearly conquered    one morning about the middle of october robert bolton walked out from cambridge to puritan grange with a letter in his pocketa very long and a very serious letter the day was that on which the secretary of state was closeted with the barrister and on the evening of which he at length determined that caldigate should be allowed to go free there had therefore been no pardon grantedas yet but in the letter the writer stated that such pardon would almost certainly be awarded  it was from william bolton in london to his brother the attorney and was written with the view of proving to all the boltons at cambridge that it was their duty to acknowledge hester as the undoubted wife of john caldigate and recommended also that for hesters sake they should receive him as her husband the letter had been written with very great care and had been powerful enough to persuade robert bolton of the truth of the first proposition  it was very long and as it repeated all the details of the evidence for and against the verdict it shall not be repeated here at its full length its intention was to show that looking at probabilities and judging from all that was known there was much more reason to suppose that there had been no marriage at ahalala than that there had been one the writer acknowledged that while the verdict stood confirmed against the man hesters family were bound to regard it and to act as though they did not doubt its justicebut that when that verdict should be set asideas far as any criminal verdict can be set asideby the queens pardon then the family would be bound to suppose that they who advised her majesty had exercised a sound discretion  i am sure you will all agree with me he said that no personal feeling in regard to caldigate should influence your judgment for myself i like the man but that i think has had nothing to do with my opinion if it had been the case that having a wife living he had betrayed my sister into all the misery of a false marriage and had made her the mother of a nameless child i should have felt myself bound to punish him to every extent within my power i do not think it unchristian to say that in such a case i could not have forgiven him but presuming it to be otherwiseas we all shall be bound to do if he be pardonedthen for hesters sake we should receive the man with whom her lot in life is so closely connected she poor dear has suffered enough and should not be subjected to the further trouble of our estrangement  nor if we acknowledge the charge against him to be untrue is there any reason for a quarrel if he has not been bad to our sister in that matter he has been altogether good to her she has for him that devotion which is the best evidence that a marriage has been well chosen presuming him to be innocent we must confess as to her that she has been simply loyal to her husbandwith such loyalty as every married man would desire for this she should be rewarded rather than punished  i write to you thinking that in this way i may best reach my father and mrs bolton i would go down and see them did i not know that your words would be more efficacious with them than my own and i do it as a duty to my sister which i feel myself bound to perform pray forgive me if i remind you that in this respect she has a peculiar right to a performance of your duty in the matter you counselled and carried out the marriagenot at all unfortunately if the man be as i think innocent but you are bound at any rate to sift the evidence very closely and not to mar her happiness by refusing to acknowledge him if there be reasonable ground for supposing the verdict to have been incorrect  sift the evidence indeed robert bolton had done that already very closely bagwax and the stamps had not moved him nor the direct assurance of dick shand but the incarceration by government of crinkett and euphemia smith had shaken him and the fact that they had endeavoured to escape the moment they heard of shands arrival but not the less had he hated caldigate the feeling which had been impressed on his mind when the first facts were made known to him remained caldigate had been engaged to marry the woman and had lived with her and had addressed her as his wife the man had in a way got the better of him and then the twenty thousand pounds and then again caldigates manner to himself he could not get over his personal aversion and therefore unconsciously wished that his brotherinlaw should be guiltywished at any rate that he should be kept in prison gradually had fallen upon him the conviction that caldigate would be pardoned and then of course there had come much consideration as to his sisters condition he too was a conscientious and an affectionate man he was well aware of his duty to his sister while he was able to assure himself that caldigate was not her husband he could satisfy himself by a conviction that it was his duty to keep them apart thus he could hate the man advocate all severity against the man and believe the while that he was doing his duty to his sister as an affectionate brother but now there was a revulsion it was three weeks since he and his brother had parted not with the kindest feelings up in london and during that time the sifting of the evidence had been going on within his own breast from hour to hour and now this letter had comea letter which he could not put away in anger a letter which he could not ignore to quarrel permanently with his brother william was quite out of the question he knew the value of such a friend too well and had been too often guided by his advice so he sifted the evidence once again and then walked off to puritan grange with the letter in his pocket  in these latter days old mr bolton did not go often into cambridge men said that his daughters misfortune had broken him very much it was perhaps the violence of his wifes religion rather than the weight of his daughters sufferings which cowed him since hesters awful obstinacy had become hopeless to mrs bolton an atmosphere of sackcloth and ashes had made itself more than ever predominant at puritan grange if any one hated papistry mrs bolton did so but from a similar action of religious fanaticism she had fallen into worse that papistical selfpersecution that men and women were all worms to be trodden under foot and grass of the field to be thrown into the oven was borne in so often on poor mr bolton that he had not strength left to go to the bank and they were nearer akin to worms and more like grass of the field than ever because hester would stay at folking instead of returning to her own home  she was in this frame of mind when robert bolton was shown into the morning sittingroom she was sitting with the bible before her but with some domestic needlework in her lap he was doing nothingnot even having a book ready to his hand thus he would sit the greater part of the day listening to her when she would read to him but much preferring to be left alone his life had been active and prosperous but the evening of his days was certainly not happy  his son robert had been anxious to discuss the matter with him first but found himself unable to separate them without an amount of ceremony which would have filled her with suspicion i have received a letter this morning from william he said addressing himself to his father  william bolton is i fear of the world worldly said the stepmother his words always savour to me of the huge ungodly city in which he dwells  but that this was not a time for such an exercise he would have endeavoured to expose the prejudice of the lady as it was he was very gentle william is a man who understands his duty well he said  many do that but few act up to their understanding she rejoined  i think sir i had better read his letter to you it has been written with that intention and i am bound to let you know the contents perhaps mrs bolton will let me go to the end so that we may discuss it afterwards  but mrs bolton would not let him go to the end he had not probably expected such forbearance at every point as to the evidence she interrupted him striving to show that the arguments used were of no real weight she was altogether irrational but still she argued her case well she withered bagwax and dick with her scorn she ridiculed the quarrels of the male and female witnesses she reviled the secretary of state and declared it to be a shame that the queen should have no better advisers but when william bolton spoke of hesters happiness and of the concessions which should be made to secure that she burst out into eloquence what did he know of her happiness was it not manifest that he was alluding to this world without a thought of the next not a reflection as to her souls welfare has once come across his mind she saidnot an idea as to the sin with which her soul would be laden were she to continue to live with the man when knowing that he was not her husband  she would know nothing of the kind said the attorney  she ought to know it said mrs bolton again begging the whole question  but he persevered as he had resolved to do when he left his house upon this difficult mission i am sure my father will acknowledge he said that however strong our own feelings have been we should bow to the conviction of others who  but he was promulgating a doctrine which her conscience required her to stop at once the conviction of others shall never have weight with me when the welfare of my eternal soul is at stake  i am speaking of those who have had better means of getting at the truth than have come within our reach the secretary of state can have no bias of his own in the matter  he is i fear a godless man living and dealing with the godless did i not hear the other day that the great ministers of state will not even give a moment to attend to the short meaningless prayers which are read in the house of commons  no one continued robert bolton trying to get away from sentiment into real argumentno one can have been more intent on separating them than william was when he thought that the evidence was against him now he thinks the evidence in his favour i know no man whose head is clearer than my brothers i am not very fond of john caldigate  nor am i said the woman with an energy which betrayed much of her true feeling  but if it be the case that they are in truth man and wife  in the sight of god they are not so she said  then he continued trying to put aside her interruption and to go on with the assertion he had commenced it must be our duty to acknowledge him for her sake were we not to do so we should stand condemned in the opinion of all the world  who cares for the opinion of the world  and we should destroy her happiness  her happiness here on earth what does that matter there is no such happiness  it was a very hard fight but perhaps not harder than he had expected he had known that she would not listen to reasonthat she would not even attempt to understand it and he had learned before this how impregnable was that will of fanaticism in which she would entrench herselfhow improbable it was that she would capitulate under the force of any argument but he thought it possible that he might move his father to assert himself he was well aware that in the midst of that apparent lethargy his fathers mind was at work with much of its old energy he understood the physical infirmities and religious vacillation which combined had brought the old man into his present state of apparent submission it was hardly two years since the same thing had been done in regard to hesters marriage then mr bolton had asserted himself and declared his will in opposition to his wife there had indeed been much change in him since that time but still something of the old fire remained i have thought it to be my duty sir he said to make known to you williams opinion and my own i say nothing as to social intercourse that must be left to yourself but if this pardon be granted you will i think be bound to acknowledge john caldigate to be your soninlaw  your father agrees with me said mrs bolton rising from her chair and speaking in an angry tone  i hope you both will agree with me as soon as tidings of the pardon reach you you should i think intimate to hester that you accept her marriage as having been true and legal i shall do so even though i should never see him in my house again  you of course will do as you please  and you sir he said appealing to the old man  you have no right to dictate to your father said the wife angrily  he has always encouraged me to offer him my advice then mr bolton shuffled in his chair as though collecting himself for an effortand at last sat up with his head however bent forward and with both his arms resting on the arms of his chair though he looked to be old much older than he was still there was a gleam of fire in his eye he was thin almost emaciated and his head hung forward as though there were not strength left in his spine for him to sit erect i hope sir you do not think that i have gone beyond my duty in what i have said  she shall come here muttered the old man  certainly she shall said mrs bolton if she will do you suppose that i do not long to have my own child in my arms  she shall come here and be called by her name said the father  she shall be hestermy own hester said the mother not feeling herself as yet called upon to contradict her husband  and john caldigate shall come he said  never exclaimed mrs bolton  he shall be asked to come i say he shall am i to be harder on my own child than are all the others shall i call her a castaway when others say that she is an honest married woman  who has called her a castaway  i took the verdict of the jury though it broke my heart he continued it broke my heart to be told that my girl and her child were namelessbut i believed it because the jury said so and because the judge declared it when they tell me the contrary why shall i not believe that i do believe it and she shall come here if she will and he shall come then he got up and slowly moved out of the room so that there might be no further argument on the subject  she had reseated herself with her arms crossed and there sat perfectly mute robert bolton stood up and repeated all his arguments appealing even to her maternal lovebut she answered him never a word she had not even yet succeeded in making the companion of her life submissive to her that was the feeling which was now uppermost in her mind he had said that caldigate should be asked to the house and should be acknowledged throughout all cambridge as his soninlaw and having said it he would be as good as his word she was sure of that of what avail had been all the labour of her life with such a result  i hope you will think that i have done no more than my duty said robert bolton offering her his hand but there she sat perfectly silent with her arms still folded and would take no notice of him goodbye said he striving to put something of the softness of affection into his voice but she would not even bend her head to himand thus he left her  she remained motionless for the best part of an hour then she got up and according to her daily custom walked a certain number of times round the garden her mind was so full that she did not as usual observe every twig almost every leaf as she passed nor now that she was alone was that religious bias which had so much to do with her daily life very strong within her there was no taint of hypocrisy in her character but yet with the force of human disappointment heavy upon her her heart was now hot with human anger and mutinous with human resolves she had proposed to herself to revenge herself upon the men of her husbands familyupon the men who had contrived that marriage for her daughterby devoting herself to the care of that daughter and her nameless grandson and by letting it be known to all that the misery of their condition would have been spared had her word prevailed that they should live together a stern dark but still sympathetic life secluded within the high walls of that lonely abode and that she should thus be able to prove how right she had been how wicked and calamitous their interference with her childthat had been the scheme of her life and now her scheme was knocked on the head and hester was to become a prosperous ordinary married woman amidst the fatness of the land at folking it was all wormwood to her but still as she walked she acknowledged to herself that as that old man had said soso it must be with all her labour with all her care and with all her strength she had not succeeded in becoming the master of that weak old man     chapter lxi  the news reaches cambridge    the tidings of john caldigates pardon reached cambridge on the saturday morning and was communicated in various shapes official letters from the home office were written to the governor of the jail and to the subsheriff to mr seely who was still acting as attorney on behalf of the prisoner and to caldigate himself the latter was longer than the others and contained a gracious expression of her majestys regret that he as an innocent person should have been subjected to imprisonment the secretary of state also was described as being keenly sensible of the injustice which had been perpetrated by the unfortunate and most unusual circumstances of the case as the home office had decided that the man was to be considered innocent it decided also on the expression of its opinion without a shadow of remaining doubt and the news reached cambridge in other ways by the same post william bolton wrote both to his father and brother and mr brown the undersecretary sent a private letter to the old squire at folking of which further mention shall be made before church time on the sunday morning the fact that john caldigate was to be released or had been released from prison was known to all cambridge  caldigate himself had borne his imprisonment on the whole well he had complained but little to those around him and had at once resolved to endure the slowly passing two years with silent fortitudeas a brave man will resolve to bear any evil for which there is no remedy but a more wretched man than he was after the first week of bitterness could hardly be found fortitude has no effect in abating such misery other than what may come from an absence of fretful impatience the man who endures all that the tormentors can do to him without a sign simply refuses to acknowledge the agonies inflicted so it was with caldigate though he obeyed with placid readiness all the prison instructions and composed his features and seemed almost to smile when that which was to be exacted from him was explained he ate his heart in dismay as he counted the days the hours the minutes and then calculated the amount of misery that was in store for him and there was so much more for him to think of than his own condition he knew of course that he was innocent of the crime imputed to himbut would it not be the same to his wife and child as though he had been in truth guilty would not his boy to his dying day be regarded as illegitimate and though he had been wrongly condemned had not all this come in truth from his own fault and when that eternity of misery within the prison walls should have come to an endif he could live through it so as to see the end of itwhat would then be his fate and what his duty he had perfect trust in his wife but who could say what two years might dotwo years during which she would be subjected to the pressure of all her friends where should he find her when the months had passed and if she were no longer at folking would she come back to him he was sure nearly sure that he could not claim her as his wife and were she still minded to share her future lot with him in what way should he treat her if that horrid woman was his wife in the eye of the lawand he feared though hardly knew that it would be sothen could not that other one who was to him as a part of his own soul be his wife also what would become of his child who as far as he could see would not be his child at all in the eye of the law even while he was still a free man still uncondemned an effort had been made to rob him of his wife and boyan effort which for a time had seemed to be successful how would hester be able to withstand such attempts when they would be justified by a legal decision that she was not his wifeand could not become his wife while that other woman was alive such thoughts as these did not tend to relieve the weariness of his days  the only person from the outside world whom he was allowed to see during the three months of his incarceration was mr seely and with him he had two interviews from the time of the verdict mr seely was still engaged in making those enquiries as to the evidence of which we have heard so much and though he was altogether unsympathetic and incredulous still he did his duty he had told his client that these enquiries were being made and had on his second visit informed him of the arrival of dick shand but he had never spoken with hope and had almost ridiculed bagwax with his postagestamps and postmarks when caldigate first heard that dick was in englandfor a minute or twohe allowed himself to be full of hope but the attorney had dashed his hopes what was shands evidence against the testimony of four witnesses who had borne the fire of crossexamination their character was not very good but dicks was if possible worse mr seely did not think that dicks word would go for much he could simply say that as far as he knew there had been no marriage and in this mr seely had been right for dicks word had not gone for much then when crinkett and mrs smith had been arrested no tidings had reached him of that further event it had been thought best that nothing as to that should be communicated to him till the result should be known  thus it had come to pass that when the tidings reached the prison he was not in a state of expectation the governor of the prison knew what was going on and had for days been looking for the order of release but he had not held himself to be justified in acquainting his prisoner with the facts the despatches to him and to caldigate from the home office were marked immediate and by the courtesy of the postmaster were given in at the prison gates before daylight caldigate was still asleep when the door of the cell was opened by the governor in person and the communication was made to him as he lay for the last time stretched on his prison pallet you can get up a free man mr caldigate said the governor with his hand on his prisoners shoulder i have here the queens pardon it has reached me this morning caldigate got up and looked at the man as though he did not at first understand the words that had been spoken it is true mr caldigate here is my authorityand this no doubt is a communication of the same nature to yourself then caldigate took the letter and with his mind still bewildered made himself acquainted with the gratifying fact that all the bigwigs were very sorry for the misfortune which had befallen him  in his state of mind as it then was he was by no means disposed to think much of the injustice done to him he had in store for him for immediate use a whole world of glorious bliss there was his house his property his farm his garden and the free air and there would be the knowledge of all those around him that he had not done the treacherous thing of which those wretches had accused him  and added to all this and above all this there would be his wife and his child it was odd enough that a word from the mouth of an exalted parliamentary personage should be able to give him back one wife and release him from anotherin opposition to the decision of the lawshould avail to restore to his boy the name and birthright of which he had been practically deprived and should by a stroke of his pen undo all that had been done by the combined efforts of jury judge and prosecutor but he found that so it was he was pardoned forsooth as though he were still a guilty man yet he would have back his wife and child and no one could gainsay him  when can i go he said jumping from his bed  when you pleasenow at once but you had better come into the house and breakfast with me first  if i may i would rather go instantly can you send for a carriage for me then the governor endeavoured to explain to him that it would be better for his wife and more comfortable for everybody concerned that she should have been enabled to expect him if it were only for an hour or two before his arrival a communication would doubtless have been made from the home office to some one at folking and as that would be sent out by the footpostman it would not be received before nine in the morning  but caldigate would not allow himself to be persuaded as for eating before he had seen the dear ones at home that he declared to be impossible a vision of what that breakfast might be to him with his own wife at his side came before his eyes and therefore a messenger was at once sent for the vehicle  but the postmaster who from the beginning had never been a believer in the australian wife and being a liberal was staunch to the caldigate side of the question would not allow the letter addressed to the old squire to be retained for the slow operations of the regular messenger but sent it off manfully by horse express before the dawn of day so that it reached the old squire almost as soon as the other letters reached the prison the squire who was an early man was shaving himself when the despatch was brought into his room with an intimation that the boy on horseback wanted to know what he was to do next the boy of course got his breakfast and mr caldigate read his letter which was as follows       home officeoctober 187      my dear sirwhen you did me the honour of calling upon me here i     was able to do no more than express my sympathy as to the misfortune     which had fallen upon your family and to explain to you i fear not     very efficiently that at that moment the mouths of all of us here     were stopped by official prudence as to the matter which was     naturally so near your heart i have now the very great pleasure of     informing you that the secretary of state has this morning received     her majestys command to issue a pardon for your son the official     intimation will be sent to him and to the county authorities by this     post and by the time that this reaches you he will be a free man      in writing to you i need hardly explain that the form of a pardon     from the throne is the only mode allowed by the laws of the country     for setting aside a verdict which has been found in error upon false     evidence unfortunately perhaps we have not the means of annulling     a criminal conviction by a second trial and therefore on such     occasions as thisoccasions which are very rarewe have but this     lame way of redressing a great grievance i am happy to think that     in this case the future effect will be as complete as though the     verdict had been reversed as to the suffering which has been     already endured by your son by his muchinjured wife and by     yourself i am aware that no redress can be given      it is one of those cases in which the honest and good have to     endure a portion of the evil produced by the dishonesty of the     wicked i can only add to this my best wishes for your sons     happiness on his return to his home and express a hope that you     will understand that i would most willingly have made your visit to     the home office more satisfactory had it been within my power to do     sobelieve me very faithfully yours      septimus brown   he had not read this letter to the end and had hardly washed the soap from his face before he was in his daughterinlaws room she was there with her child still in bedthinking thinking thinking whether there would ever come an end to her misery it has come said the old man  what has come she asked jumping up with the baby in her arms but she knew what had come for he had the letter open in his hands  they have pardoned him the absurdity of the thing pardoning a man whom they know to be innocent and to have been injured  but the absurdity of the thing as the old squire very naturally called it was nothing to her now he was to come back to her she would be in his arms that day on that very day she would once again hold up her boy to be kissed by his father  where is he when will he come of course i will go to him you will make them have the waggonnette at once will you not i will be dressed in five minutes if you will go of course i will go to fetch him  but this the squire would not allow the carriage should be sent of course and if it met his son on the road as was probable there would be no harm done but it would not be well that the greeting between the husband and the wife should be in public so he went out to order the carriage and to prepare himself to accompany it leaving her to think of her happiness and to make herself ready for the meeting but when left to herself she could hardly compose herself so as to brush her hair and give herself those little graces which should be pleasant to his eye papa is coming she said to her boy over and over again papa is coming back papa will be here your own own own papa then she threw aside the black gown which she had worn since he left her and chose for her wear one which he himself had taken pride in buying for herthe first article of her dress in the choice of which he had been consulted as her husband and with quick unsteady hand she pulled out some gay ribbon for her baby yesshe and her boy would once again be bright for his sakefor his sake there should again be gay ribbons and soft silks papa is coming my own one your own own papa and then she smothered the child with kisses  while they were sitting at breakfast at puritan grange the same news reached mr and mrs bolton the letter to the old man from his son in town was very short merely stating that the authorities at the home office had at last decided that caldigate should be released from prison the writer knew that his father would be prepared for this news by his brother and all that could be said in the way of argument had been said already the letters which came to puritan grange were few in number and were generally addressed to the lady the bankers letters were all received at the house of business in the town what is it asked the wife as soon as she saw the long official envelope but he read it to the end very slowly before he vouchsafed her any reply it has to do with that wretched man in prison she said what is it  he is in prison no longer  they have let him escape  the queen has pardoned him because he was not guilty  the queen as though she could know whether he be guilty or innocent what can the queen know of the manner of his life in foreign partsbefore he had taken my girl away from me  he never married the woman let there be no more said about it he never married her  but mrs bolton though she was not victorious was not to be silenced by a single word no more about it indeed there must be very much more about it if she was not his wife she was worse she said  he has repented of that  repented she said with scorn what very righteous person ever believed in the repentance of an enemy  why should he not repent  he has had leisure in jail  let us hope that he has used it at any rate he is her husband there are not many days left to me here let me at least see my daughter during the few that remain to me  do i not want to see my own child  i will see her and her boyand i will have them called by the name which is theirs and he shall comeif he will who are you or who am i that we shall throw in his teeth the sins of his youth then she became sullen and there was not a word more said between them that morning but after breakfast the old gardener was sent into town for a fly and mr bolton was taken to the bank  and what are we to do now asked mrs robert bolton of her husband when the tidings were made known to her also at her breakfasttable  we must take it as a fact that she is his wife  of course my dear if the secretary of state were to say that i was his wife i suppose i should have to take it as a fact  if he said that you were a goose it might be nearer the mark  really but a goose must know what she is to do  you must write her a letter and call her mrs caldigate that will be an acknowledgment  and what shall i say to her  ask her to come here if you will  and him  and him too the fact is we have got to swallow it all i was sure that he had married that woman and then of course i wanted to get hester away from him now i believe that he never married her and therefore we must make the best of him as hesters husband  you used to like him  yesand perhaps i shall again but why on earth did he pay twenty thousand pounds to those miscreants that is what i could not get over it was that which made me sure he was guilty it is that which still puzzles me so that i can hardly make up my mind to be quite sure that he is innocent but still we have to be sure perhaps the miracle will be explained some day     chapter lxii  john caldigates return    the carriage started with the old man in it as soon as the horses could be harnessed but on the folking causeway it met the fly which was bringing john caldigate to his homeso that the father and son greeted each other in the street amidst the eyes of the villagers to them it did not much matter but the squire had certainly been right in saving hester from so public a demonstration of her feelings the two men said hardly a word when they met but stood there for a moment grasping each others hands then the driver of the fly was paid and the carriage was turned back to the house is she well asked caldigate  she will be well now  has she been ill  she has not been very happy john while you have been away from her  and the boy  he is all right he has been spared the heartbreaking knowledge of the injury done to him it has been very bad with you i suppose  i do not like being in jail sir it was the length of the time before me that seemed to crush me i could not bring myself to believe that i should live to see the end of it  the end has come my boy said his father again taking him by the hand but the cruelty of the thing remains had there been another trial as soon as the other evidence was obtained the struggle would have kept your heart up it is damnable that a man in an office up in london should have to decide on such a matter and should be able to take his own time about it the grievance was still at the old squires heart in spite of the amenity of mr browns letter but john caldigate who was approaching his house and his wife and to whom after his imprisonment even the flat fields and dykes were beautiful did not at the moment much regard the anomaly of the machinery by which he had been liberated  hester in the meantime had donned her silk dress and had tied the gay bow round her babys frock who was quite old enough to be astonished and charmed by the unusual finery in which he was apparelled then she sat herself at the window of a bedroom which looked out on to the gravel sweep with her boy on her lap and there she was determined to wait till the carriage should come  but she had hardly seated herself before she heard the wheels he is here he is coming there he is she said to the child look look it is papa but she stood back from the window that she might not be seen she had thought it out with many fluctuations as to the very spot in which she would meet him at one moment she had intended to go down to the gate then to the halldoor and again she had determined that she would wait for him in the room in which his breakfast was prepared for him but she had ordered it otherwise at last when she saw the carriage approaching she retreated back from the window so that he should not even catch a glimpse of her but she had seen him as he sat still holding his fathers hand then she ran back to her own chamber and gave her orders as she passed across the passage go down nurse and tell him that i am here run quick nurse tell him to come at once  but he needed no telling whether he had divined her purpose or whether it was natural to him to fly like a bird to his nest he rushed upstairs and was in the room almost before his father had left the carriage she had the child in her hands when she heard him turn the lock of the door but before he entered the boy had been laid in his cradleand then she was in his arms  for the first few minutes she was quite collected not saying much but answering his questions by a word or two oh yes she was well and baby was wellquite well he too looked well she said though there was something of sadness in his face but i will kiss that awayso soon so soon she had always expected that he would come back long long before the time that had been named she had been sure of it she declared because that it was impossible that so great injustice should be done but the last fortnight had been very long when those wicked people had been put in prison she had thought that then surely he would come but now he was there with his arms round her safe in his own home and everything was well then she lifted the baby up to be kissed again and again and began to dance and spring in her joy then suddenly she almost threw the child into his arms and seated herself covered her face with her hands and began to sob with violence when he asked her with much embracing to compose herself sitting close to her kissing her again and again she shook her head as it lay upon his shoulder and then burst out into a fit of laughter what does it matter she said after a while as he knelt at her kneeswhat does it matter my boys father has come back to him my boy has got his own name and he is an honest true caldigate and no one again will tell me that another woman owns my husband my own husband the father of my boy it almost killed me john when they said that you were not mine and yet i knew that they said it falsely i never doubted for a moment i knew that you were my own and that my boy had a right to his fathers name but it was hard to hear them say so john it was hard to bear when my mother swore that it was so  at last they went down and found the old squire waiting for his breakfast i should think said he that you would be glad to see a loaf of bread on a clean board again and to know that you may cut it as you please did they give you enough where you were  i didnt think much about it sir  but you must think about it now said hester to please me you must like everything your tea and your fresh eggs and the butter and the cream you must let yourself be spoilt for a time just to compensate me for your absence  you have made yourself smart to receive him at any rate said the squire who had become thoroughly used to the black gown which she had worn morning noon and evening while her husband was away  why should i not be smart she said when my man has come to me for whose eyes shall i put on the raiment that is his own but for his i was much lower than a widow in the eyes of all men but now i have got my husband back again and my boy shall wear the very best that he has so that his father may see him smile at his own gaudiness yes father i may be smart now there were moments in which i thought that i might never wear more the pretty things which he had given me then she rose from her seat again and hung on his neck and wept and sobbed till he feared that her heartstrings would break with joy  so the morning passed away among them till about eleven oclock when the servant brought in word that mr holt and one or two other of the tenants wanted to see the young master the squire had been sitting alone in the back room so that the husband and wife might be left together but he had heard voices with which he was familiar and he now came through to ask hester whether the visitors should be sent away for the present but hester would not have turned a dog from the door which had been true to her husband through his troubles let them come she said they have been so good to me john through it all they have always known that baby was a true caldigate  holt and the other farmers were shown into the room and holt as a matter of course became the spokesman when caldigate had shaken hands with them all round each muttering his word of welcome then holt began we wish you to know squoire that we none of us aint been comfortable in our minds here at folking since that crawling villain crinkett came and showed himself at our young squires christening  that we aint said timothy purvidge another netherden farmer  i havent had much comfort since that day myself mr purvidge said caldigatenot till this morning  nor yet havent none of us continued mr holt very impressively we knowed as you had done all right we was as sure as the church tower lord love you sir when it was between our young missuswholl excuse me for noticing these bright colours and for saying how glad i am to see her come out once again as our squires wife should come outbetween her and that bedangled woman as i seed in the court it didnt take no one long to know what was the truth the eloquence here was no doubt better than the argument as caldigate must have felt when he remembered how fond he had once been of that bedangled woman hester who though she knew the whole story did not at this moment join two and two together thought that mr holt put the case uncommonly well no we knew he continued with a wave of his hand but the jury werent netherden mennor yet utterden mr halfacre he added turning to a tenant from the other parish and they couldnt tell how it all was as we could and there was that judge who would have believed any miscreant as could be got anywhere to swear away a mans libertyor his wife and family which is amost worse we saw how it was to be when he first looked out of his eye at the two postoffice gents and others who spoke up for the young squoire it was to be guilty we knowd it but it didnt any way change our minds as to crinkett and smith and them others we saw that they were ruffians we never doubted that but we saw as there was a bad time coming to you mr john then we was unhappy unhappy along of you mr johnbut amost worse as to this dear lady and the boy  my missus cried that you wouldnt have believed said mr purvidge if thats true said my missus she aint nobody and its my belief shes as true a wife as ever stretched herself aside her husband then hester bethought herself what present of all presents would be most acceptable to mrs purvidge who was a redfaced redarmed hardworking old woman peculiarly famous for making cheeses  we all knew it said mr holt slapping his thigh with great energy and now in spite of em all judge jury and lying witnessesthe king has got his own again at this piece of triumphant rhetoric there was a cheer from all the farmers and so we have come to wish you all joy and particularly you maam with your boy things have been said of you maam hard to bear no doubt but not a word of the kind at folking nor yet in netherdennor yet at utterden mr halfacre but all this is over and we do hope that you maam and the young squoire ll live long and the young un of all long after we are gone to our restand that youll be as fond of folking as folking is of you i cant say no fairer then the tray was brought in with wine and everybody drank everybodys health and there was another shaking of hands all round mr purvidge it was observed drank the health of every separate member of the family in a separate bumper pressing the edge of the glass securely to his lips and then sending the whole contents down his throat at one throw with a chuck from his little finger  the two caldigates went out to see their friends as far as the gate and while they were still within the grounds there came a merry peal from the bells of netherden churchtower i knew theyd be at it said mr holt  and quite right too said mr halfacre wed rung over at utterden only weve got nothing but that little tinkling thing as is more fitter to swing round a bullocks neck than on a churchtop  i told em as they should have beer said mr brownby whose house stood on folking causeway and they shall have beer mr brownby was a silent man and added nothing to this one pertinent remark  as to beer said mr halfacre wed ave found the beer at utterden there wouldnt have been no grudging the beer mr brownby no more than there is in the lower parish but you cant get up a peal merely on beer youve got to have bells  while they were still standing at the gate mr bromley the clergyman joined them and walked back towards the house with the two caldigates he too had come to offer his congratulations and to assure the released prisoner that he never believed the imputed guilt but he would not go into the house surmising that on such a day the happy wife would not care to see many visitors but caldigate asked him to take a turn about the grounds being anxious to learn something from the outside world what do they say to it all at babington  i think theyre a little divided  my aunt has been against me of course  at first she was i fancy it was natural that people should believe till shand came back  poor dear old dick i must look after dick what about julia  spretæ injuria formæ said mr bromley what were you to expect  ill forgive her and mr smirkie i dont think smirkie ever looked on me with favourable eyes  then the clergyman was forced to own that smirkie too had been among those who had believed the womans story but you have to remember how natural it is that a man should think a verdict to be right in our country a wrong verdict is an uncommon occurrence it requires close personal acquaintance and much personal confidence to justify a man in supposing that twelve jurymen should come to an erroneous decision i thought that they were wrong but still i knew that i could hardly defend my opinion before the outside world  it is all true said caldigate and i have made up my mind that i will be angry with no one who will begin to believe me innocent from this day  his mind however was considerably exercised in regard to the boltons as to whom he feared that they would not even yet allow themselves to be convinced for his wifes happiness their conversion was of infinitely more importance than that of all the outside world beyond when the gloom of the evening had come she too came out and walked with him about the garden and grounds with the professed object of showing him whatever little changes might have been made but the conversation soon fell back upon the last great incident of their joint lives  but your mother cannot refuse to believe what everybody now declares to be true he argued  mamma is so strong in her feelings  she must know they would not have let me out of prison in opposition to the verdict until they were very sure of what they were doing  then she told him all that had occurred between her and her mother since the trialhow her mother had come out to folking and had implored her to return to chesterton and had then taken herself away in dudgeon because she had not prevailed but nothing would have made me leave the place she said after what they tried to do when i was there before except to go to church i have not once been outside the gate  your brothers will come round i suppose robert has been very angry with me i know but he is a man of the world and a man of sense  we must take it as it will come john of course it would be very much to me to have my father and mother restored to me it would be very much to know that my brothers were again my friends but when i remember how i prayed yesterday but for one thing and that now today that one thing has come to mehow i have got that which when i waked this morning seemed to me to be all the world to me the want of which made my heart so sick that even my baby could not make me glad i feel that nothing ought now to make me unhappy i have got you john and everything else is nothing as he stooped in the dark to kiss her again among the rosebushes he felt that it was almost worth his while to have been in prison  after dinner there came a message to them across the ferry from mr holt would they be so good as to walk down to the edge of the great dike opposite to twopenny farm at nine oclock as a part of the message mr holt sent word that at that hour the moon would be rising of course they went down to the dikemr caldigate john caldigate and hester there outside mr holts farmyard just far enough to avoid danger to the hayricks and cornstacks there was blazing an enormous bonfire all the rotten timber about the place and two or three tarbarrels had been got together and there were collected all the inhabitants of the two parishes the figures of the boys and girls and of the slow rustics with their wives could be seen moving about indistinctly across the water by the fluttering flame of the bonfire and their own figures too were observed in the moonlight and john caldigate was welcomed back to his home by a loud cheer from all his neighbours  i did not see much of it myself mr holt said afterwards because me and my missus was busy among the stacks all the time looking after the sparks the bonfire might a been too big you know     chapter lxiii  how mrs bolton was quite conquered    nearly a week passed over their heads at puritan grange before anything further was either done or said or even written as to the return of john caldigate to his own home and to his own wife in the meantime both mrs robert and mrs daniel had gone out to folking and made visits of ceremonyvisits which were intended to signify their acknowledgment that mrs john caldigate was mrs john caldigate with mrs daniel the matter was quite ceremonious and short mrs robert suggested something as to a visit into cambridge saying that her husband would be delighted if hester and mr caldigate would come and dine and sleep hester immediately felt that something had been gained but she declined the proposed visit for the present we have both of us she said gone through so much that we are not quite fit to go out anywhere yet mrs robert had hardly expected them to come but she had observed her husbands behests so far there had been a family reconciliation during the first few days after the prisoners release but no sign came from mrs bolton and mr bolton though he had given his orders was not at first urgent in requiring obedience to them then she received a letter from hester       dearest dearest mammaof course you know that my darling husband     has come back to me all i want now to make me quite happy is to     have you once again as my own own mother will you not send me a     line to say that it shall all be as though these last long dreary     months had never beenso that i may go to you and show you my baby     once again and dear mamma say one word to me to let me know that     you know that he is my husband tell papa to say so alsoyour most     affectionate daughter      hester caldigate   mrs bolton found this letter on the breakfasttable lying as was usual with her letters close to her plate and she read it without saying a word to her husband then she put it in her pocket and still did not say a word before the middle of the day she had almost made up her mind that she would keep the letter entirely to herself it was well she thought that he had not seen it and no good could be done by showing it to him but he had been in the breakfastparlour before her had seen the envelope and had recognised the handwriting they were sitting together after lunch and she was just about to open the book of sermons with which at that time she was regaling him when he stopped her with a question what did hester say in her letter  even those who intend to be truthful are sometimes surprised into a lie what letter she said but she remembered herself at once and knew that she could not afford to be detected in a falsehood that note from hester yesi had a note this morning  i know you had a note what does she say  she tells me that hehe has come back  and what else she was well aware that we knew that without her telling us  she wants to come here  bid her come  of course she shall come  and him to this she made no answer except with the muscles of her face which involuntarily showed her antagonism to the order she had received bid her bring her husband with her said the banker  he would not comethough i were to ask him  then let it be on his own head  i will not ask him she said at last looking away across the room at the blank wall i will not belie my own heart i do not want to see him here he has so far got the better of me but i will not put my neck beneath his feet for him to tread on me  then there was a pausenot that he intended to allow her disobedience to pass but that he was driven to bethink himself how he might best oppose her woman he said you can neither forgive nor forget  he has got my child from memy only child  does he persecute your child is she not happy in his love even if he have trespassed against you who are you that you should not forgive a trespass i say that he shall be asked to come here that men may know that in her own fathers house she is regarded as his true and honest wife  men she murmured that men may know but she did not again tell him that she would not obey his command  she sat all the remainder of the day alone in her room hardly touching the work which she had beside her not opening the book which lay by her hand on the table she was thinking of the letter which she knew that she must write but she did not rise to get pen and ink nor did she even propose to herself that the letter should be written then not a word was said about it all the evening on the next morning the banker pronounced his intention of going into town but before he started he referred to the order he had given have you written to hester he asked she merely shook her head then write today so saying he tottered down the steps with his stick and got into the fly  about noon she did get her paper and ink and very slowly wrote her letter though her heart was in truth yearning towards her daughterthough at that moment she could have made any possible sacrifice for her child had her child been apart from the man she hatedshe could not in her sullenness force her words into a form of affection       dear hester she said of course i shall be glad to see you and     your boy on what day would it suit you to come and how long would     you like to stay i fear you will find me and your father but dull     companions after the life you are now used to if mr caldigate     would like to come with you your father bids me say that he will     be glad to see himyour loving mother      mary bolton   she endeavoured in writing her letter to obey the commands that had been left with her but she could not go nearer to it than this she could not so far belie her heart as to tell her daughter that she herself would be glad to see the man then it took her long to write the address she did write it at last     mrs john caldigate   folking   but as she wrote it she told herself that she believed it to be a lie  when the letter reached hester there was a consultation over it to which old mr caldigate was admitted it was acknowledged on all sides that anything would be better than a family quarrel the spirit in which the invitation had been written was to be found in every word of it there was not a word to show that mrs bolton had herself accepted the decision to which everyone else had come in the mattereverything rather to show that she had not done so but as the squire said it does not do to inquire too closely into all peoples inner beliefs if everybody were to say what he thinks about everybody nobody would ever go to see anybody it was soon decided that hester with her baby should go on an early day to puritan grange and should stay there for a couple of nights but there was a difficulty as to caldigate himself he was naturally enough anxious to send hester without him but she was as anxious to take him it isnt for my own sake she saidbecause i shall like to have you there with me of course it will be very dull for you but it will be so much better that we should all be reconciled and that everyone should know that we are so  it would only be a pretence said he  people must pretend sometimes john she answered at last it was decided that he should take her reaching the place about the hour of lunch so that he might again break bread in her fathers housethat he should then leave her there and that at the end of the two days she should return to folking  on the day named they reached puritan grange at the hour fixed both caldigate and hester were very nervous as to their reception and got out of the carriage almost without a word to each other the old gardener who had been so busy during hesters imprisonment was there to take the luggage and hesters maid carried the child as caldigate with his wife behind him walked up the steps and rang the bell there was no coming out to meet them no greeting them even in the hall mr bolton was perhaps too old and too infirm for such running out and it was hardly within his nature to do so they were shown into the wellknown morning sittingroom and there they found hesters father in his chair and mrs bolton standing up to receive them  hester after kissing her father threw herself into her mothers arms before a word had been said to caldigate then the banker addressed him with a set speech which no doubt had been prepared in the old mans mind i am very glad he said that you have brought this unhappy matter to so good a conclusion mr caldigate  it has been a great troubleworse almost for hester than for me  yes it has been sad enough for hesterand the more so because it was natural that others should believe that which the jury and the judge declared to have been proved how should any one know otherwise  just so mr bolton if they will accept the truth now i shall be satisfied  it will come but perhaps slowly to some folk you should in justice remember that your own early follies have tended to bring this all about  it was a grim welcome and the last speech was one which caldigate found it difficult to answer it was so absolutely true that it admitted of no answer he thought that it might have been spared and shrugged his shoulders as though to say that that part of the subject was one which he did not care to discuss hester heard it and quivered with anger even in her mothers arms mrs bolton heard it and in the midst of her kisses made an inward protest against the word used follies indeed why had he not spoken out the truth as he knew it and told the man of his vices  but it was necessary that she too should address him i hope i see you quite well mr caldigate she said giving him her hand  the prison has not disagreed with me he said with an attempt at a smile though it was not an agreeable residence  if you used your leisure there to meditate on your souls welfare it may have been of service to you  it was very grim but the banker having made his one severe speech became kind in his manner and almost genial he asked after his soninlaws future intentions and when he was told that they thought of spending some months abroad so as to rid themselves in that way of the immediate record of their past misery he was gracious enough to express his approval of the plan and then when the lunch was announced and the two ladies had passed out of the room he said a word to his soninlaw in private as i was convinced mr caldigate when i first heard the evidence that that other woman was your wife and was therefore very anxious to separate my daughter from you so am i satisfied now that the whole thing was a wicked plot  i am very glad to hear you say that sir  now if you please we will go in to lunch  as long as caldigate remained in the house mrs bolton was almost silent the duties of a hostess she performed in a stiff ungainly way she asked him whether he would have hashed mutton or cold beef and allowed him to pour a little sherry into her wineglass but beyond this there was not much conversation mr bolton had said what he had to say and sat leaning forward with his chin over his plate perfectly silent it is to be supposed that he had some pleasure in having his daughter once more beneath his roof especially as he had implored his wife not to deprive him of that happiness during the small remainder of his days but he sat there with no look of joy upon his face that she should be stern sullen and blackbrowed was to be expected she had been compelled to entertain their guest and was not at all the woman to bear such compulsion meekly  the hour at last wore itself away and the carriage which was to take caldigate back to folking was again at the door it was a tuesday you will send for me on thursday she said to him in a whisper  certainly  early after breakfast you know i suppose you will not come yourself  not here i think i have done all the good that i can do and it is pleasant to no one but you shall pick me up in the town i shall go in and see your brother robert then he went and hester was left with her parents  as she turned back from the halldoor she found her mother standing at the foot of the stairs waiting for her shall i come with you mamma she said holding each others arms they went up and so passed into hesters room where the nurse was sitting with the boy let her go into my room said the elder lady so the nurse took the baby away and they were alone together oh hester hester my child said the mother flinging her arms wildly round her daughter  the whole tenor of her face was changed at that moment even to hester she had been stern forbidding and sullen there had not been a gracious movement about her lips or eyes since the visitors had come a stranger could a stranger have seen it all would have said that the mother did not love her child that there was no touch of tenderness about the womans heart but now when she was alone with the one thing on earth that was dear to her she melted at once in a moment hester found herself seated on the sofa with her mother kneeling before her sobbing and burying her face in the loved ones lap you love me hesterstill  love you mamma you know i love you  not as it used to be i am nothing to you now i can do nothing for you now you turn away from me becausebecausebecause  i have never turned away from you mamma  because i could not bear that you should be taken away from me and given to him  he is good mamma if you would only believe that he is good  he is not good god only is good my child  he is good to me  ah yeshe has taken you from me when i thought you were coming back in trouble in disgrace from the world nameless a poor injured thing with your nameless babe then i comforted myself because i thought that i could be all and everything to you i would have poured balm into the hurt wounds i would have prayed with you and you and i would have been as one before the lord  you are not sorry mamma that i have got my husband again  oh i have triedi have tried not to be sorry  you do not believe now that that woman was his wife  then the old colour came back upon her face and something of the old look and the tenderness was quenched in her eyes and the softness of her voice was gone i do not know she said  mamma you must know get up and sit by me till i tell you you must teach yourself to know thisto be quite sure of it you must not think that your daughter isis living in adultery with the husband of another woman to me who knew him there has never been a shadow of a doubt not a taint of fear to darken the certainty of my faith it could not have been so perhaps with you who have not known his nature but now now when all of them from the queen downwards have declared that this charge has been a libel when even the miscreants themselves have told against themselves when the very judge has gone back from the word in which he was so confident shall my motherand my mother onlythink that i am a wretched miserable nameless outcast with a poor nameless fatherless baby i am john caldigates wife before gods throne and my child is his child and his lawful heir and owns his fathers name my husband is to me before all the worldfirst best dearestmy king my man my master and my lover above all things he is my husband she had got up and was standing before her mother with her arms folded before her breast and the fire glanced from her eyes as she spoke but mamma because i love him more i do not love you less  oh yes oh yes so much less  no mamma it is given to us of god so to love our husband for the husband is head of the wife even as christ is head of the church you would not have me forget such teaching as that  nomy child no  when i went out and had him given to me for my husband of course i loved him best the lord do so to me and more also if aught but death part him and me but shall that make my mother think that her girls heart is turned away from her mamma say that he is my husband the frown came back and the woman sat silent and sullen but there was something of vacillating indecision in her face mamma repeated hester say that he is my husband  i suppose so said the woman very slowly  mamma say that it is so and bless your child  god bless you my child  and you know that it is so  yes the word was hardly spoken but the lips of the one were close to the ear of the other and the sound was heard and the assent was acknowledged     chapter lxiv  conclusion    the web of our story has now been woven the piece is finished and it is only necessary that the loose threads should be collected so that there may be no unravelling in such chronicles as this something no doubt might be left to the imagination without serious injury to the story but the reader i think feels a deficiency when through tedium or coldness the writer omits to give all the information which he possesses  among the male personages of my story bagwax should perhaps be allowed to stand first it was his energy and devotion to his peculiar duties which after the verdict served to keep alive the idea that that verdict had been unjust it was through his ingenuity that judge bramber was induced to refer the inquiry back to scotland yard and in this way to prevent the escape of crinkett and euphemia smith therefore we will first say a word as to bagwax and his history  it was rumoured at the time that sir john joram and mr brown having met each other at the club after the order for caldigates release had been given and discussing the matter with great interest united in giving praise to bagwax then sir john told the story of those broken hopes of the mans desire to travel and of the faith and honesty with which he sacrificed his own aspirations for the good of the poor lady whose husband had been so cruelly taken away from her thenas it was said at the timean important letter was sent from the home office to the postmastergeneral giving mr bagwax much praise and suggesting that a very good thing would be done to the colony of new south wales if that ingenious and skilful master of postmarks could be sent out to sydney with the view of setting matters straight in the sydney office 1 there was then much correspondence with the colonial office which did not at first care very much about bagwax but at last the order was given by the treasury and bagwax went there were many tears shed on the occasion at apricot villa jemima curlydown thought that she also should be allowed to see sydney and was in favour of an immediate marriage with this object but bagwax felt that the boisterous ocean might be unpropitious to the delights of a honeymoon and mr curlydown reminded his daughter of all the furniture which would thus be lost bagwax went as a gay bachelor and spent six happy months in the bright colony he did not effect much as the delinquent who had served crinkett in his base purposes had already been detected and punished before his arrival but he was treated with extreme courtesy by the sydney officials and was able to bring home with him a treasure in the shape of a newlydiscovered manner of tying mailbags so that when the sydney intelligencer boasted that the great english professor who had come to instruct them all had gone home instructed there was some truth in it he was married immediately after his return and jemima his wife has the advantage in her very pretty drawingroom of every shilling that he made by the voyage my readers will be glad to hear that soon afterwards he was appointed inspectorgeneral of postmarks to the great satisfaction of all the postoffice       footnote 1 i hope my friends in the sydney postoffice will take     no offence should this story ever reach their ears i know how well     the duties are done in that office and between ourselves i think     that mr bagwaxs journey was quite unnecessary   one of the few things which caldigate did before he took his wife abroad was to look after dick shand it was manifest to all concerned that dick could do no good in england his yellow trousers and the manners which accompanied them were not generally acceptable in merchants offices and suchlike places he knew nothing about english farming which for those who have not learned the work early is an expensive amusement rather than a trade by which bread can be earned there seemed to be hardly a hope for dick in england but he had done some good among the south sea islanders he knew their ways and could manage them he was sent out therefore with a small capital to be junior partner on a sugar estate in queensland it need hardly be said that the small capital was lent to him by john caldigate there he took steadily to work and it is hoped by his friends that he will soon begin to repay the loan  the uncle aunt and cousins at babington soon renewed their intimacy with john caldigate and became intimate with hester the old squire still turned up his nose at them as he had done all his life calling them boeotians and reminding his son that suffolk had always been a silly county but the babingtons one and all knew this and had no objection to be accounted thickheaded as long as they were acknowledged to be prosperous happy and comfortable it had always been considered at babington that young caldigate was brighter and more clever than themselves and yet he had been popular with them as a cousin of whom they ought to be proud he was soon restored to his former favour and after his return from the continent spent a fortnight at the hall with his wife very comfortably julia indeed was not there nor mr smirkie among all their neighbours and acquaintances mr smirkie was the last to drop the idea that there must have been something in that story of an australian marriage his theory of the law on the subject was still incorrect the queens pardon he said could not do away with the verdict and therefore he doubted whether the couple could be regarded as man and wife he was very anxious that they should be married again and with great goodnature offered to perform the ceremony himself either at plumcumpippins or even in the drawingroom at folking  suffolk to the very backbone was the remark of the cambridgeshire squire when he heard of this very kind offer but even he at last came round under his wifes persuasion when he found that the paternal mansion was likely to be shut against him unless he yielded  hesters second tour with her husband was postponed for some weeks because it was necessary that her husband should appear as a witness against crinkett and euphemia smith they were tried also at cambridge but not before judge bramber the woman never yielded an inch when she found how it was going with her she made fast her money and with infinite pluck resolved that she would endure with patience whatever might be in store for her and wait for better times when put into the dock she pleaded not guilty with a voice that was audible only to the jailer standing beside her and after that did not open her mouth during the trial crinkett made a great effort to be admitted as an additional witness against his comrade but having failed in that pleaded guilty at last he felt that there was no hope for him with such a weight of evidence against him and calculated that his punishment might thus be lighter and that he would save himself the cost of an expensive defence in the former hope he was deceived as the two were condemned to the same term of imprisonment when the woman heard that she was to be confined for three years with hard labour her spirit was almost broken but she made no outward sign and as she was led away out of the dock she looked round for caldigate to wither him with the last glance of her reproach but caldigate who had not beheld her misery without some pang at his heart had already left the court  judge bramber never opened his mouth upon the matter to a single human being he was a man who in the bosom of his family did not say much about the daily work of his life and who had but few friends sufficiently intimate to be trusted with his judicial feelings the secretary of state was enabled to triumph in the correctness of his decision but it may be a question whether judge bramber enjoyed the triumph the matter had gone luckily for the secretary but how would it have been had crinkett and the woman been acquittedhow would it have been had caldigate broken down in his evidence and been forced to admit that there had been a marriage of some kind no doubt the accusation had been false no doubt the verdict had been erroneous but the man had brought it upon himself by his own egregious folly and would have had no just cause for complaint had he been kept in prison till the second case had been tried it was thus that judge bramber regarded the matterbut he said not a word about it to any one  when the second trial was over caldigate and his wife started for paris but stayed a few days on their way with william bolton in london he and his wife were quite ready to receive hester and her husband with open arms i tell you fairly said he to caldigate that when there was a doubt i thought it better that you and hester should be apart you would have thought the same had she been your sister now i am only too happy to congratulate both of you that the truth has been brought to light  on their return mrs robert bolton was very friendlyand robert bolton himself was at last brought round to acknowledge that his convictions had been wrong but there was still much that stuck in his throat why did john caldigate pay twenty thousand pounds to those persons when he knew that they had hatched a conspiracy against himself this question he asked his brother william over and over again and never could be satisfied with any answer which his brother could give him  once he asked the question of caldigate himself because i felt that in honour i owed it to them said caldigate and perhaps a little too because i felt that if they took themselves off at once your sister might be spared something of the pain which she has suffered but still it was unintelligible to robert bolton that any man in his senses should give away so large a sum of money with so slight a prospect of any substantial return  hester often goes to see her mother but mrs bolton has never been at folking and probably never will again visit that house she is a woman whose heart is not capable of many changes and who cannot readily give herself to new affections but having once owned that john caldigate is her daughters husband she now alleges no further doubt on the matter she writes the words mrs john caldigate without a struggle and does take delight in her daughters visits  when last i heard from folking mrs john caldigates second boy had just been born
