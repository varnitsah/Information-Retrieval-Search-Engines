down with the traitors down with the russian spies down with metzger  above the roaring of the north wind rose the clamour of voices the cries of hate and disgust the deep groaning sobs of fierce and militant anger the man and the woman exchanged quick glances  they are coming nearer he said  she drew aside the heavy curtain and stood there looking out into the night  it is so she answered they are pouring into the square  he rose and stood beneath the great carved mantelpiece over his head hewn out of the solid oak black with age and coloured with that deep richness which is today as a lost art were blazoned the arms of one of europes noblest families he nicholas of reist its sole male representative stood deep in thought his dark young face furrowed with anxiety the moment was critical it was one of a lifetime  she dropped the curtain and came over to his side the flush of excitement was in her cheeks her eyes were like shining stars of their close relationship there could be no manner of doubt the same oval face and finelycut features the same pride of race the same firm graceful bearing only there were lines upon his facethe lines of thought and care whilst hers remained as smooth as damask typically and wonderfully beautiful  again the murmur of hoarse voicesnearer now and more clamorous  down with the traitor metzger and his accursed government reist reist a reist  her white fingers fell upon his shoulder  they are calling for you nicholas she said softly listen it is the voice of our people and they need you will you go out and speak to them shall i open the windowyes  not yet he answered swiftly not yet  her hands were already upon the curtains she turned around an impatient frown upon her face  you do not hesitate my brother she cried no it is not possible it is our country nicholas our homeland which calls for you to save it  ay to save itbut how metzger has made the way difficult  her eyes flashed fire upon him she was superbly disdainful  are you the first duke of reist who has governed theos she cried is there not the blood of former kings in your veins holy mother but it is intolerable that you should hesitate nicholas if you let these people call in vain you will be the first of our race who has ever shrunk from his duty i will not call you any longer my brother listen  reist nicholas of reist down with the common dogs down with the traitors down with metzger  he smiled faintly those subtle lines about his mouth were not there in vain  i wonder where metzger is hiding he murmured how good it would be to see him now how he would quiver and shake there is death in those voices  she flashed a look of impatient scorn upon him  you are trifling with your destiny nicholas she cried what matters the life or death of such as metzger our people need you out and tell the men of theos that once again a reist will save his country  brave words little sister brave words  her eyes were ablaze with anger  have i been mistaken in you all these years nicholas she cried listen again those are the children of your city who call to you for aid have you no longer the heart of a man or the blood of a patriot  a storm of wind and rain shook the high windows from below came the sound of a multitude thronging nearer and nearer till the square seemed filled to overflowing with a surging mob the man raised his head as one who listens and the smile no longer lightened his face the woman who watched him anxiously drew a long sigh of relief she knew then beyond a doubt that it needed no words from her to fire his resolution  marie he said quietly those are the voices which i have prayed all my life that i might hear only i fear that they have come too soon have you considered what it is that they would have from me  they would make you lord of the country she cried who better or more fitted have no fear nicholas you come of a race of rulers the god of our fathers will guide your destiny  the room huge unlit and darkened with tapestry hangings seemed full of mysterious shadows only those two facesthe girls passionate the mans keenly thoughtfulseemed like luminous things from below came still the murmur of voices rising every now and then to a hoarse roar the man became suddenly explicit his face relaxed he came back from a faraway land of thought  listen he said these people have come to put me in metzgers place there would be no difficulty about that already i have received a message from the house of laws bah i have no stomach to sit in council with tradesmen and citizens to have my will questioned to rule only by a casting vote these modern forms of government are vile they would make me president of their republici a reist of theos whose forefathers ruled the land with sword and fire they would put me in the place of metzger the merchantmetzger who would have sold his country to the russians i say no  what then she cried what then speak nicholas there are thoughts behind who but i should know them  when i rule theos he answered slowly it shall be even as the dukes of reist have ruled it before me with a sceptre in their hands and a sword upon their knees that time is not yet marie but it may come i think that you and i will see it  why not now she cried the people would accept you on any terms the republic has fallen you shall be their king  he shook his head  the time is not yet he repeated marie believe me i know my people in their blood lingers still some taint of the democratic fever you must learn little sister as i have learned it the legend on our walls and shield the motto of our race slowly but ever forward  but the people she cried what will you say to them it is you whom they want their throats are hoarse with shouting  he threw open the great windows and a roar of welcome from below rose high above the storm  you shall hear what i will say to them marie he answered come out by my side     chapter ii   almost as the man stepped out on to the massive stone balcony of his house the wind dropped and a red flaring sun dipped behind the towering mountains which guarded the city westwards and eastwards a roar of greeting welcomed his appearance and while he waited for silence his eyes rested fondly upon the long line of ironbound hills stern and silent guardians of the city of his birth for a moment he forgot his ambitions and the long unswerving pursuit of his great desire the love of his country was born in the manthe better part of him was steeped in patriotic fervour and most of all he loved this ancient city amongst the hills the capital of the state where many generations of his family had lived and died dear to him were its squares and narrow streets the ancient stone houses the many picturesque records of its great age ever as it seemed to him frowning with a stern and magnificent serenity amongst the tawdry evidences of later days and the irresistible march of modernity the wineshops of a hundred years ago flourished still side by side with the more pretentious caf√©s half french half russian which had sprung up like mushrooms about the city the countrymade homespuns the glassware and metal work heritage of generations of craftsmen survived still the hideous competition of cheap lancashire productions and brummagem ware the picturesque old fought a brave battle with the tinsel and tawdriness of the new if nicholas of reist could have had his way he would have built an impenetrable wall against this slow poison the unwelcome heritage of western progress he would have thrust the ages back a century and built bulwarks about his beloved country he looked downwards and his heart grew warm within him many of the people who shouted his name were from the country districts and wore the picturesque garb of their forefathers long extinct in the city the sight of their eager upturned faces was dear to him some day they should be his people indeed it should be his country to rule as he thought best he felt himself at that moment a patriot pure and simple  so he spoke to them in that clear sweet voice which every reist possessed and he spoke fluently and convincingly  my fellowcountrymen he said these are not days for those who love their country to waste breath in idle speech your republic of which you were so proud has fallen metzger has proved himself a traitor well i am not surprised at either of these things i warned you but you would not listen your ancient kings must indeed have turned in their graves when you elected to be ruled by such men you have tried them and you have been betrayed what would you have with me  a new government they cried a reist for president  he raised his hand the roar of voices died away at once  you would put me he said in metzgers place you would make me president of the republic of theos is that what you would have  ay ay from a thousand tongues then there was a breathless silence they waited in deep anxiety for the answer of this man whom they had come to look upon as their one possible saviour  for awhile he stood there speechless deep in thought after all was he not throwing away a certainty for what might prove an empty dream there had been presidents who had become dictators and between that and monarchy the chasm was narrow and easily bridged it was not for long however that he wavered his plans were too carefully thought out to be changed by an impulse however powerful his time was not yet  my people he said quietly i thank you and i am sorry that what you ask may not be it is not because i do not love my country it is not because i would not shed my last drop of blood in her defence but president of your republic i never will be no earthly power should draw my footsteps across the threshold of your brandnew parliament  there arose a deep murmur of disappointmentalmost of despair they shouted questions appeals prayers and nicholas of reist leaned far over his timeworn stone balcony and spoke to them again  you are questioning my patriotism he cried you do not understand very well you shall know all that is in my mind i am going to say what will sound like treason to you perhaps you will shout me downit may be that you will leave me now in disgust nevertheless listen i hate your republic it is a rotten corrupt thing i hate what you have called your parliament there is scarcely a man in it whom i would trust what has your newfangled scheme of government done for you it has made you the sport and plaything of the powers our independence is hourly threatened ay even before this year has passed away the cannon of the invader may be thundering against your walls when that time comes i promise that you shall not call to me in vain you shall find me amongst you sword in hand and i pray god that i may do my duty as a patriot and a faithful son of the state but this thing which you ask of me now i will not do i will not take my seat at the same table with those who have helped metzger to traffic in the freedom of this country i will not speak with or have any dealing with them how is it that you have dared to ask me this thing men of theos already the war beacons are builtsoon they may be reddening our skies this is what your republic has done for you and as god is my witness so long as that republic exists i will not lift my little finger to help you  something of a panic seized the people for indeed the words of the speaker had come home to them winged with a foretelling truth metzger their president had been caught redhanded in a flagrant attempt to barter away the freedom of their country who else might not be implicated they looked at one another fearfully one feeling alone was common to all before them was the only man whom they could trustone of their ancient nobility a patriot above suspicion he had more to say they would take him on his own terms so once more the air was rent with their cries and nicholas of reist raised again his hand  listen he said you want my advice you have come to me because the state is in danger and because those who should have defended it have played you false so be it i speak to you as man to man citizen of theos to citizen of theos no republic can save you it is a king you want  a deep hoarse murmur swept upwards from the packed square the republic had been their plaything the caprice of an impulsive people and they were loth to own themselves in the wrong nicholas of reist read their faces like a book now or never must he win his way from this people or fall forever from their regard his pale countenance was lit with a passionate earnestness he leaned towards them and his voice throbbed with tremulous eloquence  listen he cried you have had a parliament and a presidentmetzger what glories has he won for youhow has he enriched you how much more prosperous is our country i will tell you what he has done he has tried to sell you and theos for a million pounds oh i am not afraid to tell you the truth though one of you should shoot me whilst i stand here theos was to become a tributary state to russia your country which has defied conquest for a thousand years was to be bartered away that one man might live in luxury on his miserable bloodmoney men of theos turn over the back pages of your countrys history think of those heroes who gave their lives that you might be free men think of king rudolph who vanquished all the hosts of austria or king ughtred who drove the turks back across the balkans in midwinter and with five thousand illarmed men routed the whole army of the sultan remember rudolph the second who defended this very city for twelve months against fifty thousand turks until for very shame england held up her hand and all europe rang with the gallantry of our king and his little band of halfstarved soldiers leave republics to nations who have no past and whose souls are steeped in commerce what have we to do with them we have a magnificent history an ancient and glorious country we have soldiers few perhaps but matchless throughout the world and men of theos listen metzger has gone far in his treachery i know nothing of your state affairs but this i do know the covetousness of those with whom he dealt is whetted they are not likely to bear their disappointment quietly before many months have passed the storm may burstthe war beacons may be flaring round our borders so i say to you have no more dealings with republics scatter your parliament to the four winds of heaven summon back your ancient house of laws choose for yourselves a soldier king one of the ancient and royal race who shall rule you as his forefathers did in times of peace and ride before you with drawn sword when the war clouds gather  the babel of many voices broke loose reist felt his sisters fingers close upon his arm  it is you who must be their king nicholas  he shook his head then they saw that he would speak again and the murmur of voices died away reist leaned over towards them and his face was very pale this was his renunciation  my people he said listen many of you have heard of the war which the english have been carrying on in egypt you have heard perhaps of a captain erlito who with a dozen men held a nile fort for two days against a thousand dervishes and for this and other acts of valour has won the iron cross but this at least you do not know captain erlito is the assumed name of ughtred of tyrnaus prince of theos  the murmur of voices became a roar of acclamation then nicholas of reist raised his voice at once  listen men of theos he cried is it your will that i seek out for you prince ughtred and offer him the throne of theos think well before you answer he is a soldier a brave and honest man and he is of the royal race of tyrnaus who for many generations have been kings of theos he will not sell you to russia or beckon the hosts of the sultan across the mountains will you have him for your king  the square nay the city rang with their passionate answer never was anything more unanimous nicholas stepped back into the room his sister faced him with blazing eyes and cheeks dyed red with anger  fool she cried fool they would have made you king they were yours to do what you would with you have been false to your destiny i will never forgive you nicholas  he smiled curiously and pointed upwards to that deepengraven legend  my time he said is not yet     chapter iii   the lift went rumbling up to the topmost storey of the great block of flats and stopped at last with something of a groan the gates were opened and reist stepped out he looked about him at the bare walls the stone floor and shrugged his shoulders erlito was none too well lodged thensoldiering had brought him some brief fame but little else then he suddenly smiled the incongruity of the thing was ridiculous his sense of humour by no means a characteristic trait of the man was touched the smile lingered upon his lips he had come to offer a kingdom to a pauper  the liftboy slammed his gates and prepared to descend  captain erlitos rooms are at the end of the passage sir he volunteered last door on the left  the information was properly rewarded and the boys tolerant contempt for the foreigner who at his journeys end seemed afflicted with a curious hesitation became an extinct thing he pulled the rope and descended in hot haste a large silver coin locked in his fingers and a glorious tingling sensation of unbounded wealth in his bosom  reist knocked at the door which had been pointed out to him and waited there came no answer he tried again and became conscious of a confused volume of sounds within altogether drowning his summons for admission he listened perplexed light and rapid footsteps the swishing of a silken skirt a clear musical laugh and cry of triumph a succession of sounds which were wholly meaningless to him surely it was some sort of pandemonium a momentary silence was followed by a chorus of voices reist raised his stick and knocked more loudly a mans voice travelled out to him like mild thunder  come in  reist opened the door and crossed the threshold before him was an explanation of the sounds which he had heard only he was if possible a little more bewildered than ever  he was in a high bare apartment carpetless and almost without furniture across the middle of the floor was stretched an upright net and on either side of it were chalkmarked squares facing him was a girl with her left foot poised slightly forward her arm raised in the act of striking a feathered cork with a small racquet by her side was a man whom reist recognized at once directly he saw his visitor he stopped the game  one moment miss van decht he cried i am wanted  he crossed the room swinging his racquet in his hand and addressed reist with a pleasant smile  we have been making so much noise he said that i am afraid we did not hear your first knock i am captain erlito you wished to see me  reist looked him steadily and full in the face if physique went for anything this man was surely born to be a king he was well over six feet splendidly made and of military appearance his features were cleancut in the unmistakable tyrnaus mouldonly his mouth which stern though it was was full of humour seemed unfamiliar his eyes were a wonderful deep blue and his skin bronzed and burned with the egyptian sun a momentary bitterness possessed reist the people of theos would care little for the brains which this man might lack the first glance of him would be sufficient they would shout him king till they were hoarse  you do not remember me then reist asked softly  erlito stood swinging his racquet lightly in his fingers and looked into his visitors face with pleasant and deferential courtesy  do you know he said i am very sorry but i am afraid that i do not i have a very bad memory for faces there is something about yours which seems to me familiar but it comes from a long way back  reist smiled faintly  yes he said it comes indeed from a long way back it comes from our boyhood i hope at least that you have not forgotten my name i am nicholas of reist  a radiant smile broke across erlitos face he dropped his racquet and held out both his hands  it is little nick he cried by all that is wonderful it is little nick remember you why we played soldiers together when we were children a thousand thousand welcomes  he wrung his visitors hands his eyes were very bright he was undoubtedly affected  i am glad that you have not forgotten those days reist murmured as children we were together day by day yet it is very long ago and for you at least he continued there have been so many great happenings  it is splendid of you to have found me out erlito cried i imagined that no one knew even of my existence and marie  my sister is quite well reist answered i had forgotten for the moment that she too was once your playmate it is so long ago  she is with you in london you are living here perhaps erlito asked it is the most hospitable city in the world  reist shook his head  there is only one home for us he answered i do not love strange cities  you mean  theos  erlitos face clouded suddenly over he glanced uneasily behind him his face became graver his expression resolved itself into sterner lines a sudden bitterness found its way into his tone the mention of theos had stung him  the republic tolerates aristocrats then he remarked you are fortunate  reist drew himself up  the republic he answered proudly would never dare to interfere with us while the people of theos remain we of reist are safe  there was a momentary pause reist was conscious that his impetuous speech was scarcely a happy one for it was this man indeed who was the outcastwhose name even had become strange to the people over whom his forefathers had ruled erlito showed no resentment but his eyes were very sorrowful  your family he said slowly have always been patriots you deserve well of your country people  reist glanced once more around the room  my visit to you he said is not one of courtesynay let me say affection only i have a weighty matter to discuss with you will you allow me to outstay your guests  with all the pleasure in the world erlito answered heartily i should indeed insist upon it  you will perhaps continue yourgame reist suggested with another glance towards the net my time is yours  erlito hesitated  you are very good nicholas he said we are as you see playing badminton and as a matter of fact we are very much in earnest about this game miss van decht and i are playing the deciding match with my friends there hassen and brand let me find you a chair and present you to these good people afterwardsit will not be longi shall be wholly at your service and nicholas if you please i am erlito only here you understand  reist assented gravely and erlito turned round the two players were talking to the girl across the net an elderly man with grey imperial and smoking a long cigar was leaning back in a deckchair  miss van decht erlito said turning to her will you permit me to present to you my very old friend the duke nicholas of reistmiss van decht mr van decht mr hassen mr brand  reist bowed low before the girl who looked straight into his eyes with a frank and pleasant curiosity she was largely made but the long flowing lines of her figure were perfectly and symmetrically graceful her features were delicate but her mouth was delightfullarge shapely and sensitive her light brown hair which showed a disposition to wave had escaped bounds a little during the violent exercise and had fallen into picturesque disorder she smiled charmingly at reist but said nothing beyond the conventional words of greeting then she looked up at erlito with twinkling eyes  mr brand is getting insupportable she declared he is like all you obstinate englishmen he does not know when he is beaten  we will endeavour erlito said taking up his racquet to impress it upon him there are cigarettes by your side reist  the girl went to her place at the end of the court  this must be the deciding game she declared for the light is going and dad is smoking his last cigar ready serve  the game recommenced reist sat upon an overturned box by the side of mr van decht smoking a cigarette and watching gravely the flying figures it was the girl who absorbed most of his attention to him she was an utterly new type she was as beautiful in her way as his own sister but her frank energy and the easy terms of intimacy which obviously existed between her male companions and herself was wholly inexplicable to him he watched her with fascinated gaze all the beautiful women whom he had ever known had numbered amongst their characteristics a certain restraint almost an aloofness which he had come to look upon as their inevitable attribute their smiles were rare and precious marks of favour an undisturbed serenity of deportment was almost an inherent part of their education here was a woman of the new world no less to be respected he was sure than her sisters of theos vienna and st petersburg yet viewing life from a wholly different standpoint from the first there was something curiously fascinating to reist in the perfect naturalness and selfassurance of the girl whose every thought and energy seemed centred just then upon that flying cork her lips were slightly parted her eyes were bright her face was full of colour and vivacity she sprang backwards and forwards jumped and stooped with the delightful freedom of perfect health and strength she even joined in the chaff which flashed backwards and forwards across the net goodhumoured always and gay but always personal and indicating a more than common intimacy between the little party reist would have been quite content to have sat and watched her until the game was over but for a sudden and to him amazing incident at a critical moment erlito missed a difficult strokethe younger and slighter of his two opponents threw his racquet into the air with a curious little cry of triumph  hoela hoela  reist started almost to his feet and the blood surged hotly in his veins where had he heard that cry before he looked the man over with a swift and eager scrutiny olivecheeked with black eyes and moustache slightlyhooked nose and light graceful bearing he might have belonged to any of the southern nations he was certainly no englishman hoela hoela how the fever of hate was kindled in reists heart as the echoes of that cry rang through the room his memory too was swift and vivid no longer he sat in that bare attic watching the flying figures of the badminton players and listening to their cheerful badinage walls enclosed him no more he saw out over the sea and land he saw things the memory of which still thrilled his pulses tugged at his heartstrings over the snowcapped hills he rode wrapped in military furs his sabre clanking by his side and a storm of stinging sleet driven into his face below were lights flashing in a white wildernessamongst the hills flared the red fire of the guns the music of their thunders was even then upon his ears down the steep defile he rode at the head of his troop the sound of their approach muffled by the deep snowafterwards the roar of meeting the breathless excitement of the charge the deep battlecry of the men of theos and from those othersah he had it now  hoela hoela allah allah  a cry of triumph the game was over sara van decht threw herself into a chair between her father and him and fanned herself vigorously with a pockethandkerchief the others were laughing and talking amongst themselves erlito came over at once to her side  miss van decht he cried gaily we are invincible you played magnificently reist we are going to have some tea and then i shall be at your service why our tussle seems to have interested you  reist withdrew his eyes reluctantly from watching hassen he smiled faintly  yes he said new things are always interesting new thingsand old friends     chapter iv   afternoon tea was brought in by an elderly manservant in plain livery and was probably the most unconventional meal which reist had ever shared they sat about promiscuously upon chairs and overturned boxes and there was a good deal of lively conversation brand was a newspaper man who had served as war correspondent with erlito in the egyptian campaign mr van decht and his daughter were rich americans loitering about europe hassen remained silent and of him reist learned nothing further the little which he knew sufficed  brand came over and sat by reists side he was a tall fair man with keen eyes and weatherbeaten skinby no means unlike erlito save that his shoulders were not so broad and he lacked the military carriage  i am interested in your country duke he said you are making history there it seems to me that it may become european history  theos has fallen upon evil times reist answered all that we pray of europe is that we may be left alone if that be granted us we shall right ourselves  sara van decht looked across at him with frank interest  do you come from theos duke she asked  reist bowed  i have lived there all my life he said and i know it better than any other place  it is a very beautiful country he continued and very dear to its people to strangers though and specially you who have been brought up in america i must confess that we should probably seem outside the pale of civilization  tell me why she asked what are you so backward in  luxuries he answered we have no electric light  it is detestable she exclaimed  no street cars  they are abominable  reist smiled quietly  we have scarcely any railways he said and the telephone is rare enough to be a curiosity  she laughed back at him and gave her empty cup to brand  primitivism she declared is quite the most delightful thing in the world then your politics too must be most exciting you have revolutions and that sort of thing do you not  i do not understand you miss van decht he said quietly will you not tell me what you mean  the papers are all so vague she answered but one gathers that theos is in a state of political unrest i believe in south america they would call that a revolution  reists eyes flashed fire a faint smile flickered upon hassens lips  there is not any comparison he said haughtily any possible comparison between the affairs of one of the most ancient and historical countries in europe and the mushroom states of south america theos it is true has made mistakes and she will suffer for themshe is suffering now  the republic for example hassen remarked quietly  theos reist answered is a country in which the republican instinct is as yet unborn her sons are homely and brave tillers of the soil or soldiers we have few cities to corrupt and very little attempt at the education which makes shopkeepers and anarchists of honest men perhaps that is why we have kept our independence ay kept it although hemmed in with false friends and open enemies  reist spoke with fervour a fire in his dark eyes a note of passion vibrating in his slow tones the girl especially watched him with keen interest to her all this was new and incredible she was used to men to whom selfrestraint was amongst the cardinal virtues to the patriotism of torchlight processions and firecrackers this was all so different it was as though some one had turned back for her the pages of history reist surely was not of this generation erlito had averted his face hassen was busy lighting a cigarette mr van decht was as bewildered as his daughter yet reists words in a way had moved all of them it was hassen who answered  if the republican instinct he remarked quietly is as yet unborn in theos whence the banishment of the tyrnaus family and the establishment of a republican government  reist turned full upon him and his eyes were like the eyes of an angry lion  maurice of tyrnaus he said was one of the degenerates of a noble race i say no more against one whom if alive i should still acknowledge as my king  hassen shrugged his shoulders  you are a long way from theos count he remarked pointedly you took i presume the oath of allegiance to the republic when it was formed  that is a false saying reist answered scornfully i neither took the oath nor recognized the government  yet they allowed you to remain in the capital city hassen asked  there was no one reist answered who would have dared to bid me depart of the ancient nobility of theos we alone remain alas close dwellers in our native country else metzger had been hung in the marketplace with short shrifthe a merchant a trafficker in coin who dared to sit in the ancient council house of theos and weave his cursed treason and listen sir he continued turning abruptly upon hassen you would know whence sprang that evil weed of a republic i will tell you it was the work of foreign spies working with foreign gold amongst the outcasts and scum of theos it was not the choice of the people it was the word of sedition of cunning bribery the vile underhand efforts of foreign politicians seeking to weaken by treachery a country they dared not small though it is provoke to battle  there followed a strange tense silence no one thought of interruption they held their breath and waited the conversation which had started harmlessly enough had become a duel the grim shadow of tragedy seemed suddenly to have stalked in amongst them hassen sprang to his feet livid his coalblack eyes on fire reist was facing him his head thrown back passionate contemptuous bitter with a swift threatening gesture he threw out his arm towards his adversary  hassen bey he said my private enemies i meet under the roof of my friends and courtesy demands that i hold my peace and pass on the enemies of my country i denounce at all times and in all places you are a turkish spy one of those of whom i have been speaking who sought the hospitality of theos only to scatter gold amongst the common people to plot and intrigue for your master the sultan oh i know that you are also a soldier and a brave man for i have met you face to face in battle and may god grant that i do so again yet you are a spy and a treacherous rogue and i am very thankful that i have come here to tell you so and to order you to leave this roof  hassen had recovered himself he turned to erlito  the duke of reist he said quietly is a friend of yours perhaps it is better that i should go i regret very much to have been the passive cause of such an outbreak miss van decht you will accept my apologies  erlito was very grave he did not seem to see the hand which hassen held out to him  hassen he said we have been friends but i do not understand these things which the duke of reist has said of you you have spoken of yourself as a frenchmanof theos or of turkey i have heard nothing have you any explanation to offer  hassen shrugged his shoulders lightly  my dear erlito he said the duke of reist is an honest man buthe will forgive mehe is an anachronism he should have lived two centuries agoor better still he would have made an excellent crusader the necessities of modern diplomacy are unknown to him he has passed all his days in a semicivilized country he is not a fitting judge of the things which happen today  a sudden lightning flashed in erlitos blue eyes he drew himself to his full height and pointed towards the door  that semicivilized country sir is mine also and if you are one of those who have sought to corrupt it i beg that you will leave this room while you may with a whole skin at once sir  the imperturbability of the man was clearly disturbed he looked at erlito in amazement the face of nicholas of reist shone with joy  your country hassen repeated incredulously what have you to do with theos  erlito hesitatednot so reist he stepped forward and the leaping firelight threw a strange glow upon his pale mobile features  after all he cried to hassen it seems that you are but a poor fool of a conspirator i will do you an honour which you ill deserve i will present you to his royal highness prince ughtred of tyrnaus  gracious  the single monosyllablefrom sara van dechtwas the only speech which broke the amazed silence she was leaning forward in her chair gazing eagerly at the three men her beautiful eyes eloquent with excitementa crown of fire gleaming in her browngold hair no one noticed her hassen who had regained his composure but in whose face was written a deep selfdisgust moved towards the door with his fingers upon the handle he paused and looked back at the little group  you are both he said in a low tone a little hard upon a soldier and a servant of the sultan with whom obedience is forced to become an instinct of thatno more but there is one thing which you may call me as often and as thoroughly as you will for it is as true as the koran that i am an absolutea blind fool  he passed out and they heard him singing for the lift sara van decht looked up at brand who was sitting next to her her halfwhispered remark dissolved the situation  i suppose that we are all awake she said i feel as though i wanted to pinch myself to be sure of it     chapter v   and what has brought you to london nicholas my friend erlito asked is it pleasure or you have perhaps a mission to the english government  it was the great moment reist too restless to sit down stood upon the hearthrug the angry fire lingering in his eyes a spot of dull colour burning still in his cheeks he had not yet got over the shock of finding one of the men he most hated and despised in life a guest in this house of all others  pleasure he repeated thoughtfully people would call me a fanatic yet nevertheless ughtred this is the truth there is no pleasure for me outside my country the life of the european capitals chokes me there is a tawdriness about them all something artificial and unreal i do not know how to describe it but it is therein petersburg in paris in london and vienna it is like a gigantic depression i seem to become in them a puppet a shadow walking across a great stage always i am longing to be back in theosin theos where the winds blow down from the hills and the faces of the men and women in the streets are clean with health ah my friend i know what you would say the great cities too with their factories and huge buildings which shut out the sky they are part of gods earth the smoke which stains the heavens comes from the making of useful and beautiful things yet i watch my peasants tilling their little farms tending their hillside vineyards without luxuries without knowledge of luxuries ever lighthearted contented strong and healthy as children of the earth should be the love of that little strip of land of theirs is the keynote of their patriotism it is a passion a joy to them oh do you wonder that i think these things are best  erlitos eyes were full of sympathy his head sank upon his folded arms his thoughts travelled backwards it was so many years ago yet he could remember  listen nicholas he said i have travelled much more than you i have been in many strange countries and seen life under many strange conditions but all the while there has been a pain in my heart i have found no home i too love theos there will come a day when no sentence of banishment will keep me away  reist looked up the moment had come  that day he said may be nearer than you think ughtred i have left theos on no slight business i am here with a mission and my mission is to you  erlitos eyes were full of questioning wonder  the accursed republic reist continued has fallen like a pack of cards there is panic in the city and throughout the country theos knows now that she has been deceived and misguided that she has been brought to the very verge of ruin the powers no longer continue to assure her of their protection a sovereign and a tyrnaus had ever a claim upon them not so this bastard and bungling republic the city is full of russian spies the austrians watch us night and day the turks are creeping up even to the balkans rumours of partition have reached us from the great cabinets ughtred of tyrnaus there is only one man today who can save the country and that man is you  erlito dropped his pipe and leaned forward in his chair  are you mocking me reist he asked  may god forbid reist answered fervently that i should speak idle words upon such a subject the people of theos are still brave and true and their freedom is as dear to them as life itself they came to me who for long have lived apart and i have shown them what i truthfully believe to be their only chance of salvation you are that chance ughtred the throne of your fathers is yours if you will have it a brave man can seize it and a brave man can hold it in the teeth of all europe and by your god and for the sake of the blood which is in your veins ughtred of tyrnaus i summon you to return with me to theos  erlito rose slowly up his cheeks were flushed with excitement reists appeal had moved him deeply  you mean this he said you mean that you bring me this message from the people of theos  reist raised his hand solemnly  i mean that on their behalf i nicholas of reist than whom none has a better right to speak for their country offer you the crown of theos  erlito walked restlessly up and down the little study into which he had brought his visitor  we of tyrnaus he said are under sentence of perpetual exile  it was the illegal sentence of an illegal assembly reist answered the voice of the people has revoked it they bid you forget all else save that your native land looks to you in her hour of trouble listen it is no rosestrewn way along which you will pass to your inheritance there will be no popular reception no grand ceremony we must travel day and night to theos secretly perhaps even in disguise you must be crowned king in the palace the moment we arrive there secretly i have already called together the army for the moment the news is known there will be a storm there are russians and austrian secret agents in theos each working for their own ends they believe that i have gone to vienna and petersburg to beg for the intercession of the powers meanwhile the turkish dogs are creeping up the balkans they are gathered around our country ughtred like wreckers waiting for the ship to break up it is for you to steer that ship into safe waters  there was a long silence erlito was standing with his elbow upon the mantelpiece looking into the fire in his heart were many emotions in his face a strange light a new world had been opened up before him he saw great things moving across the vista of the future no longer then need he brood over an empty life or bewail the idle sword of a gentleman of fortune here was stuff enough to make a dozen careers a future successful or unsuccessful more brilliant than anything else which he could have conceived but reist who failed to read his companions thoughts was troubled this prolonged silence was inexplicable to him  you do not hesitate he asked at last  erlito laughed and drew himself up  you must not think so ill of me as that nicholas he answered nay there was no thought of hesitation in my mind i acceptgladly thankfully only you must know this of soldiering i have learnt a little and nothing would make me happier than to lead the men of theos into battle but of statesmanship i know little and of kingcraft nothing at all you must find me faithful advisers you yourself must stand at my right hand  then nicholas of reist drew a long breath and the cloud passed away from his face  there are still many faithful citizens he said whom we can rally around us and i myselfi live only for theos let me tell you this for it will give you confidence it is a soldier for whom the people are pining they want no more merchants in high places they shall see you ughtred of tyrnaus in the uniform of their guards they shall hear you give the word of command they will shout you kingay they will take you into their hearts this people  so the hands of the two met in a long fervent clasp erlito embraced his destiny and reist set the seal upon his renunciation                                       a king as ughtred fastened his white tie before the tiny mirror upon his dressingcase those lines at the corner of his mouth gave way he suddenly burst out laughing a king the incongruity of the thing tickled his sense of humourhe laughed long and heartily he looked around him his bedchamber was tiny and he had only been able to afford furniture of the cheapest description he looked at the plain rush carpet the swords and foils which were almost his sole decoration upon the walls the humble appointments of his dressingtable everything was scrupulously neat and clean stern and soldierlike in simplicity what a change was before him from here to the royal palace of theos where a chamberlain would wait upon him with bended knee and the small etiquette of a court would hamper his every movement the last few years passed in swift review before him he had lived always like a gentleman but always with a certain amount of rigid selfdenial necessitated by his small income he had few acquaintances and fewer friends the luxury of a westend club had been denied to himfencing and long walks were almost his sole relaxation all that he had had to hope for was the breaking out of some small war in any corner of the world when his sword and military experience might give him a chance to follow his profession he was if anything deficient in imagination but he had humour enough and to spare he laughed softly as he donned his carefullyfolded and wellworn dresscoat and reflected that this was perhaps the last dinner which he would eat in such garments with companions of his own choosing it was surely a strange turn in the wheel of fortune     chapter vi   i think your friend the duke of reist is a very interesting man sara van decht remarked but as a dinner companion hes just a little depressing i wonder what father and he will find to talk about  ughtred laughed they had just come out from the restaurant to find the great hall almost full reist and mr van decht were sitting a little apart from them  reist is a very good fellow ughtred declared but just now he is not very much in the humour for gaiety he is passionately attached to his country and theos alas is passing through a very anxious time in her history no you must not judge him by his demeanour tonight i had much difficulty in persuading him to accept your fathers invitation  she nodded sympathetically  has he come over to obtain aid from england she asked from the papers this morning it seems as though one of the powers would have to interfere and straighten things out  ughtred looked down with grave steadfast eyes into the girls upturned face it was time for him to tell her how ridiculous it would sound she would probably laugh at him  reist came to england he said to find me  she looked at him in mild wonder  you but you are no longer interested in theos are you  he sighed  i have been an exile for many years he said and theos has come to mean little else to me save a beautiful memory yet i have never forgotten that she is my native country i am never likely to forget it  do you hope ever to return she asked  i hope to be in theos within a week he answered i am returning with reist  she looked up at him startled but deeply interested  you mean it she cried oh tell me  you have read of the downfall of the republic he continued reist assures me that the people will never tolerate another they speak already of a king and miss van dechtyou must not laugh pleasei am the only surviving member of the royal family of theos  she gasped  you are to be king she exclaimed  the people have sent for me he answered simply of course there are difficulties and after all it may not come to pass still the crown is mine by right and i am going to strike a blow for it we leave for theos tomorrow  a king tomorrow she repeated vaguely  she was bereft of words ughtred laughed nervously  miss van decht he said it isnt altogether a prospect of fairyland there are many things to be given up there are many things which a man may possess but a king can only covet i have become somewhat of a bohemian in my wanderings and my freedom is very dear to me yet i think that i am doing right in making this attempt i love theos and it will be a joy to fight her battles i love the old city and the mountains and the wild country i may not be a patriot like nicholas of reist but the old war music seems to leap and burn in my blood when i think of the turks creeping nearer and nearer to the frontier and our ancient city full of foreign spies gathered together like carrion birds before the massacre it is intolerable  she was thoughtful and sympathetic  yes she said softly it is right that you should feel like that ours is a new country and there is nothing about her beautiful or historic yet if she were in dangeroh yes i understand you are right to go may you be successful  a crash of martial music from the band filled the air with ringing melody and for a moment they sat silent ughtred took up his as yet unlit cigarette and sara sipped her coffee around them were little groups of men and brilliantlydressed women the pleasant hum of conversation and light laughter came to them with something of an inspiring ring down the broad promenade two men were walking sara touched her companion on the arm with her fan  look she whispered  ughtred recognized hassen with a frown and his companion with a sudden thrill of interest they were coming slowly down from the restaurant talking earnestly together and by the side of the tall distinguishedlooking man who was listening to him with so inscrutable a countenance hassen appeared almost insignificant nicholas of reist who had moved from his chair to fetch an evening paper met them face to face he would have passed on with a contemptuous glance at hassen but that the older man turned and accosted him with grave yet pleasant courtesy  the duke of reist is far from home this is indeed a surprising meeting  reist started as he recognized the speaker he cast a single lightninglike glance at hassen who lingered by  it is as welcome as surprising reist answered quietly i had promised myself the pleasure of paying my respects at the embassy tomorrow  you will not i trust let anything interfere with so amiable an intention was the suave reply you and i should have much to say to each other reist you have a vacant chair here i see will you allow me to take my coffee with you  i shall be much honoured reist answered quietly as you say there is much which we might discuss will you permit me to introduce you to my friends  the faintest indication of surprise was followed by a murmur of delighted assent hassen perplexed and white with anger moved away the two men threaded the little maze of chairs and palm trees and womens skirts and reached the corner where sara and ughtred sat reist gravely performed the introduction  miss van decht will you allow me to present to you the prince alexis of ollendirk miss van dechtmr van decht ughtred i am sure you two should know one another prince alexis of ollendirk ughtred of tyrnaus  the prince who had bowed low and gracefully to sara held out his hand frankly to ughtred  to number tyrnaus amongst ones acquaintances he said has been an honour for centuries i knew your father prince ughtred his majesty was always very good to me the gold star of theos is amongst the most treasured of my possessions  more coffee was ordered by mr van decht and cigarettes a measured and somewhat curious conversation followed the russian ambassador talked to sara chiefly ughtred seemed to interest him only as a pleasantlymet acquaintance they exchanged views on paris and vienna and prince alexis pleaded eloquently for the charms of his own city with consummate skill he led the conversation to theos  the most picturesque country in europe he declared today i fear the most unfortunate you see mr van decht he continued turning towards him it is not always that a great country can exist and be developed upon democratic principles theos under the royal house of tyrnaus had at least a recognized place amongst the european states today she has lost it of her futureno man can speak with certainty  the russian leaned back and lit a cigarette yet reist felt that he was being watched by those halfclosed sleepy eyes he leaned a little forward and lowered his voice  i am a man of theos bred and born he said slowly and the future of my country is as my own future i am not in this bastard government as you doubtless know prince alexis but i have the confidence of the people they have come to me for counsel they have asked me how best they can secure their continued independence it is a great emergency this and since we have met here i am venturing to ask for your advice you have a precise knowledge of the situation you know the country the people our environment how best do you think that i could answer them  the russian smoked thoughtfully for a moment in the little clouds of blue smoke which hung about his head he seemed to be seeking for inspiration was this simplicity he wondered or had reist indeed a hidden purpose in seeking to make him declare himself  it is not an easy question which you ask my friend he answered at last yet after all i doubt whether more than one course is open to those who would direct the destinies of your country theos is a weak state hemmed in by powerful ones she is today the certain prey of whomever might stretch out his handeven her ancient enemy the turk so after all it is not difficult to offer you good advice i would say to you this let her seek out the strongest the most generous of those environing powers and say to her frankly give me your protection and i believe that for the sake of peace her prayer would be promptly answered  reist was silent ughtred who had been listening intently interposed  the advice he said sounds well but it seems to me to have one weak point it is her independence which theos seeks above all things to retain the protection of any one power must surely jeopardize this  by no means prince alexis answered blandly let us take my own country for example russia is great enough and generous enough to befriend a weakened state without any question of a quid pro quo a love of peace is the one great passion which sways my master in all his dealings for the sake of it he would do more even than this  the czar does not stand alone reist remarked thoughtfully he has many advisers  to whom he listens prince alexis answered when it pleases him it is said in this country yes and in others that the czar is a puppet we who know only smile for my dear reist it is true that there has not reigned in europe for many years a greater autocrat than he who sits on the throne of russia today but to return to the subject of theos your danger seems to me to lie here supposing that the present state of disquiet continues or any form of government be set up which does not seem to promise permanent stability then it is very likely that those stronger countries by whom theos is surrounded may in the general interests of peace deem it their duty to interfere  theos reist said proudly is not yet a moribund state she has an army and at the first hint of invasion all political differences would cease  prince alexis smiled and raised his tiny glass of liqueur  floreat theos he said lightly long may she continue to retain her independenceand to know her friends  they all raised their glasses from reist came a whisper little more than a breath  long live the king     chapter vii   prince alexis made the toast the signal for his departure murmuring something about a diplomatic reception which his duty forbade him to ignore in the lobby hassen brushed up against him  a word with your highness outside he murmured  the ambassador signified assent by a scarcelynoticeable gesture he lit a cigarette and leisurely buttoned his fur coat a swift glance towards the little party in the corner showed him that reist was missing  you had better slip into my carriage quietly he said to hassen our good friend the duke of reist is on the lookout somewhere and it would be better that he did not see us together  hassen nodded and preceded the ambassador who lingered to speak to some acquaintance in a few moments he followed pausing with his foot upon the carriage steps as though to relight his cigarette he looked quickly up and down the pavement at the corner of pall mall and the haymarket a man was standing with his face half turned in their direction he shrugged his shoulders and entered the carriage  the duke of reist is interested he remarked to hassen come my friend what have you to say  first of all then hassen began your bribe to metzger was large but you will never get your moneys worth you have worked hard for the political disruption of theos it may chance that you have failed utterly  the ambassador nodded pleasantly  possibly he admitted i do not quite follow you though metzger has been chased from the country there is no government no law no order the powers cannot permit this to continue a protectorship will be proposed within a week  it will be four days too late hassen answered in less time than that theos will occupy a stronger position politically than ever before  you surprise me the ambassador admitted politely  do you think that the duke of reist is the sort of man to be dining at london restaurants whilst his country bleeds to death hassen exclaimed bah his presence here with ughtred of tyrnaus tonight is no chance affair there is a deep scheme on and broadly i have fathomed it  yes  theos has had enough of republics she is going to try a king it is reist himself who put the idea into their heads he has come as the envoy of the people to ughtred of tyrnaus  that the ambassador remarked will not do at all  you think so knowing nothing of ughtred of tyrnaus i know him well and if you wish theos to become a russian province he is the very man in europe to baulk you he is brave shrewd patriotic and a fine soldier if he ever reaches theos the people will worship him he will make order out of chaos he will hold the reins and he will be proof against the wiles of your agents short of absolute force you will not be able to dislodge him  he must not reach theos the ambassador said thoughtfully the mans very physique will win him the throne  and i believe that you are right the house of tyrnaus has never been friendly towards russia what will your master say hassen  the man smiled grimly  do we want a soldier king in theos he asked when our soldiers are creeping northwards to the balkans day by day you are ready to seize by intrigue and by stealthwe are preparing to strike a blow of another sort  the ambassador smiled the turkish soldiers were brave enough but in constantinople at that moment was a russian envoy on secret business who had very definite instructions as to the occupation of theos it is possible however that prince alexis had forgotten the fact for he did not mention it  at least he said one thing is clear ughtred of tyrnaus must be delayed  hassen shrugged his shoulders the gesture was expressive  it will be worthsay five thousand pounds to you the ambassador remarked carelessly to make sure of it  hassen nodded and stepped out of the carriage they had drawn up before one of the embassies and his arrival with prince alexis was not a thing to be advertised  i shall do my best he said slipping away in the crowd                                       why yes i shall miss you isnt that natural  i hope so he answered i shall never forget these days she laughed gaily the music was playing something very soft and low reist had not yet reappeared  isnt that a little rash my friend you love experiences and you are going to enter upon a very wonderful life you are much to be envied  sara he said you must come to theos  she laughed outright in frank and unrestrained merriment  you must talk to father she said i dare say he will come he loves new countries only im sure he wont behave properly at court hes a terrible democrat and he likes to shake hands with everybody  he shall shake hands with me as often as he likes ughtred said you must remember sara that royalty in theos is not exactly like royalty in this country why my whole domain is not so large as some english counties i mean to go about my kingdom exactly like a private individual come to theos and we will play racquets in the throne room  she shook her head  the smaller the kingdom as a rule she said the more circumstance and etiquette surround the court i do not think that you will be allowed to play racquets in the throne room or to shake hands very often with a chicago stockjobber even though he is my father we shall come and gaze upon you from afar  so long as you will come he replied confidently we will see about the rest do you know sara it would almost spoil everything if i felt that this change in my life were to disturbour friendship  she drew a long palm leaf through her fingers and let it fall regretfully it was cool and pleasant to the touch a violin hidden somewhere amongst the waving green sent strange notes of melody out through the court and a little man bravely dressed in scarlet and yellow bobbed up and down over his instrument the girl was thinkingwondering it was so sudden a change this ughtred erlito had been a delightful friendbut ughtred of tyrnaus it was so strange a transition she kept her eyes fixed upon the marble floor and her heart beat for a moment or two to the sad music of the wailing violin then she sprang to her feetthe folly had passed with one sudden movement one of the little ornaments hanging from her bracelet became detached and rolled away ughtred recovered it and would have fastened it upon the gold wire but she stopped him  it is my fourleaved clover she said see i shall give it to you may it bring you good fortune floreat theos  he held it in his palma dainty ornament set with diamonds and quaintly shaped  do you mean it he asked  why of course she answered if it is not exactly a coronation present it will at least help to remind youof the days before you were a king  i need no trinkets to remind me of some things he answered quietly but theos will give me nothing which i shall prize more than this i shall keep it too as a pledge of your promise you will come to theos  yes i will come she answered  nicholas of reist was by their side dark almost saturnine in his black evening clothes and tie his presence had a chilling effect upon them both sara rose to her feet  will you see if you can find father she said to ughtred he was talking to some americans who went into the restaurant  he moved away she turned quickly to reist  i wanted to ask you she said you live in theos and you can give me an idea what is there that i can send prince ughtred for a coronation present  that is a very difficult question to answer reist said will you not be a little more explicit a steam yacht would be a present so would a cigarettecase  she nodded quickly  yes i should have explained money is of no consequence at all i had thought of a team of horses and a coach  he was suddenly serious he eyed the girl with a new curiosity she then was one of the daughters of this new world before whose golden key every court in europe had yielded she was of striking appearance perhaps beautiful instinctively well bred she might be destined to play a part in the affairs of theos  money is of no consequence at all he repeated thoughtfully we are poor folk in theos miss van decht and we do not often hear such words  sometimes i think she said that our wealth is our misfortune now you understand dont you prince ughtred was very kind to us at cairo and on the voyage back and we have seen quite a little of him in london i should like to give him something really useful please suggest something  i will take you at your word then miss van decht he answered send him a maximnordenfeld gun if you want to be magnificent send him a battery  she looked at him in amazement  do you mean it she exclaimed  i do he answered prince ughtred is a very keen soldier and he is never tired of praising these guns for the first year or two at the least we shall have troublous times and a battery of maxims might save all our lives and the throne theos has alas no money to spend in artillery though her soldiers are as brave as any in the world  father and i will see about it tomorrow she declared hush here they come  ughtred was approaching with her father and watching him it occurred to her for the first time how well his new part in life would become him he was tall and broad and he moved with the free easy dignity of a soldier accustomed to command  i have found your father he said and your carriage is waiting i thought that if reist would excuse me for halfanhour  reist interrupted him at once  you must not go away he declared earnestly not for five minutes believe me it is necessary  my dear fellow ughtred protested  is it possible reist exclaimed with some impatience that you do not recognize the great misfortune of this evening i was wrong to allow you to cometo be seen in london with you prince alexis is more than an ordinary ambassador he is a born diplomatist a true russianhe is one of the clique who today rule the country with hassens aid he has without a doubt surmised the purport of my visit to you by this time he is hard at work let me tell you that if he can prevent it you will never set foot in theos there must be no more delay come  sarah held out her hand her eyes met his frankly  the duke of reist must be obeyed she said i am sure that he is right goodbye prince ughtred you are very fortunate for you have a great and noble work before you may you succeed in it i shall hope and pray for your success  a little abruptly she turned away and took her fathers arm the two men watched them disappearthe little greyheaded man with his illcut clothes and hard shrewd face and the tall graceful girl whose toilette was irreproachable and whose carriage and bearing moved even reist to admiration they passed down the carpeted way and through the swingdoors then reist touched his companion on the arm  it is halfpast eleven he said we are going to catch the twelve oclock train from charing cross     chapter viii   the whistle sounded at last the train began to glide slowly away from the almost deserted platform but at the last moment a man came running through the bookingoffice and made for one of the compartments he tugged at the handle wrenched it open and was preparing for a flying leap when an inspector seized him there was an altercation a violent strugglethe man was left upon the platform reist drew a long breath of relief as he settled down in his corner  the way these things are managed in england he said it is excellent  ughtred shrugged his shoulders reist had been dumb for the last halfhour and he was puzzled  will you tell me now he asked the meaning of it all  the meaning of it all ishassen reist answered how long have you known him  we fought together in abyssinia ughtred answered and i found him always a capital soldier and a pleasant companion  did you ever ask him where he learnt his soldiering  onceyes  did he tell you  i do not think that he did he told me frankly enough that he had no pastthat it was not to be referred to there were others like that in the campaign men who had secrets to bury men who sought forgetfulness even that forgetfulness which a bullet brings we were a strange company enough but the fighting was good  and since then you have met him again in england  i met him at a little fencingacademy six months ago and since then we have fenced together continually but for your recognition of him i should have written him down as harmless  a spot of colour burned in reists cheek he ground his heel into the mat  harmless he a turk a russian spy a doubledealing rogue sword in hand i have chased him through the kurdistan valley all one night and if i had caught him then russia would have lost a tool and the sultan a traitorous soldier he holds still although an absentee a high command in the turkish army and all the while he is in the pay of russia prince alexis knows of my mission to you by now and if we reach theos we are lucky for i do not think that a tyrnaus upon the throne of theos would suit russia at all  i may seem stupid ughtred said seriously but it is necessary that i should understand these things why should russia object so much to my reinstatement upon the throne of my fathers surely of all the nations of europe one would expect from her the least sympathy with a democratic form of government  russia is above all sympathies or antipathies reist answered bitterly she is the most selfcentred the most absolutely selfish nation on earth the present state of turmoil in theos is owing largely to the efforts of muscovite secret agents russia desires a weak theos she wants to stand behind the government and pull the strings it is she whom we have most to fear now  ughtred lit a cigar and leaned back in his corner he was still in his evening clothes and he looked doubtfully at the windowpanes streaming with rain  neither russia nor her agents can interfere with us on neutral soil he remarked i wish reist that you had let me send for my bag i shall be a very dilapidated object by the time we reach the frontier  my wardrobe reist answered is at your service immediately we are upon the boat i am smaller than you but i have some things which may be useful now i will tell you something which will help to explain my haste when first i saw hassen and prince alexis together i understood that we must change our plans and i sent for your bag your rooms were then being watched front and back my servant bribed a postman to go to your door and ask for you he discovered that a gentleman was already in your rooms waiting for you they are very much in earnest these people my prince it will need all our wit to reach theos  we will reach it though ughtred said softly we are on our guard and there can be no means of forcibly detaining us in a quarter of an hour we shall be at dover  reist nodded he was examining the chambers of a revolver which he had drawn from the pocket of a loose ulster  let us remember he said to avoid all strangers and to speak to no one unless compelled we know nothing of theos we are returning to budapesth and prince ughtred there is a revolver in the pocket of your coat also not for use but for show we must not be led into a disturbance with any one mind it is the policy of every one to detain us if once the object of our journey is known in germany we shall not be safe in austria every moment will be perilous but once across the frontier nothing will avail i had news from theos this morning the people are on fire for your coming  the train slackened speed the lights of dover flashed out on either side they drew up at the town station and waited there for some minutes reist let down the window and addressed a porter  why do we not go on to the harbour he asked we are already late  there is a special coming in just behind you sir the man answered we shall send you both along together  reist thanked him and turned to ughtred with a little laugh  so we are to have a travelling companion he remarked dryly our friends are not to be caught asleep we must watch for the occupant of this special train we shall know then against whom we have to be upon our guard  they moved slowly on again behind them was an engine and a single carriage reist let down both windows and a fresh salt wind blew in upon their faces in a few moments they were at the landingstage  reist leaped lightly out and ughtred followed him opposite was the gangway leading to the steamer through which a little crowd of passengers were already elbowing their way they lingered on its outskirts and watched the single carriage drawn by the second engine it drew up within a few feet of them and a tall fair young man handed out his portmanteau to one of the porters and leisurely descended on to the platform ughtred recognized him with a little exclamation of surprise  why its brand  he would have moved forward but for reists restraining arm  wait who is he  a newspaper man ughtred answered an honest fellow and a friend i will answer for him  he was at your rooms with hassen reist said quickly i would trust no one whom i had seen with that man let him pass we will follow him on board  but it was too late brand possessed the quick searching gaze of a journalist and already with a little start of surprise he had recognized them  erlito he exclaimed what luck  erlito shook hands with him laughing they turned towards the boat together  have you become a millionaire my friend he asked that you must travel in special trains  brand shook his head  personally he remarked i am in my usual lamentable state of impecuniosity nevertheless for the moment i am representing wealth illimitable that is to say i am in harness again  reist looked askance at them both he did not understand ughtred was suddenly grave  i must ask you where you are going he said there is no rumour of war is there  brand hesitated  speaking broadly he answered i have no right to tell you but the circumstances of our meeting are peculiar to tell you the truth i am bound for theos  reists face was dark with angerughtreds blank with amazement brand hastened to explain  the duke of reist he said probably does not understand my position i am a special correspondent to the daily courier they send me at a moments notice to any place where interesting events are likely to happen our chief has been studying the aspect of things in theos and halfanhour ago i had my route it was the same erlito when i travelled with you to abyssinia  ughtred nodded thoughtfully  that is true he remarked reist i am sure that we can trust mr brand he is not in league with any of those who would hinder us upon our journey  that may be so reist answered but he knows too much for our safety there must be an understanding between us a single paragraph in his newspaper tomorrow as to our journey and we shall have as much chance of reaching the moon as theos  brand who was writing upon a telegraphform paused at once they were on the side of the steamer remote from the bustle of departure and almost alone  there is likely to be trouble then on the frontier or before he inquired you have opponents  so much so reist answered fiercely that if we were in theos now and you talked of filling the newspapers with idle gossip of us and our affairs we should not stop to argue the matter with you  brand laughed softly  i dont want to do you any harm he said we must compromise matters  reist misunderstood him  an affair of money he exclaimed i understand we will give your paper one two hundred pounds to make no mention of theos for a week  brand glanced at ughtred with twinkling eyes  the special train which brought me here cost more than that i am afraid he said believe me duke it is not a matter of money at all the proprietors of my paper are millionaires what they want is information when i spoke of a compromise i meant something entirely different  perhaps you had better explain exactly what you mean reist said curtly i do not understand this western journalism it is new to me  brand nodded  good he said you want to keep this journey secret until you are safe in theos very well i will send no message to my people until you give me leave only you must supply me then with exclusive information and you must see that i am the first to cable it from your country  that is an agreement reist answered solemnly if you will keep to that i am satisfied  they were already in the channel a wave broke over the bows of the vessel drenching them with spray brand led the way downstairs  since we are to be fellowpassengers he said let us drink to our prosperous journeyand theos  reist touched ughtreds arm upon the stairs  he is to be trusted this friend of yours he whispered anxiously  implicitly ughtred answered with emphasis  then we are very fortunate reist said for it is such a man as this whom we wanted     chapter ix   monsieur will pardon me  ughtred glanced up startled for an hour or more he had been watching with fascinated eyes the great rolling pine forests through which the train was rushing brand and reist were in the restaurantcarughtred was rapidly becoming too excited to eat they had entered upon the last stage of their journey somewhere away beyond that dim line of mountains was theos so far they had been neither accosted nor watched this was the first stranger who had addressed a word to either of them  you wished for a seat here ughtred asked  the priest who had come through from the diningcar held between his fingers an unlit cigar his fat goodhumoured face was a little flushed he had the appearance of a man who has found his dinner a satisfactory meal  it is your coup√© i understand monsieur he answered but the smokingcar is full i wondered if monsieur would permit me to occupy his friends seat until he returns one misses a smoke so much  he looked longingly at the cigar ughtred rose and cleared off the rugs and papers which were spread over the vacant seats  my friends i am sure will have no objection he declared i think that there is room for all of us  the priest was volubly thankful he lit his cigar and puffed at it with obvious pleasure  monsieur is doubtless a great traveller he remarked urbanely for me a journey such as this is an eventa wonderful event not once in many years do i leave my people monsieur will be amused but it is indeed ten years since i found myself in a railway train  ughtred was reserved but the priest was quite willing to bear the brunt of the conversation so long as he had a listener it appeared that he was on his way to visit his brother who was a prosperous merchant in belgrade and monsieurif he were not too inquisitiveshould he have the pleasure of his company all the way  ughtred hesitated for the fraction of a second reist was passing along the corridor with imperturbable face but with his cap in his handan agreed upon sign of danger so ughtred to whom a lie was as poison braced himself for the effort  i go even farther than you he declared my journey is not ended at constantinople  the priests fat face was wrinkled into smiles it was most fortunatehis own good fortune for himself he was so unaccustomed to travel that he found it impossible to read he was excitedbesides it gave him the headache to converse only was possible but after all he had no right to inflict himself thus upon monsieur he had perhaps affairs to attend toor he desired to sleep ughtred who found it impossible to suspect this fat simplemannered man so shabbily dressed so wrapped in enjoyment of his bad cigar smiled and shook his head they drifted into conversation ughtred learned the entire village history of baineuill and was made acquainted with the names and standing of each of its inhabitants from jean the smith to monsieur le comte who was an infidel and whose houseparties were as orgies of the evil one  and monsieur the priest asked ingenuously monsieur is perhaps a soldier i have talked so long of my own poor affairs it must be tedious  just then reist and brand passed along the corridor laughing heartily brand paused and with a bow to the priest held out a paper to ughtred  read that brand he exclaimed these papers are the drollest in the world  ughtred looked up puzzled but took the paper held out insistently towards him at the bottom of an illustration were a few pencilled words  be careful remember you are w b the priest has been asking questions about us  ughtred read and smiled the priest leaned forward  it is a joke eh monsieur will permit me also it is good to laugh  brand was equal to the occasion he took the paper quickly away from ughtred  monsieur he said removing his cap the joke which i pointed out to my friend has without doubt humour but the journal as you see is for the students monsieur will excuse me if i refrain from offering it to him  the priest acquiesced with a graver face and some show of dignity  but i fear monsieur he said to brand that i am occupying your seat you wish to return here beyond a doubt  brand shook his head  by no means monsieur he declared for the present at any rate i am engaged elsewhere  they passed along the corridor glancing up at the priest ughtred was aware of a slight change in his expression his brows were contracted he was immersed in thought the change was momentary however soon he was again chattering awaystill always of his own affairs but there came a time when he wound up a little speech with a question  is it not so monsieur brandwas not that how your friend called you  ughtred assented  my name is walter brand he answered  again there came that faint change in the priests face  monsieur will not think me curious he said he is perhaps a soldier  ughtred shook his head  i have seen some fighting he said but i am not a soldier i am a journalist if you know what that meansone who writes for the newspapers my friend whom you saw speak to me just now is a soldier by profession  the priest nodded pleasantly  and he like yourself he asked is he too english  ughtred looked around and lowered his voice  he has been in the english army but he is not an englishman he has had a very unfortunate history i wish that i could tell it to you but the time is too short and he does not like to be talked about  the priests face shone with sympathy  poor fellow he murmured  brand  they both looked up brand himself had entered the coup√© there was a slight frown upon his forehead and his tone was curt  i wish you would explain to the conductor about our tickets he said he is very stupid and i cannot make him understand  ughtred rose at once and left the coup√© brand bowed gravely to the priest  i trust monsieur will excuse me he said for interrupting what i am sure must have been a very agreeable conversation  the slight foreign accent was beautifully done brand was as tall as ughtred and although not so broad his carriage was good and his natural air one of distinction the priest smiled benignly upon him  i fear he said that i have already wearied your friend my life must seem so humdrum to him and to you who have travelled so far and seen so much for i monsieur as i have told your friend have lived all my days in one quiet country place and this journey is a great event for me  brand slipped into the vacant seat in the vestibule ughtred met reist he drew him into the smokingcompartment he was very pale and his voice shook with emotion  the priest he said is a creature of domiloffs you were on your guard  ughtred nodded  what a famous fellow brand is up to now at any rate his scheme has worked he is personating me bravely and really we are very much alike  he will be too clever for him reist said it is a matter of time do you know that in halfanhour we shall be at the frontier  so soon ughtred exclaimed  listen i had a message from our friends at limburg the train will be searched at the barrier there will be a determined attempt to prevent your entering the country theos is in a state of hopeless confusion the motion to repeal your sentence of banishment is still before the house of laws the custom officers and i am afraid the government officials have been heavily bribed by russia not to pass you across the frontier  a bright light flashed in ughtreds eyes  so we shall see he muttered  they have a plan ready for us no doubt reist continued and that priest is in it never mind we shall outwit them if only your friend brand is equal to his part  the man is a born actor ughtred said i left him playing the prince as i could never have done it i do not think that domiloffs man will find him out  reist pulled the window softly down and looked out the train was passing across a high bridge below the river wound its way through a stretch of rocky broken country  we are barely twenty miles from my homethe castle of reist is to the left of the hills there in a few minutes the train will stop be ready to follow me and do exactly as i do  but we are not timed to stop until we reach gallona  never mind reist answered this will be a stop that does not appear upon the timetable it is the plan of those who are working for us in theos and it is good at the village station of moschaum the signals will be against us and we shall stop our task is to leave the train unseenit may be difficult but i have bribed all the servants and they are preparing to see nothing there will be horses waiting for usand thenthen it will be a gallop for a kingdom  the plan seems good enough ughtred said thoughtfully and i am in your hands but what about brand  reist shrugged his shoulders  he is one of those who love adventure and i do not think that he can come to any harm let him play out his game it was his own idea to personate you and the risk is his own ah  there was a sudden slackening of speed the brakes were on and the whistle sounding reist strolled to the platform of the car as though to look out and ughtred followed him a conductor unfastened the gate and slipped away the train had come to a standstill in a tiny station a little wooden building with a cupola and everywhere surrounded with a dense forest of pines reist looked swiftly round  now he said follow me  they slipped from the train on the side remote from the platform and in halfadozen strides had reached the impenetrable shelter of the trees then there was a whistle the train crawled onward serpentlike with its flaring electric lights and the shower of sparks which flew upwards from the engine an hour later ughtred riding in silence and at breakneck speed with reist at his elbow crossed the frontier of his kingdom     chapter x   prince ughtred of tyrnaus  brand awoke from a hideous nightmare sat up on a rude horsehair couch and held his head with both hands he was conscious of a sense of nausea burning temples and a general indisposition to take any interest in his surroundings he sank back upon his pillow  oh rot he murmured go away please  there was a short silence then footsteps and the newcomer bent over the sofa  drink this  the invitation was alluring brands throat was like a limekiln he sat up and took the proffered tumbler into his hands the liquid was cold and sparklingalmost magical in its effects he drained it to the last drop and then looked curiously about him  where the mischief am i he asked and who are you  the newcomer stood in the light from the window he was a short and thickset man with irongrey hair and black moustache slightly upturned he had a pallid skin and keen grey eyes his manner was at once grave and conciliatory  your memory prince he remarked is scarcely so good as mine i have had the pleasure of seeing you but once before yet i think that i should have recognized you anywhere  oh would you brand remarked beneath his breath  i will recall myself to your memory the other continued blandly my name is domiloff  domiloff of course brand echoed you are still  still the representative of russia to the state of theos it is true  and where am i brand asked looking around the bare lofty room with some surprise and what am i here for  you are in the house of customs at gallona i met the train at the frontier to secure the honour of a little conversation with you before you proceeded to the capital i found you exceedingly unwell and took the liberty of bringing you here that you might have the opportunity of resting a little before completing your journey  brand rose slowly to his feet he was still giddy but rapidly recovering himself his last distinct recollection was the coffee which he and the priest had ordered in their coup√© there was a peculiar tastea swimming in his headafterwards blank unconsciousness  you have been most considerate i am sure he said slowly i am glad to have your explanation otherwise my presence here under the circumstances might have suggested unpleasant things to me  domiloffs lips parted in an inscrutable smile he remained silent  i might have remembered brand continued that i was travelling with two friends what has become of them  domiloff shrugged his shoulders  it was most unfortunate he declared the train pulled up for a moment at a wayside station and they appear to have descendedand to have been left behind  brand nodded  i might also have remembered he continued stroking his moustache thoughtfully a priest whose interest in his fellowpassengers was a little extraordinarya cup of coffee pressed upon me a queer tastebah why waste time i was drugged sir with your connivance no doubt and brought here what is the meaning of it  domiloff shrugged his shoulders  you assume too much my dear prince he declared blandly let us not waste time by fruitless discussion i will admit that i was particularly anxious to have a few minutes quiet conversation with you before you entered the capital the opportunity is here let us avail ourselves of it  well  domiloff coughed he had expected a torrent of indignation and abuse his guests nonchalance was a little disquieting  you are entering he said upon a troublesome inheritance  well  it is an inheritance domiloff continued which you can neither possess yourself of nor hold without powerful friends  well  my country is willing to be your friend  your country brand remarked quietly is renowned throughout the world for her generosity  domiloff bowed  you do us sir he said no more than justice  brand smiled  well go on  theos is in a state of hopeless confusion domiloff remarked it is very doubtful whether the actual state of the country has been represented to you the people are all clamouring for they know not what law and order seem to be things of the past south of the balkans the turks are massing northwards the mailed hand of austria is slowly being extended  and russia brand asked it is not her custom to remain in the background  russia domiloff said desires to be your friend she will secure for you the throne and she will guarantee your independence  at what price  domiloff shrugged his shoulders  you are very suspicious my dear prince he said my master does not sell his favours he asks only for a reasonable recognition of your gratitude i have here the copy of a treaty which will secure you against any foreign interference in the affairs of your kingdom its advantages to you and to theos are so obvious that it is idle for me to waste time by enlarging upon them read it my prince  i shall be charmed brand exclaimed stretching out his hand for it  you would doubtless prefer domiloff said to look it through alone i will return in halfanhour  you are very thoughtful brand answered by the bye you will excuse my denseness but i am not quite clear as to our exact relations at the present moment i am i presume at gallona  the baron bowed  it is indisputable  at an hotel  you are domiloff declared my honoured guest  is it part of your diplomacy to starve me brand asked coolly or may i have some breakfast  domiloff touched the bell  my dear prince he exclaimed deprecatingly  a servant entered with a traycold meats and a flask of wine outside the window a sentry walked up and down brand eyed him thoughtfully  i think that i should like a stroll he remarked my head is still heavy  domiloff advanced and laid his hand upon his shoulder  my dear prince he said i beg that for the present you will not think of it it is of the utmost importance that your presence upon the soil of theos should not be suspected i have a special train waiting to take you to the capital until we start it will be far better believe me that you do not attempt to leave this room  at what hour do we start brand asked  domiloff hesitated  it depends he said slowly upon circumstances  brand sat down and poured himself out a glass of wine  that means when i have signed the treaty i suppose  domiloff was already at the door he affected not to hear  if your highness will ring when you are prepared to give me an audience he said i shall be entirely at your service                                       brand ate and drank threw himself into an easychair and lit a cigarette presently he tried the handle of the door it was locked he moved to the window and looked out below was an old courtyard enclosed within high grey walls and iron gates through which he could catch a glimpse of the town the wide open space half square half marketplace was crowded with people in strange costume having baskets of fruit and vegetables before which they squatted and called out their wares beyond were houses with vivid whitewashed fronts red roofs and narrow windows at the gates were stationed two soldiers in red tunics and broad white trousers very baggy and tucked into their boots they were bareheaded and they smoked long cigarettes chattering meanwhile to one another and the people around in a dialect which to brand was like a nightmare he watched them for a while and laughed softly to himself this was an adventure after his own heart  he looked at his watch it was three oclock  so reist and the prince were left behind he murmured it was very well arranged by now they should be on their way to the capital i must make this last out as long as possible what a coup  he lit another cigarette and turned the treaty over in his hands here he met with a disappointment there were two copies one in russian the other in the thetian language he could not read either after a few moments deliberation he rang the bell  domiloff hurried in expectantly  you are ready for me he asked you have read our proposals you will perhaps now be disposed to admit the generosity of my master  brand shrugged his shoulders  as yet he said coolly i am in a position to admit nothing as a matter of fact i cannot read this document i cannot read russian and i have forgotten nearly all thetian you must have a copy made for me quickly either in french or english  domiloff started a momentary shade of suspicion darkened his forehead  forgotten your thetian prince he exclaimed your native tongue  you forget that i have been an exile from theos ever since i was a child brand answered i can understand a word or so here and there but that is not sufficient it is necessary that i should have an exact and precise comprehension of your proposals  domiloff took up the document  i will make a copy myself he said it will not take long i hope that you will soon find your recollection of the language revive prince you will find the people sensitive about it  domiloff seated himself at the table and for some time there was silence in the room except for the scratching of his pen brand lounged in the easychairamused himself by speculating as to the end of his adventure presently there was a sharp tap at the door a messenger entered and conversed for awhile with domiloff in russian he was dismissed with a few rapid orders domiloff turned round in his chair and faced brand  prince ughtred he said i have disturbing news from the capital the disorder in the city is so great that the powers must intervene at once unless some decisive step be taken i have finished my translation sign it and you shall enter into your kingdom before sunset  brand smiled  i will give you my answer he said in ten minutes  domiloff bowed  i shall await your decision prince he said only remember this tonight there must be a king of theos or a protectorate     chapter xi   the ten minutes became halfanhour domiloff at last lost patience and knocked at the door brand who had just finished a shorthand copy of the treaty and had tucked it within the inner sole of his boot realized the fact that he had reached the end of his tether  come in he called out cheerfully  domiloff entered and closed the door behind him  i cannot understand your highnesss indecision he said impatiently the document which i have had the honour to submit for your approval is one of the most simple and straightforward which was ever written and while you hesitate prince your kingdom passes away every moment affairs in the capital draw nearer to a crisis  brand leaned back in his chair he looked no longer at the manuscript it was evident that his decision was taken  it seems to me he said quietly that my kingdom passes away none the less surely when i sign this paper your terms baron domiloff amount to a russian protectorate our trade is to be yours and yours only russian is to be taught in our schools and russians are to control our army and our customs what will theos gain in return for this  her independence will be guaranteed russia will be her faithful friend  her independence brand smiled her independence will be rather a tattered garment  domiloff shrugged his shoulders  prince he said you scarcely yet know the nature of your inheritance theos is a small weak state hemmed in with powerful nations one of the powers must needs to be her protector russia ever generous offers herself without her aid you could not hold your kingdom for an hour  brand sighed  well he said slowly supposing i agreewill you tell me this how can i sign a treaty before i am king  domiloff touched the paper with his forefinger  that has been provided for he said what you will sign is a promise to ratify the treaty on your accession to the throne  brand shook his head  as a private individual he said my signature is worth nothing further i decline to sign a paper which might at any future time be brought up against me and cost me the respect and allegiance of my people  domiloff looked anxious a moment ago the affair had seemed settled  what do you propose then he asked  i will swear upon my honour brand said and before witnesses if you desire it that i will sign the treaty whenever you require it after my accession to the throne  domiloff hesitated made up his mind to yield and yielded gracefully  it is sufficient he declared the honour of the house of tyrnaus has never been questioned but there is one more promise which i must ask you to add the governor of the customs in whose house we now are has acted as a patriot and a wise man in conjunction with me  i understand brand said with a quiet smile he shall be held harmless so far as i am concerned  domiloff vanished for a moment and reappeared followed by a soldierlylooking young man in dark blue uniform of decidedly russian appearance and an oliveskinned blackbearded civilian with shifty eyes and nervous manner they both bowed low before brand who drew himself up to his full height and eyed them scornfully  these are your witnesses baron he asked domiloff  domiloff assented  captain barka he said who is in command of the barracks here is one of the most gallant and faithful officers in the army of theos mr omardine is governor of the customs and a civic magistrate  brand regarded them coldly  you are here he said to listen to these words of mine on the sacred honour of the house of tyrnaus and before the god of theos i swear that whenever i may be asked after my accession to the throne of this country i will sign the treaty which i hold now in my right hand and further i swear not to divest of his office or punish in any way for their treachery captain barka or mr omardine your two witnesses  the two men started omardine turned pale and glanced at domiloff with furtive eyes barka laid his hand for a moment upon the hilt of his sword and the deep colour dyed his cheeks domiloff stepped hastily forward  it is sufficient your highness he said but i must protest against the word treachery being used as applying to either of these gentlemen they have simply studied the best interests of their country in recognizing that her destiny is identical with that of russia  brand turned his back upon them  so far as their safety is concerned he said i have passed my word my opinions are my own will you tell me baron at what time you propose to release me  if your highness will accept my escort domiloff said i propose to leave for the capital at once  the sooner the better brand declared  then there remains only for your highness to put on the uniform which i have sent for domiloff remarked touching the bell  what uniform asked brand quickly  the uniform of a colonel in the guards of theos domiloff answered here it is  a servant entered carrying a suit of gorgeous light blue and white uniform barka and omardine respectfully withdrew  i see no need at all for me to wear these things brand exclaimed glancing in bewilderment at the many trappings and strange fastenings i will go as i am there will be plenty of time afterwards for this sort of thing  it is impossible domiloff interrupted your highness seems to forget that your throne has yet to be won the people have had enough of civilians you must appear before them as a soldier and they will shout you king till their throats are hoarse and the water stands in their eyes they are a dramatic people lovers of effect they must be taken by storm i cannot offer your highness a valet but perhaps i can be of assistance  brand yielded but not without secret misgivings with his clothes a certain part of his easy confidence departed his share in the game was no longer to be a purely passive one with the donning of this uniform to which he had no manner of claim he entered the lists of intrigues boldly as an impostor and masquerader under certain circumstances the way out might be difficult  domiloff watched him make his toilet with a certain curiosity it was odd that a military man should be so much embarrassed by buckles and straps yet when all was completed he was bound to admit that the result was satisfactory enough brand was a goodlooking fellow and he looked the part  your highness will be so good now as to follow me domiloff directed a carriage is waiting to take us to the station  a guard of honour surrounded the open landau whose military salute brand gravely returned the news of his arrival had quickly spread the country people thronged around shouting and cheering the air was rent with strange barbaric cries their short drive to the railway station was a triumphal progress brand alone was wholly uncomfortable surely amongst all this press of people there would be some one to whom prince ughtred was known they reached the station however without incident and amidst everincreasing enthusiasm a handsome saloon was drawn up to the carpeted platform and a cordon of soldiers kept the station clear in less than five minutes they were off  brand unbuckled his sword and threw his helmet up in the rack then he made himself comfortable in an easychair ostensibly to sleep in reality to think out the situation  how long will it take us to reach the capital he asked  two hours domiloff answered sleep for a time if you like you may make yourself quite easy my arrangements for your reception are complete you will receive a tremendous ovation the news of your coming has electrified the city  brands gratification at the prospect was certainly not apparent however he closed his eyes and relapsed into thought two hours he reckoned it all out his knowledge of the geography of the country was slight but it seemed to him impossible that prince ughtred and reist could yet have reached the capital so far all that he had done had been good the difficulty which confronted him now was to select the proper moment for his avowal and having made it to escape he foresaw difficulties domiloff was not a man to be made a fool of lightly his one comforting reflection was that when the explosion did come he would be safer in theos than in a frontier town which was obviously under russian influence  slowly the train wound its way across a rocky and difficult country a country of mountains woods and rivers valleys rich with corntracts tiny villages whose gleaming white homesteads made picturesque many a hillside brand sat quite still with halfclosed eyes presently the door of the saloon opened and closed again softly domiloff looked in and withdrew then there came the sound of voices from the next compartment listening intently bland caught a word or two here and there  absolutely impossible i saw him in paris after the algerian campaign  thinner that is all reist and the english journalist were simply left  plant√© l√† hernoff planned everything  mistakes he does not make mistakes if i believed it i would shoot him like a dog you have your revolver too good oh yes he will sign it will be a record reign it may last a month they will see that he is under the thumb of russia no he is fast asleep after hernoffs medicine one is sleepy for days  the voices died away they passed through a little wayside station gay with flags and the train began to descend a series of gradients below was a great fruitful plain bounded southwards by a range of towering mountains far away westwards was a huge ascent to a widespreading tableland brand sat with his eyes fixed steadily upon it and a queer little smile upon his lips he was sufficiently aware of his surroundings to know that there was the fortress capital of theos  he heard footsteps and closed his eyes again domiloff entered the saloon and shook him by the arm he awoke with a drowsy murmur  wake up your highness we are within a few miles of the capital  brand sat up  all right he said i am ready but how my head aches  domiloff smiled grimly and thrust a sheet of paper into his hand  it will pass off he said see this is your speech learn it it will not be wise for you to address the people in any save their own language  brand took the sheet of unintelligible characters into his own hand he looked blankly at it  read it to me he said let me hear how it sounds  domiloff declaimed and translated it brand listened thoughtfully apparently the return of ughtred of tyrnaus to the throne of his forefathers was solely owing to a benevolent desire on the part of russia to bring to theos an era of unparalleled peace and prosperity far away a gleam of white and grey towers flashed upon the hillside villages became more plentiful they were nearing the capital     chapter xii   once more the men and women of theos thronged the streets of their timeworn capital a thousand torches flared in the open space before the palace lanterns and flags waved from all the principal houses and public buildings only the great reist mansion was silent and gloomy and many questioning eyes were turned towards it  it was the duke himself who has brought ughtred of tyrnaus here muttered one yet his house is dark and empty and no man has seen him  there is something strange about it said another and i like not the wolf domiloff at the shoulder of a tyrnaus  please god the son may not be like the father  let us see him cried another comeshout  so the air shook with the roar of voices and servants in the blue tyrnaus livery came out upon the balcony of the brilliantlylit palace and spread a carpet but the man whom they longed to see lingered  domiloff argued with him in vain he was unaccountably obstinate  it is the duke of reist who should stand by my side when first i speak to my people he declared coolly it is he who brought me from england not you he must be my sponsor if he is not here i will wait  domiloff was naturally furious he had been at considerable pains to insure the absence of reist from the capital on this occasion and his inopportune return would amount to a disaster on the other hand the populace were fast working themselves up into a state of frenzy let this man show himself and the success of his coup was assured it was unpardonable hesitation he trembled with rage in the kings palace in his own chamber he had lost for the moment his hold upon this man it was the one weak spot in his carefully thoughtout scheme it was the one contingency against which he was comparatively helpless  you are losing a golden opportunity prince he declared your hesitation is a crime the people are on fire to see you they will shout you king with one voice give to reist all the glory if you will but if you would win your kingdom out on to the balcony and show yourself hear them  the roar of voices sounded like thunder from the street below brand smoked on stolidly  i shall wait one hour for the duke of reist he decided at the end of that time if he has not arrived i will reconsider the matter  domiloff who did not expect the duke of reist in an hour was forced to acquiesce  i will send messengers out amongst the people he said i will let them know that you are worn out with travelling but that in an hour you will address them shall it be so  you can do as you like brand answered quietly i make no promises  domiloff withdrew furious brand was left alone he was a journalist of the modern type and he had been in a good many tight corners his nerves were of iron his courage indomitable and his sense of humour prodigious but this was getting beyond a joke he was in a culdesac escape was scarcely to be hoped for disclosure would certainly cost him his life nevertheless as the roar of voices mounted again to his ears the corners of his mouth twitched and his eyes shone with laughter he found himself longing for pen and paper wondering how much of this he dare use as copy then the clock struck he became instantly grave after all an hour was a short time he concentrated his thoughts once more upon the situation  on one point he was resolved he would not carry his personation any further he would not present himself to the people of theos as an impostor with domiloff for his introducer and unable to frame a single sentence in the language of his supposed forefathers the speech which domiloff had written out for him was of course an impossibility some time tonight the prince and reist must surely arrive and the situation then might become possible failing that he could see nothing but chaos  halfanhour had passed but he was not greatly disturbed he had a touch of that beautiful faith which is the heritage of the born adventurer he was content to wait for something to turn up he threw away the end of his cigar and walked slowly up and down the great vaulted room the ceiling was of extraordinary height and the wooden panels which covered the walls were black with age and beautifully carved he paused before one of them to examine the design and passed his fingers lightly over the figure of a priest who knelt by the side of a wounded man in armour it was a rugged but wonderful representation suddenly he started back as though he had been shot the priest was being split down the middle before his eyes  he stood rigid even his nerves were scarcely proof against this sort of thing the head of the wounded knight had parted from his body and the legs of the priest were every moment drawing further apart he approached the panel gingerly it was not fancy there was a long thin crack from the floor to the tapestry border which stood about six feet high whilst he watched it widened he slipped his hand into his pocket and drew out his revolver  from one inch to twoto half a foot and then wide open the panel slid back brand uttered a soft cry of amazement a woman dark slender and beautiful stood upon the threshold of what seemed to be a passage herself almost as motionless as a painted figure her eyes met his with a challenging light her pose was imperious diamonds flashed from her neck and bosom and her hair was coiled upon her head coronetlike after the manner of the women of theos her black gown was cut in a manner unknown to western dressmakersto brand she seemed like a wonderful italian picture of the middle ages stepped bodily from its frame he lowered his revolver and took a quick step backward then to his surprise she spoke to him in english haltingly but with perfect distinctness  lock the door  the sound of his native language made a new man of brand his senses were no longer dazed  it isalready locked he answered  she took a step forward and before he could divine her purpose sank gently on one knee in a wonderful courtesy he took the slim white hand and bowed low over it  you are ughtred of tyrnaus she said eagerly is it not so  he laughed quietly  it is the first time he said that i have been asked the question personation seems to come natural to me  she looked at him intently and the fine dark eyebrows were drawn a little closer together  i am not very quick at speaking english she said you are ughtred of tyrnaus  well i am supposed to be he admitted  then where is my brother she demanded why is he not with you  he looked at her puzzled  forgive me he said i am rather stupid what is your brothers name and who are you  her eyes gleamed with suspicion was it not obvious who she was  i am the countess marie of reist she said will you answer me quickly  he divined the likeness at once  and do you livein the wall he asked  she frowned imperiously  if you indeed are ughtred of tyrnaus she said you should know that the reist house adjoins the palace and that this passage has been in existence since the days of king rudolph tell me what you have done with my brother nicholas and how it happens that you have entered the city without him and in company with domiloff the wolf  he smiled his optimism was justified something had turned up  you must allow me to make a confession countess he said easily i am not ughtred of tyrnaus the prince is on his way to the city with your brother and to tell you the truth if they do not arrive here very soon my position will become extremely uncomfortable  she withdrew within the shelter of the panel and regarded him haughtily  you say that you are not ughtred of tyrnaus she exclaimed then who are you an impostor yes you are in the royal chamber and even now the people call for you you are a tool of domiloffs good the people shall know that they are being deceived  he was only just in time to seize her by the wrist she wrenched herself free with a furious little cry but he blocked her escape  countess he said with perfect respect but with a gleam of laughter in his eyes pray do not desert me for i am a friend of your brothers and especially of prince ughtreds i am not masquerading for the fun of the thing i can assure you but solely to outwit domiloff permit me to explain the fact is i need your help  she eyed him coldly the touch of his fingers seemed burning still upon her wrist  well  three of us left england together brand said your brother prince ughtred and myselfwalter brand a newspaper writer and a person of no importance i wont stop to tell you how i became one of the party it isnt of any consequence and time is i happen to slightly resemble prince ughtred and we got scent of a plot to stop our entrance into theos well prince ughtred and i exchanged identities the consequences were these the prince and your brother left the train secretly before we left the frontier i was drugged and awoke to find myself t√™te√†t√™te with a remarkably gentlemanly personage called domiloff  her eyes flashed fire she came a little further into the room  ah well  he took me for granted in the kindest possible mannerwaived aside the matter of my abductionaffected to consider me as an afternoon caller he introduced politics in a casual sort of way russia i found was the great and generous friend of theos russia was pining for the friendship of theos  she interrupted him with a fierce little gesture of contempt  the hound russia is our enemy it was she who sought to buy our freedom from metzger the merchant for a million pounds  he nodded  exactly however i had to listen to him in the end he produced a treatyrussian protection for theos in exchange for every shred of independence she possessed if i would swear before witnesses to sign it when i became king i might proceed and domiloff himself would be my escort if i refusedwell i think then that other things were in store for me after a becoming show of hesitation i promised to signwhen i was king then domiloff hustled me along here i have delayed things as long as possible but its getting a little uncomfortable domiloff cant understand why i wont go and speak to the people if i declare myself he will shoot me on sight what i have been praying for is a chance to escape or that your brother and the prince might turn up  she regarded him with unfeigned admiration  i did you an injustice she said i see that you are a very brave man and we in theos love brave men  he bowed before her so gallantly and looked into her eyes so closely that a wave of colour flushed in her cheeks a distant sound in the palace however brought them to a swift sense of the danger which threatened him  you see he explained i was bound to keep it up as long as i could or domiloff would have tried to prevent your brother and the prince from reaching the capital besides since i have read the proposed treaty they would never allow me to escape alive  she nodded slowly  yes that is so it would not be well that you speak first to the people with domiloff at your elbow but if it comes to a matter of life or death you must do it i will send servants and horses to hasten my brothers coming and you must continue the personation  there is an objection he replied quickly i do not know a single word of your language and to speak for the first time to the people in any other would do the prince a great injury with them  she reflected for a moment then her face lit up she pointed down the passage  i think she said that it would be a very good time for prince ughtred to disappear you shall come with me  brand hesitated  but countess he protested they will search your house you will be accused of harbouring an impostor  she dismissed the idea with a gesture of superb contempt  the reist house she assured him is secure against domiloff or any of his creatures i offer you its shelter sir i beg you to come with me  still he hesitated a fresh murmur arose from the swelling crowd withoutfootsteps were heard in the corridorthe hour struck she laid her fingers upon his arm and looked upward into his face  sir she said softly i beg that you will come with me  brand felt his heart beating with more than the mere excitement of the moment he yielded she pressed a spring with her finger and the panel rolled slowly back into its place     chapter xiii   up the steep ascent to the capital two men galloped their tired horses in stern silence for twelve hours they had ridden with scant waste of breath in speech only at each change and seven times since break of day had they changed horses prince ughtred had lit a fresh cigar and asked the same question and met with the same reply  how goes it nicholas  we keep up with the time forward  as they neared the capital they rode through a stream of people wending their way citywards reist drew rein  whither away friends  to the capital sir prince ughtred of tyrnaus our future king is there we go to greet him  the two men exchanged quick glances as they rode on  i do not understand it reist admitted our coming is unannounced a certain amount of secrecy was necessary something strange seems to have happened  by degrees their progress along the narrow road grew more and more difficult the country folk thronged the thoroughfare gay in picturesque holiday attire many of them singing a strange national air which stirred in ughtreds heart some faint echo of faraway recollections he watched them eagerly and his heart swelled with pride a fine stalwart race with the free swinging walk of mountaineers brighteyed clearskinned with cheeks as brown as berries his dormant patriotism already awakened by his long ride through the beautiful dimlyfamiliar country beat in his heart he would rule these people as his children and though he died sword in hand the yoke of the conqueror should never bow their shoulders it was a great taska great heritage  a train brilliant with lights glided serpentlike over the high viaduct to their left a murmur arose from amongst the people  the prince they cried the prince  what does it mean ughtred asked  god only knows reist answered bewildered  at the station a cordon of soldiers blocked the way the two men spurred on into the front ranks amongst a thunder of acclamation they saw domiloff and brand in his brilliant uniform take their places in the waiting carriage they were speechless  to the palace reist cried at last come ughtred theres some damned underhand plotting going on  it was brand ughtred exclaimed brand in the uniform of the theos guards is the man mad  i do not think that it was brand at all reist answered fiercely it is a plot of that accursed russian way good people way  but the people goodnatured though they were were wedged too thickly to let them pass at last in a rush they were almost unhorsed a direct progress to the palace was impossible reist turned up a side street  we will go to my house he said it will take us some time this way but we shall never succeed in reaching the palace                                       the panel slid back behind them and closed with a spring from some place upon the wall invisible to him the countess took a small silver lamp and carefully lit it then holding it high over her head she turned towards brand  you must follow me closely she said the way is narrow and there are steps listen  they both stood for a moment with bated breath in the room behind was tumult there were angry voices the ringing of bells bewildered exclamations  it is my friend domiloff brand whispered i am afraid that he has lost his temper i might at least have left a note  she motioned him to follow her  you are quite safe she declared the secret passage has not been used for many years it is unknown to any within the palace i do not know what made me think of it tonight  it was brand remarked a remarkable piece of good fortune for me i do not fancy that our friend domiloff in a passion would be at all a pleasant companion  her face hardened  domiloff she said is a traitor and a ruffian when i saw you alone with him and without nicholas i knew that something must have happened my brother would never have suffered him to have stood by your side tonight this way  they stepped into a large dimlylit room with high panelled walls and a vaulted roof the door rolled back behind them the girl passed her hands along the wall till even the crack was invisible then she moved to the table and struck a gong  you must need wine she said basil  a greyhaired old servant entered the room and at the sight of brand would have fallen upon one knee but the girl stopped him  basil this is not prince ughtred she said but a friend of his and ours who has been taking the princes place in order that domiloff might be deceived bring us some wine  brand drank from the long venetian glass and afterwards sank gratefully into the highbacked chair to which she motioned him at her request he told her everything which had happened since the coming of reist to london and from below there came to them often the murmur of the waiting crowds  she was superbly devoid of nerves she had no manner of apprehension  they will come she said and the people will wait tell me some more of your wonderful london  you have never been there he exclaimed in astonishment  she shook her head  no nor in paris even no further west than vienna  it is incredible he murmured  and why incredible she asked him with delicately upraised eyebrows i do not understand theos is my homethose places are nothing to me whilst i was in vienna i was miserable all was hurry and bustle there was so little dignity so little repose i do not think that people who live in such places can understand what it is to love ones homeland everywhere too even amongst the aristocracy one met vulgar people shopkeepers and merchants who had made very much money mixed freely with the nobles they tell me that in england it is also like this in theos i think that we are wiser  she spoke simplyas one who points out a grievous impropriety brand smiled  i have heard your country spoken of as one of the most aristocratic in the world he remarked i think that it must be true  from what i have seen she answered it may be so there are very little of the old nobility left in theos but we are content to let them die out rather than to raise to their ranks those who have enriched themselves with commerce we believe that our way is best  and you yourself he asked tell me how you occupy yourself you have friendsamusements  she shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly  my brother has large estates she said and with them come many duties i see that our peasant women are properly brought up and that they retain their skill in lace work then there is music and when we are at castle reist we hunt it is true that i have not many friends of my own order but that is scarcely to be expected the care of so many of those who are dependent upon one is a very absorbing duty we give a dowry to every girl who marries suitably amongst our own people for many generations this has been a religion with us tell me then is it not so with the maidens of your countryi speak of course of those who are of noble birth  he shook his head  i think not he answered you see for them there are many diversions they play games hunt shoot and ride with their brothers and their brothers friends when they are at their estates then for half the year they live in london and every night there are dances concerts theatres and parties of all sorts  she nodded gravely  that is what i have heard she said they take life so much more lightly than we who live in quieter places here there is born with us the consciousness that our rank has many obligations there is not a peasant girl on my estates whom i do not know by name it has been so with the women of our house for many generations  there was a short silence then she raised her eyes to his  your own sisters she asked are they too such as you describe  brand smiled faintly  i have only one sister he said and she is married but my own people would scarcely countfrom your point of view  she looked at him faintly puzzled  you mean she asked that you are not of noble birth  he shook his head  by no means my father was a physician and i myself write for the newspapers  but you spoke of prince ughtred she remarked as your friend  he smiled  in england he explained all these things are regarded very differently we are a very democratic nation and prince ughtred you must remember is half an englishman  she was silent he had an absurd fancy that she was disappointedthat her momentary interest in him was gone he was angry with himself for the idea angry with himself also for the effort which his little speech had cost him in england he counted himself a radical almost a socialist and would have laughed to scorn the idea that the slightest possible barrier could exist between men and women of unequal birth but out here in the presence of this girl who spoke her mind so simply yet with such absolute conviction he seemed to have come into touch with a new order the aristocracy which was to her as a creed was a real and a live thing he almost justified her in his mind what was surely a fallacy in england might be truth here  the silence was prolonged then he glanced up to find her watching him with a slight smile curving her lips  to you she said i must seem very oldfashioned oh yes i can understand your point of view if i have not travelled i have at least read and your english books make these things clear enough but here we are surrounded with the old customs it is not possible to escape from them we are almost medi√¶val  i am looking forward to studying your country closely he said what i have seen of it has charmed me so far i have come across but one thing which i would gladly change  and that she asked  is the uniform of the thetian guards he answered turning slightly in his chair i must confess that my body was never made for such gorgeousness  she laughed and struck the gong  basil will show you to my brothers room she said wear any of his clothes you choose  he rose with alacrity  you will be safealone he asked with a doubtful glance towards the door  she shrugged her shoulders  domiloff has courage i believe of a sort she answered but not enough to bring him uninvited across the threshold of this house in my brothers absence  he followed the servant from the room and was shown into a bedchamber of huge proportions he changed his clothes as quickly as possible for those which were tendered to him and returned to the room where he had left the countess she welcomed him with a smile which she tried in vain to suppress  you must forgive me she said as their eyes met indeed it is hard to avoid a smile my brother is of slight stature and you are very tallis it not so  oh i dont mind he answered goodhumouredly conscious that his trousers terminated at the ankle and that the seams of his unbuttoned coat were bursting i should be comfortable in anything since i have got rid of that sword and the other thing like a satchel which kept tripping me up the management of a womans train has always seemed to me an accomplishment but it is nothing compared with the difficulty of walking like a soldier with those things whacking at your ankles every few moments one thing i can promise you and myself countess if domiloff and the whole lot of them catch me nothing would induce me to put on that uniform again  it was very becoming she said smilingly  you are making fun of me he declared reproachfully  indeed i meant it she assured him i never doubted but that you were ughtred of tyrnaus  he felt absurdly pleased there was a note of regret too in her tone then as though with some effort she addressed him more formally  you need have no fear she said that domiloff will find you here neither he nor any of his creatures dare force their way into this house all that we must pray for now is the speedy coming of nicholas and the prince  almost as she spoke they heard quick footsteps upon the corridor outside the door was thrown open     chapter xiv   nicholas of reist closely followed by prince ughtred strode into the room marie uttered a little cry of joybrand drew a long sigh of relief  nicholas at last she cried  he seized her hands and drew her to him then he turned to ughtred  you will not recognize your old playmate prince he said marie this is prince ughtred of tyrnaus  he bowed low before her and she murmured a few words of greeting then both nicholas of reist and ughtred saw brand standing underneath the great chimneypiece  brand the former cried brand how in gods name did you find your way here  brand smiled enigmatically  listen he said and i will tell you  they stood grouped around him he told his story tersely yet fully when he had finished there was a moments breathless silence he pointed to the door  you have not a moment to lose he exclaimed the people are bewildered now soon they will become impatient the uniform is in the room where i changed let prince ughtred put it on and speak to the people from your balcony it will turn domiloffs hair grey but he is powerless listen  once more brother and sister exchanged quick glances once more the men of theos as with one throat shouted for nicholas of reist marie looked curiously towards the prince he was handsomer than brand broader and of finer presence yet her eyes narrowed with something which was akin to hate in her heart she believed that her brother was making a great mistake it was a reist this people wanted not one of his corrupt race  brand is right reist decided prince my servants will show you to my room and assist you i will speak a few words to the people and prepare them for your coming  from topmost storey to basement the reist house flashed out in sudden light the people who were weary of shouting in front of the palace marked the change and a sudden rush took place it was reist who stood there with his hands resting lightly upon the balustrade a roar of welcome greeted him now at last this mystery would be cleared up then there followed a silence so intense so breathless that the very air seemed charged with the tension of it reists voice rang out like a still clear note perfectly audible to all  my country people he said not many days ago you charged me with a mission tonight i acquit myself of it i bring you good news the illustrious soldier who has won fame fighting another countrys battles has never for one moment forgotten his name or his native land has never forgotten his descent from that great race of tyrnaus who generations ago made your country one to be feared and respected throughout europe he is willing to come to our aid in these evil times he is a brave man and a just he will rule you as a soldier king may the god of our ancestors bless his reign and preserve for everlasting the independence of theos and the freedom of our sons  as the last word had left reists lips ughtred of tyrnaus in all the bravery of his brilliant uniform passed through the great room marie who had been watching for him shrank back at his near approach in something like awe for indeed it seemed as though rudolph the great whose picture frowned down upon them from the wainscotted wall walked once more in their midst the unwonted excitement had given fire to his features seemed indeed to have added inches to his great stature no wonder that the people who saw him come raised their voices in a great shout of welcome  a tyrnaus a tyrnaus god save the king  the band struck up the national anthem and from the throats of thousands came that strange thrilling air the song of their liberty prince ughtred listened with tears in his eyesand in the palace domiloff held his head and walked backwards and forwards in speechless bewilderment the last bars died away then ughtred spoke to his people and these are some of the things which he said  men of theos that song which you have sung has followed me into many strange countries i have ridden into battles with it in my ears i have heard it amongst the roaring of the guns and in the silent watches of the night to me it has always sounded like very sweet music for it has recalled to me ever my native land i too you must remember am a son of theos for long i have been an exile but no other country has ever seemed like home to me always i have hoped that some day my lot might bring me back to the homeland amongst the mountains so inexpressibly dear to all of us i too though far away have followed ever the fortunes of theos i have read of her sufferings and her misfortunes i have blushed with shame to read of those who calling themselves her sons would have bartered away her liberty for gold and now you have done away with this hateful republic the house of laws is once more convoked the duke of reist has sought me out and brought from you a wonderful message well i know little of kingcraft but i may at least call myself a soldier if the house of laws will ratify your choice nothing in this world could make me happier than to throw in my lot with yours to devote my life to preserving for you and theos that ancient and godgiven heritageour freedom this little state is surrounded it is true by powerful enemies yet god is not always with the strong let us be fearless just and slow to give offence then if we are attacked it must be war to the bitter end we can at least live like men and die heroes my people if it comes to pass that i am chosen to be your king i can promise you this while i live and whilst a single one of you will stand by my side we will remain a free and independent nation we will hand to our children their birthright untarnished and entire this is my word to you and if ever i fail to keep it may i forfeit my place through all eternity by the side of my forefathers who gave their lives for theos  the air was rent with frantic cheering these were the words and this the man to win their hearts so throughout the crowd swept a passionate and overwhelming wave of enthusiasm domiloff heard it and swore unutterable things under his breath reist for all that this was his doing felt a certain momentary anger with this people who had taken a stranger so swiftly into their heart marie said nothing but her dark eyes were eloquent ughtred stepped back at last into the room with a glow upon his face which for a moment transformed it  you are an orator my friend reist said quietly you have won your throne no house of laws would refuse to confirm the choice of such an assemblage  i think brand said quietly that i will go round to the telegraph office the time has arrived when i may take a hand in the game  from the corridor came the sound of hurried footsteps old basil the major domo threw open the door  the baron domiloff your excellency he announced     chapter xv   the room was large and dimly lit domiloff beside himself with anger saw only ughtreds tall figure in resplendent uniform standing beneath the great carved mantelpiece he addressed him fiercely  how is this he exclaimed how came you here what is the meaning of it  ughtred looked at him for a moment gravely then turned to reist  who is this person he asked why does he address me in this fashion  reist looked from one to the other with a faint smile  permit me to present to your highness he said monsieur the baron domiloff the representative of russia in theos  domiloff was white with rage  but it is a farce this he exclaimed fiercely prince ughtred and i are not strangers i demand an explanation sir  an explanation of what ughtred asked  domiloff was beside himself his black eyes burned like live coals his cheeks were pallid almost to ghastliness the muscles of his face were twitching  of your presence here sir he exclaimed of your flight from the palace of your speech to the people it was only an hour ago that you declared yourself ignorant of the language it seems that your statement was false  baron domiloff is suffering perhaps from some hallucination ughtred said quietly i have never to the best of my belief exchanged a word with him in my life as to my flight from the palace i have never yet entered it nor do i propose to do so until i enter it as king of theos  domiloffs senses were blinded with passion the broader stature of the prince his more military bearing and different accent were things of which he took no note he never once questioned the identity of the man whom he was addressing so fiercely  your highness will deny next he exclaimed that you travelled with me from the frontier that your word is pledged to sign a treaty with russia  ughtred shrugged his shoulders slightly  the duties of a minister plenipotentiary he remarked are i believe arduous baron domiloff is suffering without doubt from overwork it is unnecessary for me to remark that i reached here on horseback in company with my friend reist and that my word is pledged to sign nothingleast of all a treaty with russia  domiloff was absolutely speechless with passion brand came out from the shadows amongst which he had been loitering and faced the russian  do you know he said amiably i believe that i can clear up this little misunderstanding baron domiloff is obviously mistaking you prince ughtred for me  domiloff turned upon him swiftly  and who sir are you he asked harshly  walter brand journalistthe daily courier you know  domiloff caught up the lamp which stood on the long oaken table and looked steadily from one to the other of the two men when he set it down there was a queer bitter little smile upon his lips the moment was one of unspeakable humiliation to him he a seasoned diplomatist trusted by his master feared and respected everywhere had been befooled and outwittedby an englishman  i beg to offer my tardy congratulations to your highness he said bowing to ughtred my mistake was an unpardonable one yet this gentleman is perhaps also of the family of tyrnaus the resemblance is certainly remarkable  mr brand is not connected in any way with my family ughtred answered the resemblance between us is merely a coincidenceto which it seems i owe my presence here baron domiloff  the russian remained silent he stood with bowed head awaiting the storm  it appears ughtred continued that by proxy i was drugged and detained upon the frontier by your orders for these doings i shall certainly when the proper moment arrives demand an explanation  domiloff raised his eyes for a moment his expression was inscrutable  when the time comes your highness he said i shall be prepared to satisfy you  he passed from the room without any formal leavetaking reist looked after him thoughtfully  an enemy well at least we are forewarned prince ughtred there will be no rest for you now or i fear for many days domiloff has gone without doubt to the barracks we must forestall him i have ordered fresh horses to be brought to the door marie some wine we are thirsty wine from the kings cup  a servant whose livery seemed but a slight modification of the native dress brought some dustcovered bottles marie with her own hand unlocked an oaken cabinet and produced some quaint horn cups emblazoned in gold with the reist arms one larger than the others she set before the prince  they were a present reist said from rudolph the second to my greatgrandfather the cup you have is called the kings cup no one who is not of royal birth has ever drunk out of it permit me  he filled it to the brim and ughtred who was thirsty raised it gladly to his lips reist and brand waited  to theos and her king reist said gravely this is our ancient toast may her sons be ever brave her rulers wise and her soil fruitful god save the king  they drank together marie stood at the head of the table her dark eyes full of silent fires her fingers nervously twitching ughtred turned towards her  you too he said must drink with us nay i will have no refusal you will honour me  he held his cup towards her she shook her head  not from the kings cup she said see i have a goblet here  but ughtred was insistent  i have the weakness of my forefathers he declared and i am superstitious it will be for my good fortune and the good fortune of theos you shall drink with me from the kings cup  a spot of colour burned in the girls cheeks she drew back a swift glance passed between brother and sister it was reist who answered  your highness he said gravely in this little corner of the earth we hold hard to all our old traditions and for more than a hundred yearsay since first that cup was fashioned none have drunk from it save only those of the royal house and  he hesitated ughtred waited for him to continue  and their betrothed  ughtred started marie looked downwards and the deep colour mounted even to her forehead there was a moments silence then the spirit of obstinacy which had been kindled in ughtred prevailed  i take upon my own shoulders he said smiling all the evil that may come of it and i pray countess marie that you will honour me by drinking from my cup  she lifted her head and the eyes of brother and sister met once morea single electric moment ughtred was conscious of little save of a masterful desire to have his own way his blue eyes were filled with a compelling light perhaps too a little admiration was apparent in his bronzed handsome face marie took the cup and raised it to her lips  i drink she murmured to the welfare of theos and to her king  there was another brief but curiously intense silence reist was standing apart with folded arms and absorbed facebrand too had set down his cup and was watching marie ughtred had an uneasy feeling that what he had regarded merely as an act of courtesy had become a sacrament the entrance of a servant was a relief to them all  the horses your grace he announced are at the side door the people are lining the way to the barracks  reist roused himself quickly  your highness is ready he exclaimed there is not a moment to lose we shall know now how deep is the corruption which domiloffs gold has caused  ughtred drained his cup and stood up  i am ready he declared     chapter xvi   it is not only your countrys welfare domiloff said which trembles in the balance it is her very existence i appeal to you general dartnoffto you bushnieff if you accept this man theos as an independent country will soon be blotted from the map  domiloff stood leaning with his back against the long deal table gathered together before him were a dozen men or more in the undress uniform of the moranian guards dartnoff his white hair brushed straight back from his forehead a tall soldierly figure notwithstanding his sixty years stepped a little forward  my friend domiloff he said we are gathered here as you know in a state of some indecision i will frankly admit that as yet we have not made up our minds how to act yet it seems to me that you go a little far we have more faith in ourselves and in the destinies of our ancient kingdom than you seem willing to give us credit for the end might be as you say supposing we found ourselves involved with one of the great powers but let me assure you baron domiloff that the contest would be no bloodless one theos has held her own beset though she has been by powerful enemies for many centuries  a little murmur of applause escaped from the lips of those gathered around him domiloff held up his hand  the past of your country he exclaimed is a magnificent chapter in history it is the more incumbent upon you to see that she has a future warfare today has become a science reckless bravery is no longer the surety of success theos is without any of the modern appliances of war her artillery is ancient and her guns fit for the dustheap general dartnoff a heavy responsibility rests upon your shoulders  dartnoff stroked his long grey moustache thoughtfully  domiloff my friend he said you appear a little flurried but you are also very much in earnest now speak to us exactly the words which are in your heart you have advice to give eh well we will listen  domiloff moved to the high bare window and looked downwards towards the town as yet there was no sign of the figures which he dreaded to see he faced once more the little assemblage  here are plain words he said speaking rapidly and with rising colour if i have seemed evasive hitherto it is because i come to persuade not to dictate and i know that the tempers of you men of theos are easily kindled nicholas of reist brings today a forgotten descendant of the tyrnaus family and with your consent would make him king i say with your consent because the house of laws is nothing today but a farcical assembly and they will do what reist bids them the real decision rests with you listen russia will refuse to recognize this man if you accept him her restraining hand upon turkey will be removed russia herself may not think it worth while to move against you but even now in secret the turks are massing upon your borders they wait only for the signal  dartnoff nodded gravely  well he said let us hear what will happen to us supposing we accept your warning and refuse to recognize ughtred of tyrnaus  the protection of russia domiloff cried eagerly my master himself shall guarantee your independence i will give you pledges you will reserve for a friend and an ally the most generous of the powers but you must be quick he added with a sudden start now is the time for you to act close the gates upon those who come here tonight it shall be your answer  dartnoff shook his head  i cannot do that he said nicholas of reist is a colonel in our army and he has the right to enter here at any time  there was the thunder of hoofs in the courtyard domiloff bit his lip and looked nervously around  reist is a traitor he exclaimed it is against the law to harbour a tyrnaus  we will hear what our friend nicholas of reist has to say dartnoff answered coldly you might perhaps find it advisable to retire baron domiloff  the door was thrown open nicholas and ughtred entered general dartnoff stepped forward  general nicholas exclaimed and brother officers of the thetian guards i have the honour to present you to prince ughtred of tyrnaus  ughtred held out his hand frankly but there was not one of them who did not bow low after the manner of one making an obeisance rather than exchanging greetings  your names are well known to me ughtred said i believe that by hereditary right i may call myself a colonel in your regiment and a brother officer  dartnoff bowed  your highness is pleased to remember what is undoubtedly a fact he said the brave deeds of captain erlito in the soudan have been a source of pride to all of us  ughtred smiled with pleasureand nicholas with his hand upon his sword addressed general dartnoff in clear tones  general dartnoff he said i take the liberty of addressing you as commanderinchief of the thetian army the republic of theos has ceased by reason of its own misdeeds to exist i have always as you know refused to recognize its legislation i claim that its decree abolishing the ancient monarchy and establishing a republic here was invalid and worthless we have been made the laughingstock of europe by the goldbought merchants and traitors who have presumed to occupy the high places of theos that is all at an end it rests with us to restore honour and dignity to our country there is but one way but that a sure one general dartnoff and brother officers we come here alone and unattended but had we wished it we could have stormed your walls with half the population of theos at our backs i call upon you all to take the oath of allegiance to ughtred of tyrnaus king of theos by divine right and the choice of the people  general dartnoff hesitated for a moment  duke of reist he said slowly you ask us to take a step on the impulse of the moment from which there could be no drawing back which for good or for evil must decide forever the destinies of our country whatever my own personal inclinations might be i owe it to my brother officers and to our deep sense of patriotism to consult with them for a few minutes  reist would have spoken hastily but ughtred checked him  general dartnoff has spoken like a wise man he said i am content to wait  with folded arms drawn to his full height a commanding figure indeed ughtred of tyrnaus stood by the window looking down upon the city and the country which he loved general dartnoff surrounded by his officers stood at the head of the table in the further corner of the room where the shadows were deepest domiloff lurked he watched their faces and he knew that the game was lost  only a very few minutes had gone by before dartnoff approached the two men by the window  your highness he said to ughtred with marked respect there is one question which we feel constrained to ask  ughtred bowed  as many as you will he answered  in your coronation oath you swear to maintain inviolate the independence of theos we would know if at all costs though the cost should be famine death or annihilation will you keep this oath to the letter  may god have no mercy upon me hereafter if ever i should depart from it one hairsbreadth ughtred answered with a sudden note of passion surging up in his tone i have no fancy for ruling a tributary state sir my forefathers have held safely for theos through long generations the priceless gift of her liberty and i would sooner die a thousand times over than that mine should be the hand to part with it  general dartnoff dropped on his knee and drawing his sword from his scabbard kissed its hilt  your majesty he said we are all your faithful servants     chapter xvii   well  reist unfastened his sword the state uniform of the thetian guards was cumbersome and the day was hot  let basil bring me wine he ordered the cathedral was a furnace everywhere the air seems hot with the shouting of the people  up here marie said the clamour of voices has seemed incessant i have never heard anything like it  he walked up and down moodily he was not sure whether the day had gone according to his liking all the time her eyes questioned him  one thing he declared is certain never again will a republic exist in theos two generations of rou√©s and madmen have not sickened this people of the house of tyrnaus their loyalty is amazing  this man she said is neither rou√© nor madman  it is true he admitted  he drank his wine and as he set the glass down he felt her watching him he understood the unspoken question in her deep blue eyes  of his betrothal reist said slowly there was no word  she drew herself up haughtily a slim stately figure in her magnificent white dress caught up with jewels and the curious bejewelled headdress which in theos was the symbol of her rank yet nicholas who watched her closely caught the gleam of something in her eyes which surprised him it was more like relief than anger  was our ancient usage explained to him she asked  yes i told him that an unmarried king was contrary to the timesanctioned custom of our country i told him that the announcement of his betrothal should be made at the moment of his coronation the people expected it and it would add immensely to his popularity  you told him that  yes  and he answered  he answered me with a jest as yet he was not prepared to marry or to think of marriage he preferred to retain his liberty  she bit her lip and the colour mantled in her cheeks  and you  he hesitated  it was after the words of the ceremony he was my king between a reist and a tyrnaus the difference is purely accidental the reists are indeed the older and the nobler family but between a reist and his king there is a gulf i cannot point my sword against him  she walked restlessly up and down the room her thoughts were in confusion for some vague unacknowledged cause her first impulse had been one of relief she had expected a formal offer for her hand and she would scarcely admit even to herself that that expectation had been a dread yet to be ignored touched her pride keenly she stopped by her brothers chair  what then she asked am i the countess marie of reist to be flouted and passed over by a beggarly soldier whose life has been spent as an adventurer because the blood of the house of tyrnaus is in his veins and chance has brought him to the throne nicholas am i to look to you in vain to avenge this insult  the mans eyes flashed fire  be patient marie he answered ughtred of tyrnaus has lived in strange countries all his life and imbibed the hateful modernisms of the west let us wait for a little perhaps he does not understand perhaps the time would seem to him too short even for a royal wooing we will watch and wait meanwhile listen this is certain if ughtred of tyrnaus lives out his reign you and no other shall be his queen that at least i can answer for  she shrugged her shoulders  it may be she said that when he is ready he may find his opportunity gone the throne of theos will be no bed of roses in the meantime i at least shall not go to the palace  reist looked doubtful  it was arranged he reminded her that you should receive the wives of the ministers it is your right of birth  i renounce it then for the present she answered let him see how the fat old kolashin woman will look on his left hand  her brother watched her thoughtfully then he shrugged his shoulders  women are all alike he said to himself bitterly on his way to the palace she is in love with ughtred of tyrnaus she has drunk with him from the kings cup it is enough                                       baron domiloff  she rose to her feet perplexeda little annoyed it was a visit which she did not understand he came swiftly across the lawn to her unattended and unannounced  i do not understand she said as he bowed low before her my servants have no authority to send you here i am not receiving this afternoonand youyou surely should be at the palace  i offer my most profound apologies countess he said respectfully your servants are not at fault it was my persistence which prevailed  you have some message for me she asked doubtfully  none he answered i have come here on my own initiative you will permit me the honour of a few minutes interview as to my absence from the palace is that more likely to be remarked upon than yours countess  she waived the question  it is at least more surprising she answered do you wish your austrian friends to have it all their own way with the king  the countess of reists sympathies are i fear he murmured with my rival  my sympathies she answered are with neither of you you each seek aggrandizement at our expense i am a thetian and i believe that the less we have to do with foreigners the better but i do not see baron domiloff what profit there can be in a discussion of this sort between you and me i am still waiting for an explanation of your presence here which of my servants has proved faithless  none he answered i made my way here unknown to anybody i came countess to ask you a question  well  he did not immediately reply there was a good deal at stake and her manner was not encouraging in the end it came however  is it true what they are whispering in the citythat you have drunk with ughtred of tyrnaus from the kings cup  the countess rose from her seat with flashing eyes the russian stood his ground however respectful insistent having well calculated the effect of his words  what an infamythat you should dare to come here and ask me such a question if you will not leave me at once sir i myself must return to the house your presence here is an insult  domiloff stood in the centre of the path and his manner was the manner of a man who has something to say and will surely say it  countess he exclaimed i can claim no more with you it is true than the merest acquaintance but i beg of you to consider whether i have the reputation of doing foolish things or asking foolish questions you may not believe it but i have the good of your country at heart we in russia desire an independent theos when i see her therefore drifting gradually towards certain destruction i brave all things to save her  she regarded him steadfastly still angry but a trifle curious  explain yourself sirif any explanation is possible  countess he answered for the sake of your country answer my question  she hesitated her cheeks were flushed she drew herself up proudly  you are well served baron she said your spies it seems can penetrate even within the walls of the reist house yet the matter is no secret i have drunk with ughtred of tyrnaus from the kings cup  he inclined his head slowly  yes he said i was sure of it yet you have done well to tell me now i will tell you this ughtred of tyrnaus before he had been king an hour sent to london to summon here an american woman with whom he had beenon the best terms in london  she was thoughtful for a moment  you are sure of this  i am sure of it he answered  is she of noble birth  domiloff who had been in new york smiled faintly  she is an american he answered her father was a shopkeeper her grandfather a labourer he intends to marry her  that is impossible she answered curtly the people of theos would not permit it  when did a tyrnaus he asked ever consider the welfare or opinion of his subjects when the gratification of a caprice was concerned  she shrugged her shoulders  and why she asked do you bring this news to me  to give you an opportunity of saving your country he answered promptly see i will risk everythingi tell you the whole truth ughtred of tyrnaus is not acceptable to my master as king of theos we know the race too well they are not to be trustedthe integrity of the state is not safe in their hands there is only one man who is the heavendesigned ruler of theos  and he  it is your brother  now indeed she was interested a rush of colour warmed her cheeks the frigidity of her manner vanished as though by magic  i myself have told him so she exclaimed when the people rose against the republic they called for him it was the golden opportunity which he failed to seize  it will come again he assured her earnestly i give you my word that it will come again that shall be my care yours is to see that next time he is prepared  why do you not yourself speak to him she asked  he smiled  you know your brother the knowledge should answer that question he has sworn loyalty to ughtred of tyrnaus and for good or for evil he will keep his vow we must wait till the thing is inevitable  and i she murmured i too am a reist and he is my king  you are the first lady in theos he answered and you will not be content to bend your knee day by day before a plebeian i will prove to you that i am sincere if the king seeks your hand in marriage i will not raise a little finger against him but we will not support another tyrnaus in another reign of folly we will not recognize a king who places by his side upon the throne the daughter of tradespeople  it would be infamous she murmured  dear lady he said softly try to forget that i am a russian or that russia was ever your fancied enemy an independent theos is my policy it is your religion let us work hand in hand  the old distrust was hard to smother she gave him the tips of her fingers  you can speak with me again she said i make no promises i will watch     chapter xviii   ughtred with a deep sigh of relief sank into an easychair and mopped his forehead in most unkingly fashion he had escaped for a moment into the royal anteroom  nicholas he exclaimed if i am to be preserved for the service of the state order me a whiskyandsoda this is harder work than our ride from castle reist  reist touched the bell and smiled  it is not yet concluded he said i have many yet upon my list who have not been presented to your majesty there must be no heartburnings tonight we must make no enemies  ughtred sat up with a sudden sense of injury  nicholas he demanded where is your sister  reists face was imperturbable  my sister he said regretted exceedingly her inability to be present she will pay her respects to your majesty later  the king frowned his manner was impatient  it is now that i require her help he said the baroness is an utter impossibility her french is unrecognizable she remembers no one and the woman herself with her dyed hair and feathers is a caricature your sister must really make an effort reist she must come and help me out  i will see that your majestys wishes reist answered quietly are conveyed to her  the king eyed him keenly reist then was concealing something his sisters absence was not motiveless  on reflection he said i desire to emphasize my wishes your sisters absence is significant and might possibly be commented upon you will go yourself and fetch her nicholas say that i desire her immediate presence  your majesty reist protested my sister may have to make her toilette her immediate return with me will doubtless be impossible  the countess will use her own discretion as to the time she keeps me waiting ughtred answered coolly i have told you that i shall await your return  reist turned away with immovable face ughtred remained in the anteroom alone he lit a cigarette and took a pile of telegrams from the table by his side selecting the topmost he read it thoughtfully to himself       my best wishes to you and for the welfare of your kingdom      may my offering remain forever an ornament may peace and      happiness be the lot of your people and your ownsara van      decht  a coronation present with such a wish he said to himself must remain an enigma enter  an attendant withdrew the curtain  captain hartzan of the artillery desires a moments audience with your majesty the servant announced  the king nodded  let him be shown in  a young officer bowed low as he passed through the curtains  your majesty he announced a messenger has arrived at the barracks from the english firm of vickers son and maxim he is in charge of a whole battery of maxims and quickfiring pompoms and awaits instructions as to their delivery  i know nothing of them the king answered i understood that the firm you mention had declined the orders of the late government  it is true your majesty the officer answered and in consequence we have scarcely a modern gun at the barracks the battery which has arrived here was intended for the russian government but was purchased the person in charge informs me by a private individual for cash as a coronation present to your majesty  the king started  are you sure that there is no mistake he asked  none your majesty the officer answered the messenger is quite explicit it is a princely gift colonel dartnoff instructed me to make an immediate report to your majesty  ughtred for a moment was puzzled  i know of no one he said reflectively who could make such a present  the young officer hesitated  the artillery man in charge your majesty claims to have seen the donors cheque it was a draft upon rothschilds drawn by an american of the name of van decht  ughtred caught up the telegram by his side his eyes were suddenly bright he understood  you will inform the agent in charge he said that i will receive him tomorrow and arrange a date to inspect the battery  the young officer bowed respectfully and withdrew reist took his place the king eyed him sternly for at first it seemed to him that so prompt a return was significant  well sir  reist lifted the curtain marie stood there in court dress her long train held by pages in the reist livery her neck and arms ablaze with jewels a coronet of pearls upon her forehead she was a little pale and she carried herself with more than ordinary dignity the king rose and bowing low raised her hands to his lips  you are very welcome countess of reist he said although you are amongst the latest of those who have come to offer their good wishes  i have come she answered in obedience to your majestys commands  commands he smiled goodhumouredly it is very unkind of you he said to have thought of deserting me on such a day as this  my brother  oh nicholas is invaluable the king declared lightly he can tell me what to say to the men but it is in receiving the women i need your help  the baroness kolashin is as well acquainted with our countrywomen as i marie answered i did not doubt but that her aid would be sufficient  the baroness ughtred answered has done her best but another hour by her side would rob me of the few wits i have left i should like to know for what special sin i was committed to her charge  marie shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly but she did not smile  i am at your majestys service she said  ughtred was puzzled in what manner had he offended her  if my message seemed to you peremptory he said will you not ascribe it to my desire to taste the full measure of my powers i know nothing of the privileges of a king save what i have read in books but it seems to me that included amongst them must surely be the privilege of choosing ones companionsand ones friends  your majesty marie answered may find that a rash assumption it may lead to disappointment friends are scarcely to be made in a day or to order you must send for some of those whom you have left behind in england  he looked at her curious to know if anything lurked behind those words  mine has not been the sort of life he said quietly which leads to the making of friendships i have been a wanderer always and a lonely one i had hoped to fill the empty placeshere  there was a note of appeal in his tonedignified yet not in a sense without pathos he glanced at nicholas but he looked first at marie a faint touch of colour flushed her cheeks her manner was visibly softened  i trust that your majesty may not be disappointed she said and her eyes fell before his for the first time  a crash of music reminded them of those who still waited to bow before the king so they passed out into the great ballroom and mounting the dais marie stood on the kings left hand the room was a blaze of light of brilliant uniforms and beautiful dresses at ten oclock reist came up with a look of relief upon his face and a gleam of excitement in his eyes  the english minister and his wife your majesty he murmured it is excellent the others will follow  the news spread a little flutter of joy rippled through the room the coming of this dignified kindly old man with his grey hair and single decoration was the one thing needed theos had taken to herself a king asking leave of no one but the countenance of some at least of the powers was a vital thing at the informal coronation rushed through by reist and his friends not one of the ministers had been present domiloff with smooth face and with many lying regrets had presented an interdictory note from russia but owing to the peculiar conditions prevailing there had not been until after the coronation any properlyappointed person to receive it the late foreign minister had refused it with a smile and a polite word of regret and his example had been followed by every member of the royalist party there was they explained at the moment no government no officials no minister their various appointments were arranged for and would be confirmed immediately after the coronation until then they were only private persons so domiloff with a suave jest and a shrug of his shoulders shut himself up in his house while the cathedral bells clashed and the cannon roared from the walls  the english minister was followed in quick succession by the representatives of france and austria and with their coming a certain sense of restraint passed away from the brilliant assemblage before there had been a certain sense of unreality in the whole thing the tone of the rejoicings had been feverishwho could tell but that in a week this thing might not have passed away like a mirage now a heartier note altogether prevailed especially amongst the men there were no more side glances or shrugged shouldersthe volcano no longer trembled beneath their feet dancing commenced and the king stood up with marie of reist at supper she remained on his right hand many people spoke to reist of this  it is excellent duke declared old baron kolashin once commanderinchief of the army theos needs no outside alliance it means only entanglement that he inclined his head to where marie and the king were talking will send theos crazy with joy  reist shook his head  you anticipate my dear kolashin he answered our court circle is as you know small and maries rank entitles her to receive but this is only their second meeting i am sure that as yet no such idea has entered the kings head  kolashin twirled his fierce moustache and smiled knowingly  eh but my friend there is a report that they have drunk together from the kings cup how about that  it is true reist admitted but the king knows nothing of the history of the cup his offer was one of gallantryno more they were children together  the general chuckled  marie is a beautiful girl he said there is none like her in theos eh but if i were young again  he went off smiling to himself  reist was touched on the arm by brand  may i speak to you for a moment duke  by all means  there is still one of the foreign ministers absent besides domiloff  reist nodded  effenden pascha there is yet time however  effenden pascha is not coming brand said  reist eyed him sharply  how do you know that  i was at the palace gates brand answered when effenden pascha drove up he was on the point of entering when he was accosted by our friend domiloff  reists face grew black as night  the hound he murmured go on  they stayed talking for five minutes or more eventually they both reentered effenden paschas carriage and were driven off  the wolf and the dog reist cried fiercely let them beware how they bark at the gates of theos  he was white almost to the lips with anger brand watched him curiously  i do not believe that you people like the turks he remarked  reist turned upon him with a sudden violent gesture his voice was low but charged with passionate hate  like them to us they are as vermin a pest upon the face of the earth you wonder why i tell you that it is because we know them because their border villages are in touch with ours we know their life and the manner of it i could tell you things which you dare not put in print stories which if english people read in your paper they would brand you a liar so my friend brand believe this there is not a true thetian breathing who would not rather die himself and kill his wife and children than that the turks should enter theos pardon me  he moved away with a quick expressive gesture brand remained in his corner and presently the king with marie of reist upon his arm passed by they paused before him  come brand ughtred remarked why so thoughtful you must dance my friend  your majesty brand answered i was pondering upon the inequalities of life yesterday i was a king and a most uncomfortable position it was today you are kingandhe glanced at marieit is a trial to ones disposition to refrain from envy  marie detached her hand softly from the kings sleeve  so gallant a speech sir she said smiling must be rewarded you have not yet asked me to dance     chapter xix   it seems to me she said quietly that all men must be ambitious that the love of power must be a part of their very existence  in england he remarked we are more circumscribed our limits are more exact yet i suppose in our small way we all flutter our wings  i have a curiosity to understand things she said leaning back and fanning herself slowly help me to understand yourself  he smiled  do i puzzle you then  a littleyes  how  she looked at him reflectively out of her dark full eyes he looked into them once and turned awayhe scarcely knew why  you do not seem to me she said like a man who would be content with small things you outwitted domiloff himself yet you call yourself a writer and you are perhaps content  he shrugged his shoulders  why not there is excitement in it one travels everywhere meets strange types of people penetrates into unknown countries carries often ones life in ones hands oh its not a bad life  perhaps she answered i do not quite understand our newspapers in theos are different you then are content  again that curious searching gaze from the most beautiful eyes into which he had ever looked brand in whose life women had played a small part was unaccountably ill at ease his easy nonchalance of manner had deserted him content he looked for a moment into his future and was astonished to find in it a new emptiness she bent over towards him and at her touch a thrill went through his veins and set his heart beating to a new music  just now she murmured you told the kingthat you envied him was it true  for the moment he answered i think that it was  you then would like to be a king  he laughed and answered her with a forced lightness  i not i it would not suit me at all  what did you mean then she persisted  i think he said that i was a little lonely you see i know none of these people i am a stranger and i felt a little out of my element and thenthen he came by with you andwell i wished i were in his place  she laughed very softly  so far as i am concerned she murmured you very soon had your wish  it was very kind of you he said to take pity upon me  i think that i wanted to talk to you again she said i am tired of all these people tell me mr brand how long will you stay on in theos  i am not sure he answered perhaps a week perhaps a month it depends upon my paper they may recall me at any time  she frowned and stopped fanning herself  why do you go back she said abruptly why do you not stay in theos  there is no place here for me he answered i am a stranger  you say she continued that in your own country the limits of life are being drawn closer why do you not make for yourself a career in a country like this theos has need of such men as you  he shook his head  theos has her own sons to direct her future i am a stranger  so is the king  but he is a tyrnaus the people have chosen him for their king  you are his friend she said and to you i may not say very much but he is young and he may make mistakes he comes of a family who have done much evil here  brand was startled  i thought that you and your brother were his chief supporters he said people are saying too  her fan stopped brand hesitated  please to go on she said imperiously  it is not my affair he continued awkwardly i ought not to have alluded to it but they are speaking of the possibilities of a marriage between you and him  the slow waving of white feathers recommenced he felt that she was looking at him almost in spite of himself their eyes met he looked away with hot cheeks and burning eyes was this girl a trained coquette or  i do not think she said that you need consider that i do not think that i shall ever marry ughtred of tyrnaus  despite himself he spoke the thoughts which had filled his mind  you he said are ambitious have you no desire to be a queen  i love power she answered but i am a womanand i do not wish to marry ughtred of tyrnaus  brand told himself fiercely that he was a fool yet the music was suddenly sweeter his vague antipathy to the king had vanished into thin air the taste of life was sweeter between his teeth  you may think me mad he said but i amnot sorryto hear it  there was a short silence it was evident that if she thought him mad she was not displeased  some day she said presently i should like to talk to you of theos i believe that before long there will be great changes here a new order of things may comeand you are one of those whom theos may look to for help  i he repeated but indeed countess you are overrating me i am only a journalist i know nothing of statecraft  you are a strong man she answered and strong men are scarce promise me that you will not leave theos without letting me know  i am not likely to do that he said if ever i can help you or your country i would do it willingly but you will remember that i am the friend of ughtred of tyrnaus  you may have other friendsis it not so  the significance of her speech once more filled him with new emotionshalfdelightfulhalfuneasy a sudden passionate impulse came to him to seize the little white hand all ablaze with jewels which hung over the arm of her chair so near to his he mastered it with a stupendous effort they sat there in a silence which was to him almost ecstatic then nicholas of reist stood suddenly before them his black eyebrows contracted into a lowering frown  marie he said the king is asking for you  she shrugged her shoulders and rose without haste  i think she said that i have done my dutyand i am tired i should like to go home nicholas  you must make your adieux in any case he answered giving her his arm and ignoring brand no one is leaving yet and there is to be a display of fireworks in the grounds  she looked over her shoulder to brand with a parting smile  goodnight mr brand i have enjoyed my rest very much  he bowed low and remained for a moment alone in the palm house through the open windows came the sound of ascending rockets hissing through the still night airthe grounds were ablaze with lights he passed out and mingled with the crowd of people     chapter xx   illuminations fireworks and the thunder of saluting cannon closed the day the excited crowds dispersed slowly to their homes the national hymn ceased at last to echo through the squares and streets towards midnight domiloff who had left the palace early knocked at the door of a large white house in the place des √âstrangers and was at once admitted he passed into a hall furnished after the turkish style and into the presence of effenden pascha  the turk was still in the uniform and jewelled turban which he had donned for the reception at the palace he greeted domiloff eagerly they conversed in french  it is well that you have come the turk exclaimed tomorrow it will be known in constantinople that you and i alone of the foreign ministers failed to attend the reception of the new king how am i to explain this domiloff  domiloff nodded and lit a cigarette  listen effenden pascha he said quietly i have within the last few minutes received a message from st petersburg ordering me to recognize on behalf of russia ughtred of tyrnaus it does not suit my country just at present to be at variance with the other powers accordingly i must present myself at the palace tomorrow you however are outside the concert now listen i speak truth do i not when i say that the ancient enmity between your country and theos is still a live thingthat but for the powers your soldiers would long ago have pillaged theos and sacked the city  it is true effenden pascha admitted what then  the accession of ughtred of tyrnaus is not approved of by my master as i have explained we cannot move ourselves for the time is not yet ripe for a european war this however we can undertake if your master should refuse to recognize the new sovereign of theos and should think the time ripe for an effort to regain what was once a part of the ottoman empire there shall be no interference russia will not interfere and russia will see that no other power does you follow me  perfectly effenden pascha answered quietly and afterwards  the afterwards domiloff remarked with a shrug of the shoulders is of your own making  the turk shook his head slowly  domiloff he said so far all is well but your price your master serves no one without a price wherein is to come your advantage  we have none to gain domiloff answered simply we object to a tyrnaus once more upon the throne of theos  the turk moved towards the door  there is still time he said i go to pay my respects to king ughtred  you are too late domiloff cried  not so the turk answered pointing through the trees the palace is still a blaze of light  domiloff swore softly between his teeth  do not be so hasty my friend he exclaimed  my country effenden pasha answered is too often the tool of yours we are to do the work and at the last momentthe bears paw we are to conquer theos for russia  you are entirely wrong domiloff declared earnestly the eventual possession of the country may become a matter of private treaty between your court and mine but i will give you the word of the czar that if for any reason we should desire to occupy it you shall have a quid pro quo you shall have a free hand in asia minor and a loan  you will give me pledges of this nature in writing effenden pascha asked  certainly  the turk walked to the window with a smile  allah he exclaimed it will be good to hear once more the guns roar in the balkans we turks domiloff are a nation of soldiers and these long intervals of peace are ill for us  outside there was a sudden tramp of feet into the square filed a company of soldiers they halted in front of the house the two men exchanged rapid glances  what is this the turk asked quickly  heaven knows domiloff answered listen  a thunderous summons at the door voices in the hall an officer in the uniform of the thetian guards entered bearing a letter  to monsieur domiloff he announced saluting  domiloff opened it without a word as he read he grew pale to the lips       siri have the honour to enclose your passport and safe      conduct to the frontier of theos i have informed the czar      your imperial master of the circumstances which render your      further presence in my dominions displeasing to me            signed         ughtred of tyrnaus                                rex  domiloff crushed the letter in his fingers  well sir he said to the officer in the morning i will seek an audience of his majesty  i regret sir the officer answered that my orders allow me no latitude whatever a special train is waiting and my instructions are to escort you to the frontier  domiloff drew the turk on one side  listen he said this is a bold stroke i half expected it ughtred of tyrnaus has courage at least i go straight to st petersburg i will give pledges of what i have promised to your minister there  effenden pascha bowed he was most uncomfortable but there was a certain pleasure in witnessing the discomfiture of the wily russian  i shall await your news he answered  domiloff and his escort departed effenden pascha at once undressed sent for his physician and sought his bed before morning theos knew of the sudden attack of malignant fever which had most unfortunately laid hold of him at the moment of starting to attend the reception at the palace     chapter xxi   ughtred slackened his reins about his horses neck and turning round called to brand who was sitting a few yards away making some rapid sketches the kings cheeks were flushed with colour and his eyes were bright  what do you think of that brand he asked proudly  he pointed to where a cloud of dust hung round the last company of galloping thetians the roll of the drums and the shrill music of the fifes still reached them  they are born horsemen and born soldiers your majesty brand answered with enthusiasm i only wish that there were more of them  ughtred smiled  the mountains are our chief protection he said with a little wave of his arm the passes through which men could be poured into theos are narrow and for defensive purposes a small perfectlytrained army is sometimes as useful as a large one i am proud of my army brand  you have reason brand answered i am even now trying to make europe understand what manner of men these are  general dartnoff came galloping up  if your majesty will ride now to pinters pass he said you will be able to trace the progress of the attack  the king and brand rode off together followed by his small bodyguard  your people have said nothing yet about recalling you ughtred asked  nothing brand answered i think that theos is still being watched with interest  and you yourself  brand looked straight ahead  i am content here he answered i shall be sorry to leave  there was the thunder of hoofs on the turf a short distance away and marie of reist in a white ridinghabit and the military cap of the thetian guards galloped past her lithe superb figure was at its bestshe managed her charger with the easy confidence of a born horsewoman ughtred eyed her thoughtfully  there are not many women like thateven in england brand he remarked  your majesty is quite right brand answered the countess of reist is the most beautiful woman whom i have ever seen  ughtred smiled and looked down into the valley they reined in their horses upon a small knoll  i think that i know one who is more beautiful the king said in an undertone i heard this morning from our friends the van dechts brand they are travelling in italy and may come on here  brand shrugged his shoulders  your majesty will find their presence welcome he asked  the king looked at him in surprise  surely they are friends of mine it would give me great pleasure to have them here why not  brand hesitated  i wondered he said slowly if they might not find their presence here a little equivocal your majesty is no longer a private individual and mr and miss van decht however agreeable in themselves are not of the rank which entitles them to a familiar footing at your court  ughtred looked at his companion in some surprise  that speech he remarked might have come from nicholas of reistfrom you my friend it sounds strangely  i admit it brand answered for myself it is true that i am a democrat but then i am only a journalist i have noticed that the few nobles who remain in theos are aristocrats to the backbone i believe that you find their principles absolutely rockbound  the king frowned his eyes had rested upon marie of reist sitting upright in her saddle and watching eagerly for the development of the sham fight  well well he said we shall see i wish to see the van dechts here and it is useless to meet trouble halfway be so good brand as to convey my regards to the countess of reist and suggest that she join us our position is better chosen than hers  brand cantered over to her side and repeated the message she rode with him towards the king  you have been much occupied lately perhaps she said to brand my brother tells me that you have been invisible  i have been busy he answered perhaps because of my small share in events here i have become wonderfully interested in theos i have been making excursions in all directions i want to understand many things which are hard for a stranger to form a right idea of  she smiled  then why do you not come to me she said i can tell you very much about theos i can tell you about the country people and how they live did i not ask you to come mr brand you are very ungallant  he met a glance from her dark eyes and his pale cheeks were suddenly flushed  you were good enough to say that you would receive me he answered if i may come then i will  my brother has shown me in the english papers some of the things which you have written about theos she continued i cannot tell you what pleasure they gave me it is a wonderful gift yours mr brand when one reads one seems to see a picture of the whole place you have written wonderfully of your adventures here  and yet he said in a low tone the adventure here which was most interesting to me which i shall never forget so long as i live i have not written about at all it is for the memory only  again their eyes met he was very bold this englishman yet though her eyebrows were slightly raised she did not rebuke him  i think perhaps she said that we had better obey the royal command  she touched her horse with the whip and they galloped up the hillside ughtred watched them closely as they rode up he made room for marie by his side brand had perforce to fall behind they talked together eagerly of the manoeuvres the girl was thoroughly well versed in the situation  i believe from the south she said that theos is unassailable if only we had more heavy guns for the passes  you have seen the new battery ughtred asked  she nodded  yes the maxims are wonderful  i am expecting he said that the donor will be paying us a visit here soon  she looked up inquiringly  an american was it not  an american and his daughter mr and miss van decht if they come i hope that i may count upon you countess to help me make their visit an enjoyable one  i will do all that i can she answered coldly i have never met any americans they must be wonderful people in england they are intermarrying is it not so with the aristocracy  there have been many such marriages ughtred assented  it is the worst of england she murmured a great nation but indeed a nation of shopkeepers amongst the nobles the pride of race seems to have died out the fear of poverty is to them as the fear of death ah see  through the pass below was a sudden movement little puffs of smoke burst out all over the hillside general dartnoff and his staff came galloping up  your majesty he said saluting i shall ask for your congratulations on behalf of colonel bushnieff the attacking force have been entrapped into the pass and are now subject to a terrible crossfire bushnieffs guns are so placed that every one of them is effectual i go to give the award the defending force have easily triumphed  i will come with you the king answered  brand drew back to let them pass marie also lingered in a moment they were alone he turned to her  you are coming he asked  i think not i am tired my servants are below i shall return to theos  brand hesitated  my horse is lame he remarked  i do not wonder at it she answered you have been galloping about without choosing your way  i too am tired he continued thoughtfully  her lips parted  i shall be glad of your escort mr brand  they rode slowly across the open country in the waning day before them on the hilltop were the grey towers and the piledup houses of theos a picturesque medley with their red roofs and white fronts now fast becoming blurred in the gathering twilight as they neared the road a sudden waft of perfume from the lavenderfields beyond filled the air and a breath of wind came sweeping through the yellow cornfields brand with his hat in his hand looked thoughtfully about him  i think he said that no man could be born here who would not die for such a country as this i believe that i am beginning to understand what patriotism might be  her face lit up in a moment  it is beautiful she said to hear you say that i wish mr brand she added softly that it were your country too then we should be sure of one good patriot  i think he said that if trouble came to theos i should be proud to reckon myself amongst her sons i have never seen country people like yours i have ridden into the furthest parts and wherever i have seen men and women i have heard singing i have been greeted like a friend i have been offered bread and wine before i could even dismount how they toil too no wonder the soil is fruitful  oh it is good to hear you talk like this she cried with a sudden little burst of passion the love of my country is in my bloodit is part of me i could not live if theos were dishonoured and lately there have been so many sorrows i seem to have found myself listening and over the land there has been silence no longer the whistling of the men and the singing of women it has been as though something terrible has always been about to happen it is a fancy of course nicholas laughs at me it is foolish but the love of theos is more to me than the love of life i fear for her when for myself i have no fear tell me mr brand this seems strange talk to you  i know theos and i know you he answered i understand  she did not speak again for some time but he saw that her eyes were full of tears and he kept his face turned from her when at last they passed into the city she spoke to him softly  i am indeed very foolish she said but just now i am anxious theos seems to have made for herself new enemies the coming of ughtred of tyrnaus has provoked russia and it is the one country which i fear most you will come and see me soon mr brand  he bowed over the hand which she held halfshyly out it was not a form of greeting in which she often indulged  i will surely come he answered  he left her at the reist house and rode slowly towards his own quarters already the streets were lined with people awaiting the return of the king and the troops torches were waved hither and thither in the open space in front of the palace a huge bonfire had been lit everywhere was the pleasant murmur of cheerful voices further down the street they were singing in a low rhythmical chant the national anthem now the king was in sight and a roar of voices welcomed him the front of the palace blazed out in a fire of illuminations a shower of rockets shrieked upwards from the park the king was coming long live the king     chapter xxii   sara van decht leaned back in her basketchair and looked across the cobbled street across the trim square where the miniature fountain was playing to where a cluster of redroofed whitefronted houses were huddled together in picturesque confusion  well i think its delightful she exclaimed i never could have imagined anything so picturesqueor so restful  mr van decht scratched his chin thoughtfully and selected a cigar from his case  it is restful he admitted i cant say that im quite accustomed to taking my meals upon the pavement even under an awning and there is an odour of garlic about the hotel which i dont altogether relish i grant you that it is restful though theres no denying that  the girl laughed softly  poor old dad she exclaimed i guess its selfish of me to drag you all across europe to this little bit of a country but i couldnt help it a bit i positively must see ughtred with a crown on his head and a sceptre in his hand before we go back its too delicious now i wonder how we ought to let him know that we are here  telephone  she laughed againlaughed till the tears stood in her eyes  father you must try to be more medi√¶val she exclaimed fancy ringing up a king  send a boy round with a note then he suggested or shall i stroll round to the palace and let them know id just as soon its only a few minutes walk  i will write she decided but there is no hurry we will go out for a walk presently and look at these dear quaint little shops there are heaps of things i want to buy  mr van decht rose suddenly from his chair  jehosophat he cried whats that  it was a horsecar oldfashioned rickety with canvas awnings drawn wearily along by an aged horse mr van decht eyed it with vast curiosity  jehosophat he repeated id like to take that whole affair right back with us and sell it to the first dime museum thatd give the price look at the bonnet on the horses head sara and the bell my how she bumps i must have a talk with your king sara my numberthree installation is what is wanted here with overhead wires and forty cambridge wagons with cheap labour and water transport i guess it would be a light contract im going to board the next that comes along sara and get the thing into my head  the streets look very narrow and hilly for cars father  guess the whole place wants straightening out a bit mr van decht admitted if your king wants to make this place go sara hes got to imbibe a few western notions and the sooner the better  you shall talk to him sara remarked with a little smile at the corner of her lips i am sure that he will be interested  i guess i can give him some ideas mr van decht remarked puffing vigorously at his cigar youd better write that note sara  in a moment father its so fascinating to watch these country people with their baskets look there is something you cant beat in new york anyhow  up the steep narrow road came a company of horsesoldiersa gay sightin flashing helmets plumes and the soft blue uniform of the thetian guards a band up at the palace played them in the people rushed to the right and to the left lined the pavements and shouted a greeting then suddenly every head was uncovered and a little respectful murmur rippled through the crowd  the king long live the king  sara rose eagerly from her place at the table they were virtually upon the pavementa little extended near the hotel and dotted about with tiny round tables it was ughtred who rode at the head of the little troop of soldiers and suddenly their eyes met a sharp word of command broke from his lips he dismounted and crossed the street towards them drawing off his heavy white gloves as he came  welcome he cried welcome to theos  he took saras hands in his and held them tightly  this he said is charming of you one moment  he beckoned to the officer who had been riding by his side and gave a few brief orders the troop passed on reist and a younger man in dark ridingclothes remained  if you will allow me ughtred said i will take a cup of coffee with you there is a garden here i believe  the hotel proprietor came hurrying out reist explained what was required they made their way into a semipublic garden which was instantly cleared of chance loiterers a table was set in a shady corner  mr van decht ughtred said i must shake hands with you you are most welcome i appreciate your coming here immensely  my daughter mr van decht explained has been set upon this trip ever since your friend brand began his letters upon theos in the daily courier they have been very widely read sir we must congratulate you upon having taken hold of your kingdom so firmly  you are very good ughtred answered brand has been a godsend to us the position here has been fairly represented to england and in fact europe through his reports he too will be delighted to see you again miss van decht you must allow me to present captain hartzan of the artillerythe duke of reist you already know now when did you arrive  last night sara answered that dear little train of yours brought us from the frontier we scarcely expected to see you so soon  it is my great goodfortune ughtred answered i go every morning to the fortifications to direct the artillery practice the van decht battery has been in action this morning he added smiling  i presume sir that this is a warlike country mr van decht remarked  a shadow crept over the kings face  it is not our choice he answered we are surrounded by dangerous enemies and we are a very small nation our security depends solely upon our readiness to resist attack for these last two months i have had to forget that i am a king and remember only that i am commanderinchief of our little army  i presume that you are not anticipating any immediate trouble sir mr van decht asked  the king glanced round already he was learning the lesson of caution  the history of theos he said is doubtless unknown to you turkey is our old and historic enemy and her attitude towards us just now is to say the least of it threatening we trust to our inoffensiveness and the goodwill of the powers to preserve our independence but we judge it best to be prepared so far as possible to fight our own battles well crasten what are you bringing us  the hotel proprietor bowed low and filled some finelycut glasses with liqueur from a dusty and carefully cradled bottle  the fin champagne your majesty was brought from the cellars of louis philippe by my father i trust your majesty will approve  ughtred sipped it and did approve he accepted some coffee also and broke a roll in his fingers  this is my longest fast he explained laughing we ride out at six to escape the heat part of my afternoon i spend at the barracks and part at the house of laws  it appears to me sir that you find pretty considerable to do mr van decht remarked id an idea that royalty had an easier time of it  a good many people share that idea mr van decht ughtred answered goodhumouredly for myself i never worked half so hard in all my life but then it is work i love and for my country which is very dear to me some day i hope when things are more settled to be able to drop the military part of my labours and give all my attention to the development of my country  mr van decht nodded he was greatly enjoying the fin champagne  youre right there sir he declared make a nation strong commercially and shell hold her own in time against the world i guess youre a travelled man sir and you wont mind a stranger remarking that in some ways youre a little behind the times here  saras eyes twinkled with amusement the young officer who understood a little english glanced at reist and was speechless  you mustnt mind father sara exclaimed you know hes a terrible democrat and utilitarian to the backbone hes dying to introduce electric cars here and electric light  why you want them bad enough her father admitted i dont suppose weve a town of half the size in the states where we havent both and this a capital city too  mr van decht is quite right ughtred said gravely only one has always to remember that this is a very poor country and we cant afford to pay for luxuries  i guess those cars would pay for themselves before long sir mr van decht declared  it is very likely ughtred answered im sure that if any capitalist were disposed to undertake the commercial part of it there would be very little difficulty about the concession  mr van decht rose up briskly  if youll excuse me sir he said i guess ill hail that bobby hutch and go the round  the king laughed  you are a man of business mr van decht he said certainly go and help yourself to all the information you can sara if you will come up with me i will show you the palace i am afraid there is nothing there to interest your father but he will have many opportunities of seeing it reist will you see if the carriage has come  for a moment they were alone  they looked into one anothers eyes and sara laughed softly  why this is just the queerest thing in the world she murmured what will happen to me at the palace if i forget to say your majesty and ought i to curtsey when i speak to you  ughtred smiled back at her  i believe he said that you ought to kissmy hand  then i guess i wont she answered i believe im democrat enough to expect  what  he leaned over towards her but the sentence was never finished reist stood before them and the look on his face was a forecast of coming trouble  the carriage is here your majesty he announced  illustration i believe he said that you ought to kissmy hand     chapter xxiii   what do i think of theos sara repeated i think it must be the lost paradise of the lotuseaters it does not seem possible for anything ever to happen here  ughtred laughed  we share the primitive passions with the rest of mankind he assured her we know what it is to be excited even to be rowdy the wear and tear of life perhaps touches us more lightly than in your western cities you see we are a rural people  miss van decht reist remarked dryly misses perhaps the clang of the electric cars and the factory sirens  it is the proverbial peace of the city amongst the mountains ughtred said yet if you listen you can hear the murmur of voices in the caf√©s and there is a band playing in the square  it is alldelightful sara declared only i wonder that you find it possible to take life seriously here  they were sitting out on the great stone balcony behind the palaceughtred reist and marie mr van decht and sara a servant in spotless white livery had silently arranged coffee and liqueur in strangelooking bottles upon a table already laden with fruit below them were the terraced lawns leading to the river dotted with dark firtrees and flowering shrubsbeyond the red roofs and white fronts of many villas in the distance the blue mountains the king and sara van decht were sitting side by side marie unusually taciturn leaned back in her chair listening and watching with halfclosed eyes  ughtred lit a fresh cigarette and smoked for a moment thoughtfully  i can assure you he said that life is in its way as complex a thing here as in the greater cities the people are very poor and how to raise money enough to develop the country and pay our way without undue taxation is a very serious problem indeed then you must not forget that we live always in the shadow of a great danger  sara looked at him inquiringly he pointed southwards to the mountains  beyond there he said is turkey and turkey is our eternal enemy even now there are strained relations between us night and day our watchmen guard the passes there have been rumours lately of an impending raid upon our frontier villages  sara listened with rapt attention  how fascinating it really sounds quite medi√¶val  we are medi√¶val in more ways than one he continued our standing army consists of barely one thousand men but in case of war the whole of our male population would take up arms every man must fight himself for his home and his native land if you can spare the time here we will go to some of the more distant villages and you will see the saturday drill i am rather proud of my military system  she looked across at her father  he is so restless she said i can never tell how long he will stand any one place just at present he talks as though he were disposed to settle down here for the rest of his life  marie leaned forward her face gleamed pale in the twilight her tone was almost openly contemptuous  away from the electric cars and sirens and all the delights of your western cities  sara nodded gravely  yes away even from the paris edition of the new york herald but then my father you know is terribly mercenary i believe he thinks that there is scope for the capitalist here  your father is quite right then ughtred answered smiling try and persuade him to give the place a trial it is supposed you know to be the healthiest spot in europe  why im in no hurry to leave and thats a fact mr van decht admitted ive an appointment with the manager of your cars here tomorrow and if we do business i guess ill have to stop  sara laughed softly  thats just like father she exclaimed wherever he goes and finds horsecars he wants to either buy the company out or put in his own system of electric cars im afraid you think were very commercial dont you countess  oh no marie answered coldly one rather expects that you know from your nation it is very interesting i must confess though that i do not wish to see electric cars in the streets of theos  and why not young lady mr van decht inquired  because i love my old city too well to wish to see her modernized and made hideous marie answered it is scarcely a feeling with which one could expect strangers to sympathize but there are many others besides myself who would feel the same way  mr van decht nodded  is that so well nowadays the countries who place the picturesque before the useful are very few and far between i guess its as well for the community at large that it is so you would scarcely call that brokendown old omnibus dragged along by a lame mule a credit to theos or a particularly picturesque survival  marie shrugged her shoulders and dismissed the subject with a little gesture of contempt mr van decht waited for a minute and then as she remained silent continued  a country which neglects the laws of progress is not a country which can ever hope for prosperity dont you agree with me sir he asked the king  ughtred nodded  i am afraid that i do he admitted theos with its vineyards and handploughs its simple hillfolk and its quaint village towns is from an artistic point of view delightful yet i am bound to admit that for the sake of its children and the unborn generations i would rather see factory chimneys in its valleys and mine shafts in the hills the people are poor and so long as we have to import everything we use and wear we must get poorer and poorer the country is productive enough we have minerals and a wonderful soil what we need is capital and enterprise  marie shuddered  and you are a tyrnaus she murmured with a sidelong glance of reproach  it is my fortune he said good or bad to know more of the world outside than those who came before me please god i am going to leave theos a richer and happier country when my days here are spent if we are spared from war i shall do it  in future marie said i shall dread war less i begin to see that there are other evil things  she rose and bowed slightly to the king  your majesty will excuse me she said i find the air a little cold  she passed down the terrace steps her maid a few yards behind a certain reserve fell upon the others  i am afraid sara said to nicholas of reist that your sister does not approve of me  he hesitated  marie he said is passionately faithful to all the traditions of our family and our race this is a conservative country and no one more so than she i myself am in close sympathy with her yet my reason tells me that we are both wrong our peasantry are finding already the struggle for existence a severe onea single failure in the crops would mean a famine it has occurred to me mr van decht that the advice of a man of affairs such as yourself may be very useful to us  ughtred rose up  you shall talk progress together he said while i show miss van decht my pictures                                       marie held the note in her fingers looking at it doubtfully it was addressed to her thrust secretly into her maids hand by a stranger in the crush outside the palace gates at least that was the girls story she tore it open       you are a patriot the sister of nicholas of reist and the      kings friend by you he may be warned the american woman      who with her father has come to theos was betrothed to him      in london she has come to claim her position the people of      theos will never accept as their queen a woman of humble      birth the child of tradespeople let the king be warned  she tore the note into a thousand pieces and walked restlessly up and down the great room her eyes were lit with fire and a scarlet spot burned in her cheeks  oh if he should dare she murmured if he should dare  she stopped abruptly before the picture of rudolph the flickering light of fifty wax candles from the huge silver candelabra on the oaken table lit up the dull canvas it was ughtred himself who looked down at her  queen of theos she murmured why not we have drunk together from the kings cup  countess  she turned quickly round brand had come silently into the room     chapter xxiv   you  her surprised interjection recalled to him for the first time the hour and the strangeness of his visit yet he attempted little in the way of excuse  i may stay five minutes he begged you are alone  it is very late she murmured  he pointed out of the great window at the far end of the room  your brother is attending the king if he should returnwell mine is no idle errand i can justify my coming even at this hour  then she noticed that he was not dressed for the evening that he was pale and that there was trouble in his eyes she led him into a smaller room pushed open a window and beckoned him to follow her down the worn grey steps into the gardens  this is my favourite corner she said beyond are the flower gardens and the air here at night is always sweet you shall sit with me my friend and you shall tell me what it is that brings you with this look of trouble in your face  his eyes remained fixed upon her with a sudden passionate wistfulness she was very sweet and gracious and her slow speech seemed to him more musical than ever so he sat by her side and a little sea of white satin and lace and soft draperies covered up all the space between them for it had been a state dinner at the palace and he found speech very difficult  now this is restful and very pleasant she said after a long pause but you must tell me why you have come it was not by chanceto see me but no you spoke also of my brother  her eyes sought hisa spice of coquetry in their questioning gleam but the cloud lingered upon his face  i would not have dared to come at such an hour he said if my visit were an ordinary one  how very unenterprising she murmured i am sure that this is much the pleasantest time of the day  countess he said slowly is baron domiloff a friend of yours  of mine but no why do you ask such a question  he has been banished from theos did you know that he was hiding still in the city  she shook her head slowly  i know nothing she answered how strange that you should ask me  is it not true then he continued that you and he and your brother are plotting against the king  she regarded him with uplifted eyebrows then she patted him gently on the arm with her fan  it is the moon my friend she declared a little brief frenzy is it not  his tone recovered confidence he breathed a sigh of relief  the man lied to me he declared now i will tell you just what has happened to me you know that i have a room in the theba place well tonight as i was about to prepare for dinner a messenger a native thetian he seemed to me brought a note to my rooms it was neither signed nor addressed but it bade me follow the bearer without question if i would be of service to theos  you went she asked  of course he answered quickly if the summons was genuine well and goodif it was false i still wanted to know the meaning of it  and which was it she asked  genuine enough he answered gravely i was led into a quarter of theos where i have never been before and which i am sure i could not find again we arrived at a little caf√©i do not know the nameit was somewhere outside the walls a man was waiting for me in a back room he was disguised but i recognized him at once it was domiloff  she started instinctively he felt that she was deeply interested  at first i thought that it was a trapthat domiloff was preparing some revenge for my personation of the king soon however i learnt that his intention was a different one he is concerned in a plot to dethrone the king and he proposed that i should throw in my lot with his party  did he tell you then that nicholas and i were concerned in it  no from his point of view your cooperation as yet was unnecessary yet the whole thing is concerned with you and your brother for domiloff has named him as the future ruler of theos he offered to give me positive evidence that russia has decided to remove ughtred from the throne that theos itself is in deadly peril  there is one thing she said which i do not quite understand why did domiloff send for you you are not a soldier nor are you wellknown to the thetians  it is very simple he answered today the press has an immense influence upon public opinion in england and all the western countries i am writing for my paper in england a series of articles upon theos and i am writing from a point of view friendly to ughtred of tyrnaus domiloff wants these articles stopped he professes to need my active help what he really desires is that i write no more or alter the tone of my letters  her satin slipper traced a mystic pattern upon the smooth green turf  these are two things she said which i do not understand the baron domiloff has repute as a cunning and very shrewd diplomatist did he ask you for no pledge that you would not speak of these things to the king  brand shook his head  it would have been useless he answered i think that he knew quite well that i should give no such pledge that is what makes me believe that the matter is serious he is so sure of coming events that failing my joining with him he expressed himself as indifferent as to what my course of action might be there was only one condition he made before i leftand that one i agreed to  she looked at him inquiringly  it was that i should come to youbefore i went to the king  their eyes met in that single luminous moment he learned that these things came at least as no surprise to her he seemed even to divine something of that desire which had eaten its way into her heart  to me she murmured well  countess he said gravely for myself there is but one course of action possible i came here as the friend of ughtred of tyrnaus i am bound to his cause by every tie of honour as well as my own sympathies before the morning i shall have told him all that i have told you  her fan fluttered idly in her fingers she remained silent but he had a fancy that a shadow had fallen between them  domiloff sent me to you he continued what does that mean  she shook her head  the ways of baron domiloff she said are not easy to understand  are you and your brother concerned in thisplot he asked gravely  my brother she said would i believe shoot you if you asked him such a question it is only a few months ago that he himself brought ughtred of tyrnaus here nicholas has too little ambition he is a patriot pure and simple  and youyourself he asked  i have had no dealings with baron domiloff she answered but i think that he knows my views i do not love the family of tyrnaus and i do not think that ughtred had any claim to the throne of theos his father and grandfather misgoverned the country and estranged all the nobility who were the backbone of the state we alone are left and if ughtred should marry the daughter of this american tradesman we too must become exiles  but you would not stoop he murmured to plot against the king  it is not necessary she answered i believe that what you have been told is true i believe that russia will not tolerate ughtred of tyrnaus my friend she added in a softer tone why do you concern yourself in these things leave domiloff alone and believe me your warning to the king would be wasted stay here and watch for the things which may happen do you remember what we talked about that night at the palace the times are comingwait and your opportunity may also show itself who knows that your own future may not become linked with the future of theos  she leaned over towards him her hand fell upon his shoulder and its touch though light was like a caress then brand understood that this was temptation for his whole being quivered with the delight of her softened tone and the unspoken things which trembled there and shone from her eyes in truth she too was thinking of the moment when she had believed him to be the king  dear lady he said almost pleadingly i would be content to live all my days in theos if  he hesitated a wonderful smile curved her lips and her eyes were full of invitation yet he hesitated  for a brave man she murmured you are veryvery fainthearted  whereupon he took her into his arms and kissed her     chapter xxv   it chanced that a brilliant autumn brought a season of great prosperity to the thetian winegrowers and farmers and the year of ughtreds accession to the throne seemed likely to be marked with a white stone in their annals never had a ruler been more popular with all classes his military system while it made no undue demands upon the people provoked the admiration of europe and several important and successful industrial undertakings were due entirely to his instigation mr van decht fascinated by the climate the primitive but delightful life and a firm believer in the possibilities of the country still lingered in the capital and already the results of his large investments were beginning to be felt only a few people knew of the hidden danger which was ever brooding over the landa danger which ughtred had realized from the first and which from the first he had set himself steadfastly to avert a soldier himself he knew something of the horrors of war nothing seemed to him more awful than the vision of this beautiful country blackened and devastated her cornfields soaked with blood her pleasant pastoral life swept away in the grim struggle against an only partiallycivilized enemy he set himself passionately to work to strive for peace  reist came to him one evening straight from the house of laws with a suggestion  your majesty he said the people are asking for a queen  ughtred laughed  im sorry i cant oblige them offhand he answered  has your majesty never thought of an alliance through marriage with one of the powers not a direct alliance perhaps but one which might be useful to us if the worst should come  ughtred shook his head  a dream my friend he answered there is only one country in the world who could help us and i fear an english princess would be beyond our wildest dreams friendship with russia is more to be dreaded than her open enmity france has no royal family and is bound up with russia germany and austria are tied  your marriage has been spoken of sire reist said slowly i have promised to convey to the house your views a queen would be very popular  i am not prepared at present to make any announcement upon the subject ughtred answered  i should not hesitate at any sacrifice which the safety or benefit of theos seemed to require at present there is no question of anything of the sort  reist bowed and abandoned the subject but late that night he sought his sister she was sitting on the stone balcony which led from her own suite of rooms her elbow upon the worn balustrade her clear beautiful face clouded with thought for the first time nicholas noticed a change in her she was thinner and there were dark lines under her eyes a vague trouble was in her eyes  marie he said you have not been to the palace lately  no  tell me why  she turned slowly towards him  need you ask i hate that american girl she is always there she monopolizes everything i wish to heaven that she would go away  reist came a little closer his voice dropped  has he spoken  you know that he has not  the face of the man was stern and greyeven as the face of one musing upon evil things  tonight he said i gave him every opportunity by all ancient laws and customs he is your betrothedand he knows it yet he persists in this uncompromising silence the difficulty remains only with himself  she drew nearer to him  it is an insult to our house she murmured i am glad that you have spoken to me of this nicholas it is unbearable  you are right he admitted you have been patient marie and so have i the time has come to end it  she laid her slender fingers upon his arm slenderer than ever they seemed to him now and unbejewelled save for one great emerald set in dull gold which burned upon her fourth finger  what can you do nicholas you know the meaning of it all it is the coming of sara van decht  he nodded thoughtfully  i myself he said have watchedand seen but marie the daughter of a tradesman though he were rich enough to buy a kingdom can never sit upon the throne of theos  he is masterful she said and i think that he cares for her he will have his own way  reist was wearing his uniform for there had been a reception at the austrian ministers as though by accident he touched the hilt of his sword  our honour is engaged marie he said you may safely leave all in my hands  he is your king she reminded him with a sidelong glance as though anxious to watch the effect of her words  and i he answered hotly am nicholas duke of reist since when marie have the men of tyrnaus reached a pinnacle when the reists could not address them as equals our quarterings are more numerous our house is more ancient than theirs ughtred of tyrnaus must answer to me as would any other gentleman of his rank if the time should come when our honour demands it  those are brave words my brother she said  you do not doubt me marie  she shook her head  i do not doubt you nicholas only  well  there was a time when the throne was yours when the people would have shouted you king you let it go by you pointed there tell me nicholas is it forever this waiting  her forefinger was raised to that carved motto nicholas remained for a moment lost in thought  marie he said presently i will tell you the truth i did not give ughtred of tyrnaus credit for such gifts as he has shown i wanted the principle of monarchy reestablished and it was best to revert to the royal house then i found that he was a better man than i had thought and an alliance with you would have reconciled me to his reign nowi must admiti am doubtful  she remained for a moment lost in thought had the time come when she might speak he detested domiloff and all his waysat heart too the good of theos was far dearer to him than any personal ambition  nicholas you say that you are doubtful i have a feeling that before long the king will announce his intention of marrying sara van decht will you remain even then his faithful servant  the scorn in her tone first stung then moved him to wonder  you do not love the king marie he exclaimed  love him nicholas it is better that there should be now a clear understanding of things between us i am a countess of reist and i have been slighted by an adventurera man who but for you would even now have been living in poverty in a foreign land i would not marry him though he begged me with tears in his eyes to save his throne to save his life  he walked restlessly up and down his own pride had been wounded bitterly marie was right  i am willing she continued to endure this affront if it seems to you that your duty to theos still bids you hold by the king but there is one thing to which i will not submit i will not bow the knee to this american girl if he should make her queen nor in that case will i suffer you nicholas to remain the kings counsellor  nor will i he answered  promise me one thing more my brother she begged if again we should hear that cry ringing through the squares promise me that you will not fail them we have had enough of strangers in theos it is those who have lived here all their lives to whom every stone of the place is dear who should control her destinies  i am the faithful servant of ughtred of tyrnaus he answered slowly while he serves the state wisely and well but if that should come to pass which we have spoken of the evil must fall upon his own head listen  there was some commotion without a servant threw open the door  his majesty the king     chapter xxvi   the king followed hard upon the footsteps of his seneschal and neither reist nor marie was wholly at ease in the first moments of greeting it was the latter to whom the king addressed himself  my visit countess he said is to you i am fortunate in finding you at home  your majesty is very kind marie answered  i have come he continued to demand an explanation from youor rather to beg for it you have been absent from all our gatherings at the palace lately i came to assure myself that we had not unwittingly offended you or to ask you how we can render them sufficiently attractive to insure your presence  marie was taken unawares both by the kings visit and by the directness of his questioning it was nicholas who answered for her  your majesty he said my sister does not enjoy the best of health i was even now endeavouring to persuade her to spend a few weeks at the castle the mountain air is always good for her  your sisters appearance then the king replied much belies her condition i have never seen her looking better  nevertheless my brother is right your majesty marie said i have decided to leave theos for a while  the king bowed  it is not amongst my prerogatives to question the movements of my subjects he said gravely but you must forgive me if i remember that you and your brother are my earliest and best friends here i shall venture to ask you therefore if illhealth is your only reason for desiring to absent yourself from the court  nicholas intervened he rose and held back the curtains which led into another suite of rooms marie understood and with a quick courtesy rose from her seat  your majesty nicholas said with your permission i will return your candour the subject is one which we can best discuss in my sisters absence  marie passed out nicholas let fall the curtains  your majesty he said only a short while ago as your counsellor and as one who has the interests of theos greatly at heart i ventured to allude to a somewhat delicate subjectto your marriage  the king nodded  well  i must take the liberty of reminding your majesty of your first visit here on your arrival at theos we drank wine together in this room the royal betrothal cup was filled for you and notwithstanding my remonstrances at your particular desire my sister drank with you from that cup its history and associations were known to you  the king rose up  but  your majesty will permit me reist interrupted it was doubtless an act of thoughtless goodnature on your part but we thetians hold fast by our old traditions and regard them as sacred things the news of this leaked out and the marriage of your majesty and the countess of reist has been freely talked of throughout the state your majesty will perceive therefore that my sisters position at court naturally became a trying one especially as her rank entitles her always to the place by your side  ughtred was silent for several moments a frown of perplexity spread itself over his face  reist he said slowly your sister is very charming and i have a great admiration for her yet i must admit this the idea which you have suggested is an altogether new one to me i did not for one moment imagine that she or you or any one would attach any significance to what i looked upon at the time as a harmless little ceremony  reist bowed low  to the people of theos he said these ancient customs are sacred your majesty will permit me to proceed there is a further development which has also a bearing upon the situation i refer to the advent of mr and miss van decht  the king raised his eyebrows  and how does this matter concern he asked my very good friends the van dechts  your majesty nicholas answered has admitted them considering their position or i should say their lack of position to a somewhat surprising familiarity this too has given rise to much comment in the city miss van decht is a very beautiful young woman and your majesty has treated her publicly with great consideration almost as an equal your majesty must bear with our prejudices this is not a democratic country we hold by our rank and its obligations and we do not consider an american retired tradesman and his daughter people whom we can meet habitually on terms of equalityeven at the court of the king  ughtred rose from his chair and his mouth was set and grim  i am obliged to you for your frankness nicholas he said i will endeavour to return it mr van decht and his daughter are my very good friends and their position at my court is that of valued and welcome associates it seems to me that whom the king can treat as equals his nobles may endure as companions but in any case i desire to say this to you and to the aristocracy of theos whose opinions you doubtless express in the matter of my friends as in the matter of taking a wife when the time may come i do not permit any interference and if any be offered i shall resent it further if any stay away from my court for such reasons as you have hinted at i shall esteem their absence a personal affront am i understood  reist bowed in cold silence the king took a quick step towards him and laid his hand upon his arm  nicholas he said dont let me lose a good friendyou to whom i owe my kingdom remember that i am a man as well as a king i did not promise to become a machine when i took the coronation oaths i have my likes and my dislikesas you have bear with me a little  reist hesitated there entered a messenger for the king  your majesty he announced the englishman brand is at the palace he desires an immediate audience  ughtred took up his cloak  i fear that it is ill news he said follow me reist     chapter xxvii   your majesty  the king waved his hand  you can leave that out brand speak to me plainly you look as though you had something important to say  i have indeed brand answered  he glanced around cautiously they were in the chamber used for meetings of the privy councila great room with stained glass windows fluted pillars supporting a vaulted roof stone walls with here and there a covering of tapestry a collection of ancient arms was hung over the great chimneypiece in the centre of the floor stood a round table of solid oak a bad room for confidences this in which the slightest whisper awoke curious echoes the king noticed brands hesitation and divined its cause  come this way brand he directed reist is close behind he will keep out all intruders  they passed into the kings private study a small octagonal room on the ground floor of one of the towers the king threw himself into an easychair and pointed towards another but brand remained standing  well  your majesty the kingdom of theos is in danger  i know it the king answered calmly there are traitors in the city itself i have felt sure of it for some time  the danger is urgent  go on  i have acquired a good deal of information during the last few days brand said some of it has come through a source which i may not revealpiecemeal and in disconnected fragments you will have to take a good deal on trust  i believe in you brand  first of all then brand said you are aware of what has been going on in the press all over europe in russia germany and france  the king nodded  a widespread conspiracy he said to vilify me and my methods and my government i have been represented to europe as a harebrained scheming military adventurer idle worthless a drunkard and heaps of other things i know it brand i know another thing too i know that one paper in england through thick and thin has been my friend i do not deserve all the good which it has spoken of me on the other hand i shall always regard as one of my best friends the man who had the pluck to try and stem the tide  the slender fingers of the journalist found themselves suddenly within the brown sinewy hand of the king there was an instants silencea mans silence then brand continued  mr ellis our minister there is your friend but he is a weak colourless creature and he gives no weight or point to his reports he tries hard to be honest but he is wofully under the influence of the others and the others  i know the king interrupted austria germany and russia have come to a secret understanding and somehow i fancy that turkey is involved in it but what pretext they can find for movement against me or from what quarter i am to expect the aggression i cannot say  it is what i have just discovered brand said  the kings eyes flashed he was a brave man but the cloud of doubt had been stupefying it was this knowledge for which he craved  it is russia who is the moving spirit brand continued  russia of course the king exclaimed bitterly an independent theos has always been against her policy she debauched the republic she triedas you well know brandto make my accession a virtual russian protectorate  and further brand said she has actually in london stooped to this our paper has been approached by an agent of the russian government with a view to purchasing a cessation of our support of you i myself your majesty feel myself deeply to blame weeks ago i could have warned you that domiloff was still in the capital plotting against you i kept silent i beg that you will not ask me why the news which has brought me here now has come by cipher telegram from my chief a secret treaty has been signed between russia and turkey the terms i do not know but turkey is left free to attack you at once and she is already moving troops and guns to the frontier  germany ughtred asked quickly  is pledged to neutralityalso austria the only european country which has not come to terms with russia is england  the king rose from his chair and walked restlessly up and down the room his eyes were flashing and the lines about his mouth were hard and bitter  its a brave gamepolitics he cried today we read our ancient history and thank the gods for civilization its a huge fraud brand what they did in those days with fire and the sword they do today by craft and secret treaties by falsehood and deceit its a world of rapine still it is only the methods which have changedand changed for the worse  brand nodded slowly  listen he said my chief has had an interview with one of our cabinet ministers he has listened to all he had to say and i believe that the state of affairs here will be fairly represented to the english government but to be frank i am afraid there will be no intervention from england she may sympathize but she will not deem her interests sufficiently involved to interfere  have you any idea ughtred asked when there will be any movement on the part of turkey and what the casus belli will be  the blow may be struck at any moment brand answered i am afraid my warning comes too late to afford you time for preparations  the king smiled  i am not a child my dear brand he said sooner or later i felt that the thing must come and instinct seemed to tell me from what quarter i will let you into a secret my friend if the turks raid my three frontier villages they may possibly find themselves a little surprised  a smile illumined brands serious face  youll make a fight for it then he asked eagerly  ughtred rose up his eyes were lit with inward fire and in his tone there trembled a note of splendid passion  a fight for it ay we shall fight in such a way my friend that all europe shall hide her face and feel the shame of the carnage and misery for which her miserable selfishness is responsible there is one thing about my people brand which is divine and thank god it is in my own blood too notwithstanding my years of exile we love our country our hills and mountains our cornfields and vineyards our villages and our queer old towns its a wonderful love brand and i dont believe you highlycivilized people in your rich smokestained western countries know what it means i tell you its a passion here we thetians love our country as we love our womenkind the footstep of the invader is seductionwhen it comes there will be lit such a fire of passionate hate from the balkans to the northern frontier that only death or victory will quench you will see them come to arms brand these children of mine whom god protect young and old boys and their grandfathers a fight for it did you say i promise you man that if this blow falls and we are conquered you shall come here afterwards and you shall find an empty country a blackened chaos of ruins  an answering flash of enthusiasm lit up brands face for a moment but the man was practical to the core  what number of trained men can you rely upon he asked  fifteen thousand the king answered i know every village company every regiment i have drilled myself they have old martinis but they are born shots and born horsemen lately too we have gone through a course of carbine instruction i could put five thousand mounted infantry into the field who could surprise you  and artillery  the king groaned  we have done what we could he answered but as for heavy guns we have none listen i will give you a sketch of my idea for defending the balkans  the king talked quickly and clearly there was no more trace of the enthusiast nor indeed did he betray again during all the anxious days to come that more passionate side of the man which brands few words seemed to have quickened into life he talked now as the cool and skilful strategist brand who was something of an amateur soldier himself listened with keen interest  and you the king asked at last  brand smiled  i am here to see that the things which are coming are fairly reported from one quarter at least he answered i am going to stay and if the trouble comes i am correspondent for the new york herald as well as the daily courier  that is very good news the king said england and america are the champions of freedom throughout the world i have fought for england and if this wrong is done to me i shall appeal to her for justice  a knock at the door a young officer on the kings staff saluted  his excellency the turkish ambassador craves the privilege of an immediate audience he announced     chapter xxviii   effenden pascha was breathless and for such a phlegmatic individual seemed to be much disturbed  your majesty he said i am here on a serious errand  the king bowed  proceed effenden pascha  your majesty has heard the news from bekal  ughtred shook his head  i have heard nothing  the turk raised his hands it was incredible  yesterday he announced a party of my turks riding harmlessly along the frontier were attacked without warning by a large company of mounted thetians and cut to pieces  it is amazing the king declared was no provocation given were the turks unarmed  effenden pascha was clear on both points they were simply a party of surveyors accompanied by a few soldiers they were set upon without the slightest warning  it is strange the king remarked that i should have heard nothing of this it is stranger still effenden pascha that in my own capital you should first have received tidings of such gravity  the yellowskinned turk did not flinch he bore the thrust without the least sign of disquietude  i myself he announced heard only by telegrams from bekal ten minutes ago one of the survivors galloped posthaste thither immediately after the affair i have hastened to present the demands of my master the sultan  you lose no time ughtred remarked quietly  the turk shrugged his shoulders  the affair is of great importance he said my master will demand the execution of capital punishment upon all the leaders and an indemnity of ten million piastres  your august master ughtred remarked has lost no time in formulating his demands my reply to you is this immediately i learn the details of the affair i will consider your proposal  the ambassador who had remained standing bowed  that is to say he remarked softly that at present you decline to offer me my satisfaction or to discuss the matter with me  exactly ughtred answered if the affair turns out according to your telegram i shall at once offer to you my profound regrets and such reparation as is within my power i will communicate with you directly i hear  the ambassador bowed once more and there was a steely glint in his eyes  i fear he said that the delay will not be pleasing to my august master  it is unavoidable the king answered you agree with me brand  brand who had been sitting in the alcove before a writingtable hidden by a curtain looked out and assented gravely  most certainly your majesty  the turk started his eyes flashed  so he exclaimed we have been overheard  mr brand is an englishman of distinction the king said softly i have appointed him for the present my private secretary all affairs of state therefore are known to him  the turk bowed low it was no fool after all then with whom he had to do he went out thoughtfully the presence of the englishman had impressed him in the council room he passed the duke of reist hurrying through to the presence of the king  effenden pascha he said will you wait for a moment a dispatch has arrived concerning which the king will desire to see you at once  effenden pascha smiled and took a chair in the anteroom beyond he smoked a cigarette thoughtfully and drank the coffee which a groom of the chambers hastened to bring him in ten minutes reist reappeared  will you come with me he said  effenden pascha threw down his cigarette and followed  the king had moved into the council chamber and sat at the table with an open telegraph dispatch before him baron doxis the president of the house of laws was on one side of him and brand on the other effenden pascha knew very well what was coming the king looked at him and there was an added sense of power in the grave soldierly face  effenden pascha we too have received a telegram from bekal its contents are briefly these bekal an unfortified village of theos was last night attacked by a large armed body of turks who proceeded to rob murder and outrage in the most barbarous fashion my regard however for the safety of my frontier towns has led me lately to station bodies of mounted troops within signalling distance of bekal and my dispatch informs me that in the fight which followed your troops were driven across the frontier with heavy losses you will see effenden pascha that my report and yours differ  the turk smiled incredulously the reports most certainly did differ  now the king continued if your report is the true one i will hold myself responsible for all the evil that has been done if on the other hand mine is true i shall at once formulate demands which i shall request you to lay before your august master now i invite you in order that the truth may be placed beyond doubt to accompany an envoy from this court to bekal by special train today and there agree as to what has really happened  effenden pascha shrugged his shoulders  i must await the instructions of my master your majesty he answered calmly  you decline his majestys proposal then reist asked quietly  the turk was silent the meddlesome englishmans pen was in the ink his presence was disastrous  i do not declineno he answered i await only a dispatch from constantinople i fear that your intelligence department is at fault there has been no foray on the part of the turks my master desires peace above all things  ughtred smiled  you say that your master desires peace above all things he said let me see what our intelligence department has to say since the day of my accession to the throne you have concentrated within twenty miles of my frontier nearly thirty thousand men day by day this work of moving up troops has been going on last week trains were running all night to bekal with war material and arms what does this mean effenden pascha  the turk was dumfounded the kings gaze was keen and close he visibly faltered  your majestys intelligence department has magnified a few harmless movements of troops he said we have internal troubles in the northern provinces which require strong garrisons  but not thirty thousand men effenden pascha the king said  the turk bowed  with your permission he said i will now go and lay before the sultan my master your explanation of the bekal incident  we shall ourselves the king answered be requiring an explanation of that unprovoked attack upon our territory  the turk bowed and withdrew the three men were left alone  the situation is fairly clear i think the king said turkey is to be russias catspawwe are to be the chestnuts one great point is in our favour the onus of an unprovoked invasion must rest with turkey brand will see the facts correctly stated in the english and american papers we had better send to the barracks at once reist for the general and hold a council of war  there followed an hours anxious consultation then the king without any attendant as was his custom left the palace by the side entrance and amidst the respectful salutations of the passers by walked across to the villa which mr van decht had rented mr van decht and sara were sitting in the garden he accepted the chair they offered him and lit a cigar mechanically  mr van decht he said abruptly i regret exceedingly that i have encouraged you to make investments in my country i did it for the best it was for the advantage of my people and i hoped for yours i told you of the one risk i fear that it has come to pass  mr van decht was unmoved sara turned upon him breathlessly  do you mean war she exclaimed  he nodded  it seems that our great neighbours he said resent our independence our chief enemy is russia in pursuance i am convinced of a secret understanding with her turkey is on the point of declaring war upon us  then all i can say is that it is a darned shame mr van decht declared hotly dont you trouble yourself about my investments if the turks disturb my property i guess my country will know how to make them pay your majesty those turks must be whipped  while weve a yard to stand upon or a man to fight we shall do our best i have been a soldier as you know all my life and i have no sentimental hatred of war but my countryah well it is so different when it is your own people who are going to die upon their homesteads your own womenkind who must go sorrowing through life widowed and orphaned i dont suppose there is anything particularly beautiful about theos the king continued thoughtfully yet to me her quiet country places her vineyards and farms her whole rural life has seemed so simple and charming i have seen my people at their play and at their daily tasks a cheerful honest people lighthearted and fond of pleasure perhapswhy not the thought of a blackened country her vineyards and cornfields red with blood the homesteads in flames my poor peasants fighting to the death against cruel oddsit is hideous i do not dare to think of it or it will unman me only i pray to the god of our fathers that this thing will not seem just to the great libertyloving nations and that they will not see us wiped out from the face of the earth  there was a moments silence mr van decht was smoking vigorously sara was silent because she did not dare to speak but her eyes were eloquent ughtred threw away his cigar which had gone out and lit another  come he said i am getting an old woman we must take the more cheerful view of things i came to you at once because i wanted to give you as much notice as possible  what do you mean sara asked softly  i mean that of course you must go away ughtred answered i cannot tell how long the railway communication will remain uninterrupted mr van decht  he turned round and broke off in his speech mr van decht had disappeared sara and he were alone     chapter xxix   ughtred was on the whole a man ill versed in womens ways yet even he was conscious of a subtle change in the girl who sat by his side the frank friendliness of her manner towards him which had been a constant barrier against any suggestion of more sentimental relations was for the moment gone her eyes were soft and her face was eloquent with beautiful and unspoken sympathy the change was indefinable but apparent ughtred felt it and sighed  this may be the last talk we shall have together for a long time he said gravely perhaps forever i wonder if i might be permittedto say something which has come very near my heart lately  you may say anything you choose she murmured  you know that lately i have been travelling about my countrytrying to get to know my people and to understand them i will tell you sara what has made the greatest impression upon me it is their beautiful domesticity i think that it has taught me to understand a little how much fuller and sweeter life may be when one has a wife to care for and to help one and sara i think that i too have been often lonely and i too have needed a wife  yes  it was no more than a whisper but it thrilled the man he touched her fingerswarm and soft they seemed almost to invite his caress  sara i have been dreaming since then and i thought that when my people got to understand me a little more to trust me and believe in me i would go to them and say i am going to give you a queen only i am a man as you are men and i must choose as you have chosen the one woman who has my heart and sara there might have been difficulties but i think that we should have smoothed them away  if she echoed  if the woman i love sara cared a little for me  it was dusk and ughtred scarcely knew how it happened but she was in his arms and they were very happy it was dusk then but the stars were shining when the cathedral clock reminded him that his lovemaking must be brief  dear she murmured if you must go at least remember that you have made me very happy  and i he answered cheerfully am afraid no longer of anything i have become a raving optimist i feel that if the war comes we shall sweep the turks from the face of the earth  she held out her hand and drew him to her  you will not repent she murmured you ought to marry a princess  he kissed her on the lips  every woman in the world he answered is a princess to the man who loves her you are my princess there will never be any other  she walked with him towards the house  i ought to have been discussing your departure with mr van decht and instead i have been discussing other things with you  discussing what  your departure  she laughed softly  do you think that we are going away  you must he answered sadly theos may be no safe place for you in fortyeight hours even  she pressed his arm lightly  dear she said you are foolish if ever i am to be anything to you and these people what would they think of me if i ran away when evil times came but wait you must hear what father says he knows nothing of this  they found him in the room he called his study he looked up from his desk as they entered  father sara said the king wants us to leave tomorrow morning in fortyeight hours he says the city may be in danger  mr van decht wheeled round in his recently imported american chair and puffed vigorously at his cigar  i wasnt reckoning upon leaving just yet he remarked quietly were you sara  no  ughtred looked from one to the other  i am afraid you dont quite understand the situation mr van decht i do not think it probable of course but it is possible that the city may be surrounded in less than a week  mr van decht nodded  i guess it isnt quite so bad as that he answered in any case id like you to understand this weve had a pretty good time here and we havent any idea of scuttling out just because things arent exactly booming ive a tidy idea of engineering and i think i can show you a wrinkle or two in trenchmaking then theres another thingyoull allow a mans a right to do what he pleases with his own money  why i suppose so ughtred answered  well im not given to bragging mr van decht continued but i reckon im one of the richest men in the states accordingly as im sort of a resident here i claim the right to help the war fund ive put a million to your credit at the credit lyonnaise and if mores wantedtheres plenty i dont want any thanks i dont mind telling you that id give a lot more to see those lowdown skunks get the whipping they deserve  ughtred was for a moment speechless it was sara who replied for him  we are very much obliged father she said smiling at him you dont mind do you  he looked from one to the other he did not affect any surprise but his face was grave  sara has promised that some day if we are spared she will be my wife ughtred said simply i hope that you will consent  mr van decht nodded thoughtfully  i had an idea he said hesitatingly that you would be not exactly a free agent in such a matter  ughtred smiled  my kingdom is a tiny one he answered and i do not think after a while that there will be any difficulty at all  mr van decht rose from his chair and shook hands solemnly with the young man  i wasnt reckoning upon having a king for a soninlaw he said but i know a man when i see him and if it works out to be possible you can take my consent for granted sara is the daughter of plain people with no family to boast of but i tell you this sir i am a man with few wants and i will give sara the largest dowry that has ever been given by prince or commoner i reckon im worth five million pounds and ill settle four and a half upon her theos wants money and that may take things a bit smoother in case of trouble  you are magnificently generous sir ughtred answered i am afraid that nowadays a bride with such a dowry would rank above princesses  the cathedral clock chimed again ughtred tore himself away reist met him at the door his eyes blazing with excitement  effenden pascha has left the city he exclaimed the turks are streaming over the frontierbushnieff has wired for reinforcements  the supply trains are waiting ughtred asked quickly  with steam up  your carriage quickly to the barracks ughtred exclaimed     chapter xxx   all night long the warbeacons of theos reddened the sky and the thunder of artillery woke strange echoes amongst the mountains there were three passes only through which the turks could force their way into the fertile plain which stretched from theos southwards and each one to their surprise was found well guarded and fortified a simultaneous advance was repulsed with heavy loss at solika only on the far east where the veteran general kolashin was in command the first position was carried but this temporary success was counterbalanced by the immense losses inflicted on the advancing columns from the second and more secure line of fortifications across the plain a light railway from theos all night long brought reinforcements and stores to the different positions ughtred himself by means of an engine and fast horses visited before daybreak the three points of attack he was present and himself directed the successful resistance at solika he returned to theos at daybreak hopeful and even with a certain sense of relief that the worst had now come to pass  still in his uniform stained with blood and dust the king sat at a small writingtable in his retiringroom reading the days letters and telegrams already he had been busy with tongue and pen his appeal for intervention couched in dignified and measured terms had been written signed and dispatched by special messenger to england france and germany for ughtred had a very keen sense of proportion courageous though he was and confident in the bravery of his people he knew that his resistance unaided could only be a matter of time  hiram van decht now a privileged person at the palace came in to him as he sat there  i guess you dont want to be bothered just now he remarked apologetically but saras bound to know how things have gone so far  ughtred wheeled round in his chair and welcomed his visitor  cigars at your elbow he said help yourself  van decht disregarded the invitation he looked steadily at the king then he rang the bell  youll forgive the liberty i know he said but im going to tell that flunkey of yours to fetch a flask of wine and see you drink some  ughtred smiled  i was just going to order something he said ive had a hard night so far nothing has gone amiss our outposts were rushed at solika but our main position was easily held  van decht nodded  thats good any fighting at althea pass  we are being heavily shelled there and at morania but i consider that both places are almost impregnable solika is where we must concentrate you see we have treachery to fear there it is a frontier town and full of small russian traders reist is garrisoning the place and general dartnoff is in command of the forces holding the pass just now everything is quiet i fancy they are waiting to bring up more heavy guns  van decht lit a cigar meditatively  this is what beats me he remarked i can never figure out your european politics but i should never have thought that england and germany would have allowed a small unoffending country to be overrun and grabbed by a lot of heathen infidels  ughtred sighed  it is hard to understand he said only you must remember this selfishness is the keynote of international politics as of many other things a single power is always afraid of moving for fear of disturbing the balance of nations besides they all know that this is no war between turkey and theos it is russia who is pulling the strings  thats all right mr van decht admitted but i should say that youve a sort of a claim on england youre half an englishman anyway youve fought her battles shes big enough to give you a lift  if help comes from anywhere ughtred answered it will come from england i have appealed to the powers and to england especially mr ellis has already been here and he is representing my case strongly  wine was brought in and food ughtred ate little but smoked a cigar  whats the next move mr van decht asked  well i am waiting now for news from reist the king said we are in telegraphic communication with solika and i can get there on my engine in an hour so long as we can hold solika we are safe for i do not think that we can possibly be outflanked our whole southern frontier only extends for forty miles and there are only two practicable passes  reist anything of a soldier mr van decht asked after a brief silence  for this sort of workexcellent ughtred answered  you trust him  as myself i never knew a man more devoted to his country it is his religion why do you ask  van decht took his cigar from his mouth and regarded it thoughtfully  sara doesnt like him  the king laughed  hes no ladys man  sara has instinct her father remarked cant say i take to him myself theres a kink in the man somewhere  ughtred smiled  well it isnt in his loyalty or his bravery ughtred answered he is my best soldier my most capable adviser and i owe him my kingdom  van decht abandoned the subject  ill get along he said rising take my advice lie down a bit till your message comes along youre looking pretty bad  ughtred smiled  the first day of war he said even on a small scale is the most wearing later on we shall take things more easily only you must remember sir that it is for the liberty of an ancient kingdom we fight not only for our own lives but for the happiness of unborn generations i would sooner see theos blotted out forever from the map of europe and the memory of man than have her exist a vassal state of russia  mr van decht departed in respectful silence if tradition or sentiment appealed to him but slightly he knew an honest man by instinct and he was fast drifting into a very close sympathy with his future soninlaw  there came word from reist within the hour ughtred tore open the envelope and spread out the cipherbook before him  no signs of movement on part of enemy scouts report big guns being mounted on positions commanding ours solika restless have hung two spies general dartnoff desires council of war this afternoon     chapter xxxi   before the great high window marie of reist watched the red fires flaring in the mountains and listened to the faroff booming of the guns behind her the room was in darkness for she had turned out the lamps to see more clearly into the night so when a voice at her elbow roused her she started with a sudden fear  countess you hear the warnote yonder listen again those guns are sounding the knell of the house of tyrnaus  she recovered herselfyet she was amazed  baron domiloff what are you still in theos  still in theos countess i remain here to the end  but you were banished she exclaimed  he smiled inscrutably  yes he answered i was banishedby ughtred of tyrnaus still as you see i remain to tell you the truth countess it did not seem worth my while to gofor so short a time  you must be a master in the art of corruption she remarked  indeed no he assured her there are a few of my country people in the city there are also thetians who understand that the tyrnaus dynasty is only a passing thing  i am not so sure she answered that i agree with you they say that he is a skilful and gallant soldier and we of theos love brave men an hour ago he rode back to the palace his uniform stained with dust and blood and the people cheered him like mad things they say that he has driven the turks back at all points  domiloff smiled  dear lady he said the successes of today or tomorrow are of no account the turks are mounting great guns in positions which must command every point where the thetians are covering the passes the end of it is as certain as a mathematical problem before a month has passed theos must sue for peace or admit the turks to the city  you are very certain  warfare today he answered can be determined on mathematical lines bravery is a delightful quality in the abstract but brave men are killed as easily as cowards tell me have you spoken with your brother  yes  he will not consent to this van decht alliance  no  domiloff smiled  it is good he answered i think that the time has come when i may approach him myself  she shook her head  he is wild with the excitement of fighting she said the king and he have fought together and nicholas speaks of him as a brave comrade and a patriot last night he wrote to me from solika and he spoke of the king as a brother for the moment he has forgotten all about the van decht alliance take my adviceleave nicholas alone  domiloff looked out into the night frowning and thoughtful  when the tide of battle changes he said your brothers enthusiasm will wane he will remember the slight upon youupon his name  she regarded him proudly  it is very seldom she remarked that you permit me to forget it  he smiled the sight of his white teeth gleaming in the twilight filled her with repulsion the man was like a wolf  countess he said i am not a hypocrite i am pledged to the deposition of the king and you are my natural ally for it is your brother who must take his place and you who must prevent the sacrilege of this proposed marriage so you see i am open with you we are both working towards the same end therefore i say let us work together  they were silent for a few minutes listening to the distant roar of the guns watching the lurid lights which every now and then lit up with an unholy glare that distant background then she turned to him  there is nothing she said which i can do besides whilst the war lasts everything else seems small to see theos drive back the infidels and retain her freedom i would be content even to let things remain and end my days there in the convent  he shook his head  dear lady he said you were not made for a convent any more than sara van decht was made for a throne try and believe in me a little more i too desire a free theos you are a woman and you have wit and courage say to yourself this it is necessary for theos that your brother and the king should quarrel keep it always in your mind remember that your brothers anger only slumbers the king has insulted you and your house the whole history of your family could disclose no such affront tamely borne besides there is your friendthe englishman  she turned swiftly upon him  what do you mean  he shrugged his shoulders  only that i know no man whose future i would believe in more readily if he were content to settle down in theos your brother could see to it that it was made worth his while tell mewhen will you see the duke of reist  perhaps tonight she answered straining her eyes through the darkness if all is quiet in solika he said that he might return for a few hours  domiloff nodded  very well remember what i have said to you countess a rupture between your brother and the king will save theos you understand  yes she answered in a low tone i understand     chapter xxxii   ughtred sprang to his feet he was half asleep and a little dazedwholly bewildered at the apparition which was suddenly sharing the solitude of his chamber it was marie of reist who stood before him in a wonderful rosecoloured gown tied loosely around her she was paler than he had ever seen herher eyes bright with purposebehind the open panel  you bring news he cried do you come from nicholas  she shook her head  i know nothing of nicholas she answered i came to see you  he was speechless her visit seemed to him amazing its object an enigma  i wished to speak to you alone lately it has been impossible lock your door  he obeyed but he returned to her with a grave face  marie he said think for a moment it is better that i should come to you tomorrow  she interrupted him with an impatient gesture at that moment the roar of distant artillery was distinctly audible  there may be no tomorrow she answered it is for the sake of theos i have come you must hear me  for your own sake countess he begged earnestly i beg that you will leave me at any moment we may be interrupted messages are brought to me continuallyand the hour is late  i am the countess of reist she answered proudly and the people of theos know me i have come to ask you a question you must hear me and you must answer me  he smiled  you are a little peremptory he said never mind the question  there have been rumours your majesty of a marriage between you and the american miss van decht  he looked across at her in displeased surprise  these are no times for thought or speech of such things he answered  she turned upon him with a sudden fierceness a spot of angry colour burned in her cheeks  you are wrong she exclaimed i have come to you resolved to know the truth listen your majesty there are those who say that in your long exile you have forgotten all that is due to your birth and your country they say that you are at heart a democrat that it is in your mind to marry this daughter of an american tradesman to offer her to the people of theos as their queen  it is true he answered what of it  she looked at him for a moment as though stricken with a sudden blow to her the idea was heresy rank and foul a storm of indignant passion swept through her  it is impossible she cried fiercely there is not a lady of theos who would attend your court do you think that imarie of reist would kiss the hand of this van decht womani or any of the others oh it is madness  countess he said quietly we will choose another time for the discussion of this matter you must forgive me if i beg that you will leave me  another time she answered oh listen you depend at this moment on the loyalty of theos to defend your throne do you believe that you could command it if this were known in the mountains the turks are gathering a great army in the city there is treachery ah you start but my words are true if the words which you have spoken to me had been spoken from the balcony there your throne would have been lost forever  he looked at her curiouslynot altogether unimpressed treachery what did she mean by that she moved a step nearer to him underneath her loose gown her bosom rose and fell quickly her face was flushed and her eyes brilliant  your majesty she said do you know that by all the traditions of theos you are betrothed to methat the people of theos wait day by day for the announcement  he looked at her in blank amazement he was bereft of words her eyes flashed fire upon him  it is an insultthis purpose of yours she cried you and i have drunk together from the kings cup it has been the betrothal ceremony in the royal house of theos for generations you a stranger who owe your very throne to us have dared to ignore ityou who propose to raise to the throne of the most ancient kingdom of europe a woman of unknown birth it is an infamy  countess he answered you know quite well that i was ignorant of your custom of the history of that cup  there are times she said fiercely when ignorance is worse than crime no man yet even a king has lived to break faith with the house of reist  he had recovered himselfand he remembered he addressed her steadily yet with a growing coldness in his tone  is it your wish then countess that i fulfil the obligations which you say i have incurred  her face burned her eyes were lit with fire he had gained an advantage he had made her angry  it is a brutal question she cried but quickly answered you know quite well that if it were so i should not be here no i would not marry younot even to be queen of theos  then why  oh but you are blind she interrupted passionately you understand nothing i repeat that i would not marry you to be queen of theos i am willing to be your friend i am willing to forget your broken pledge but listen theos is the dearest thing on earth to me i am jealous for my country not for myself i will not have this tradesmans daughter queen of theos do you think that i marie of reist would follow her from the room would bend my knee to her would call her queen it is madness inconceivable i speak for myself but there are others who feel as i feel it would be an insult to every royal family in europe these are the things which i have come to say you must abandon your purpose or  or  there was a moments deep silence she shook her head very slowly  there is not a noble of theos your majesty who would not consider himself justified in rescinding his oath to a king who could stoop so low  ughtred eyed her gravely  marie he said you are a peeress of theos in your own right and as such you yourself have taken an oath of allegiance to me  it is true your majesty she answered coldly and i tell you now that the announcement of your betrothal to sara van decht would in my opinion and before my conscience justify me in breaking that oath and your majesty must remember further that those who are not with you are against you  the king sat down and leaned his head upon his hand was this really how the people of theos would regard his marriage if indeed it should ever come to pass the girl was so terribly in earnest and of personal feeling it seemed after all that she had none a cloud crept over his face  it is a threat he said quietly countess i beg that you will leave me i will think over all that you have said and i will discuss it fully with your brother and my other advisers forgive me if i add that i think it would be more fitting  he pointed to the open panel she held up her head as though listening but ughtred heard nothing then she looked once more at the king something in his face reminded her for the moment of the man whom he resembled he was tired and his distress touched her heart she moved suddenly over to his side and dropped upon her knee the heavy sleeves fell back from her wrists her white fingers touched his arms she remembered that they had been young together and after all the destinies of theos were largely in his hands he looked into her face and was amazed at the change her tone no longer shook with anger she pleaded to him  your majesty you and i were children together listen to me i have lived in theos all my life and the love of my country has become a religion to me for her sake listen you must not think any more of sara van decht your marriage would be impossible the house of laws would not permit it the nobility of theos of whom alas there are but few left would not tolerate it i am speaking the truth to you as for what has been between you and me it shall go for nothing ilisteni love another man wait for a few years and then seek for a wife where the royal house of theos has the right to seek i who know tell you that this is your dutythat even now your throne is in peril that you know nothing of  illustration nicholas of reist stood on the threshold  for the fraction of a second ughtred hesitated seeking about in his mind only how best to terminate a painful situation and that brief period became almost a fatal interlude for she saw what was passing in his mind then a low fierce cry came to them from the shadows of the room nicholas of reist stood on the threshold of the open panel his drawn sword quivering in his hand     chapter xxxiii   it was a curiously deep silence which reigned for many moments in the kings chamber ughtred slowly drew a little apart from marie and glanced sternly from one to the other his momentary suspicion however died away the look on the face of nicholas of reist was such as no man even the most consummate of actors might assume  what news do you bring the king said quietly is all well at solika  reist pointed to his sister  there are no fresh tidings he answered i await your majestys explanation of my sisters presence here  ughtred drew himself up the blood of an ancient race asserted itself he eyed reist coldly it was the king who faced a rebellious subject  i have no explanation to offer to you duke of reist he answered seek it instead from your sister it is she who should afford it you seeing that her presence here was undesired by me and unexpected  your majesty lies reist thundered  there was a deep and awful silence then ughtred turned upon him a fierce flash of anger in his blue eyes  duke of reist he said you are a privileged person at this court and i have called you my friend you will unsay those words or hand me your sword  i repeat reist said fiercely that your majesty lies  the king pointed to the open panel  countess he ordered leave us this matter is between your brother and myself we can settle it best in your absence  she turned to her brother  nicholas she said the kings word is truth i came here without any knowledge of his i remained here against his will it was unwise perhaps but the fault was mine i wished to hear from his own lips what truth there was in these rumours of his coming marriage  was it your place to ask the king these things he demanded fiercely was it dignified or seemly of youyou his affianced bride  i am not his affianced bride nicholas she answered that was an idle ceremony it was true we drank together of the kings cup but its history was unknown to him  he eyed them both with a fierce scorn  god alone knows of what cup you have drunk together he cried bitterly how often have you found it necessary to seek him here in the solitude of his chamber how often have you used this infernal passage  to seek the king never she answered firmly i used it when i found brand here if i had not theos might today have been a russian state  he pointed with unshaking finger to the opening in the wall  pass away marie  she hesitated  it is the truth which i have told you nicholas she said  he thrust before her eyes a piece of paper  you are young marie to lie so glibly even for your lovers sake here is the message which summoned you here written in the kings handwriting signed with the kings name you left it on the table so that even the servants might know of the shame which has come upon our house  the king crossed the room and looked over maries shoulder it was indeed his own notepaper and the writing of those few words strangely resembled his  come now i am aloneu  the king looked up with grave face  it is a forgery he said  it is a forgery marie echoed white to the lips  nicholas of reist said nothing he pointed to the open panel a look of horror flashed into the girls face she understood  nicholas she cried that message never came from the king where you found it i do not know but i never saw it before you must believe me nicholas the king was ignorant of my coming he was unwilling that i should remain even for a moment  i repeat the king said gravely that the writing which you hold in your hands is a forgery nicholas i have never written to your sister in my life this is part of a plot which shall be sifted to the bottom  still nicholas stood silent before the panel and marie passed out he shut it carefully then he turned to the king who was still standing with that halfsheet of notepaper in his hand  your majesty he said i desire to know whether it is your intention to marry my sister  the king looked him squarely in the face  nicholas he said have i ever in my life done or said anything to give rise to such a belief  your majesty reist answered with a bow has been ever most discreet yet before witnesses you pledged my sister in our ancient betrothal cup well knowing its immutable record  that is true the king answered but at the time i showed clearly that with me at least it was a jest i plead guilty to an act of folly i came straight here from life amongst a people to whom symbols and ceremonies have become as empty thingsa practical and utilitarian people and i did not recognize the passionate clinging of the dwellers in these more romantic countries to old customs and old ritual i deeply regret it nicholas i have no other regret  reist pointed to the letter which still remained in the kings fingers ughtred tore it through with a gesture of contempt  i did not write it he said i did not invite your sisters presence  reist controlled himself with a visible effort  your majesty he said i beg you for one moment to reflect i appeal once more less for your sake or mine than for our countrys to your honour your throne you owe to me i have been your faithful servant and my sword is yet wet with the blood of your enemies our name is great throughout europe an alliance with us can only strengthen your hold upon the people it ill becomes me to force these things upon you but the issue is great do you seek the hand of my sister in marriage  i do not the king answered i never have done wait  reist paused with his hand upon the hilt of his sword the king continued  for the sake of my kingdom i do not order you from my presence reist we are in danger as you know and i can ill spare a brave man listen on my honour i ughtred of tyrnaus declare to you that the letter you found is a forgery that your sisters presence here was as much a surprise to me as to you that i never for one single moment failed in the respect which i owe to her as the sister of my best subject  that reist said coldly is your majestys last word  it is  reist drew his sword from his scabbard and bent it upon the ground till the blade snapped the pieces he threw before the king  i resign my position in the army he said and i withdraw my oath of allegiance we are on equal terms now ughtred of tyrnaus and i demand satisfaction from you for this affront upon my house  ughtred eyed him sternly for a moment but without anger  first sir he said discharge yourself of your duty report to me of the position at solika  we have withstood a fierce attack reist answered coldly and driven the turks off with heavy losses i regret to add however that solika is a hotbed of russian intrigue and what we gain in the field we shall doubtless lose through treachery my force are encamped outside the city and there are scouts duly posted to warn us of any fresh attack i desire your answer ughtred of tyrnaus  the kings eyes flashed with anger  be careful sir he exclaimed or my answer will be a file of soldiers and the prison  there was a brief pause an angry spot burned on reists cheeks but he kept silent  my answer to you is this sir the king said all duties which i owe as a private individual are secondary to those i owe my country so long as the war lasts i decline your challenge the day it is over i will meet you under any condition you choose to name now go  but  sir the king thundered i do not bandy words with my subjects go  reist passed out in silence the panel rolled heavily back the king was alone he sank heavily on to his couch and buried his face in his hands     chapter xxxiv   once more brother and sister stood face to face in the great shadowy audienceroom of the reist palace again too there was the clamour of many voices in the streets below for a messenger had just galloped in with news from the front and a sad procession of ambulance wagons had arrived for the hospital only it seemed to them both that that other day of which both for a moment thought lay far back in some uncertain past events had marched so rapidly during the last few months that all sense of proportion and distance was lost they looked at one another with white haggard faces marie saw that her brother no longer wore his sword  what has happened she asked faintly  the fires of hell were smouldering in his dark eyes yet he answered with some attempt at calmness  i challenged him i had the right he did not deny it but he will not fight until the war is over i have broken my sword i am an outcast from my peopleand he is still their king marie you have brought great trouble upon our house  it was not i who brought him here she answered i was against it always the trouble is of your makingand his he drank with me from the kings cup  ay and tonight he refused absolutely to marry you marie i suffered the everlasting humiliation of offering your handto have it refused  she drew a short quick breath it was humiliation indeed a sudden wild anger seized her she locked and interlocked her fingers nervously  they are an accursed race these men of tyrnaus she cried they make vows only to break them their honour is a broken reed  then nicholas his face gleaming white through the darkness leaned over to her  marie he said those written wordswhich summoned you to himwere his  she hesitated he raised his hand  marie he said solemnly answer me as though your foot were upon the threshold of eternity remember that the name of reist will become a name of shame for ever if you speak falsely he is young and he came here a stranger to us and our traditions with our country in peril i might forgive for the while his broken trothif that were all but if he has dared to hold you lightlythat i cannot forgive tell me the truth was that message indeed from him which summoned you to a clandestine meeting  she met his fixed gaze with beating heart her bosom rose and fell quickly she was torn with a hundred emotions at last she answered  nicholas she said i know nothing of that note i sought the king of my own free will  reist paced the room with quick uneven footsteps marie sat at the table her head buried in her hands he did not approach her through the open window came the dull booming of guns the sound was a torture to him  what are you going to do she asked at last  god only knows he answered bitterly i have no king and no country yet if i stay here i shall go mad  she removed her hands from her face and looked at him stealthily  if there were a way she whispered to save theos and to be avenged on ughtred of tyrnaus  he stopped short  what do you mean  if there were still a way she whispered by which our old dream might come true if it were still possible that you might become the saviour of our country might even now rescue it from the turks  plain words he cried let there be no enigmas between you and me what do you mean  she looked at him more boldly  if a great power should say i will not help theos in her trouble because i do not recognize ughtred of tyrnaus but if the right man is willing to accept the thronesoi will stretch out my handthe war shall ceasetheos shall be free what do you think of that nicholas  he looked at her with new eyes  whose thoughts are these he asked slowly  domiloffs  he has spoken to you  yes  it is treason he cried hoarsely i will have none of it  who she asked is a greater traitor than ughtred of tyrnaus  he was silent  who she cried is better beloved in theoswho could rule the people more wisely than you nicholas it would save our country from conquest and pillage it isthe only way is it not what we have spoken of beforehave not you yourself pointed upwards to that motto whose writing is surely no less clear today oh nicholas you cannot hesitate  he walked to the window and looked out towards the hills where the red lights still flared and the guns made sullen music her words were like poison to him  listen nicholas she said while ughtred of tyrnaus is king no help will come to us from any other nation and without help how can theos hold out against a hundred thousand turks we have few soldiers and fewer guns our population will be decimated our country laid waste and the end will be slavery it is for you to save us all it is you who can save theos  he looked at her with cold stern eyes  how long have you been the confidante of domiloff  it is only lately she answered that he has spoken to me of these things i think nicholas that he is afraid of you  perhaps reist remarked bitterly he mistook me for an honest man  it is freedom for theos she said softly and revenge upon the king whatever may befall him from our hands he has deserved  is domiloff still in theos he asked  she nodded  you will find him at the caf√© metropolitan she said only he is now a frenchman you must ask for monsieur abouyat  reist moved restlessly up and down the room often his fingers sought the place where his sword should have been  something i must do he muttered i might disguise myself as a peasant and fight in the ranks to be here idle is horrible to go to domiloffi cannot  he looked gloomily out into the darkness the inaction was unendurable she crossed the room to his side and laid her hand upon his arm  it is not by standing still nicholas or by indecision that you can preserve your country or avenge your honour she said go to domiloff hear what he has to say then ask yourself what is best for theos  domiloff has the tongue of a fiend he answered or a serpent i do not dare to trust myself with him russia would play us false in the end our freedom would be undermined i myself should be a puppet a doll at the beck and call of a master oh i know how these russians treat an independent state if once their fingers are upon her throat  you talk as though theos were not already doomed she cried what hope have we as it is nicholas have you ever thought what must happen when the turks have crossed the frontier you know their wayit is blood and fire and desolation have you considered the women and children nicholas  he groaned the recollection of former raids was lurid and terrible enough it was hard for him to see clearly and his scabbard was empty  i will go to domiloff he said at last i will hear what he has to say     chapter xxxv   it was very dark very stuffy and a strong malodorous suggestion of garlic pervaded the little caf√© the ordinary customers of the place preferred always the round tables outside and very few passed through the worn swing doors which led to the gloomy interior the two men who occupied one of the small partitions had the place to themselves  it is not the time this for any weak scruples my dear reist domiloff was saying theos in a weeks time will be either a russian state forever or once more a free country with a ruler who is one of her own sons and in whom my master can repose every confidence you see i am very frank with you i admit that this attack upon your country is the will and the decree of russia it was broached in london confirmed in st petersburg and planned in constantinople yet believe me it was conceived in no spirit of enmity to theos it is simply this we will not have a tyrnaus upon the throne of theos  your country reist answered hoarsely has no great reputation for generosity what are we to pay for our freedom you would not have me believe that there is no price  there is none was the quiet answer which you as a patriot and a thetian need hesitate to pay we should require the abolition of the present edict prohibiting russians from holding public offices and a few more such unimportant concessions they are nothing they will serve only to knit our countries more closely together in friendship  reist laughed hardly  yet i think he said that the freedom of theos would become somewhat of a jest were i to accept your terms  the alternative domiloff remarked may seem more pleasing to you yet i have heard people say unpleasant things of the turkish yoke  theos is not yet conquered reist answered ughtred to do him justice is a soldier and my people have the love of fighting born in their hearts  the odds are too greatand you know it was the quiet reply besides the turkish army is led by russians and supplied with russian artillery the result is certain  there may be intervention  from whom domiloff asked smiling france is the monkey who dances to my masters musicaustria is bound to us germany is geographically powerless  there is england  domiloff laughed outright  england as a european power he declared has ceased to exist a few dutch farmers have pricked the bubble of her military reputation if she should have the sublime impudence to lift her voice we should treat her with the contempt she has earned no reist there will be no intervention your brave thetians will be cut to pieces your country will be pillaged and burned your women will become the consorts of the turkish soldiery your ladies will go to grace a turkish harem these things must be unless you have the courage to hold out your hand you call yourself a patriot prove it the issue is plain enough  the words bit into reists heart he sat in gloomy silence from afar off he seemed to hear the battlecry of his beloved soldiers the thunder of hoofs the flashing steel the glory of the charge thrilled his blood there was patriotism indeedthere where the lances dripped red and the bullets flew and he nicholas of reist sat skulking in the back room of a doubtful caf√© safely out of harms reach talking treason with one who had ever been the foremost of his countrys enemies  you bought metzger he said and the people cast him out you may buy me and yet the people will not accept your terms they will not have russians in authority over them the hatred of your country is a religion with them  they believe in you as they would believe in no other man domiloff answered you can make the situation clear to them in your heart you know that it is their only salvation  they may save their skins reist admitted but after all life is a short thing it is better to die like gods than to live like slaves  domiloff shook his head  my friend he said there is but one life that we know anything of and it should not be lightly thrown away you can save theos if you will supposing however that you are obstinatethat you cling to your ancient prejudiceswell what will you do then consider your position you have quarrelled with the king your place in the army has gone you have surrendered your sword how can you ever show yourself in theos again who lingered here in the hour of battle be wise my friend before you there is but one possible course take it the day will come when every man who calls himself a thetian will bless your name  or curse it reist muttered  curse it indeed domiloff answered if you play the coward it is the hour now for a strong man to rise you are that man ughtred of tyrnaus whom you call your king is even now forging the fetters to lead theos into slavery it is for you to thrust him aside and save your people  his is the nobler way reist cried bitterly domiloff i can listen to you no longer i am not the man you seek my feet are not used to these tortuous ways i will ask the kings pardon he will give me back my sword and i can at least find a glorious death  you can fight then for a king who has deprived you of your sword domiloff whispered you can forgive him the insult he has thrust upon your sister you can bear to think of her slighted for the daughter of an american tradesman who is ughtred of tyrnaus that he should do this thing and that the duke of reist should ask his pardon  reist ground his teeth  i can force my way into the ranks and fight unknown he said hoarsely it would be better to die there than to live to listen to your poisonous whisperings i do not trust you domiloff i cannot i have no pledge that you would keep your word  a sudden change flashed into the white face of the russian he sat perfectly stilllistening reist opened his lips to ask a question but it remained unasked he too heard the sound somewhere behind the partition a mans breathing was distinctly audible domiloffs hand sought his pocket and he rose softly to his feet  the intruder whoever he might be did not hesitate for a second he leaped through the window by which he had entered and ran down the passage domiloff followed him and peering forward fired a couple of shots in rapid succession apparently they were fruitless for the fugitive gained the open space in front of the caf√© and mingled with the crowd there was a rush of bystanders towards the two men but domiloff raised his hands and cried in thetian  a turk a turk a spy follow him  there was a rush across the street domiloff and reist exchanged rapid glances with one another  a spy indeed but a spy from the other side domiloff muttered i wonder how much he heard  but reist was speechless to him the interruption had come like the awakening from a horrible dream there was a man thena man of theos who knew him for a traitor  the hue and cry had left them alone suddenly domiloff stooped down a soft felt hat lay almost at their feet through the brim and crown was a small round hole  it is his hat domiloff muttered why did i not aim an inch lower  he struck a match and looked for the name inside the lining it was scott and co bond street london  reist felt his cheeks burn though the night was cool domiloffs voice sounded unnaturally calm  it was the englishman then walter brand good  the kings friend reist faltered  domiloff nodded  i do not think he said that he will ever see the king again     chapter xxxvi   late that night a man stood motionless amongst the shrubs in the garden of the reist house his eyes were fixed always upon a certain window where a light was burning he muttered often to himself and the things which he said were not pleasant to hear he was tired and cramped with his long waitingyet so long as that light burned he dared not approach the house  there came to him at last a welcome sound a light footstep and the trailing of a skirt upon the gravel path he leaned forward  countess i am here  marie stooped to pluck a flower and slipped behind the shrub they were now invisible from the house  you received my note he asked  yes  it was more than two hours ago i am cold and tired with waiting was it necessary to keep me here so long  quite she answered i came as soon as it was safe  who has been with your brother tonight he asked  how do you know that we have not been alone  he pointed to the light still burning in the window  that light he said see it is just extinguished your visitor has gone  she laughed bitterly  you are well servedby my servants she said  it is for all our interests the visitor  it was general kolashin  the general himself  yes he came to reason with my brother about giving up his command  domiloff frowned  your brother did not waver  he wavered a good deal but for me i think that he would have returned to camp i am sorry now that i interfered  you are not in a pleasant humour tonight i fear countess  i am never in a pleasant humour when i have to do withsuch as you treason and deceit are ugly things to us at least baron domiloff  i do not agree with your terms countess he answered but this is scarcely the place or the time for argument your brother  he awaits you  he has spoken of our interview  yes  and you have told him  to beware of baron domiloff she answered coolly  he bent over to read her face uncertain in the dim twilight  you are jesting he murmured  it is very possible she admitted  she turned away from him and looked towards the hills the muttering of artillery still continued domiloff was uneasy  countess he said i must go in to your brother for this evening we were overheard in the caf√© metropolitan and i am not safe in the city any longer but i pray you to tell me this what is your brothers disposition concerning these matters of which we have talked  she shook her head  i cannot tell you i have done what i can but he himself is torn with doubts and fears the sound of the guns and the thought of the fighting goads him to madness i have done what i promised through me he has broken with the king and i have sent him to you the rest you should have accomplished  and so i should domiloff declared fiercely but for that cursed interruption it is ill to do with men who do not know their own minds  or with women in the like straits my friend she murmured  he shot a quick glance at her  of you he declared quietly i have no fear you would not see this american girl queen of theos i do not think that you would stand in waiting before her throne  maries face was for a moment white with passion she seemed as though she would strike him domiloff watched her narrowly he liked to be sure of every one with whom he had to deal and there were times when she eluded him  no she answered at last it is not likely that i should do that baron domiloff i will show you the way to my brothers room  one moment  he touched her arm she drew it away with an angry exclamation domiloff was not without vanity and his personal repugnance to her which she was at no pains to hide galled him for a moment he dared not trust himself to speak  will you be so good as to remember she said with cutting force that my toleration of you is on account of theos and theos only personally i hate all conspirators and plotters the idea of this sort of thing and everybody connected with it is loathsome to me  he bowed low it was as well that she could not see his face  countess he said you will excuse my familiarity but there was a matteran urgent matterwhich i had yet to mention to you there is a man who must die unless he leaves theos in fourandtwenty hours i have heard him called your friendelse he were a dead man at this moment  she looked at him doubtfully  you do not mean the king  no i mean walter brand the english journalist  she started domiloff watched her keenly  what has he done she asked  what has he not done you remember his first appearance here  she laughed softly  i remember it very well she answered he was bold enough to befool the wily baron domiloffto play with him and beat him at his own game yes his first coming i remember very well indeed  the darkness hid domiloffs face his voice was under perfect control  i bear him no special grudge for that domiloff said but it was only the beginning he has done his very best to oppose us throughout he is the kings most intimate friend he is our most dangerous enemy his letters from here are influencing the whole european press in england they have created a sensation and in germany also they have been translated into every language and copied everywhere the time has come when they must cease  she felt the significance of his words she was not altogether unmoved under his close scrutiny  he is an englishman she said and it is dangerous to interfere with englishmen  nevertheless it must be done he declared tonight it has become a matter of urgency  how so  because not content with the mischief which he has already done he must needs play the spy upon one or both of us tonight he was at the caf√© metropolitan and overheard some part of my conversation with your brother  a sudden colour flushed her cheeks her eyes were bright  he is a brave man she cried  domiloff shrugged his shoulders  the difference between a brave man and a fool he said is so slight but listen countess you wish his life spared  if harm comes to him through you or any of your creatures she cried with a little burst of passion i will go to the king and have you hung in the marketplace  there was a moments silence domiloff was staggered by her bold words  countess he said his safety lies with you i give you this opportunity to warn him  to warn him but i do not know where he is marie protested besides he would not heed me  tomorrow domiloff answered i may be able to acquaint you with his whereabouts i must at least have him watched and his dispatches intercepted he is absolutely our most dangerous opponent  but even if he were to receive a message from me he would not come if he were at the front marie said  he comes every day to theos to send off his cables domiloff answered i shall send you word where he is and you must send for him it is absolutely necessary that he come over to our side  he is not the kind of man to desert a losing cause marie said he would not listen to me  domiloff gave vent to an impatient gesture  he must listen to you countess or die he said  she looked him in the face  you will remember my threat baron domiloff she said those were no idle words  he bowed low  we will go to your brother he said     chapter xxxvii   the king entered from his antechamber and took his place at the head of the long table amidst a profound and depressing silence the faces of his counsellors were grave indeed the military members were all at the front those who remained were the merchants and men of peace and to them the guns whose roar seemed ever increasing spelled ruin  old baron doxis took the chair he opened the proceedings with dim eyes and a shaking voice theos was dear to him but so also were his sons and nephews some of whom he could scarcely hope to see again the routine business was quickly dispensed with the king in a few sentences told them the war news of the day  then baron doxis rose again  your majesty he said this meeting of our inner council you yourself have pronounced an wholly informal one we are sitting here with closed doors we are all i believe patriots and thetians let me ask your majesty therefore if every means have been tried to avoid the destruction which threatens us  the faces of all were turned towards the king  my friends he said slowly i have heard it whispered not amongst you perhaps but yet amongst those who might have known me better that this war is the outcome of my own military activity that it is a war which might have been prevented let me implore you not to give credit to any such idea it is a cruel war an unjust war andwe must look the worst in the face it may mean the extinction of theos as an independent nation but it has been brutally thrust upon us we have been powerless to avoid it we have given no offence we have striven for peace knowing that by peace alone we can prosper the pretext for the commencement of hostilities was a false one an absolutely faithful account of all that passed between effenden pascha and ourselves has been set down on paper and forwarded to constantinoplealso to every court in europe i have appealed to every reigning sovereign for intercession what is left to us but to fight the enemy have crossed our frontier but for our dispositions and the bravery of our soldiers they would be even now at the gates of theos if i failed in my duty tell me where what could i have done  baron doxis rose up again  your majesty he said we do not presume to doubt your word we believe in the justice of our cause and we will believe that these movements on the part of the turks are movements of ruthless aggression but bearing in mind our hopeless inferiority in numbers i must ask whether any steps have been taken to ascertain the terms on which peace would be granted to us  the kings face was set and grave  baron doxis he said we have not yet approached the commanderinchief of the turkish forces on this subject but i can tell you well what the answer would be the surrender of your army of our city the pillaging of our houses the outraging of our women have you not yet learned how the turks make war  baron doxis remained upon his feet he passed his trembling hand along his snowwhite beard  your majesty he said these are the days of civilized warfare and it is possible that more restraint might be exercised over the turkish soldiery now than in the days gone by i humbly submit that the demands of the invaders be ascertained and submitted to us  the king remained silent for a minute then he looked up and though his lips trembled his voice was firm enough  you can send your instructions to general dartnoff he said i shall not interfere at the same time i feel bound to tell you that i look upon any such appeal as hopeless we have no hope save in god in our arms and from the possible intercession of one or more of the powers  tavener a merchant who was suspected of jewish descent rose timidly to his feet  your majesty has come tonight from the seat of war he said may we ask of these rumours concerning the duke of reist it is rumoured that the duke has abandoned his command and returned his sword to your majesty  the rumour is correct the king answered  there was an uneasy murmur of voices baron doxis rose  your majesty we should esteem some further particulars as to this action on the part of the duke of reist we have always been accustomed to consider him one of the born leaders of this country  the resignation of the duke ughtred said is due to a personal matter which i am not at liberty to explain to you no one can regret it more than i do  an ominous silence followed ughtred was conscious of it yet there seemed to be nothing which he could do to dispel it he knew that the loyalty of these men was being sorely taxed in their hearts they believed him responsible for the war this severance with reist encouraged them in their belief baron doxis rose slowly to his feet  your majesty he said slowly as the oldest member of this council as the oldest inhabitant of theos here present will you permit me to say a word respecting the duke of reist  the king inclined his head  i am prepared to hear you baron doxis he said  the duke of reist doxis continued is the sole representative of the one family in theos who for centuries have served their country faithfully as true patriots the duke of reist it was who is solely responsible for the restoration of the monarchy it was he who found your majesty out and brought you here to reign over us  ughtred looked up  i am conscious he said of all that nicholas of reist has done for theos i know too what i personally owe him i believe him at heart to be a true and devoted patriot yet for all this the quarrel between us is not of my seeking i cannot go to him and order him into the field seek him yourselves if you will he has spoken words to me which no one not even the first noble in christendom has a right to use to his sovereign i pass that over i demand no apology let him resume his place in the field and his command if he will i would not place my own dignity before the good of theos the assembly is dismissed gentlemen  the king retired to his own apartments his servant was in waiting  your majesty has four hours before the time appointed for the special train he announced the sleeping chamber is prepared  ughtred waved him away  i shall not retire he said leave me alone  he leaned forward in his easychair and buried his face in his hands only a month ago life had seemed such a fair thing he had been full of plans and dreams he had envied no man in europe and now he seemed hemmed about with disaster he was no longer the hero of the people he had lost his best friendbetween his counsellors and himself an ominous gulf was widening every hour there were whispers of treason in the city his isolation would soon become an accomplished fact almost his courage failed him  the door was softly opened and closed he looked up wearily then sprang to his feet it was sara who was coming across the room towards him with outstretched hands  sara  he took her into his arms from which she presently escaped and carefully disengaged herself already he felt better at the sight of her  how did you come here sara he asked  i used your ring she answered showing it to him father is in the next room  your father has been very useful he said he has been out with the engineer all day  she laughed  he is amusing himself but ughtred i came to talk to you for a moment they tell me that you are going back to the front directly  i must be there at daybreak he answered until then we have granted them an armisticeto bury their dead  she nodded  i hear all about it i was in the fieldhospital all day and the wounded were brought in shouting with joy it was a great fight ughtred  an answering gleam flashed in his eyes  you should have been a soldiers daughter sara  her face was suddenly grave she was standing by his side with her hands loosely clasped behind her her eyes upturned to his  ughtred she said i have come here to say something to you there have been rumours of a quarrel between you and the reists is that true  there is something of the sort he admitted  they say that the duke of reist has thrown up his command  yes  is it true ughtred that you went through some sort of a betrothal ceremony with the countess of reist  he laughed heartily then he told her the story she listened with grave face  you were scarcely to blame she said when he had finished but ughtred i have begun to understand what should have been plain to me from the firstwhat you too should have thought of perhaps our engagement would never be welcomed by your people they love the old families and the old names it would make you unpopular and i believe it is at the bottom of your disagreement with the reists you must forget what you said dear it is best indeed  he turned upon her for the moment almost fiercely he was overwrought  you too he exclaimed my god how lonely people can leave a king when the evil times come  he saw her look of pain and the tears fill her eyes he turned suddenly and threw his arms about her  you love me sara you do not want to take that back  you know that i do not she answered  then put these things away from you till these troubles are past at least let me have you to think of and fight for afterwards we will speak of them again  she assented gladly  only i want you to know ughtred she said that i will never become your wife if it is to lessen your hold upon your people here i wish they could know it some of these poor wounded soldiers look at me as if i were their enemy why it is terrible  he smiled reassuringly  when the war is over we will talk of this seriously he answered listen  he threw up the blind it was still dark and apparently raining but away eastwards there was a break in the clouds and the stars were paler in the courtyard below a carriage was waiting he dropped the blind hastily picked up his cloak  i must go sara he declared wish me luck dear  she clung to him with suddenly swimming eyes her lips trembledher face was very wistful  oh my dear my dear she cried softly if only i could bring you luck if only i could be your mascotte  he laughed cheerily his arms were around her and she was comforted  there is no better mascotte for a man in this world he declared than the touch of the woman he loves send me back to the front dear with your kisses upon my lips and the sound of your voice in my ears and i promise you that you shall hear great news  when ughtred passed out a few minutes later a rumour went through the palace that good news had come for the king held his head high and his eyes were as the eyes of a man who goes forth to victory looking upon pleasant things     chapter xxxviii   throughout the night there was little attempt at sleep in the thetian camp long lines of men relieved every two hours that they might work at the utmost speed were busy in the valley digging entrenchments guns were being dragged up to the heights and signalling stations fixed with dawn came a proclamation from the king freely issued about the camp       men of theos and soldiers of the thetian army       the thanks of the state are due to you for your brave fight      yesterday you and your gallant leaders i am glad to tell      you that at althea pass and morania the enemy were also      repulsed with great loss so far then the fighting has gone      wholly in our favour let us thank god who has strengthened      the arm of those whose cause is just who resist an      unwarranted and iniquitous invasion of their native land       the precautions which have been taken to guard against this      act of brigandage encourage us to hope for success we are      not taken unawares since my accession to the throne of my      ancestors i have as you know devoted every effort to      strengthening our defences to preparing so far as      preparation was possible for the position in which we find      ourselves today althea pass is almost impregnable i do      not believe that the turks will ever pass alive through the      moranian defiles here it is that the final struggle must      take place it is you my soldiers who must bear the great      burden of the fighting the place of honour is yours and      the place of honour may be the place of death it is meet      therefore that i your king should be with you i have      therefore decided to take over the supreme command from your      valiant and respected leader general dartnoff and to lead      you personally into battle with gods help and your valour      i have every trust and every hope in the future i need not      remind you that our cause is just and great we fight for      our homesi for my palace you for your homesteadsas      brothers together we fight for our freedom for our      womenkind and the freedom of those who are to come after      us for my part i pledge myself to this there shall be no      submission on terms that i will ever accept save those which      leave theos as free in the future as it is today for your      part i ask you only to quit yourselves like the thetians of      old to believe in me and obey to remember always that god      is with the weak and he will surely protect us strike      hard obey unflinchingly and if the whispers of treason      should reach your ears scorn it as did those others who have      fought before you do this and i will lead you to victory  at dawn a single horseman attended by a small escort galloped down from the shed where the light railway from theos ended general dartnoff and a little group of officers stood in front of the formers quarters  it is reist at last one exclaimed  but the general shook his head  it is the king he declared see he is riding his own horse  the old battlecry rang like music in the kings ears as he galloped down the lines he was fair to look upon in the faint early sunlight bronzed and manly a born soldier with a dash of the enthusiast the men fresh from reading his proclamation welcomed him with thunderous cheers their shouts rose to the skies and ughtred breathed more freely for these were reists men and it was reists place which he must fill  your majesty is welcome to the camp general dartnoff said saluting we were looking for the duke of reist  the king passed into the tent and motioned the general and the other officers to follow them then he turned and faced them  general dartnoff he said i regret to inform you that the duke of reist has resigned his command  blank astonishment was written into their faces the thing was incredible  i beg your majestys pardon general dartnoff said with some hesitation but do we indeed hear you rightly the duke of reist has resigned his commandin time of warat such a time as this nicholas of reist  it is unfortunately true the king repeated  he is stricken with illness suddenly dartnoff asked  the king shook his head  i regret to say that the resignation of the duke of reist is due to a personal matter between myself and him in which he considers himself aggrieved  there was a moments silence quick glances were exchanged amongst the officers dartnoff was sorely puzzled  it was nicholas of reist who brought you here he said slowly it was his word and advicewhich  which made me king ughtred continued that is so general dartnoff and you gentlemen do not think that i treat this matter lightly it has been a great blow to mea great shock but listen the duke of reist has no cause of offence against me whatever he has been deceived and misled and i have a fancy that domiloff who they say is still lurking about theos is concerned in it  the generals face grew graver than ever  nicholas of reist he said would never stoop to secret dealings with such men as domiloff  i hope and believe not myself the king answered promptly but such men as domiloff work in the dark indirectly and some one has poisoned the mind of nicholas of reist against me but listen i repeat that the matter is a personal one for the moment it can well be left where it is i will promise you this after the war if theos still exists and i am alive i will meet the duke of reist before you general dartnoff and any three of our countrymen whom you may select and you shall judge between us if you find that i am in the wrong my abdication shall be at your service if you decide in my favour the duke of reists apology and his hand will be sufficient for me but remember that today we stand before the destinies of theos for gods sake do not let your loyalty or your faith in me be affected by this deeplytobedeplored incident to do so would be to play into the hands of those who have poisoned the mind of the duke of reist against me give me your trust a little longer i beg of you  general dartnoff stood in front of his officers and he did not hesitate the cloud had passed from his face  your majesty he said we accept yet with your permission i would ask you this question no man in theos loves his country better than nicholas of reist if he should desire to recall his words  the king held out his hand  i would offer it to him he said as freely as i offer it now to you  the cloud passed in substance away metterbeea senior officerrespectfully intervened  your majesty he said there is reists command  the king looked around him  i am going to make one more demand upon your loyalty he said gravely general dartnoff it is my wish that you take over the command of the duke of reists corps the chief command i am prepared to assume in person  general dartnoff smiled  if your majesty makes no more serious demands upon our loyalty than this he will be well served he answered there is no one more fit to command than you sir the present admirable disposition of our forces is yours not mine so far i have been no more than a figurehead your plan of entrenchments has been a revelation to all of us  there arose a little murmur of approval reists defection was amazing but this was the man who alone could save theos ughtred felt a glow of pride and gratitude as he shook hands with his chief officers  and now general he said i must ask you to transfer your staff to me in order that i may give some instructions the turkish lines are clearly in view from our positions i believe  the general bowed  we have reports every twenty minutes your majesty he answered anything in the nature of a surprise is impossible  very well ughtred said now general will you let me have in the course of halfanhour an escort of two hundred picked men i am going to enter solika  dartnoff dispatched an officer with instructions then he turned to the king  your majesty is aware of the state of affairs within the walls  ughtred nodded  yes i want the help of two or three residents of the city whose loyalty is above suspicion can you point out such to me  more than two or three i think your majesty dartnoff answered i will give their names to the officer commanding your escort  ughtred sat down at the head of the table  let them bring some coffee then at once in an hour i wish to start for solika the officers of my staff and you general dartnoff will please remain  breakfast was brought and ughtred talked for a few minutes to them all he then explained that during the campaign he desired to rank as general only to be addressed as sir to be treated as commanding officer and not as king for the most part the officers were thetians and austrothetians keen soldiers and well up to their work for in addition to their regular duties the drilling of the armed population had also devolved upon them ughtred looked them over and his heart grew lighter they were a little rough perhaps and somewhat uneasy at first in his presence but honest men and soldiers to the backbone  towards midday solika awoke into a state of wild excitement the king was at the town hall with many of the leading inhabitants and extraordinary rumours were flying about the civil populace was to be invited to bear arms foreigners were to be expelled a great blow was to be struck at the mixed population whose loyalty was doubtful fact followed fast upon the heels of rumour the little street caf√©s were thronged with eager groups all studying a proclamation wet from the press the station was thronged with trains all strangers must quit solika in twelve hours all residents not naturalized must take the oath of allegiance and hold themselves ready to bear arms or leave in twentyfour hours property would be respected as far as possible but the war laws of theos had known no modification for five hundred years and on every wall appeared copies of the statute and a schedule of treasonable practices the penalty for which was death solika was in an uproar a hasty but secret meeting of russians was held at the house of the consul it was broken up by a detachment of soldiers and every person there conducted in a guarded train to the frontier ughtred himself rode through the streets and read in the faces of the angry crowds their extraction and where their sympathy lay there was scarcely a native thetian there for the men of theos were excellent farmers and tillers of the land but poor shopkeepers their wants were supplied by jews and russians who robbed them regularly and were only too ready now to welcome the coming of a richer race ughtred returned to the town hall and knew that he had done well  on the steps he stopped short he was face to face with the man whom more than any other at that moment he desired to meet it was brand     chapter xxxix   at last brand exclaimed with a gesture of relief i have been looking for you everywhere  ughtred glanced round they were surrounded by a considerable crowd  you have something important to say to me brand  yes  ughtred motioned to an orderly  procure a fresh horse for mr brand he said you will ride back to camp with me brand we shall be away from this rabble then  it was not until they were absolutely alone that brand spoke  your majesty he said nicholas of reist is a traitor  the king turned in his saddle  i cannot believe that my friend he said reist has quarrelled with me personally and has resigned his command in the army but that does not make him a traitor  perhaps not brand answered drily but association with domiloff does  ughtred started his face and his tone alike gave evidence of his unbelief he even smiled  you are mistaken my dear brand he said reist is a patriot and a nobleman he would never stoop to league himself with such scum  i presume that my eyes are sufficient evidence brand answered quietly i myself saw reist and domiloff meet last night at a low caf√© in theos i overheard part of their conversation  the kings face was as the face of a man who has received a blow for a moment or two he remained silent  they may have met by accident he said at last looking halffearfully towards brand domiloff may have proposed things to reist but he would not listen no he surely would not listen  you are mistaken brand declared grimly he met domiloff by appointment and he listened with interest to all that he had to say  how do you know this brand the king asked  i have been watching the place for some timeand domiloff it ought to be burned it is a hotbed of treason and russian intrigue i saw the meeting and heard part of the conversation unfortunately i was discovered  you were discovered ughtred repeated  and domiloff put a bullet through my hat brand continued i escaped but it was a close thing since then i have had an opportunity of appreciating how widespread have been domiloffs snares my life has been attempted twice and i have been misled by forged letters as to your whereabouts i have been to althea and morania in search of you  and you heard some part of what passed between domiloff and reist  yes domiloff offered reist the crown of theos and russian intervention in the present war  and russian protection afterwards i suppose ughtred remarked bitterly  that is of course what is behind it all brand assented  the face of the king grew stern and thoughtful there was silence between the two men for some time  if any other man had told me of this ughtred said at last frankly i should not have believed them it was nicholas of reist who was always warning me of russia and russian intrigue he seemed to read domiloff like a book  the quarrel which you spoke of between yourself and reist brand said thoughtfullywas it serious  it was forced upon me ughtred answered the countess most unfortunately came to my room last night by the secret passage to warn me againstwell brand i do not see why i should not be frank with youagainst an alliance with sara van decht  she cameof her own willwithout any suggestion from you brand asked  of course ughtred answered i may not be a model of etiquette but i should never dream of soliciting of welcoming an interview from even so old a friend as the countess of reist under such circumstances well in the midst of our conversation which i was doing my best to curtail her brother arrived unexpectedly from solika and found us together he chose to consider her presence in my room compromising and demanded that i should marry her after thatchaos as i told you reist has given up his command and deserted me i believe that i have promised to fight him after the war is over  and the countess brand asked  the king smiled bitterly  she too seems to be my enemy though why i cannot imagine she at any rate can bear no illwill to me over that unfortunate affair of the betrothal cup for she has told me plainly that she loves another man  brands horse seemed to stumble and his face was invisible for a moment as he stooped down to pat her neck when he looked up there was a curious gleam in his eyes  your majesty he said i am very sorry that this has happened i believe that domiloff is working very hard to induce the duke of reist to join in his plot against you  the king looked sorrowfully away  nicholas was my one friend here he said i have only my soldiers now god grant that their lives may not be frittered awaythat we may not lose by treason what we gain in battle  they talked for a while of the campaign brand from his brief visit to althea and morania was already conversant with the plan of operations an old war correspondent the muttering of the guns was like music to him  you should be able to hold your positions for a fortnight he declared and by that time theos will be ready for a siege i see that you are making preparations for a retreat there  the women and children are being sent away every hour the king answered i know that my men here are staunch and so far as they are concerned the turks will find nothing but a heap of smoking ruins when they enter theos it is not the actual fighting which troubles me brand  brand looked into the kings anxious face and found there some clue to his doubtful words he pointed with his riding whip to the distant city  it is treachery which you fear he remarked softly  ughtred nodded  i will tell you he said there is something going on there which i cannot understand it is domiloffs work i am sure of that at the meeting of the council last night i seemed to be somehow conscious of a general atmosphere of intrigue there is something going on behind my back doxis plainly hinted that it would be better to make terms than waste the whole country by an impossible resistance and when i asked him terms with whom he was silent we know that the turks have no terms to offer save unconditional surrender what did he mean then  i fear brand said that domiloffs schemes are more deeply laid than we at first believed what a pity that he was ever allowed to remain in theos  i sent him to the frontier once ughtred said he came back secretly  but your police  theos has no police now ughtred answered they are fighting at althea we could not afford to leave a hundred ablebodied men in the city  brand reined in his horse the two men were on a hill from which the outposts of the turkish army were distinctly visible brand took out his glasses and swept the country steadily for several minutes  i have a proposition to make he said after he had finished his survey i do not think that there will be any fighting today if you like i will return to theos and endeavour to find out what is going on  the king held out his hand  if you will do this for me he said simply it will be the service of a friend i think that i need friends now very badly  so brand turned his horses head towards theos and the king rode down into the camp alone     chapter xl   you  marie of reist rose with a sudden swift movement from the sofa where she had been lying  i trust that my visit is not as unwelcome as it seems to be surprising he remarked crossing the room towards her i am taking advantage  she held up her handa quick impulsive gesture of silence  hush she whispered do not say another word follow me and tread lightly  he followed her into the circular stone wall hung with ancient paintings and where no light ever came save through those wonderful stained glass windows the gift of an emperor to rudolph of tyrnaus they passed along a passage up some stairs and into a sittingroom she closed the door softly and stood for a moment with her hand still upon the handle listening then as all seemed quiet below the fear passed from her eyes and she smiled upon him  are you mad to come here she asked softly you ought not to show yourself in the streets do you not know that you are the most unpopular person in theos  i can assure you that i was not aware of it he answered in any case who in this house would be likely to wish me harm  you are quite safe here i think she answered ignoring his question my brother and some friends were in the next room downstairs i was afraid that they might hear your voice  he sat down on the sofa beside her  i am not inclined he said to quarrel with my good fortune but as a matter of fact it is your brother whom i wish to see there is no reason why i should notthat i know of  she shook her head  nevertheless she said be content to stay with me it will be better for you oh yes a very great deal better  brand moved a little nearer it was certain that there was much which he could learn from her  it is very pleasant to see you again countess he remarked  she shrugged her shoulders  countess  the colour flushed under his tanned cheeks he looked away  marie thenif you will permit  i do permit she murmured only you must not say it very oftenuntil i get used to it oh my friend how glad i am to see you and yet how dangerous it is why do you go on filling all the newspapers in europe with your letters from theos and your praises of the king you have made enemies here you are even now being sought for  he smiled grimly  i thought that i must be becoming unpopular he said people are so anxious to find me that they send bulletsmostly very badly aimed onesafter me in the street i do not understand it  she shuddered and glanced nervously around her the window by which they sat was commanded by another in the eastward wing of the house she looked at it for a moment and her eyes were full of fear once more  even now she murmured i believe that we are being watched look do you see anything  he stood by her side but the window was empty enough below the square and streets beyond were strangely empty a sense of desolation brooded over the place  i see nothing he answered i really dont think that we need alarm ourselves  she drew him away to the lounge heaped with furs and drawn up to the fire an easel was standing in one corner of the room and behind a piano the walls were hung with watercolours and sketches and the air was fragrant with the odour of burning logs beyond was an inner apartment  you are the first man except nicholas my brother she said who has ever been in here remember that please and be very obedient you will do all that i tell you will you promise  blindly he answered if you will ask me nothing impossible  i shall not do that i am going to ask you something for your own good you must leave off writing those letters to the english newspapers  he was suddenly very quiet and still but he turned and looked at her  why  because it is for your safety for the good of theos and because it is my wish  your wishand whose else  my brothers  there was a moments silence she saw signs of a new sternness about the closelydrawn lips the steelgrey eyes from which a momentary tenderness seemed to have vanished  it is true then what i hear he said slowly your brother has deserted the king  the change in her mood matched his she drew herself up and looked at him with flashing eyes and uplifted head  my brother will not continue his allegiance to a sovereign who proposes to raise a tradesmans daughter to the throne of theos and who has offered an insult to our family  i am sorry to hear you talk like this he answered the king has not willingly affronted you it was your brother to whom he owes his throne he has not forgotten ithe is never likely to forget it he regarded you both as his best friends here as for sara van decht the king would take no step without the sanction and consent of his people she will be one of the richest women in europe and the whole of her dowry would be spent for the good of theos even then if the voice of the people were against it the king would yield the one aim of his life is the welfare of theos and her people  so far in his care of them she said scornfully he has met with but little success when before have the turks crossed the frontier of our territory when before have we been in such grievous straits as these  for these things he answered the king is blameless this invasion of theos is a long planned undertaking nothing could have stopped it i believe that no other man in the world would have met the situation with so much skill and so resourcefully  she was silent for a moment her very calmness seemed ominous it seemed to him that underneath she was trembling with passion  marie he said i wonder that you are so blinded by this senseless prejudice against the king but leave him for the moment out of the question you love your country for centuries the name of your family has been a great one in the history of theos yet today both you and your brother are making a terrible mistake you are drifting towards her enemies  enough she cried i can see that you are still for the king  most surely he answered  you will not discontinue those letters  no  she pointed to the door  find your way outif you can she ordered furiously i do not care what becomes of you only leave me  he took a quick step towards her and grasped her wrists  marie he said with a sudden hoarse passion you can send me out to be shot if you like but you shall kiss me first  her anger passed away like magic her slender arms drew his face down to hers her eyes were soft with tears  dear she murmured you shall not leave me like this i thought that you had come here to join usbecause you knew that i wanted you and you speak only of the king as your friendwho is our enemy will you not be reasonable there are brighter days in store for theos stay with us and share them  he shook his head sadly  you are being deceived he said there is only one man who can save this country and that man is ughtred of tyrnaus he is honestdomiloff is a rogue these schemes of his have but one possible ending and that is slavery for theosthe total loss of her independence oh it is all so plain mariedomiloffs wiles are so transparent let me see your brother and reconcile him to the king  it is too late she answered it is impossible  i have come here with a message from the king to him he declared i must at least deliver it  her eyes gleamed with passion suddenly she threw her arms around his neck  you are very foolish and i dont know why i should care for you she cried but i do i do listen this is not your country you are not a thetian subject the king has no claim upon you if you will not help us go away until it is all over you can easily do that go away and wait i will send for you when it is all over you will see then that i was right no you must not kiss me any more dear you must do as i say listen  she sprang away from him there were footsteps in the corridor outside her face was ashen a look of terror flashed in her eyes  they have found you out she cried it is domiloff and his men heaven help us     chapter xli   but after all it was only nicholas of reist who entered he closed the door behind him carefully and approached them brand stepped forward  i have a message for you he said  reist smiled  a message which it seems you found necessary to deliver to my sister he remarked i have not been informed of your desire to see me  i should not have left the house without doing so brand answered my message is from the king  proceed  reist stood motionless before the window in the clear daylight the physical change in the man was painful enough to witness the flesh had fallen away from his cheeks leaving great hollows underneath his eyes his forehead was furrowed with lines his pallor was unnatural and unwholesome brand saw these things and wondered more than ever how the defection of such a man could have been brought about  the king bade me seek you out and remind you that in all human probability before tomorrows sun has set the great battle will have been fought the turks are concentrating before solika and it is there that we shall fight your men are asking for you at such a crisis in the history of your country the king does not believe that you will be content to sit in idleness he bids you come and afterwards seek for redress if any is needed in the matters which rest between you and him  i thank you reist said slowly to the king i return no answer to his message to you i say this i have lost confidence in ughtred of tyrnaus i regret that my hand ever raised him to the throne i recognize him no longer as the ruler of this country  then you are a rebel brand exclaimed is that what you mean  reists dark eyes were lit with fire  be careful sir he said fiercely those are not the words to be used to a duke of reist by inheritance and by virtue of my name i too am the guardian of these people of theos i have lived with them all my life as did my fathers and my grandfathers before me their freedom and their happiness are a solemn charge to me i have come to the conclusion that ughtred of tyrnaus is not able to maintain for them either  then who is brand asked this war is none of his seeking how in gods name could he do more for theos than stand at the head of her people with drawn sword prepared to die rather than submit to this barbarous invasion is there higher patriotism than this  the king is your friend reist answered and you judge him from your own standpoint yet i am willing to admit that he is a brave man few cowards have ever sprung from thetian stock but bravery is not everything and in the present case it can avail him nothing the odds are too overwhelming if theos is to be saved it will not be at the point of the sword  brand was within an ace of losing his temper his cheeks were flushed and his voice was not so steady as usual  theos will never be saved by those who plot with such rogues as domiloff behind the city walls he exclaimed duke of reist i know you to be a brave man or i would not dare to use these words to you you are being grossly deceived the turks and now you are the catspaw of russia domiloffs mission is to secure theos for a russian state oh cant you see through his miserable scheming i am an outsider in the game perhaps for that reason i am the better judgei see the clearer it is so simple there will be a supposed rising of the people you or another of domiloffs puppets will be set up as king or protector the hand of turkey will be stayed i grant you but at the cost of an indemnity which you will never be able to pay there will be a russian loan secured upon the customs and the receipts of the country every link in the chain of bondage is as clear as day russians will stream over your frontiers and settle in your cities everywhere theos will have to give way to the new influence in ten years at the most the thing will be complete theos will become a second poland duke of reist you are at heart a patriot and a brave soldier but you are no match for domiloff in what he would call his modern diplomacy arrest him his presence in the city is illegal you have every justification out to the camp and take your place by the kings side i know something of war and i know that your cause is far from hopeless at least you can hold the turks in check and i tell you that intervention is no longer a dream england is at this moment hesitating and if she moves germany will stand by her dont make the mistake of your life take down your sword order your horses and ride with me to solika  it was obvious that reist was moved a spot of colour burned in his cheeks and he glanced for a moment at his sister as though for guidance she too was agitated brand turned to her  countess he exclaimed will you not add your words to mine i come here as your friend the king is guiltless of all offence towards you plead with your brother beg him to ride with me to the king  she laid her hand softly upon his  my friend she said you have spoken like a brave man and an honest man and both my brother and i respect you very much for it but you are a stranger here and we are thetians we know our country and her needs better than you we do not believe that ughtred of tyrnaus is the man to save her he is too what you call in the west democratic for an ancient kingdom the heart of the people is not with him as for domiloff we do not trust wholly to him we are not quite so blind as you would have us believe yet we need friendsand believe mewe shall know how to reward them stay here with us mr brand we will try to treat you so that you shall never regret it  the upward glance of her dark eyes was eloquent enough but brand only shook his head  i am for the king he said  and i the duke of reist said with a sudden vehemence am for my country mr brand you are answered you have my permission to repeat the whole of our conversation to the king now as to yourself you are a brave man and i do not care to see harm come to such leave this house at once marie will show you an exit from this side you are in danger from which even i am powerless to protect you  i thank you brand answered taking up his hat your friend domiloff is i suppose still anxious as to my whereabouts and in all probabilityhere he is     chapter xlii   there was a sharp tap at the door marie and her brother exchanged quick glances brand stepped forward but marie waved him back  who is there she called out  it is i baron domiloff was the suave answer i regret very much to intrude but i have urgent business with your friend mr brand can i come in  she hesitated after all any attempt to keep him out must be futile  you can come in she answered  the door opened and domiloff entered he bowed low before the countess but there was an evil smile upon his lips when his eyes met brands  this is a very fortunate meeting mr brand he declared it saves us the trouble of searching for you only an hour ago my dear sir the countess and i were speaking of you  so far as the countess was concerned brand answered dryly i am honoured  domiloff shrugged his shoulders he turned to nicholas with a smile which was meant to be goodhumoured  mr brand imagines perhaps that i bear him some illwill for that previous little rencontre between us in which by the bye i must admit that i had very much the worst of it i can assure him most sincerely that it is not so  brand shrugged his shoulders  we have met since then baron domiloff i think he said and even you must admit that a revolver bullet through ones hat is scarcely a message of good will  domiloff was bewildered was this a joke or was his friendhis very good friend mr walter brandunder some hallucination brand turned from him impatiently  the matter is not one which will repay discussion he said countess i regret that i must offer you my adieux  domiloff held up his hand  one moment he said persuasively we are all three here together now and the opportunity is too excellent to be lost the duke of reist the countess and i have something in common to say to you you will spare us a few momentsand your best attention my dear mr brand  by all means brand answered something in common to say to me sounds interesting i am at your service  it concerns the daily letters which you cable from here to london on behalf of the newspaper to which you are attached domiloff said slowly  indeed brand answered i am flattered that you should have troubled to read them  from a literary point of view domiloff admitted they are admirable politically i regret to say that we find them mischievous  brand laughed scornfully  perhaps you are not altogether an impartial judge he remarked will you proceed please  those letters i am afraid must be discontinued domiloff said  brand stared at him  dont talk rubbish he exclaimed must be discontinued indeed why i consider your objection to them the highest compliment which i could possibly receive as if anything which you could say would make me alter my views  domiloff smiled it was a very faint but a very evil smile  it is not he protested what i might say but what i might do i take it for granted that either the duke of reist or the countess has spoken with you on this matter and i will not therefore waste my breath it is sufficient to tell you this your present attitude is harmful to what we consider the best interests of theos you must either undertake to send no more cables or remain here as our prisoner  brand glanced towards the countess and in his eyes there was a merciless inquisitive light  so i am in a nest of conspirators he remarked dryly there is no longer any doubt about it i do not know baron domiloff what magic you use to pervert honest men but your success is certainly astounding now let me pass  with a quick movement his revolver flashed out and domiloff was covered perfectly selfpossessed the russian bowed and stood away from the door but brand reached it only to be confronted by halfadozen naked sabres the landing was held by a small company of russian soldiers  for the protection of the russian embassy baron domiloff remarked sardonically now mr brand will you put your revolver away and listen to reason  brand turned to marie he was white with rage  countess he demanded i entered this room at your invitation was this arranged for is this a trap of your setting  a little cry of pain broke from her lips she recovered herself almost immediately  did i know she asked that you were coming  he was silent in his heart he had already absolved her  countess he said forgive me i spoke hastily duke of reist i appeal to you this is your house and i entered it openly and upon a legitimate errand i remained here as your guest i demand a safe conduct from it order that man to remove his soldiers  marie stepped forward  nicholas she cried he is right we cannot have the reist house turned into a nest of brigands baron domiloff these are my apartments your presence is an intrusion which i do not choose to tolerate be so good as to withdraw and take your men with you  my dear lady he declared it is impossible  a fierce answer trembled upon maries lips but nicholas held out his hand  silence marie he said mr brand has made an appeal which it is very difficult for me to ignore he is under my roof and to some extent he is entitled to my protection but there are limits to the obligations even of hospitality there have been things spoken of in his presence which must not be repeated  the safety and welfare of theos domiloff said solemnly must eclipse all other considerations mr brand came here of his own accord  reist turned to brand  are you prepared he said to keep silence as to all that has transpired since you crossed the threshold of this house i will be content with your word of honour  no brand answered firmly i cannot make any such promise  marie turned upon them both with flaming cheeks  let the king know all she cried what does it matter now this is my house as well as yours nicholas and i say that mr brand shall leave it when and how he pleases baron domiloff i order you to withdraw and take your soldiers with you  but domiloff only shook his head  countess he said for your brothers sake and the sake of theos i cannot do as you ask this mans silence for a few days at least is the one thing necessary to secure our success  then my silence will be the silence of death brand answered fiercely if you will not let me pass peaceably i shall fight my way as far as i am able stand away domiloff you cursed spy  marie sprang between them she pushed brand back  nicholas she said this is not your affair it is between baron domiloff and myself you recognize that  entirely he answered  then will you leave it in my hands she begged  he hesitated for a moment but a glance into her face reassured him  i am content he said and left them  she turned to domiloff  baron she said if you do not let mr brand pass unhurt our compact is at an end  he held up his hands in eager expostulation  i wish your friend no harm countess he declared but believe me his reports are doing us every possible injury besides he will carry word of this to the king it is impossible to let him go i will withdraw my men if you like while you reason with him it is his silence only we require  she turned to brand  you hear  he nodded  my silence he answered is not to be bought the king is my friend and his cause is mine apart from that it is my duty as an honest man to upset the scheming of such rogues as that he pointed to domiloff in two minutes countess i shall leave this roomdead or alive  domiloff was very pale but he remained calm marie left him and placed her hands in brands she looked up into his face fondly  you are quite right she said i honour you for your words  then she turned to domiloff  listen she said you will permit mr brand to pass uninjured or i shall go at once to nicholas and tell him not only all that i know but what i suspect you understand me i shall tell himthe whole truth i go also to the king and i tell himthe whole truth i go also to the house of laws i anticipate your proclamation to them and i announcethe whole truth these are not empty threats i swear to you that i will do these things  domiloff regarded her thoughtfully his expression was inscrutable  you will not risk the success of all our plans he said slowly you will even sacrifice your country that this man may go safely you are serious it is in your mind that you are the countess marie of reist and hethe paid writer in an english newspaper forgive me that i speak of this it is incredible  it is nevertheless true she answered firmly your answer  he bowed low  mr walter brand he said is fortunate he is welcome to depart  wait  she crossed the room and from a cedar box on the mantelshelf drew out a small shining revolver she stood facing domiloff  my friend she said so i shall remain until mr brand has left the house and waves to me from the street below and if there is treachery i give you my word that i shall fire you have seen me use a revolver you know that this is not play with me  mr brand he repeated is fortunate indeed     chapter xliii   once more the beacons flared in a long lurid line from the mountaintops rockets screamed into the night and away from south of solika came the heavy roll of guns plainly to be heard in the anxious city rumours were plentiful the turks were already streaming through the passes a great battle was on hand solika had fallen the streets and squares of theos were filled with an excited and restless mob mostly composed of old men children and women with a sprinkling of foreigners the outdoor caf√©s were filled people stood about in little knots together talking eagerly up at the railway station a constant stream of refugees waited patiently for trains to take them northwards  there were no trams running or carriages the government had subsidized the horses and most of the men had gone to the front all night long gangs of navvies in squads were working at the fortifications by searchlight from all the country places stores were pouring in  towards morning the roar of distant artillery increased and those who listened keenly fancied that they could hear the sharper rattle of maxims and machineguns trains began to crawl in from the front full of wounded from them something of the truth was gathered the king had made a forced march himself had crossed the frontier and fiercely attacked the turkish army so far all had gone well the turks were falling back and had already lost two guns  in the grey dawn sara hastened to the hospital which was already almost full the regular nurses were out at the front and their places were mostly taken by volunteersthe suggestion having come from sara herself everywhere the news was being eagerly discussed solika was being turned into a military base at althea the position had been so strengthened as to be now impregnable the king was the idol of his army and the military fever burned fiercely  at midday news a telegram from solika announced that the king was returning across the frontier having completely scattered the turkish army inflicted great loss upon them and captured four guns the town master caused a copy of the telegram to be posted in the marketplace and the bells of the cathedral were rung later on it was whispered about that the victory had come very near being turned into total and irredeemable disaster for the thetians chasing the flying turks through a difficult country were suddenly met by an unexpected rally and stretching on both sides of them like a gigantic crescent was a great army of reinforcements with great skill ughtred had extricated his army and regained the shelter of solika but the joy of their victory was damped the enemy were in strength which seemed absolutely overwhelming  towards afternoon there came shouts from the railway station through the crowd which gave him clear passage cheering vigorously ughtred was driven towards the palace he looked pale and dishevelled and his uniform showed that he had not been an idle spectator of the fighting he waved his hand affectionately to the crowd but was clearly preoccupied at the palace he sent for his state secretary and mr thexis the leader of the government party in the house of laws an informal council meeting was summoned and hastily attended by the leading members of the house                                       an hour afterwards sara was summoned from the midst of her work at the hospital by an urgent note at the villa she found ughtred waiting for her  you she cried softly how dare you fetch me away from my work  then as a clearer impression of his appearance came to her standing in the white noonday sunshine she became anxious  you are not hurt she cried nothing has gone amiss  he tightened his clasp upon her hands  hurt no i took too great care of myself we have won our first battle too sara my men fought splendidly  she nodded  at the hospital she said even the badly wounded are full of enthusiasm tell me you have more news have you not  he nodded  we crossed the border in pursuit he said and we saw with our own eyes what the scouts who are coming in continually report the whole of the turkish army has been mobilized and is being massed upon our borders that is to say two hundred thousand of the finest soldiers in the world are almost at our gates all told we number sixteen thousand  the tears stood in her eyes she pressed his hands silently  im afraid i dont understand these things she said but an unprovoked attack like this seems like a return to ancient history it is barbarous can you not appeal to the powers  that i have done he answered sadly but you must remember that this is the fruit of russias intrigue turkey is only a catspaw she holds france of course and the eternal policy of germany is to keep friends with russia there is only england  england she cried hopefully why you are half english yourself england will surely interfere  it is a great deal to ask he answered seriously my friendship can be of little account to her and it is asking her to risk a war for the sake of an abstract principle diplomatically england would be very unwise to interfere as a great and generous country i have appealed to her but sara i have little hope  and if she does not  if she does not i shall put the issue plainly before my people if they prefer a glorious death to serfdom i too being of their mind shall fight till this war becomes a massacre  she smiled at him bravely  europe will never permit it dear she said it would be too terrible see i have faith in your destinyand my luck i am not even afraid  the courtyard rang with the sound of hoofs a messenger from the telegraph corps entered at the kings summons  your majesty he announced i have to announce that an hour ago a trainload of cossacks numbering about five hundred arrived at the frontier and demanded permission to continue their journey to theos captain operman in accordance with your instructions demanded their passport they had none to give but their colonel produced papers which contained their route to theos for the protection of the russian embassy there in further accordance with your majestys instructions captain operman then replied that theos was in a perfectly peaceful state and the russian embassy was amply protected by its flag from both belligerents the colonel in command of the cossacks replied that his orders were absolute to proceed to theos and he had no alternative but to obey them captain operman replied that his orders too were absolute and he could not permit an armed body of men to cross the frontier in reply to this the russians were ordered to at once entrain captain operman once more protested and announced according to your majestys instructions that any further advance on the part of the cossacks would constitute an invasion and be recognized as an act of war there being no reply to this your majestys instructions were successfully carried out to the letter  tell me exactly what happened ughtred asked  the whole of the rollingstock available was blown up and the railway line destroyed beyond the possibility of immediate repair at a dozen places i regret to add that several of the cossacks were slightly injured by the explosion  and is there any message from captain operman with reference to horses ughtred asked  in this direction also the messenger replied your majestys instructions have been carefully carried out the country has been absolutely denuded of horses it will be impossible for the russians to obtain more than a dozen at the outside  captain operman has carried out my instructions faithfully and well ughtred replied  the messenger bowed  i was further desired to report your majesty he added that word has just arrived that a series of explosions have occurred at different points along the line on the other side of the frontier captain operman makes no report to your majesty concerning these but he desires me to say that their effect will be to retard all communication with russia for several days at least  the king smiled  i am well served indeed he said what has become of the cossacks  they are quartered at the station buildings your majesty there is no stock of provisions whatever in the vicinity and in case they should attempt to march to theos all the farms en route have been warned to remove their cattle and stores  you will present my compliments and thanks to captain operman the king said and you will congratulate him on the success and spirit with which he has carried out my orders further you will request him to report himself to me at headquarters at the earliest possible opportunity  the messenger bowed and withdrew ughtred rose and paced the room thoughtfully  i expected this move of domiloffs he said looking towards sara you see theos itself is in a queer state every honest man who can bear arms is at the front there remain in the city only a horde of russian jews who i suspect have been drafted in a few at a time and are only waiting a signal from domiloff to begin rioting  he touched a bell  let me speak to mr ruttens he ordered he was in the anteroom a few minutes ago  what are you going to do sara asked  i am going to try and arrest domiloff he answered i fear that it is quite useless but an attempt must be made there will be some mischief before long if he is left alone  sara rose up and came to his side  there are other traitors in the city besides domiloff she said if what they are saying is true  a deeper shadow fell upon the kings face  you mean the reists  it is common report  nicholas of reist has withdrawn his allegiance to me ughtred said yet i do not believe that he would be concerned in anything absolutely traitorous as for the countessi fear that i have incurred her illwill she is friendly too they say with domiloff i cannot see though what mischief she can do ruttens he added turning towards the door are there sufficient police left in theos to effect the arrest of one man  ruttens greybearded long since a pensioner saluted the king respectfully  your majesty he answered it depends upon the man  the man is baron domiloff  ruttens shook his head  your majesty he said we can make the attempt yesterday it would have been possible enough but last night half the veterans and weaklings who have been enrolled as special police deserted  deserted the king exclaimed frowning  ruttens smiled  deserted in order to make their way to the front your majesty old kennestoff who is eighty years old got out his rifle and went and a dozen more well nigh his age i myself  he hesitated the kings face had cleared  you had my orders ruttens and my special commission a few good men we must have in theos  there are rascals enough your majesty ruttens said with grave face there are a good many aliens too whose presence here i cannot understand they pay their way and hang round the squares in little groups always whispering to themselves they call themselves farmers and shopkeepers from the frontier but there is little of the thetian in their faces to my mind the city were healthier cleared of them your majesty  the king smiled bitterly  but how my good ruttens he exclaimed you and your few veterans would be powerless against them  ruttens sighed  it is true your majesty he answered to be frank i have put them down in my mind as creatures of domiloff and though today i will endeavour to effect his arrest i fear very much that he is well guarded against anything of the sort  once more the courtyard rang with the clatter of hoofs there was commotion below and in the palace  it is word from the front the king cried  the messenger stood before him  your majesty he announced general dartnoff has telegraphed that he is engaged he adds that there seems to be some extensive movement preparing  ughtred tore himself away sara choked back a sob and held out both her hands at the moment of parting they were alone  goodbye dear she whispered do your best and have faith i am not afraid for you or for theos  he kissed her and galloped away followed by his few attendants her cheerfulness was inspiring his heart swelled with pride at the thought of her she had destroyed forever his lingering superstition as to the obligations of raceshe a daughter of the democracy with the heart and courage of a queen ughtred had passed through his one hour of weakness as the engine with its one solitary carriage tore across the plain to solika a new and finer hopefulness was born in him her words and her steadfast optimism had fired his blood he would fight his countrys enemy so that for very shame europe should cry hold     chapter xliv   in his room with heavy curtains closely drawn across the barred windows to keep from his ears the distant mutterings of the guns nicholas of reist sat in torment from below in the square he had heard the peoples farewell to the king as he had hastened back to the scene of actionthe echoes of the citys varying moods floated up to him from hour to hour and whilst all was activity ceaseless restless he alone of the men of theos sat idle his hands before him waiting for he knew not what it was indeed torment the blood of his fighting forefathers was burning in his veins to linger here in miserable inaction whilst the war music throbbed in his ears was like torture to him even domiloff had found it best for the last few days to leave him alone besides domiloff was busy  in a small room at the back of the house the russian was receiving a visitor before the door were halfadozen soldiers and the bolts were closely drawn yet even then the conversation between the two men was tense and nervous  to have ventured here yourself domiloff said drawing the shade more closely over the lamp seems to me my dear hassen a little like bravado you hold the wits of this people a little too cheaply i am not yet strong enough to protect you if you are recognized you will be shot at sight  one runs risks always the other answered carelessly and besides it is your fault that i am here your inaction is unaccountable there has been no message from you for three days i am afraid that you are bungling matters  and youwhat of you the other answered hotly what were your men doing at solika to be driven back by a handful of halftrained farmers i expected the turks at theos today and all would have been well yet with eighty thousand men you do nothing you too who have boasted of your soldiers and your artillery as the equal of any in europe  the visitor shrugged his shoulders  domiloff he said you are irritated and nervous be careful what you say i admit that so far we have been checked but it is not sense to talk of halftrained farmers ughtred of tyrnaus is a fine soldier mind i was with him in egypt and he had a sound training there his dispositions against attack are excellent he has evidently been thinking them out since first he came here then you told us that he had no modern artillery at all  he had not then domiloff answered these batteries were a present from a rich fool of an american or his daughter  the fair sara van decht i heard that she was here  you know her  she visited at colonel erlitos in london hassen answered so did i but that is of no consequence you very well know that we relied upon your help to finish this campaign quickly so far you have done nothing perhaps you do not understand the reason for haste let me tell you this even now the message is before the sultan waiting for his signature which will recall the troops and bring the invasion to an end  gorteneff is in constantinople himself domiloff answered he will not allow it to be signed  gorteneff so is sir henry white in constantinople you seem to forget that  domiloffs face was black  white the englishman bah you will not tell me that your master fears the english any more their day is over they have no longer a place amongst the powers  hassen smiled  you exaggerate he said england is the only country in europe at least who could bring our masters palace about his ears in twentyfour hours and make beautiful constantinople a heap of blackened ruins no no domiloff my master is wishful to serve you we are hereso far we have done all the workit is for your aid now we ask that is only fair you do not seem to understand the real reason for haste i know that at any moment the protest which white has already presented may be followed by an ultimatum  and your master would regard it  i am very sure that he would hassen answered promptly it is not worth while attempting to deceive you if england is really no longer a country worthy of consideration fight her yourself i am very sure that we shall not and you must remember this domiloff the agitation throughout england in favour of theos is fed day by day with letters from this very city the writer must be with you all the time yet you permit him to continueyou with your unscrupulousness and your secret agents englands intervention if she does intervene is entirely your fault  damn that fellow domiloff muttered through his teeth  you know who it is hassen exclaimed  yes  and you permit him to continue you have made no effort to close his mouth  oh i have tried domiloff answered hastily he is an englishman and he cannot be bought he will not listen to reason and so far as regards other means we have been unfortunate he has a hat with two bullet holes in it  hassen caught up his hat  oh i think that it is of no use my staying here he said the domiloff i have heard of and used to know is not any more in existence that is very certain you have let the man write these letters day by day you have had him within the city all this time and all that you can tell me is that he has a hat with two bullet holes in you have been unfortunate bah the man who makes history is not the man who fails in a trifle like that  domiloff ground his teeth together but he kept his temper  my friend he said that is all very well but you do not understand everything this man is the lover of the countess of reist any hurt to him would be a mortal affront to her  cannot she make him hold his tongue hassen asked if he is her lover she should surely be able to bring him to our side the girl is pretty enough surely the englishman is not a joseph  he is english and that is worse domiloff answered but this very day we caught him here in this house she appealed to himoffered him every inducement implored him to cease those letters his obstinacy was amazing neither my threats nor her prayers and promises availed i ordered him to be seized and then what must she do but turn round and swear that if he were touched she would go to the kingand she would have done it  so he got away  he got away  hassen groaned  domiloff he said it is farewell i do not come again our compact is at an end you are getting old domiloff the days at stamboul are long past he got away a change like this in a man is marvellous  domiloff stood before the door he was very pale and his face was not pleasant to look upon  stay where you are hassen he said you have come here it seems to reproach me for inaction for not having helped you sufficiently from within the city well it is possible that i have relied too much upon the result of your coming into touch with the thetians i expected your army here before this hassen however you did not come here only to complain eh you have a suggestion perhaps well let me hear it as for the englishman i will risk the anger of marie of reist he shall not write another letter now what beyond that i am ready the city is full of my agents if only i were to give the word hassen you would never leave the city alive  hassen laughed scornfully  i have passed through the thetian lines he said and made my way alone here so it is not likely that death could come nearer to me than this but domiloff you talk now more like a man i will admit that what you said is truth i have come here with a scheme in mind and it is a good scheme  then waste no more time domiloff said quickly go on  there is in it hassen said a personal element in truth my master has disappointed me in this campaign i should have been given the entire command and instead i have only a corps now i am stationed as you know not at solika but at althea therefore it is my men whom i would like to bring into theos whilst mellet pascha who has my place is still held back at solika  domiloff nodded  that is reasonable he said but the althea passes are impregnable i do not think that they can be taken by assault at all  nor i hassen answered dryly i want a safe conduct through them  domiloff looked up quickly  i see but klipper who is in command there is incorruptible  klipper must be removed then now what about the duke of reist domiloff he is on our side is he not  he is on our side domiloff answered slowly but unfortunately he has quarrelled with the king he is in the house at this moment  quarrelled what folly domiloff you seem to have bungled everything you have touched lately what is the good of reist to us when he sits here sulking  the good of him domiloff repeated why he is to be our puppet kingfor a month or so he is simply invaluable besides his absence from the army has set people talking about the king it has created dissatisfaction  that is all very well domiloff hassen said but have you ever considered how very much more useful reist would be to us if he were outwardly on friendly terms with the king near him now and at the head of his menand all the time ours  it is without doubt true but you do not know nicholas of reist domiloff said dryly he is not of the stuff from which conspirators are fashioned this quarrel with the king has cost me endless trouble he would never play a traitors part as he would call it secretly  hassen smiled grimly  listen domiloff he said if nicholas of reist were to go to the king and hold out his hand and beg his pardon would the king receive him  of course  would he give him the command at althea if he were to ask for it  without a doubt  then he must ask for it and get it then i will talk to him if you find him so difficult these are not times for neutrality he must be for the king or against the king with the althean passes unguarded for an hour the thing is done then there can be as much intervention as you like theos will be ours  domiloff stood silent with knitted brows and downcast eyes  the scheme is good he said but i fear very much whether reist will consent  he will have to hassen answered coolly he is your man is he not he has already committed himself too deeply to draw back you can show him that it is for the salvation of theos  you shall show him yourself domiloff answered i will take you to him you will understand then the mood of the man with whom we have to deal  hassen held up his hand  you forget he said the duke of reist and i are ancient enemies i was in command when we raided the frontier ten years ago perhaps my men were a little rough to their prisonersi forget the circumstances now but there was trouble between us  domiloff shrugged his shoulders  so was i his enemy a short time ago he answered it is barely a month since the name of a russian was like poison to him but those things are forgotten now reist is oursabsolutely our friends must be his friends and our enemies his so i shall take you to him believe me it will be best  even then hassen hesitated the memory of reists outburst in london was still before him but domiloff had already opened the door  come he said softly i know that reist is alone     chapter xlv   it seemed to reist that this was the supreme moment of his indignity he stood before the two men whitefaced holloweyed speechless and marie who had joined their councils watched him anxiously  nicholas she said this may sound to you a terrible thing indeed i myself wish that there were another way but there are many things to be considered it will save bloodshed and it will end the war with theos lost ughtred and the solika army must surrender after that  aye after that reist interrupted fiercely let me hear what domiloff has to say after that  the rest is simplicity itself domiloff said coolly a meeting of the house of laws shall be called and the turkish army shall be withdrawn across the frontier sentence of banishment shall be passed upon ughtred of tyrnaus and you nicholas of reist shall be proclaimed king then there shall be peace in theospeace and i hope prosperity we have gone over all this before reist you must trust us our alliance is useless if every few minutes you lose faith  a passive treason was all that i promised reist said i undertook to break with the king to give up my command in the army and remain here nothing more surely that is enough for my share  under ordinary circumstances it would have been enough hassen said but in one or two instances the unexpected has intervened this englishman whom you all seemed to have welcomed amongst you has been indeed a firebrand his letters have been read everywhere in england they have done terrible mischief in germany too they have made trouble we have therefore to end this matter swiftlywith one coup we cannot now wait for the inevitable end from your point of view duke surely this is better so the prosecution of this war would simply mean a devastated and depopulated theos unless ughtred of tyrnaus surrendered quickly the bloodshed would be terrible the end of course certain surely what we propose is the better way you duke of reist who are a thetian and a patriot must  stop  a sudden fire burst in reists dark eyes the deep colour rushed into his cheeks there was a breathless silence in the little room  not that word he said slowly for gods sake not that word i do not know what i am or what men will call me when these terrible days have passed away but the patriots are those who wait with ughtred of tyrnaus to give their lives for their country those whose swords are unsheathed and whose heart is stout for battle i who spend my gloomy days here striving to keep the sound of those guns from my ears skulking in the shadows afraid even to show my face at the windowi am no patriot  the duke of reist does himself an injustice domiloff said softly it is physical courage which fills a mans heart with the desire to fighta greater thing than this is the moral courage which keeps a brave man inactive when he knows in his heart that inaction is best for his country  oh you are a subtle reasoner domiloff reist said bitterly i cannot argue with you only i know that all theos is standing sword in hand before our ancient enemies and i am here the weariness of it is intolerable  it is the nerves my friend domiloff answered cheerfully you need a good gallop a little of this stinging air well what we need of you is action is it notand there is danger too  it goes beyond our bargain reist answered in an agitated tone once i never dreamed that you hassen would pass the threshold of my door and leave it alive as for such a thing as you askoh i am not judas enough for that  nicholas his sister said quickly can you not see that it is a great deed think how many lives you will save in years to come every woman of theos who sees her husband by her side will remember that you were his preserver besides it is too late now for hesitation we have chosen our side and we must work for our cause  domiloff nodded  the countess is right he said do as we ask nicholas of reist and in a fortnights time there will be no war or sign of war and the people shall know to whom they owe their deliverance  reist smiled bitterly  my people he said will never overwhelm me with gratitude you do not know them as i do a true thetian would love best the man who led them into the jaws of death to fight for his liberty even though the fight were in vain than the man who made all things smooth and happy for him by skulking within four walls and intriguing with such men as you domiloff  hassen turned impatiently away  my friend he said to domiloff we waste our time here theos must take its chance i am not disposed to wait any longer for the duke of reists answer  then you shall have it now reist said facing them with a momentary reassertion of his old self i accept in an hour i will ride out to solika but i shall do this thing my own way tell me only how i can communicate with you at althea  it is easy hassen exclaimed i will explain  he drew reist on one side the countess and domiloff exchanged quick glances then there came suddenly from below the sound of a measured tramping of feet in the square halting before the great mailstudded door marie moved swiftly to the window  it is ruttens she announced hurriedly the temporary commander of police he has forty or fifty men with him and they have formed a cordon around the door  hassens hand flew to his sword he looked towards domiloff  what does this mean he exclaimed have we been betrayed domiloff  it is not you they seek he said reist find out what they want  there was the sound of heavy footsteps upon the stairs marie sprang towards the door but she was too late a servant had already thrown it open  colonel ruttens he announced  domiloff already stealing to the furthermost corner of the room which was a large one extinguished the solitary lamp and plunged the whole place into comparative darkness ruttens paused a few yards from the threshold and peered around him  is the duke of reist here he asked  nicholas struck a match and lit a solitary candle its feeble flame did little more than reveal his own pale face  here i am colonel ruttens what do you want with me  colonel ruttens saluted  with younothing duke he answered nothing save your help that is in arresting a miscreant  who is he reist asked  the baron domiloff  he is a russian subject reist said slowly  i have a warrant for his arrest signed by the king ruttens answered russian or no russian he has been guilty of inciting to treason of conspiring to bring a regiment of cossacks into the city and of using firearms in the street apart from which his very presence in the city is an offence as he was banished by the king some time ago  and why do you come to me reist asked  because baron domiloff is at present in this house ruttens answered my men have surrounded it and i have come first to you duke i call upon you as a loyal thetian to aid me in making this arrest  what right have you to assume that i should give shelter to baron domiloff reist asked quietly  i regret to say that he is known to be in this house ruttens answered further the fact that you duke were also known to be here when every loyal thetian is under arms compelled me to assume that your attitude towards this russian spy was not inimical  reist started as though struck immediately afterwards ruttens attention was attracted by the sound of stealthy footsteps in the further corner of the apartment he half drew his sword and peered forward  who is that he asked duke of reist i have spared you the indignity of filling your house with police but i must call upon you at once to hand over my prisoner if not i shall summon my men i have only to  he was powerless to utter another syllable a strong pair of arms were around his neck and a handkerchief thrust into his mouth he only looked towards reist but the look was such that reist felt the shameful colour flood his cheeks  hassens dagger gleamed blue in the twilight but reist held out his hand  listen he said bind and gag him and then escape by the western entrance but no violence he is an old man  hassen shrugged his shoulders but domiloff hastened to assent  there is no need to hurt him he said keep him here quietly for a while i will order my men into the hall in case that motley crew below try to force an entrance countess will you be showing our friend the way to the western exit reist you must watch this man  they hurried away reist stood quite still for a moment his heart was thumping against his side he bent over ruttens and lifted the gag from his mouth  what was the signal to your men that they should follow you he whispered  ruttens caught his breath for a moment  abroken window  reist seized a paperweight from his table and dashed it through the nearest pane the glass fell with a crash into the street below there was an answering shout and a rush of feet domiloff rushed breathless in  what has happened he exclaimed  a stone thrown from the street below he answered quick domiloff and escape they are streaming in below why they are fighting already  domiloff was pale with fear but he forced a smile  i have friends in the city he said they will not see me taken farewell reist remember  he hastened from the room reist stooped down and cut the cords which held ruttens  listen ruttens he said i have plans of my own for saving theos and unfortunately domiloff has been concerned in them but that is over you know the western entrance he leaves by that quick  ruttens staggered from the room already the sound of firearms rang out from the hall below     chapter xlvi   this is life brand said blithely as he leaped from his steaming horse  and death ughtred answered gravely god grant that theos may not know many days such as this  brand fixed his fieldglasses and swept the scene below  enemy advancing crescent shape in loose formation he remarked your men capitally entrenched masked guns too and cavalry in reserve your majesty how long have they been shelling the trenches  all day ughtred answered with a faint smile our losses are less than fifty wounded this is their second advance the first cost them a thousand men  an a d c galloped up the hill with a report ughtred gave a few rapid orders and retired for a few minutes to consult with his officers below the din of battle grew louder through the films of smoke multitudes of grey uniformed men could be seen creeping across the plain like ants now hesitating and dropping now running on from shelter to shelter to brand they seemed as numberless as the pebbles on the seashore his face grew grave as he saw how near they were to the long zigzag line of entrenchments the thetian firing too had certainly slackened a horrible idea flashed into his brain if the weakening fire were due to lack of ammunition theos was doomed  he looked around ughtred and his staff were specks in the distance they were hastening down to be nearer the scene of action brand caught his horse and galloped after them the battle fever seemed to be in the atmosphere the afternoon heat was rendered more oppressive by a murky vapour rising from the valley below it was difficult to see anything save the swarm of turks creeping steadily on across the plain above their heads screamed the shells which were to pave the way for their advance brand hastened on filled with misgivings  at last he reached a spur of the hill from which an easy descent led down into the valley from here he could see into the trenches and his spirits revived they were swarming with men there were no signs of any panic the king and his staff had halted almost within shouting distance and protected from the enemys fire only by a little clump of trees then brand knew that there was method in this silence  a long clarionlike buglecall and thena sudden upheaval of all the forces of destruction from the heights above the pompoms and maxims sent down a murderous rain the trenches from end to end belched forth red fire brand held his breath it was an epochfor a lookeron a marvellous experiencea page in the chapter of his life the firingline of the turks was within four hundred yards of the trenches and in thirty seconds they were wiped out of existence the next line and the next shared the same fate the turkish officers galloped to the front with drawn sabres the mohammedan battlecry solemn and inspiring rang fiercely out it was useless no living thing could face that zone of destruction a dust rose from the bulletriven ground it was like a hailstorm upon an ocean the turks wavered and broke and the thetian cavalry rode them through and through passing out of their broken ranks with bloodstained sabres and hearts aflame  ughtred watching saw the first signs of danger and signalled for their withdrawal but the lust of blood was awake in them and they were drunk with the joy of fighting they followed and followed till the turks out of that awful avalanche of death became conscious that a thousand thetian horsemen were not an invincible force their fight was checked they were almost immediately surrounded their leader fell shot through the heart and a miracle was required to save the flower of the thetian army  a miracle which happened for of a sudden a horseman who had ridden in the ranks his face shaded by a helmet leaped to the front  a reist a reist he cried for god and theos and once more the fear of numbers passed away they fought like heroes and in the m√™l√©e without serious loss they fought their way almost to the open and their path was an avenue of blood but how it might have gone with them no man could tell for at the critical moment the whole cavalry reserve with ughtred himself at their head fell upon the enemys right flank and the triumph of the day was assured the turks fled and no further pursuit was attempted  the man who had led that wonderful rally rode slowly back to his place in the ranks but ughtred from whose left temple the blood was streaming and whose arm was helpless put his horse to the gallop and intercepted him  it was well done duke of reist he said will you shake hands with me  for a moment reist hesitated and in that moment the king stung by his indecision withdrew his appeal  i will not have a grudging reconciliation he said as we are so we will remain until your apology is ready but i am glad at least to see that you are still a patriot i cannot have you fighting in the ranks duke of reist what post will you have  reist stood very still for a moment and the pallor on his cheeks was more than the pallor of exhaustion  your majesty he said there is a report that general kolashin is wounded send me to althea  the king turned his horse  as you will he answered captain hartzan ride with the duke of reist to althea and take this ring to general kolashin whose command the duke of reist will take over  then the king flushed with fighting the blood indeed still upon his face from a wound on the temple rode slowly down the lines of his army from far and near the men of theos greeted him lustily this was indeed a born leader whose dispositions had prevailed against the wily turkish generals and whose personal valour they had with their own eyes beheld even from solika far in the background came an answering echo to that strange thunder of mens rapturous voices  brand touched him on the arm  your majesty he said you have won a victory today which will amaze all europe be careful that you do not lose what you have gained by treachery  the king looked into brands grave face and beckoned him on one side  well  domiloff has got hold of reist he said he is a traitor there is something going on in the city even now which i do not understand  the king shook his head gravely  reist is my personal enemy he said but theos has no more faithful son it is he who has just saved our victory from being turned into disaster  nevertheless brand answered he is domiloffs man and there is treachery afoot i will tell you what happened to me in the city  the king listened with darkening face but when brand had finished his story he shook his head again  domiloff is my enemy he said and it may be the countess of reist but of reist himself i will believe no such thing  your majesty will regret it brand remarked dryly  if you are right i certainly shall the king answered for i have appointed reist to the command at althea  brand wheeled his horse round  i wish you good fortuneand goodbye he said  the king looked at him in amazement  where are you going brand he asked  home  home why  the war is over brand answered the turks will occupy theos tomorrow  you are talking nonsense ughtred declared hotly  brand shook his head  your majesty he said you will admit that a traitor at althea can let the turks into theos  the king frowned  it is true he admitted but reist is no traitor  if you will come with me to the city brand answered i will prove to you that he is     chapter xlvii   baron domiloff it is i marie of reist let me in  she stepped into the darkened room and closed the door behind her domiloff who was looking white and scared turned the key in the lock and faced her nervously  why have you come here countess he exclaimed do you not understand that i am in hiding it is not a fit place for youand you may have been followed  she held her handkerchief to her face and looked around her in disgust  you are right she answered it is not a fit place for any one it is abominable what are you doing here  the king and this englishman brand are in the city together and they have scent of how things are going he answered my house in the avenue was surrounded by soldiers this morning but i managed to give them the slip and reach here safely have you brought me word from nicholas  she shook her head  no  then why are you here this place is of evil repute besides it is not safe you may have been followed  i believe that i was she answered it is not of any consequence there is not any one in theos who would harm a reist  his face was unnaturally white she looked at him in wonder was the man a coward  but it was madness he exclaimed angrily there are spies everywhere your brother and i were overheard talking together at this very place i may be arrested at any moment  she glanced at him contemptuously  i suppose that when one conspires she said there is always danger baron domiloff i have followed you here because since noon yesterday there have been two attempts upon the life of the englishman walter brand  both bungled he remarked one is ill served so far from home  she turned upon him fiercely  have you forgotten what i told you only a few days ago  one does not remember too long he answered lightly the words of an angry woman  her eyes flashed upon him wrathfully the odour of the violets at her bosom seemed to fill the dark stuffy room he remarked suddenly how beautiful she was  if you do not know when a woman is in earnest she declared you are a fool i have come to tell you this that the moment evil happens to him i go at once to the king i tell him everything mind this is no idle threat i swear to you that i will do this  a cloud of evil passions swept up from the mans heart he drew a little closer to her and took up his stand nearer the door  it is folly he said in a low tone the man is working up all europe with his accursed letters he must be removed  if evil comes to him she said steadily the king shall know all  he drew a little closer to her an ugly smile curved his lips  it cannot be countess that your interest in this fellow is personal he is not of your order you would not be so cruel as to bestow upon him a consideration which you deny to your equals  it seems to me she said calmly that you are trying to be impertinent the nature of my interest in mr brand can be no concern of yours it is sufficient that what i have said i mean  i do not find it sufficient he answered quietly  she turned upon him haughtily her delicate eyebrows were drawn together her eyes were aglow with anger domiloff watched her stealthily why had he never realized how handsome she was he drew a little nearer to her  what do you mean she demanded insolent  countess he answered it is very strange to me that you should so long have been ignorant of the truth do you think that it is for the sake of theos i have planned for the overthrow of ughtred of tyrnaus do you think that it is for your brothers sake that i have smoothed his way to the throne no my reward has always been clear before me i have looked for it always at your hands  at my hands  he winced before the amazed scorn of her words yet he continued steadily  if you are surprised countess he said well i have been the victim of that timeworn fallacy which ascribes to any woman at any time the knowledge of being loved you have always been the object of my respectful admiration you are now  she threw out her handsa silencing gesture  enough she exclaimed i do not know what you are going to say i do not wish to hear it  you must he declared you shall hear me  she turned her back upon him but he was between her and the door he turned the key in the lock and faced hera new domiloff wolflike with evil things in his white face and black eyes  you shall promise to be my wife he said or  or what  she did not quail his eyes fell before hers but the key slipped into his pocket  or you do not leave this house he answered i am master here the whole quarter is russian be reasonable countess the alliance is worthy of your consideration  she leaned suddenly forward and struck him across the cheek  you cur she cried i would as soon marry one of my servants  she beat upon the door and called out domiloff drew out his handkerchief and held it to his cheek he made no effort to silence her there was a dull red mark across his face if she could have seen his expression she would have been frightened  there came no answer to her calling she rushed across to the window there were men on the place below but they only answered her frantic gestures with dull indifferenceat most with a shrug of the shoulders and a smile they were russian jews it was as domiloff had said they were his creatures it was the one evil spot in theos domiloff stood with his back to her still with his handkerchief to his face  she turned upon him fiercely  if you do not let me out she cried nicholas shall shoot you like a dog  it may be he answered coolly that i shall shoot nicholas at least there will be something to be wiped out between us i shall not fear his vengeance  what do you mean she asked suddenly cold with the first sensations of fear the mans quietness was ominous and she could see his face now he put his handkerchief away and came over to her catching her wrists with a sudden catlike movement  it is your own fault he said you will remember that blow to your dying day                                       they stood side by side at the window of one of the great reception rooms of the palace the king and brand a driving storm of rain was beating against the glass and the thunder rattled amongst the distant hills from peak to peak ughtred was looking more pale and harassed than when he had ridden sword in hand in front of his tiny army and watched the turks closing in around them  what is the meaning of it brand he asked sadly there is something astir which i cannot understand see how the people throng the square in front of the reist house and scarcely even glance this way what are they waiting for  brand shook his head  the true meaning of it i do not know he answered but there is treason abroad i am sure of that and i am sure that nicholas of reist is concerned in it  the king bit his lip if nicholas of reist were a traitor what hope was there for theos  i do not know these people he said my men are all in the field or under arms at the barracks these are not native thetians  they look to me brand said dryly like a horde of russian jews from across the frontier  i am going to ride once more through the city the king said come with me brand  they left the palace by a side door and passed cautiously along the street the king with his military cloak wrapped closely about him all around was a constant muttering the people talked together excitedly enough but without elation there were no signs that this was a day of victory the kings face grew stern  i do not know this rabble he said they are not my own people  they are the tools of domiloff brand answered it is he who is at the root of all this trouble it is he who has corrupted nicholas of reist  they rode across the square and the people scattered before them with muttered imprecations brand suddenly turned into a side street and motioned the king to follow him  our police he said have failed to catch domiloff let us try ourselves i believe i know where he may be found  the kings face lightened and he touched his horse with the spur but brand hesitated  the place is in a bad quarter he said there will be risk  but ughtred laughed  with a guard he said we should have no chance you and i alone will take domiloff     chapter xlviii   the storm had driven away the crowd of loiterers from in front of the caf√© metropolitan the king and brand stood under one of the small lime trees which bordered the road watching the place the lower room unshuttered and lit with several flaring gas jets was filled with a crowd of men drinking and singing songs from the upper windows came no sign of life  that is where i believe that domiloff is hiding brand declared do you see what a rabble that is inside the caf√©  the king nodded  russian jews every one of them he said anyhow there are too many of them for us to enter the place singlehanded  brand take one of the horses and ride to the barracks bring down a guard of twentyfive men i will wait here  brand nodded and hurried away to the corner of the street where they had left the horses the king lit a cigar shielding the light as much as possible with his hand and leaned against the trunk of the tree  five minutes passed ten a quarter of an hour the king whose thoughts were none of the pleasantest grew impatient suddenly the cigar dropped from his fingers he sprang forward with beating heart bewildered incredulous for he had seen a strange thing  up at that dark unlit window had flashed for a moment the pale terrorstricken face of a woman drawn back almost at once by an unseen hand the echoes of her passionate cry for help rang still in his ears and strangest thing of all the face was the face of marie of reist  ughtred forgot then that he was a king and that his life was a pledge to his country he remembered only that he was a man of more than ordinary strength and that from that dreary little room a woman was calling to him for help in the passage the few loiterers who disputed his way were brushed on one side like flies he sprang up the little staircase which creaked under his weight in halfadozen bounds the girls cries were plainly to be heard now he thundered upon the door  there came for a moment no answer the girls cry was stifled as though by a rough hand  let me in ughtred cried at once  there came no answer save a mans muttered curse and the sound of footsteps ughtred was wearing his military riding boots and the door was crazy and old a single charge and it went crashing into the room ughtred stumbled and saved his life for a bullet whistled just over his head as domiloff sprang to the window  marie breathless and dishevelled recognized ughtred with a cry of wonder  the king she exclaimed and domiloff who might have escaped looked round and hesitated ughtred who was as quick as lightning upon his feet snatched him back from the windowsill and threw him heavily upon the floor  there was no time for explanations through the d√©bris of the door there sprang into the room halfadozen of the loiterers from the room below they faced the king standing like a giant in the centre of the floor with his long military sword flashing grey in the dim light  be off he cried this is not your affair i do not wish to hurt any of you but i will kill the first man who comes a yard further  they hung back but one remained looking about him with crafty peering eyes his long upper teeth gleaming like yellow fangs his hand lurked about his tunic  little master he said tell us what has happened here there is a man hurt what have you done to him  ughtreds sword was within an inch of the mans chest  the man is unhurt and my prisoner ughtred said  your prisoner little master my eyes are bad and the light is dim who are you to come here and make prisoners  i am the king ughtred answered rashly  there were those who knew him there was a murmur which was like a growl and ughtred hesitated no longer but ran his sword through the man whose knife was already stealing from his tunic he fell back with a shriek of horror and the king himself in grievous danger wrenched his sword free there were halfadozen knives raised and one must have struck into his chest but marie stooping down had seized domiloffs revolver and leaning over shot the man through the heart the king who had recovered his balance sprang amongst them and they scattered like rabbits then came a great cry from downstairs  the soldiers quick save yourself  they fled without waiting for a parting stroke ughtred lowered his sword and let them pass there were three dead and wounded in the room and domiloff lay on his back where the king had thrown him the king turned to marie  you are a brave woman he said you have saved both our lives  but she held out both her hands to him and her eyes were streaming  your majesty has saved more than my life she faltered and i have not deserved it i have been your enemy  he took her hands gently  we have fought together he said henceforth we should be comrades                                       eleven men sat around a long table in one of the rooms of the reist house they talked only in whispers and a general air of uneasiness was apparent it was rumoured that the king was in the city and these men felt themselves to be conspirators domiloff was strangely absent the countess of reist in her own house had omitted to offer them a welcome  their suspense was temporarily ended however the door opened and baron doxis entered followed by a foreigner whom most of them recognized they rose to their feet baron doxis presented the guest  my colleagues he announced this is monsieur gourdolis the accredited envoy of the czar to us he has certain proposals to submit upon which we will at once debate  a counsellor rose up  has the countess of reist any message to us from her brother  the countess of reist baron doxis answered is unaccountably absent  and domiloff another asked it is chiefly owing to his representations that we are assembled here today is he too absent  there was a moments silence then gourdolis spoke  gentlemen he said my friend domiloff will be with us doubtless before this meeting is dissolved in the meantime i will with your permission lay before you the terms on which my august master the czar is willing to stay the hand of turkey by force if necessary and guarantee your independence  some heavy curtains at the end of the room were suddenly thrown aside the king stood there and by his side marie of reist  my arrival it would appear is opportune the king said grimly address yourself to me and proceed monsieur gourdolis     chapter xlix   one by one the members of the council staggered to their feet the coming of the king was like a bombshell thrown amongst them they were met in secret conclave a proceeding to the last degree unconstitutional they were receiving too an emissary from a foreign country which amounted to high treason doxis was perhaps the first to recover himself  your majestys coming is unexpected he said i trust that there is no ill news from the seat of war  there is no news save good news the king answered having handed a chair to marie yesterdays battle you all know about i will tell you the prospects later meanwhile i see that you have a stranger here what has monsieur gourdolis to say to us  gourdolis rose slowly to his feet he was a man of resource a shrewd and ready diplomatist already he was scheming how to turn to his own advantage the kings unexpected presence he played a bold card  your majesty he said respectfully it was painful to me to put forward my masters propositions to the council of the house of laws in your absence it is still more painful to do so in your presence i speak however to the representatives of a nation whose liberty and whose very existence is threatened and i offer themin a wordsalvation that is my excuse for my presence here today  what your offer really amounts to is no doubt the russian yoke instead of the turkish ughtred remarked bitterly my forefathers have tasted more than once of muscovite generosity  gourdolis shook his head gravely  your majesty he said you wrong my country and my master our demands are very simple and i lay the terms of them here upon the table the only conditions upon which i regret to say that my master is immovable is the immediate abdication of your majesty  the king sat with unchanged face  in favour of whom he asked  nicholas duke of reist  is the duke of reist cognizant of this and willing to accept the throne the king asked  he is your majesty baron doxis answered  marie rose to her feet  it is false she declared my brother is a patriot and he has taken the oath of allegiance to the king i pledge my word for his that he will keep that oath  a murmur of blank amazement was followed by a dead silence gourdolis was speechless the king looked around him sternly  have i by chance stumbled upon a conspiracy he asked what do you say taverner and you valgrosse did you come here prepared to listen to such a proposition as this  indeed your majesty taverner answered hastily i did not  nor i valgrosse echoed  what about you doxis the king asked  the old baron who for many years had been chairman of the house of laws rose slowly to his feet  your majesty he said i will admit that i alone of those present here had some knowledge of this proposal i hope that your majesty will not look upon my presence here as disloyal or unseemly only in my heart is deep engraven the love of my country and her people and the one dread of my life has been the coming of the turk your majesty no one has been a more sincere admirer than myself of the wise and careful manner in which you have ruled this country young though you are you have more than fulfilled our most sanguine expectations only i fear that unaided we may as well hope to stem the tide of the mighty danube as repel this turkish invasion  you have spoken like a true man doxis the king said yet i must remind you that your presence here is akin to treason what of the oath of loyalty which you swore to me only a few months ago  your majesty doxis answered i have not broken that oath i am here only to listen to what these proposals may be that i take it is the position also of my colleagues  a murmur of assent gourdolis remained standing his papers in his hands  your majesty will forgive me if i assert that there is no treason involved in the presence of any one here i summoned those to meet me whom i knew to be real and true patriotswho would not hesitate at a small thing to secure their countrys freedom  the king faced him scornfully  we have heard monsieur gourdolis he said of the freedom of those countries whom your beneficent master has taken under his wing councillors i think more highly of your intelligence than to imagine that you are to be suborned by such clumsy intriguing as this freedom is one thing the yoke of russia another i will tell you some of the considerations which monsieur gourdolis has presently to propose to you the customhouses are to be controlled by russia the appointment of all government officials is to be sanctioned by her our foreign policy is to be her foreign policy the army is to be officered by russians and russian is to be taught in the schools these things are amongst your conditions is it not so monsieur gourdolis  gourdolis hesitated and his chance was gone  you have employed spies he muttered  not i the king answered yet i know your terms as they were proposed to nicholas of reist and it amazes me only that you should have expected men in whose hands remain the destinies of their country to give you even a patient hearing my councillors give this man the answer his insolent mission deserves and let him be shown across the frontier we will before long show europe how we deal with our enemies the turks are not yet at the gates of the city  there was a murmur of respectful enthusiasm gourdolis smiled a very evil smile  not yet he murmured but the end is not far off  baron doxis rose up  your majesty he announced our answer is unanimous we have been misled by baron domiloff both as to the nature of monsieur gourdoliss mission and the attitude of the duke of reist we reject his terms we decline once and for all to treat with him we trust to god and to you to keep the enemy from our gates  the king smiled upon them  i thank you all he said for your confidence let me add that i believe the day will come when you will be heartily thankful that you gave this man the answer he deserved the importance of our victory yesterday has i find been wilfully minimized in the city but i can assure you that with only a very trifling loss we withstood an attack on the part of the whole turkish forces i have however better news than that for you the greatest nation in the world would seem to have espoused our cause yesterday afternoon the english ambassador at constantinople presented an ultimatum to the sultan demanding the withdrawal of his forces from the frontier of theos the press throughout europe have announced the fact this morning  baron doxis rose hurriedly to his feet  your majesty he exclaimed in broken tones permit me on the part of your councillors and myself to express our unbounded confidence both in your military skill and in your diplomacy theos has found a second rudolph  the king smiled faintly  we are an instance he said of an ancient nation who has benefited by the great new power of this generation my diplomatic appeal to the english government would have been of no avail but for the wonderful espousal of our cause by the whole british press that we owe to one who has been living amongst us and who has three times within the last few days narrowly escaped assassination by the friends of baron domiloff monsieur gourdolis you have your answer  gourdolis remained imperturbable he bowed to baron doxis and moved towards the door then he faced the king  your majesty he said has a singularly dramatic knack of turning up in unexpected places and at unexpected times may that faculty not desert you during the next few days  he closed the door and departed the king rose to his feet  baron doxis he said i leave the charge of the city in your hands i return at once to the front there is no telegraphic communication between the headquarters of the turkish commanderinchief and constantinople and in any case it is well to be prepared countess of reist will you favour me for one moment  she led him into her own little room and placed her hands in his  we are friends he asked  if your majesty can really pardon me she answered fervently for always  and brand the king asked  her cheeks burned with a sudden rush of colour  you may tell him she said after tomorrow     chapter l   into the black night across the level plain which stretched between theos and the pass of althea a woman rode as one rides a race with death her servants had been left far away behindher horses sides were streaked with foam once or twice he had swerved and almost unseated her she plied him with whip and spur and passionate words it was for the honour of a great race for her own salvation that she rode all was well as yet the lights of the camp were twinkling like a band of ribbon across the hillside and there was silence as deep as death everywhere except when the wind came booming down the valley in fitful gusts and bowed the tops of the lonely and stunted trees upwards she mounted and the road grew rougher her horses eyes were streaked with blood his nostrils quivered still she urged him on a little further now and her goal was reached so she rode on white to the lips with fearlest even now she should be too late  at the outposts they stopped her and the great bay horse after staggering for a moment like a drunken man fell over dead she scarcely glanced at him the officer who knew her rapidly transferred her saddle to his own pony  it is a message from the king to nicholas she said tell me how long will it take me  the duke is himself guarding the beacon the soldier answered madame the countess will reach him in ten minutes  she galloped off never noticing that her ponys feet were shod with felt she looked neither to the right nor the left and she saw nothing of the strange restlessness which seemed to pervade the camp everywhere the shadows of men were moving noiselessly about spectral guns were surrounded by little groups of whispering soldiers there was no bivouacing the campfires burned low every now and then when challenged she mechanically repeated the countersign all the while her lips were moving in one ceaseless passionate prayer  they took her pony at the summit and a silent sentry pointed to where a single dark figure stood out against the empty background a few yards to his left was the great beacon and a row of torches burned in a stand ever ready for the signal she called to him softly and even to herself her voice seemed to come from a long way off  nicholas nicholas  he turned towards her and she saw that his face was livid he was horrified to see her  marie the good god what has happened  i have deceived you nicholas she whispered hoarsely the writing was not the writing of the king it was domiloffs plot and i wanted to see you king the king has saved my life forever nicholas you and i must be his faithful subjects i have given my word i have pledged your honour  then into the face of nicholas of reist there came a transfiguring and almost holy joy he uttered no word of reproach the glory of life was once more hot in his pulses he drew her to him  thank god he sobbed this way marie now listen  she stooped with him over that awful chaos from below came a sound like the falling of autumn rains upon dead leaves he held her to him  it is the turks he whispered  she sprang away in horror but he laughed softly  marie he said that is well instead of a sleeping camp our guns will rake the pass our men await only the signal up here where one is near god one sees clearly i am the faithful servant of theos even though the king had been my enemy see  he listened for a moment and then crossing the hill took a torch from the stand and plunged it into the heart of the great beacon tongues of fire leaped up to the sky and a hoarse murmur passed like a wind through the camp then the ground beneath them shook with the roar of artillery nicholas took her by the arm  ride for theos at once he directed you will be quite safe for no turk will pass alive through the pass tell the king that i am his faithful servant                                       about halfway to theos brand galloping furiously out from the city came face to face with marie riding leisurely home on a small pony he leaped from his horse in amazement  marie he exclaimed what is happening at the pass how came you here  she was very tired but she smiled at him reassuringly  nicholas has over ten thousand turks in the defile she said they must either surrender or be killed  thank god he exclaimed  she got off her pony and sat on a bank  i am very tired she said and swaying suddenly towards him fainted in his arms  brand was a man of resource and in a few minutes she reopened her eyes he poured some brandy between her lips and she sat up  i am very sorry she said i rode last night from theos to althea and i have had no rest  he made her drink some milk they sat hand in hand a wonderful dawn breaking in the east by and by a horseman from theos passed them at full gallop  the war is over he cried the english fleet is at constantinople the turks have sued for peace long live the king  he vanished in a cloud of dust riding furiously for the pass brand took marie into his arms and kissed her  dear he said i havent much money and im only an ordinary man  she laughed softly  i think in theos she said we have clung a little too closely to the old ideals rank is very well and money i know little about but on the whole i am glad that you are an ordinary man  illustration the war is over he cried  they rode into theos as the king arrived from solika the cathedral bells clanged out a welcome the people lined the streets everywhere breathless excitement prevailed old baron doxis met the king on the palace steps he held out both hands but his eyes were wet with tears  your majesty he said this is your day of triumph and yours alone may god send you in the future wiser and better councillors  but ughtred passed his arm through the old mans and led him into the palace  i am young and i was unproven he said i shall be quite satisfied if god will preserve for many years my present ones                                       theos won for herself as the fruits of that brief campaign a wonderful military reputation and every prospect of unbroken peace she entered indeed upon that golden age which comes once in the worlds history to every nation great or small mr van decht built a palace within the city and invested all his vast capital in the country brand whose services no one realized more thoroughly than the king accepted a government appointment and entered the house of laws a naturalized thetian and when they asked the king what gift a grateful nation could offer him he answered them promptly but in very few words  the right to depart from a constitutional principle the right to share my throne with the woman i love  there was no hesitation no break in the thunderous applause which greeted his answer and which nicholas of reist himself led the marriage of ughtred of tyrnaus and sara van decht under such conditions touched the imagination of europe every capital was anxious to f√™te them the society papers lived upon their doings for years but even they did not know that during that famous visit to london where they were received with a consideration rarely accorded even to royalty they stole away one evening and dined together t√™te√†t√™te at a famous london restaurant they were unrecognized and they enjoyed themselves like children afterwards they found out a certain seat in a certain corner of the palm lounge and spent a very delightful hour there when at last they rose to go he took her hand for a moment softly in his  tell me he whispered you find it possible to be happy although you are a queen  i am your wife dear she answered with a little squeeze of his hand which seemed to satisfy him  an amazing whisper suddenly passed from group to group of the brilliantlydressed men and women who sat about in the court the band broke off in the middle of a selection and played the national air of theos every one rose respectfully he passed her hand through his arm with a little grimace  they have found us out dear he whispered  the people gazed with breathless but wellbred interest they saw a tall distinguishedlooking man with the mark of a recent scar slightly disfiguring his left temple and upon his arm the most beautiful woman in the room her eyes wonderfully soft and brilliant a delicate flush upon her cheeks the king and queen of theos passed out to their carriage
