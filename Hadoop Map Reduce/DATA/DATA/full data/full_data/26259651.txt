26259651	history of friedrich ii of prussia  frederick the great  by thomas carlyle      book xvsecond silesian war important episode in the general european one15th aug 174425th dec 1745     chapter ipreliminary how the moment arrived  battle being once seen to be inevitable it was friedrichs plan not to wait for it but to give it thanks to friedrich wilhelm and himself there is no army nor ever was any in such continual preparation military people say some countries take six months some twelve to get in motion for war but in three weeks prussia can be across the marches and upon the throat of its enemy which is an immense advantage to little prussia among its big neighbors some countries have a longer sword than prussia but none can unsheathe it so soonwe hope too it is moderately sharp when wielded by a deft hand  the french as was intimated are in great vigor this year thoroughly provoked and especially since friedrich sent his rothenburg among them have been doing their very utmost their main effort is in the netherlands at presentand indeed as happened continues all through this war to be they by no means intend or ever did to neglect teutschland yet it turns out they have pretty much done with their fighting there and next year driven or led by accidents of various kinds they quit it altogether and turning their whole strength upon the netherlands and italy chiefly on the netherlands leave friedrich much to his astonishment with the german war hanging wholly round his neck and take no charge of it farther in which to friedrichs biographers there is this inestimable benefit if far the reverse to friedrichs self that we shall soon have done with the french then with them and with so much else and may in time coming for most part leave their huge sorcerers sabbath of a european war to dance itself out well in the distance not encumbering us farther like a circumambient bedlam as it has hitherto done courage reader let us give in a glance or two some notion of the course things took and what moment it was when friedrich struck inwhom alone or almost alone we hope to follow thenceforth dismal swamp so gracious was heaven to us lying now mostly to rearward little as we hoped it  it was mere accident a series of bad accidents that led king louis and his ministers into gradually forsaking friedrich they were the farthest in the world from intending such a thing contrariwise what brainbeating diplomatic spiderweaving practical contriving now and afterwards for that object especially now rothenburg noailles belleisle cardinal tencin have been busy not less the mistress chateauroux who admires friedrich being indeed a highminded unfortunate female as they say and has thrown out amelot not for stammering alone they are able almost high people this new chateauroux ministry compared with some and already show results  nay what is most important of all france has unconsciously or by mere help of noailles and luck got a real general to her armies comte de saxe now marechal de saxe who will shine very splendent in these netherland operationscountershone by mere wades dahrembergs cumberlandsin this and the four following years noailles had always recognized comte de saxe had long striven for him in official quarters and here gets the light of him unveiled at last and set on a high place loyal noailles  this was the year this 1744 when louis xv urged by his chateauroux the highsouled unfortunate female appeared in person at the head of his troops go sire go mon chou and i will accompany show yourself where a king should be at the head of your troops be a second louislegrand which he did his chateauroux and he actually went to the netherlands with baggagetrain immeasurable including not cooks only but

june and captured in notime menin ipres furnes and the fort of knock and as much of the austrian netherlands as he likedthat is to say saw noailles and saxe do itwalking rapidly forward from siege to siege with a most thundering artillery old marshal wade and consorts dismally eating their victuals and looking on from the distance unable to attempt the least stroke in opposition so that the dutch barrier if anybody now cared for it did go all flat and the balance of power gets kicked out of its sacred pivot to such purpose have the dutch been hoisted terrible to think ofhad not there from the opposite quarter risen a surprising counterpoise had not there been a prince karl with his 70000 pressing victoriously over the rhine which stayed the french in these sacrilegious procedures     prince karl gets across the rhine 20 june2 july 1744  prince karl some weeks ago at heilbronn joined his rhine army which had gathered thither from the austrian side through baiern and from the hitheraustrian or swabian winterquarters with full intent to be across the rhine and home upon elsass and the compensation countries this summer under what difficulties soever karl or as some whisper old marshal traun who is nominally second in command do make a glorious campaign of it this yearand lift the cause of liberty at one time to the highest pitch it ever reached here in brief terms is prince karls operation on the rhine much admired by military men  stockstadt june 20th 1744 some thirty and odd miles north of mannheim the rhine before turning westward at mainz makes one other of its many islands of which there are hundreds since the leap at schaffhausen one other and i think the biggest of them all perhaps two miles by five which the germans call kuhkopf cowhead from the shape it hasa narrow semiellipse river there splitting in two one split the western going straight the other bending luxuriantly round so that the hindhead or straight end of the island lies towards france and the round end or cowlips so to speak towards native teutschland and the woody hills of the bergstrasse thereabouts stockstadt chief little town looking over into this cowhead island lies under the chin understand only farther that the german branch carries more than twothirds of the river that on the island itself there is no town or post of defence and that stockstadt is the place for getting over coigny and the french some 40000 are guarding the river hereabouts with lines with batteries cordons the best they can seckendorf with 20000 more imperial old bavarian troops revivified recruited by french pay is in his garrison of philipsburg ready to help when needednot moulting now at wembdingen in that dismal manner newfeathered now into kaisers army waiting in his philipsburg to guard the river there coignys french have ramparts ditches not quite unfurnished on their own shore opposite this cowhead island isle de heron as they call it looking over to the hindhead namely but they have nothing considerable there and in the island itself nothing whatever if now stockstadt were suddenly snatched by us thinks karlif a few pontoons were nimbly swung in  june 20thcoignys people all shooting feudejoie for that never enough to be celebrated capture of menin and the dutch barrier a fortnight agothis is managed to be done the active general barenklau active brigadier daun under him pushes rapidly across into kuhkopf rapidly throws up intrenchments ramparts mounts cannon digs himself ingreatly to coignys astonishment whose people hereabouts and in all their lines and posts are busy shooting feudejoie for those immortal dutch victories at the moment and never dreaming of such a thing fresh force floods in prince karl himself arrives next day in support of barenklau coigny headquarters at speyer forty miles south need not attempt dislodging him but must stand upon his guard and prepare for worse which he does with diligence shifting northward into those stockstadtmainz parts calling seckendorf across the river and otherwise doing his bestfor about ten days more when worse and almost worst did verily befall him  no attempt was made on barenklau nor beyond the alarming of the coignyseckendorf people did anything occur in cowhead islandunless it were the finis of an ugly bully and ruffian who has more than once afflicted us which may be worth one word colonel mentzel copperfaced colonel originally playactor spy in persia and i know not what had been at the seizure of kuhkopf a prominent man whom on the fifth day after june 25th prince karl overwhelmed with joy by handing him a patent of generalcy just received from court my friend on account of your merits old and lateaha said barenklau congratulating warmly dine with me then herr general mentzel this very day the prince himself is to be there highness of hessendarmstadt and who not all are impatient to drink your health mentzel had a glorious dinner still more glorious drinkprince karl and the others it is said egging him into much wild bluster and gasconade to season their much wine eminent swill of drinking with the loud coarse talk supposable on the part of mentzel and consorts did go on in this manner all afternoon in the evening drunk mentzel came out for air went strutting and staggering about emerging finally on the platform of some rampart face of him huge and red as that of the foggiest rising moonand stood looking over into the lorraine country belching out a storm of oaths as to his taking it as to his doing this and that and was even flourishing his sword by way of accompaniment when lo whistling slightly through the summer air a rifleball from some sentry on the french side writers say it was a french drummer grown impatient and snatching a sentrys piece took the brain of him or the belly of him and he rushed down at once a totally collapsed monster and mere heap of dead ruin never to trouble mankind more guerre de boheme iii 165 for which my readers and i are rather thankful voltaire and perhaps other memorable persons sometimes mention this brute miraculous to the plebs and gazetteers otherwise eternal oblivion were the best we could do with him trenck also readers will be glad to understand ends in jail and bedlam by and by  prince karl had not the least intention of crossing by this cowhead island nevertheless he set about two other bridges in the neighborhood nearer mainz few miles below that city kept manoeuvring his force in huge halfmoon round that quarter and mysteriously up and down alarming coigny wholly into the mainz region for the space of ten days and then stealing off to schrock a little rhine village above philipsburg many miles away from coigny and his vigilantes he  night of 30th june1st july suddenly shot pandour trenck followed by nadasti and 6000 across at schrock who scattered seckendorfs poor outposts thereabouts to the winds built a bridge before morning and next day another next day prince karl in person appeared and on the 3d of july had his whole army with its luggages across and had seized the lines of lauterburg and weissenburg celebrated northern defence of elsassmuch to coignys amazement and remained inexpugnable there with elsass open to him and to coigny shut for the present adelung iv 139141 coigny made bitter wail accusation blame of seckendorf blame of men and of things even tried some fighting seckendorf too doing feats to recover those lines of weissenburg but could not do it and in fact blazing to and fro in that excited rather than luminous condition could not do anything except retire into the strong posts of the background and send express on express swifter than the wind if you can to a victorious king overturning the dutch barrier help your majesty or we are lost and france iswhat shall i say  admirable feat of strategy what a general this prince karl exclaimed mankindcauseofliberty mankind with special enthusiasm and took to writing lives of prince karl for instance the life of his highness prince charles of c with c c london 1746 one of the most distracted blotches ever published under the name of bookwakening thoughts of a public dimness very considerable indeed to which this could offer itself as lamp as well as tarburning and tedeuming on an extensive scale for it had sent the cause of liberty bounding up again to the top of things this of crossing the rhine in such fashion and in effect the cause of liberty and prince karl himself had risen hereby to their acme or culminating point in worldhistory not to continue long at such height little as they dreamt of that among their tarburnings the feat itselfcontrived by nadasti people say and executed what was the real difficulty by traunbrought prince karl very great renown this year and is praised by friedrich himself now and afterwards as masterly as julius caesars method and the proper way of crossing rivers when executable in face of an enemy and indeed prince karl owing to traun or not is highly respectable in the way of generalship at present and did in these five months from june onward really considerable things at his very acme of life as well as of generalship which alas soon changed poor man never to culminate again he had got at the beginning of the year the high maria theresas one sister archduchess maria anna to wife

of long mutual attachment she safe now at brussels diligent coregent and in a promising familyway he here walking on victoriousneed any man be happier no man can be supremely happy long and this generals strategic felicity and his domestic were fatally cut down almost together the cause of liberty too now at the top of its orbit wasbut let us stick by our excerpting  dunkirk 19th july 1744 princess ulriques wedding just two days ago king louis on hearing of the jobsnews from elsass instantly suspended his conquests in flanders detached noailles detached this one and that doublequick division after division leaving saxe with 45000 to his own resources and the fatuities of marshal wade and 19th july himself hastens off from dunkirk leaving much of the luggage but not the chateauroux behind him to save his country poor soul but could not in the least save it the reverse rather august 4th he got to metz belleisles strong town about 100 miles from the actual scene his detached reinforcements say 50000 men or so hanging out ahead like flameclouds but uncertain how to actnoailles being always cunctatious in time of crisis and poor louis himself nothing of a cloudcompellerand then  metz august 8th the most christian king fell ill dangerously dreadfully just like to die which entirely paralyzed noailles and company or reduced them to mere hysterics and excitement of the unluminous kind and filled france in general paris in particular with terror lamentation prayers of forty hours and such a paroxysm of heroworship as was never seen for such an object before espagnac ii 12 adelung iv 180 fastes de louis xv ii 423 c c  for the cause of liberty here we consider was the culminating moment elsass lorraine and the three bishoprics lying in their quasimoribund condition austrian claims of compensation ceasing to be visions of the heated brain and gaining some footing on the earth as facts prince karl is here actually in elsass master of the strong passes elate in heart he and his france again as if fallen paralytic into temporary distraction offering for resistance nothing hitherto but that universal wailing of mankind heroworship of a thricelamentable nature and the prayers of fortyhours most christian majesty now in extremis centre of the basest hubbub that ever was is dismissing chateauroux noailles coigny and company hang well back upon the hill regions and strong posts which are not yet menaced or fly vaguely more or less distractedly hither and thither not in the least like fighting karl much less like beating him karl has germany free at his back nay it is a german population round him here neither haversack nor cartridgebox like to fail before him are only a noailles and consorts flying vaguely aboutand there is in karl or under the same cloak with him at present a talent of manoeuvring men which even friedrich finds masterly if old marshal wade at the other end of the line should chance to awaken and press home on saxe and his remnant of french with right vigor in fact there was not that i can see for centuries past not even at the siege of lille in marlboroughs time a more imminent peril for france     friedrich decides to intervene  king friedrich on hearing of these rhenish emergencies and of king louiss heroic advance to the rescue perceived that for himself too the moment was come and hastened to inform heroic louis that though the terms of their bargain were not yet completed sweden russia and other points being still in a pendent condition he friedrichwith an eye to success of their joint adventure and to the indispensability of joint action energy and the top of ones speed now or neverwould by the middle of this same august be on the field with 100000 men an invasion of bohemia will not that astonish prince karl and bring him to his rhinebridges again over which if your most christian majesty be active he will not get except in a half or wholly ruined state follow him close send the rest of your force to threaten hanover sit well on the skirts of prince karl him as he hurries homeward ruined or halfruined him or whatever austrian will fight i do my best to beat we may have bohemia and a beaten austria this very autumn seeand in one campaign there is peace ready for us this is friedrichs scheme of action success certain thinks he if only there be energy activity on your side as there shall be on mineand has sent count schmettau filled with fiery speed and determination to keep the french full of the like and concert mutual operations  magnanimous exclaim noailles and the paralyzed french gentlemen king louis i think now past speech for schmettau only came august 9th most sublime behavior on his prussian majestys part own they and truly it is a fine manful indifference by no means so common as it should be to all interests to all considerations but that of a joint enterprise one has engaged in and truly furthermore it was immediate salvation to the paralyzed french gentlemen in that alarming crisis though they did not much recognize it afterwards as such and indeed were conspicuously forgetful of all parts of it when their own danger was over  maria theresas feelings may be conceived george iis feelings and what the cause of liberty in general felt and furiously said and complained whensuddenly as a deus ex machina or supernal genie in the minor theatresfriedrich stept in precisely in this supreme crisis 7th august 1744 friedrichs minister graf von dohna at vienna has given notice of the frankfurt union and solemn engagement entered into obliged in honor and conscience will and must now step forth to right an injured kaiser cannot stand these high procedures against an imperial majesty chosen by all the princes of the reich this unheardof protest that the kaiser is no kaiser as if all germany were but austria and the queen of hungarys prussian majesty has not the least quarrel of his own with the queen of hungary stands true and will stand by the treaty of berlin and breslauonly with certain other german princes has done what all german princes and peoples not austrian are bound to do on behalf of their downtrodden kaiser formed a union of frankfurt and will with armed hand if indispensable endeavor to see right done in that matter in adelung iv 155 156 the declaration itself audience 7th august 1744 dohna off homeward on the second day after  this is the astonishing fact for the cause of liberty and no clamor and execration will avail anything this man is prompt too does not linger in getting out his sword when he has talked of it prince karls operation is likely to be marred amazingly if this swift king comparable to the old serpent for devices were to burst forth from his silesian strengths tread sharply on the tail of prince karls operation and bring back the formidably fanged head of it out of alsace five hundred miles all at oncethere would be a business  we will now quit the rhine operations which indeed are not now of moment friedrich being suddenly the key of events again i add only what readers are vaguely aware of that king louis did not die that he lay at deaths door for precisely one week 8th15th august symptoms mending on the 15th in the interimgrandalmoner fitzjames uncle of our conte di spinelli insisting that a certain cardinal who had got the sacraments in hand should insist and endless ministerial intrigue being busymoribund louis had when it came to the sacramental point been obliged to dismiss his chateauroux poor chateauroux an unfortunate female yet one almost thinks the best man among them dismissed at metz here and like to be mobbed that was the one issue of king louiss deathsickness sublime sickness during which all paris wept aloud in terror and sorrow like a child that has lost its mother and sees a mastiff coming wept sublimely and did the prayers of fortyhours and called king louis le bienaime the wellbelovedmerely some obstruction in the royal bowels it turned outa good cathartic and the prayers of fortyhours quite reinstated matters nay reinstated even chateauroux some time afterthe devil being well again and as the proverb says quitting his monastic view reinstated chateauroux but this time poor creature she continued only about a daysudden fever from excitement said the doctors fever poison you mean whispered others and looked for changes in the ministry enough oh enough  old marshal wade did not awaken though bawled to by his ligoniers and others and much shaken about poor old gentleman no artillery to speak of murmured he want baggagewagons too and lay still here is artillery answered the official people with my own money i will buy you baggagewagons answered the high maria anna in her own name and her prince karls who are jointgovernors there possibly he would have awakened had they given him time but time in war especially is the thing that is never given once friedrich had struck in the moment was gone by poor old wade of him also enough     chapter iifriedrich marches upon prag captures prag  it was on saturday early in the morning 15th august 1744 that friedrich set out attended by his two eldest brothers prince of prussia and prince henri from potsdam towards this new adventure which proved so famous since sudden swift to the worlds astonishmentactually on march here in three columns two through saxony by various routes southeastward one from silesia through glatz southwestward to invade bohemia rumor says 100000 strong fact itself says upwards of 80000 on their various routes converging towards prag heldengeschichteii 1165 orlich ii 25 27 enumerates the various regiments his columns especially his saxon columns are already on the road he joins one column this night at wittenberg and is bent through saxony towards the frontiers of bohemia at the utmost military speed he has  through saxony about 60000 go he has got the kaisers order to the government of saxony our august ally requiring on our imperial business a transit through youand winterfeld an excellent soldier and negotiator has gone forward to present said order a document which flurries the dresden officials beyond measure their king is in warsaw their king if here could do little and indeed has been inclining to maria theresa this long while and winterfeld insists on such despatchand not even the duke of weissenfels is in town dresden officials send off five couriers and thirteen estafettes to the poor old duke heldengeschichte ii 1163 get him at last andthe march is already taking effect they may as well consent to it what can they do but consent in the uttermost flurry they had set to fortifying dresden all hands driving palisades picking delving making coupures trenches or sunk barricades in the streetsfatally aware that it can avail nothing is not this the kaisers order prussians to the amount of 60000 are across our frontiers rapidly speeding on  friedrichs manifestounder the modest title anzeige der ursachen advertisement of the causes which have induced his prussian majesty to send the romish kaisers majesty some auxiliary troopshad appeared in the berlin newspapers thursday 13th only two days before an astonishment to all mankind which gave rise to endless misconceptions of friedrich but which supporting itself on proofs on punctually excerpted footnotes is intrinsically a modest quiet piece and what is singular in manifestoes has nothing or almost nothing in it that is not so far as it goes a perfect statement of the fact auxiliary troops that is our essential character no war with her hungarian majesty or with any other on our own score but her hungarian majesty how has she treated the romish kaiser her and our and the reichs sovereign head and to what pass reduced him refusing him peace on any terms except those of selfannihilation denying that he is a kaiser at alland enumerates the various imperial injuries with proof given quiet footnotes by way of proof and concludes in these words for himself his majesty requires nothing the question here is not of his majestys own interest at all everything his majesty required or requires is by the treaty of berlin solemnly his if the reich and its laws endure and he has taken up arms simply and solely in the view of restoring to the reich its freedom to the kaiser his headship of the reich and to all europe the peace which is so desirable given in seyfarth beylage i 121136 with date august 1744  pretences subterfuges lies exclaimed the austrian and allied public everywhere or strove to exclaim especially the english public which had no difficulty in so doinga public comfortably blank as to german facts or nonfacts and finding with amazement only this a very certain fact that hereby is their own pragmatic thunder checked in midvolley in a most surprising manner and the triumphant cause of liberty brought to jeopardy again perfidious ambitious capricious exclaimed they a prince without honor without truth without constancyand completed for themselves in hot rabid humor that english theory of friedrich which has prevailed ever since perhaps the most surprising item of which is this latter very prominent in those old times that friedrich has no constancy but follows his caprices and accidental whirls of impulseitem which has dropped away in our times though the others stand as stable as ever a monument of several things friedrichs suddenness is an essential part of what fighting talent he has if the public thrown into flurry cannot judge it well they must even misjudge it what help is there  that the above were actually friedrichs reasons for venturing into this big game again is not now disputable and as to the rumor which rose afterwards and was denied and could only be denied diplomatically to the ear if even to the ear that friedrich by secret article was to have for himself the three bohemian circles konigsgratz bunzlau leitmeritz which lie between schlesien and sachsen heldengeschichte i 1081 scholl ii 349there is not a doubt but friedrich had so bargained very well if we can get said circles and would right cheerfully have kept and held them had the big game gone in all points completely well game to reinstate the kaiser both in bohemia and bavaria by friedrichs fine playing not a doubt of all thisnor of what an extremely hypothetic outlook it then and always was greatly too weak for enticing such a man  friedrich goes in three columns one on the south or left shore of the elbe coming in various branches under friedrich himself this alone will touch on dresden pass on the south side of dresden gather itself about pirna in the saxon switzerland so called a notable locality thence over the metal mountains into bohmen by toplitz by lowositz leitmeritz and the highway called the pascopol famous in war the second column under leopold the young dessauer goes on the other or north side of the elbe at a fair distance marching through the lausitz rendezvous or startingpoint was bautzen in the lausitz straight south to meet the king at leitmeritz where the grand magazine is to be and thence still south straight upon prag in conjunction with his majesty or parallel to him heldengeschichte i 1081 these are the two saxon columns the third column under schwerin collects itself in the interior of silesia is issuing by glatz country through the giant mountains bohmische kamme bohemian combs as they are called which tourists know by the pass of braunaudisturbing the dreams of rubezahl if rubezahl happen to be there this say 20000 will come down upon prag from the eastern side and be first on the ground 31st augustfirst by one day in the home parts of silesia well eastward of glatz there is left another force of 20000 which can go across the austrian border there and hang upon the hills threatening olmutz and the moravian countries should need be  and so in its three columns from west from north from east the march with a steady swiftness proceeds important especially those two saxon columns from west and north 60000 of them with a frightful entsetzlich quantity of big guns coming up the elbe much is coming up the elbe indispensable highway for this enterprise three months provisions endless artillery and provender is on the elbe 480 big boats with immense vorspann of tracehorses dreadful swearing too as i have heard will pass through the middle of dresden not landing by any means no be assured of it ye dresdeners all flurried palisaded barricaded no hair of you shall be harmed after a day or two the flurry of saxony subsided prussians under strict discipline molest no private person pay their way keep well aloof to south and to north of dresden all but the necessary ammunitionescorts doand require of the official people nothing but what the law of the reich authorizes to imperial auxiliaries in such case the saxons themselves friedrich observes had some 40000 but scattered about king in warsawdreadful terror making coupures and tetesdepontcould have made no defence had we diligently spent eight days on them reflects he afterwards to seize saxony and hobble it with ropes so that at any time you could pin it motionless and even if need were milk the substance out of it would not have detained us eight days  oeuvres de frederic iii 53 which would have been the true plan had we known what was getting ready there certain it is friedrich did no mischief paid for everything anxious to keep well with saxony hoping always they might join him again in such a cause cause dear to every patriot german prince urges friedrichthough bruhl and the polish once moravian majesty are of a very different opinion  maria theresa her thoughts at hearing of it may be imagined the evil genius of my house afoot again my high projects on elsass and lorraine husband for kaiser elsass for the reich and him lorraine for myself and him gone probably to water nevertheless she said an official person heard her say my right is known to god god will protect me as he has already done  heldengeschichte ii 1024 and rose very strong and magnanimously defiant again perhaps at the bottom of her heart almost glad withal that she would now have a stroke for her dear silesia again unhindered by paladin george and his treaties and notions what measures against this nefarious prussian outbreak hateful to gods and men are possible she rapidly takes in bohemia in bavaria and her other countries that are threatened or can help and abates nothing of heart or hopepraying withal immensely she and her people according to the mode they have sending for prince karl we need not say doublequick as the very first thing  of maria theresa in hungaryfor she ran to presburg again with her woes august 16th diet just assembling therelet us say only that hungary was again chivalrous that old palfy and the general hungarian nation answered in the old tonevivat maria ad arma ad arma with tolpatches pandours warasdinsand in short that great and small in infinite insurrection have still a stroke of battle in them pro rege nostro scarcely above a district or two as the jaszers and kauers in their overcautious way making the least difficulty much enthusiasm and unanimity in all the others here and there a hungarian gentleman complaining scornfully that their troops known as among the best fighters in nature are called irregular troopsirregular forsooth in one public consultation district not important not very spellable though doubtless pronounceable by natives to it a gentleman suggests that winter is near should not there be some slight provision of tents of shelter in the frozen sleety mountains to our gallant fellows bound thither upon which another starts up when our ancestors came out of asia minor over the palus maeotis bound in winter ice and sabre in hand cut their way into this fine country which is still ours what shelter had they no talk of tents of barracks or accommodation there each wrapt in his sheep skin found it shelter sufficient tents  heldengeschichte  ii 1030 and the thing was carried by acclamation  wide wail in bohemia that war is coming back nobility all making off some to vienna or the intermediate towns lying thitherward some to their countryseats all out of prag willing mind on the part of the common people which the government strains every nerve to make the most of here are fasts processions prayers of fortyhours here as in vienna and elsewhere in vienna was a three days solemn fast the like in prag or better with procession to the shrine of st vituslittle likely to help i should fear rise all fencible men exclaims the governmentat least we will ballot and make you risemilitia people enter prag to the extent of 10000 like to avail little one would fear general harsch with reinforcement of real soldiers is despatched from vienna harsch one of our ablest soldiers since khevenhuller died gets in still

ramparts of the place then as to provisions endless corn is introducedfarmers forced the unwilling at the bayonets point to deliver in their corn much of it in sheaf so that we have to thrash it in the marketplace in the streets that are wide and thus in prag is heard the sound of flails among the militiadrums and so many other noises with the great churchorgans growling and the bass and treble miserere of the poor superstitious people rising to st vitus and others in fact it is a general dance of st vitusexcept that of the flails and militiamen working at the rampartsmostly not leading anywhither letter from a citizen of prag date 21st sept in heldengeschichte  ii 1168 which gives several curious details  meanwhile friedrichs march from west from north from east is flowing on diligent swift punctual to its times its places and meets no impediment to speak of at tetschen on the saxonbohemian frontiera pleasant schloss perched on its crags as tourists know where the elbe sweeps into saxon switzerland and its long stone labyrinthsat tetschen the austrians had taken post had tried to block the river driving piles into it and tumbling boulders into it with a view to stop the 480 prussian boats these people needed to be torn out their piles and they which was done in two days the soldier part of it and occupied the boatmen above a week before all was clear again prosperous correct to program all the rest not needing mention from ushere are the few sparks from it that dwell in ones memory  august 15th 1744 king left potsdam joined his first column that night at wittenberg through mieissen torgau freyberg is at peterswalde eastern slope of the metal mountains august 25th all the columns now on bohemian ground  friedrich had crossed elbe by the bridge of meissen on the southern shore politely waiting to receive his majesty there stood feldmarschall the duke of weissenfels to whom the king gave his hand no doubt in friendly style and talked for above half an hourwith such success thinks friedrich by and by we have heard of weissenfels before the same poor weissenfels who was wilhelminas wooer in old time now on the verge of sixty an extremely polite but weakish old gentleman accidentally preserved in history one of those conspicuous human clotheshorses phantasmal all but the digestive part which abound in that eighteenth century and others

poor citythird siege it has stood within these three years since that moonlight november night in 1741and are only waiting for their heavy artillery to begin battering the poor inhabitants in spite of three sieges the 10000 raw militiamen mostly of hungarian breed the 4000 regulars and harsch and old ogilvy are all disposed to do their best friedrich is naturally in haste to get hold of prag but he finds on taking survey that the swordinhand method is not now as in 1741 feasible at all that the place is in good posture of strength and will need a hot battering to tear it open owing to that accident at tetschen the siegecannon are not yet come up build your batteries your moldaubridges your communications till the cannon come and beware of bathyani meddling with your cannon by the road  bathyani is within twenty miles of us at beraun a compact little town to southwest gathering a magazine there and ready for enterprisesin more force than friedrich guesses drive him out seize that magazine of his orders friedrich september 5th and despatches general hacke on it a right manat whose wedding we assisted wedding to an heiress long since in friedrich wilhelms time if anybody now remembered and on the morrow there falls out a pretty little action of beraun about which great noise was made in the gazettes pro and contra which did not dislodge bathyani by airy means but which might easily have ruined the impetuous hacke and his 6000 getting into masked batteries pandour whirlwinds charges of horses from front from rear and from both flankshad not he with masterly

of harms way and begin collecting magazines at pilsen far rearward which may prove useful to prince karl in the route prince karl is upon  siegecannon having at last come september 8th the batteries are all mountedon wednesday 9th late at night the artillery in enormous quantity opens its dread throat poor prag is startled from its bed by torrents of shot solid and shell from three different quarters and makes haste to stand to its guns from three different quarters from bubenetsch northward from the upland of st lawrence famed weissenberg or whitehill westward and from the ziscaberg eastward hill of zisca where iron zisca posted himself on a grand occasion oncewhich latter is a broad long hill west end of it falling sheer over prag and on another point of it highest point of all the praguers have a strong battery and works the prag guns otherwise are not too effectual planted mostly on low ground by much the best prag battery is this of the ziscaberg and this after two days experience had of it the prussians determine to take on the morrow  september 12th schwerin who commands on that side assaults accordingly with the due steadfastness and stormfulness throwing shells and balls by way of prelude friedrich with some group of staffofficers and dignitaries steps out on the bubenetsch post to see how this affair of the ziscaberg will prosper the praguers thereabouts seeing so many dignitaries turn cannon on them disperse ihr herren have a care cried friedrich not himself much minding so intent upon the ziscaberg and could have skipt indifferently over your cannonballs ploughing the groundhad not one fateful ball shattered out the life of poor prince wilhelm a good young cousin of his shot down here at his hand doubtless a sharp moment for the king prince margraf wilhelm and a poor young page there they lie dead indifferent to the ziscaberg and all coming wars of mankind lamentation naturally for this young manbrother to the one who fell at

after his prelude of bombshells rushes on doublequick cannot be withstood hurls out the praguers and seizes their battery a ruinous loss to them  their grand zisca redoubt is gone then and two subsidiary small redoubts behind it withal which the french had built and named the magpienests nids a pie these also are ours and we overhang from our zisca hill the very roofs as it were and there is nothing but a long bare curtain now in this quarter ready to be battered in breach and soon holed if needful it is not needfulnot quite in the course of three days more our bubenetsch battery of enormous power has been so diligent it has set fire to the watermill burns irretrievably the watermill and still worse the wooden sluice of the moldau so that the river falls to the everywhere wadable pitch and governor harsch perceives that all this quarter of the town is open to any comerand in fact that he will have to get away the best he can  white flag accordingly tuesday 15th free withdrawal to the wischerad wont you by no manner of means answers friedrich bids schwerin from his ziscaberg make a hole or two in that curtain opposite him and gets ready for storm upon which harsch next morning has to beat the chamade and surrender prisoner of war and thus wednesday 16th it is done a siege of one week no moreafter all that thrashing of grain drilling of militia and other spirited

well on the skirts of marshal traun or of prince karl the cloak of traun who is hastening hitherward all he can     chapter iiifriedrich diligent in his bohemian conquests unexpectedly comes upon prince karl with no french attending him  this electrically sudden operation on prag was considered by astonished mankind whatever else they might think about it a decidedly brilliant feat of war falling like a bolt out of the bluelike three bolts suddenly coalescing over prag and striking it down friedrich himself though there is nothing of boast audible here or anywhere was evidently very well satisfied and thought the aspects good there is prince karl whirling instantly back from his strasburg prospects the general st vitus dance of austrian things rising higher and higher in these home partsreasonable hope that in the course of one campaign proud obstinate austria might feel itself so wrung and screwed as to be glad of peace with neighbors not wishing war that was the young kings calculation at this time and had france done at all as it promisedor had the young king himself been considerably wiser than he washe had not been disappointed in the way we shall see  friedrich admits he did not understand war at this period his own scheme now was to move towards the southwest there to abolish bathyani and his tolpatches who are busy gathering magazines for prince karls advent to seize the said magazines which will be very useful to us then advance straight towards the passes of the bohemian mountains towns of furth waldmunchen unfortunate town of cham burnt by trenck where masons are now busy these stand successive in the grand pass through which the highway runs some hundred miles or so from where we are march at ones swiftest thitherward bathyanis magazines to help and there await prince karl it was friedrichs own notion not a bad one though not the best the best he admits would have been to stay pretty much where he was abolish bathyanis tolpatch people seizing their magazines and collecting others in general well rooting and fencing himself in prag and in the circles that lie thereabouts upon the elbebounded to southward by the sazawa branch of the moldau which runs parallel to the elbebut well refusing to stir much farther at such an advanced season of the year  that second plan would have been the wisestthen why not follow it too tame a plan for the youthful mind besides we perceive as indeed is intimated by himself he dreaded the force of public opinion in france aha look at your king of prussia again gone to conquer bohemia and except the three circles he himself is to have of it lets bohemia go to the winds this sort of thing friedrich admits he dreaded too much at that young period so loud had the criticisms been on him in the time of the breslau treaty out upon your king of prussia call you that an honorable ally undoubtedly a weakness in the young king inasmuch says he as every general and every man add we should look to the fact not to the rumor of the fact well but at least he will adopt his own other notion that of making for the passes of the bohemian mountains to abolish bathyani at least and lock the door upon prince karls advent that was his own plan and though secondbest that also would have done well had there been no third  but there was as we hinted a third plan ardently favored by belleisle whose wartalent friedrich much respected at this time plan built on belleisles reminiscences of the old taborbudweis businesses and totally inapplicable now belleisle said go southeast not southwest right towards the austrian frontier itself that will frighten austria into a fine tremor shut up the roads from austria budweis neuhaus seize those two highroad towns and keep them if you would hold bohemia the want of them was our ruin there your ruin yes but your enemy was not coming from alsace and the southwest then he was coming from austria and your own home lay on the southwest it is all different now friedrich might well think himself bewitched not to have gone for cham and furth and the passes of the bohmerwald according to his own notion but so it was he yielded to the big reputation of belleisle and to fear of what the world would say of him in france a weakness which he will perhaps be taught not to repeat in fact he is now about to be taught several thingsand will have to pay his schoolwages as he goes     friedrich leaving small garrison in prag rushes swiftly up the moldau valley upon the taborbudweis country to please his french friends  friedrich made no delay in prag in haste at this late time of year september 17th on the very morrow of the siege the prussians get in motion southward on the 19th friedrich from his post to north of the city defiles through prag on march to kunraditzfirst stage on that questionable expedition up the moldau valley right bank towards tabor budweis neuhaus to threaten austria and please belleisle and the french  prag is left under general einsiedel with a small garrison of 5000einsiedel a steady elderly gentleman favorite of friedrich wilhelms has brief order or outline of order to be filled up by his

to miltschin and 27th to taborbut the diary would be tedious  friedrich goes in two columns one along the great road towards tabor under schwerin this and friedrich mainly with him the other to the right along the rivers bank under leopold young dessauer which has to go by wild country roads or now and then roads of its own making and much needs the pioneer a difficult march in the shortening days posadowsky follows with the proviant drawn by cattle of the horse and ox species daily falling down starved great swearing there too i doubt not general nassau is vanguard and stretches forward successfully at a much lighter pace  there are two rivers considerable branches of the moldau coming from eastward which and first of them the sazawa concern us here after mounting the southern uplands from prag for a day or two you then begin to drop again into the hollow of a river called sazawa important in bohemian wars it is of winding course the first considerable branch of the moldau rising in teutschbrod country seventy or eighty miles to east of us in regard to sazawa there is at present no difficulty about crossing the country being all ours after the sazawa mount again long miles day after day through intricate stony desolation rocks bogs untrimmed woods you will get to miltschin thence to tabor miltschin is the crown of that rough moor country from prag to tabor is some sixty miles after miltschin the course of those brown mountainbrooks is all towards the luschnitz the next considerable branch of the moldau branch still longer and more winding than the sazawa tabor towers up near this branch budweis on the moldau itself is forty miles farther and there at last you are out of the stony moors and in a rich champaign comfortable to man and horse were you but once there after plodding through the desolations but from that sazawa by the luschnitz on to budweis mounting and falling in such fashion there must be ninety miles or thereby plod along and keep a sharp eye on the whirling clouds of pandours for those too have got across upon usadded to the other tempests of autumn  on the ninth day of their march the prussians begin to descry on the horizon ahead the steeples and chimneytops of tabor on its high scarped rock or hill of ziscafor it was zisca and his hussites that built themselves this bit of inexpugnability and named it tabor from their biblesin those waste mountain regions on the tenth day 27th september the prussians without difficulty took tabor walls being ruined garrison small we lie at tabor till the 30th last day of september thence 2d october part of us to moldautein rightwards where cross the moldau by a bridgebridge one has heard of in old broglio timescross there with intent easily successful to snatch that castle of frauenberg darling of broglio for which he fought his pharsalia of a sahay to no purpose  both columns got united at tabor and paused for a day or two to rest and gather up their draggled skirts there the expedition does not improve in promise as we advance in it the march one of the most untowardly and posadowsky comes up with only half of his provisioncartshalf of his cattle having fallen down of bad weather hillroads and starvation what could he do that is an ominous circumstance not the less  three things are against the prussians on this march two of them accidental things first there is at this late season too the intrinsic nature of the country which friedrich with emphasis describes as boggy stony precipitous a waste hungry and altogether barren countrytoo emphatically so described but then secondly what might have been otherwise the population worked upon by austrian officials all fly from the sight of us nothing but fireless deserted hamlets and the corn if they ever had any all thrashed and hidden no amount of money can purchase any service from them poor dark creatures not loving austria much but loving some others even less it would appear of bigoted papist creed for one thing that is a great point we do not meddle with their worship more or less but we are heretics and they hate us as the night which is a dreadful difficulty you always have in bohemia nowhere but in the circle of konigsgraz where there are hussites far to the rear of us at this time will you find it otherwise this is difficulty second  then thirdly what much aggravates itwe neglected to abolish bathyani and here are bathyanis pandours come across the moldau on us plenty of pandoursto whom 10000 fresh hungarians of a new insurrection which has been got up there are daily speeding forward to add themselvessuch a swarm of hornets as darkens the very daylight for you vain to scourge them down to burn them off by blaze of gunpowder they fly fast but are straightway back again they lurk in these bushy wildernesses scraggy woods no foraging possible unless whole regiments are sent out to do it you cannot get a letter safely carried for them they are an unspeakable contemptible grief to the earnest leader of menlet us proceed however it will serve nothing to complain let us hope the french sit well on the skirts of prince karl these sorrowful labors may all turn to good in that case  friedrich pushes on from tabor shoots partly as we have seen across the moldau to the left bank as well captures romantic frauenberg on its high rock where broglio got into such a fluster once we could push to pisek too and make a bivouac of pisek if we lost our wits nassau is in budweis in neuhaus and proper garrisons are gone thither nothing wanting on our side of the business but these pandours these 10000 insurrection hungarians with their trencks spurring them a continual unblessed swarm of hornets these which shut out the very light of day from us too literally the light of day we can get no free messaging from part to part of our own army even as many as six orderlies have been despatched to an outlying general and not one of them could get through to him they have snapt up three letterbags destined for the king himself for four weeks he is absolutely shut out from the rest of europe knows not in the least what the kaiser or the most christian or any other king is doing or whether the french are sitting well on prince karls skirts or not attempting that at all this also is a thing to be amended a thing you had to learn your majesty an army absolutely shut out from news from letters messages to or fro and groping its way in darkness owing to these circumambient thunderclouds of tolpatches is not a wellsituated army and alas when at last the letterbag did get through andbut let us not anticipate  at tabor there arose two opinions which in spite of the kings presence was a new difficulty south from tabor a days march the highway splits direct way for vienna lefthand goes to neuhaus righthand or straightforward rather goes to budweis bearing upon linz which of these two nassau has already seized budweis and it is a habitable champaign country in comparison neuhaus farther from the moldau and its uses but more imminent on austria would be easy to seize and would frighten the enemy more leopold the young dessauer is for budweis rapid schwerin a hardy outspoken man is emphatic for the other place as headquarter so emphatic are both that the two generals quarrel there and friedrich needs his authority to keep them from outbreaks from open incompatibility henceforth which would be destructive to the service for the rest friedrich seizes both places sends a detachment to neuhaus as well but holds by budweis and the moldau region with his main army which was not quite gratifying to the hardy schwerin on the opposite or left bank holding frauenberg the renowned hillfortress there we make inroads at discretion but the country is woody favorable to pandours and the right bank is our chief scene of action how we are to maintain ourselves in this country to winter in these towns between the sazawa and the luschnitz unless the french sit well on prince karls skirts it will not be possible     the french are little grateful for the pleasure done them at such ruinous expense  french sitting well on prince karls skirts they are not molesting prince karl in the smallest never tried such a thingare turned away to the brisgan to the upper rhine country gone to besiege freyburg there and seize towns about the lake of constance as if there were no friedrich in the game it must be owned the french do liberally pay off old scores against friedrichif except in their own imagination they had old scores against him no man ever delivered them from a more imminent peril and they the rope once cut that was strangling them magnificently forget who cut it and celebrate only their own distinguished conduct during and after the operation to a degree truly wonderful  it was moonlight clear as day that night 23d august when prince karl had to recross the rhine close in their neighborhood guerre de boheme iii 196and instead of harassing prince karl to half or to whole ruin as the bargain was their distinguished conduct consisted in going quietly to their beds old marechal de noailles even calling back some of his too forward subalterns and joyfully leaving prince karl then and afterwards to cross the rhine and march for bohmen at his own perfect convenience  seckendorf will sit on karls skirts they said too late for us this season next season you shall see such was their theory after louis got that cathartic and rose from bed schmettau with his importunities which at last irritated everybody could make nothing more of it let the king of france crown his glories by the siege of freyburg the conquest of brisgaufor behoof of the poor kaiser dont you observe hither austria is the kaisersand furthermore were freyburg gone there will be no invading of elsass again which is another privately very interesting point  and there at freyburg the most christian king now is and his army up to the knees in mud conquering hither austria besieging freyburg with much difficulty owing to the wetbesieging there with what energy a spectacle to the world and has for the present but one wife no mistress either with rapturous eyes france looks on with admiration too big for words voltaire i have heard made pilgrimage to freyburg with rhymed panegyric in his pocket saw those miraculous operations of a most christian king miraculously awakened and had the honor to present said panegyric and be seen for the first time by the royal eyeswhich did not seem to relish him much the panegyric epitre au roi devant fribourg is in oeuvres de voltaire xvii 184 since the first days of october freyburg had been under constant assault amid rains amid frosts a siege long and murderous to the besieging partyand was not got till november 5th not quite entirely the citadels of it till november 25th majesty gone home to paris to illuminations and triumphal arches in the interim adelung iv 266 barbier ii 414 13th november c for the illuminations grand in the extreme in spite of wild rains and winds it had been a difficult and bloody conquest to him this of freyburg and the brisgau country and i never heard that either the kaiser or he got sensible advantage by itthough prince karl on the present occasion might be said to get a great deal  seckendorf will do your prince karl they had cried always seckendorf and his prussian majesty are not we conquering hither austria here for the kaisers behoof seckendorf they did officially appoint to pursue appoint or allowand laid all the blame on seckendorf who perhaps deserved his share of it very certain it is seckendorf did little or nothing to prince karl marched leisurely behind him through the oberpfalzskirting baireuth country karl and he to wilhelminas grief her letters  oeuvres de frederic xxvii i 133 cleisurely behind him at a distance of four days knew better than meddle with prince karl so that prince karl in twentyone marches disturbed only by the elements and bad roads reached waldmunchen 26th september in the furthcham country ranke iii 187 and was heard to exclaim we are let off for the fright then nous voila quittes pour la peurseckendorf finding nothing to live upon in oberpfalz could not attend prince karl farther but turned leftwards home to bavaria made a kind of second reconquest of bavaria on exactly the same terms as the first austrian occupants being all called off to assist in bohmen againconcerning which here is an excerpt  seckendorf following at his leisure and joined by the hessians and pfalzers so as now to exceed 30000 leaves prince karl and the rest of the enterprise to do as it can and applies himself for his own share as the needfulest thing to getting hold of bavaria again that his poor kaiser may have where to lay his head and pay old servants their wages dreadfully exclaimed against the old gentleman especially by the french comanagers why did not the old traitor stick in the rear of prince karl in the difficult passes and drive him pronewhile we went besieging freyburg and poaching about trying for a bit of the brisgau while chance served a traitor beyond doubt probably bought with money down thinks valori but after all what could seckendorf do he is now of weight for barenklau and bavaria not for much more he does sweep barenklau and his austrians from bavaria clear out in the course of this october all but ingolstadt and two or three strong townspassau especially which can be blockaded and afterwards besieged if needful for the rest he is dreadfully illoff for provisions incapable of the least attempt on passau as friedrich urged on hearing of him again and will have to canton himself in homequarters and live by his shifts till spring  the noise of french censure rises loud against not themselves but against seckendorffriedrich before that tolpatch eclipse of correspondence when three of his letterbags were seized and he fell quite dark had too well foreboded and contemptuously expressed his astonishment at the blame both were well earning passau said he cannot you go at least upon passau which might alarm the enemy a little and drag him homewards adieu my dear seckendorf your officer will tell you how we did the siege of prag you and your french are wetted hens poules mouilleescowering about like drenched hens in a day of set rain as i hear nothing of either of you i must try to get out of this business without your helpotherwise it will be ill for me indeed excerpted fragment of a letter from friedrichexact date not given date of excerpt is donanworth country 23d september 1744which the french agent in seckendorfs army had a reading of campagnes de coigny iv 185187 ib 216219 cited in adelung iv 225 which latter expression alarmed the french and set them upon writing and bustling but not upon doing anything  prince karl had crossed the rhine unmolested in the clearest moonlight august 23d24th seckendorf was not wholly got to heilbronn september 8th a pretty way behind prince karl the 6000 hessians formerly in english pay indignant landgraf wilhelm who never could forgive

friedrich britannic majestys soninlaw not good fat uncle george commanding them henceforthwith extreme lack of profit to prince friedrich to the hessians and to the french as will appear in time these 6000 and certain thousands of pfalzers likewise in french pay are now with seckendorf and have raised him to above 30000it is the one fruit king friedrich has got by that union of frankfurt and by all his long prospective haggling and struggling for a union of german princes in general two pears after that long shaking of the tree both pears rotten or indeed falling into seckendorf who is a basket of such quality seckendorf increased in this munificent manner can he still do nothing cry the french the old traitori have no magazines said seckendorf nothing to live upon to shoot with no money and it is a mutual crescendo between the perfidious seckendorf and them without work done in the nurnberg country some hussars of his picked up lord holderness an english ambassador making for venice by that bad route prisoner are not you but they did not use him ill on consideration the heads of imperial departments gave him a pass and he continued his venetian journey result of it zero without farther molestation that i heard of adelung iv 222  these frenchseckendorf cunctations recriminations and drenchedhen procedures are an endless sorrow to poor kaiser karl who at length can stand it no longer but resolves since at least bavaria though moneyless and in ruins is his he will in person go thither confident that there will be victual and equipment discoverable for self and army were he

blazes into illuminationsforgetful who caused its past wretchednesses hoping only all wretchedness is now ended let ruined huts and cham and the burnt towns rebuild themselves the wasted hedges make up their gaps again here is the king come home here sure enough is an unfortunate kaiser of the holy romish reich who can once more hope to pay his milkscores being a loved kurfurst of bavaria at least very dear to the hearts of these poor peopleand to their purses interests and skins has not he in another sense been dear what a price the ambitions and cracked phantasms of that weak brain have cost the seemingly innocent population population harried hungered down dragged off to perish in italian wars a country burnt tribulated torn to ruin under the harrow of fate and ruffian trenck and company britannic george rather a dear morsel too has come much cheaper hitherto england is not yet burnt nothing burning thereexcept the dull fire of deliriums natural stupidities all set flaming which whatever it may be in the way of loss is not felt as a loss but rather as a comfort for the time beingand in fact there are only say a forty or fifty thousand armed englishmen rotted down and scarcely a hundred millions of money yet spent nothing to speak of in the cause of human liberty why populations suffer for their guilty kings my friend it is the populations too that are guilty in having such kings reverence sacred respect for human worth sacred abhorrence of human unworth have you considered what it means these poor populations have it not or for long generations have had it less and less hence by degrees this sort of kings to them and enormous consequences following  karl vii got back to munchen 23d october 1744 and the tarbarrels being once burnt and indispensable sortings effected he went to the field along with seckendorf to encourage his men under seckendorf and urge the french by all considerations to come on and really did what he could poor man but the cordage of his life had been so strained and torn he was not now good for much alas it had been but little he was ever good for a couple of dear kurfursts his father and he have stood these bavarian countries very high since the battle of blenheim and downwards     chapter ivfriedrich reduced to straits cannot maintain his moldau conquests against price karl  one may fancy what were friedrichs reflections when he heard that prince karl had prosperously and unmolested got across by those passes from the oberpfalz into bohmen and the circle of pilsen into junction with bathyani and his magazines at mirotitz october 2d ranke iii 194 orlich ii 49 heard moreover that the saxons 20000 strong under weissenfels crossing the metal mountains coming on by eger and karlsbad regions were about uniting with him bound by treaty to assist the hungarian majesty when invadedand had finally what confirms everything that the said prince karl in person making for budweis just seen his advanced guard said rumor under mistake was but few miles off few miles off on the other side of the moldauof unknown strength hidden in the circumambient clouds of pandours  suppressing all the rages and natural reflections but those needful for the moment friedrich october 4th by moldautein dashes across the moldau to seek prince karl at the place indicated and at once smite him down if possiblethat will be a remedy for all things prince karl is not there nor was the indication had been false friedrich searches about for four days to no purpose prince karl he then learns for certain has crossed the moldau farther down farther northward between prag and us means to cut us off from prag then which is our fountain of life in these circumstances that is his intentionold traun who is with him understands his trade thinks friedrich traun or the prince is diligently forming magazines all the country carrying to him in the town of beneschau hither side of the sazawa some seventy miles north of us an important town where roads meetunless we can get hold of beneschau it will be ill with us here across the river again at any rate and let us hasten thither that is an affair which must be looked to and speed is necessary  october 8th after four days search ending in this manner friedrich swiftly crosses towards tabor again to bechin over on the luschnitz one march there to collect himself for beneschau and the other intricacies towards tabor again by his bridge of moldauteinclouds of pandour people larger clouds than usual hanging round hidden by the woods till friedrich is gone friedrich being gone there occurs the affair of moldautein much talked of in prussian books of which in extreme condensation this is the essence  october 9th friedrich once off to bechin the pandour clouds gather on his rearguard next day at tein bridge here to the number of about 10000 rumor counts 14000 and with desperate intent and more regularity than usual attack the teinbridge party which consists of perhaps 2000 grenadiers and hussars the whole under ziethens chargeobliged to wait for a cargo of breadwagons here defend your bridge with cannon with caseshot that is what the

the moldau countries cannot owing to the skill of prince karl or of old feldmarschall traunhas to retire behind the sazawa and ultimately behind the elbe with much labor in vain  october 14th18th retreat from bechintabor country to beneschau  these pandours give us trouble enough no magazine here no living to be had in this country beside them unfortunate colonel jahnus went out from tabor lately to look after requisitioned grains infinite pandours set upon him muhlhausen is the memorable place jahnus was obstinate too obstinate thinks friedrich and perished on the ground he and 200 of his  oeuvres de frederic iii 61 nay next a swarm of them came to tabor itself nadasti at their head to try whether tabor with its small garrison could not be escaladed and perhaps prince henri who lies sick there be taken tabor taught them another lesson sent them home with heads brokenwhich friedrich thinks was an extremely suitable thing but so it stands here by the thousand and the ten thousand they hang round us and prince karlit is of all things necessary we get hold of that beneschau and the magazine he is gathering there  rapidity is indispensableand yet how quit tabor we have detachments out at neuhaus at budweis and in tabor 300 men in hospital whom there are no means of carrying to leave them to the tolpaches friedrich confesses he was weak on this occasion he could not leave these 300 men as was his clear duty in this extremity of war he ordered in his neuhaus detachment not yet any of the others he despatched schmerin towards beneschau with all his speed schwerin was lucky enough to take beneschau and its provendera most blessed fortuneand fences himself there hearing which friedrich having now got the neuhaus detachment in hand orders the other three the budweis the tabor here and the frauenberg across the river to maintain themselves and then leaving those southern regions to their chance hastens towards beneschau and schwerin encamps october 18th

means trauns who sees that hunger and wet weather will of themselves suffice for friedrich there ensues accordingly for three weeks to come in that confused country a series of swift shufflings checkings and manoeuvrings between these two which is gratifying and instructive to the strategic mind but cannot be inflicted upon common readers two considerable chessplayers an old and a young their chessboard a bushy rocky marshy parallelogram running fifty miles straight east from prag and twenty or fewer south of which prag is the northwest angle and beneschau or the impregnable konopischt the southwest the reader must conceive it and how traun will not fight friedrich yet makes him skip hither and thither chiefly by threatening his victuals friedrichs main magazine is now at pardubitz the extreme northeast angle of the parallelogram parallelogram has one river in it with the innumerable rocks and brooks and quagmires the river sazawa and on the north side where are kuttenberg czaslau chotusitz places again become important in this business it is bounded by another river the elbe intricate manoeuvring there is here for three weeks following old traun an admirable man thinks friedrich who ever after recognized traun as his schoolmaster in the art of war we mark here and there a date and leave it to readers  radicz october 21st22d at radicz a march to southwest

of wintering between the luschnitz and the sazawa there is now little unless they will fight us and be beaten friedrich from his inaccessible camp of konopischt manoeuvres reconnoitres in all directions to produce this result but to no purpose an austrian detachment did come to look after beneschau and the magazines there but rapidly drew back again finding konopischt on their road and how matters were friedrich will guard the door of this sazawaelbe tract of country hope of the sazawaluschnitz tract has in few days fallen extinct here is news come to konopischt our three poor garrisons

are all three gone eight couriers galloping with message come away were all picked up by the pandours so they stood and were lost three thousand fighting men gone for the weak chance of saving three hundred who were in hospital thinks friedrich war is not a school of the weak pities for the chance of ten you lose a hundred and the ten too sazawaelbe tract of country let us vigilantly keep the door of that  saturday october 24th friedrich out reconnoitring from konopischt discovers of a certainty that the whole austriansaxon force is now advaucing towards beneschau and will this night encamp at marschowitz to southwest only one march from us on the instant friedrich hurries back gets his army on march thitherward though the late october sun is now past noon off instantly a stroke yonder will perhaps be the cure of all such roads we had says friedrich as never army travelled before long after nightfall we arrive near the austrian camp bivouac as we can till daylight return at the first streak of day friedrich and his chief generals are on the heights with their spyglasses austrian army sure enough and there they have altered their posture overnight for traun too has been awake they lie now opposite our right flank on a scarped height at the foot of which through swamps and quagmires runs a muddy stream unattackable on this side their right flank and foot are safe enough creep round and see their leftnothing but copses swampy intricacies we may shoulder arms again and go back to konopischt no fight here oeuvres de frederic iii 63 64 orlich ii 69 speaking of defensive campaigns says friedrich didactically years afterwards if such situations are to answer the purpose intended the front and flanks must be equally strong but the rear entirely open such for instance are those heights which have an extensive front and whose flanks are covered by morassesas was prince karls camp at marschowitz in the year 1744 with its front covered by a stream and the wings by deep hollows or that which we ourselves then occupied at konopischtas you well remember military instructions above cited p 44  october 26thnovember 1st the sazawaluschnitz tract of country is quite lost then lost with damages the question now is can we keep the sazawaelbe tract for about three weeks more friedrich struggles for that object cannot compass that either want of horseprovender is very greatcountry entirely eaten say the peasants and not a truss remaining october 26th friedrich has to cross the sazawa we must quit the door of that tract hunger driving us and fight for the interior in detail traun gets to beneschau in that cheap way and now in behalf of traun the peasants find forage enough being zealous for queen and creed pandours spread themselves all over this sazawaelbe country endanger our subsistences make our lives miserable it is the old story friedrich famine and mud and misery of pandours compelling has to retire northward elbeward inch by inch whither the austrians follow at a safe distance and in spite of all manoeuvring cannot be got to fight  brave general nassau who much distinguishes himself in these businesses has though friedrich does not yet know it dexterously seized kolin westward in those elbe partsground that will be notable in years coming important little feat of nassaus of which anon on the other hand our magazine at pardubitz eastward on the elbe is not out of danger pandours and regulars 2000 and odd sixty of the pandour kind disguised as peasants leading haycarts made an attempt there lately but were detected by the vigilant colonel and blown to pieces in the nick of time some of them actually within the gate  oeuvres de frederic iii 65 nay a body of austrian regulars were in full march for kolin lately intending to get hold of the elbe itself at that point midway between prag and pardubitz but the prompt general nassau as we remarked had struck in before them and now holds kolinthough for several days friedrich could not tell what had become of nassau owing to the swarms of pandours  friedrich standing with his back to prag which is fifty miles from him and rather in need of his support than able to give him any and drawing his meal from the uncertain distance with pandours hovering roundis in difficult case while old traun is kept luminous as midday the circumambient atmosphere of pandours is tenebrific to friedrich keeps him in perpetual midnight he has to read his position as with flashes of lightning for most part a heavyladen sorely exasperated man and must keep his haggard miseries strictly secret which i believe he does were valori here it is very possible he might find the countenance farouche again eyes gloomy on damp november mornings schwerin in a huff has gone home since your majesty is pleased to prefer his young durchlaucht of anhalts advice what can an elderly servant not without rheumatisms do otherwell answers friedrich not with eyes cheered by the phenomenon the elbesazawa tract even this looks as if it would be hard to keep a world very dark for friedrich enveloped so by the ill chances and the pandours but what help  from the french camp far away there comes dated 17th october third week of their siege of freyburg by way of help to friedrich magnanimous promise so soon as this siege is done which will be speedily though it is difficult we propose to send fifty battalions and a hundred squadronssay only 60000 horse and foot not a hoof or toe of which ever got that length on actually trying ittowards westphalia to bring the elector of koln to reason poor kaisers lanky brother who cannot stand the french procedures and has lately sold himself that is sold his troops to england and keep the king of england and the dutch in checkby way of solacement to your majesty will you indeed you magnanimous alliesthis was picked up by the pandours and i know not but friedrich was spared the useless pain of reading it orlich ii 73  november 1st9th friedrich loses sazawaelbe country too on the first day of november here is a lightningflash which reveals strange things to friedrich trauns late manoeuvrings which have been so enigmatic to right and to left upon prag and other points issue now in an attempt towards pardubitz which reveals to friedrich the intention traun has formed of forcing him to choose one of those two places and let go the other formidable fatal thinks friedrich and yet admirable on the part of traun a design beautiful and worthy of admiration if we stay near prag what becomes of our communication with silesia what becomes of silesia itself if we go towards pardubitz prag and bohmen are lost what to do despatch reinforcement to pardubitz thanks to nassau the kolinpardubitz road is ours that is done pardubitz saved for the moment could we now get to kuttenberg before the old marshal his design were overset altogether alas we cannot march at once have to wait a day for the bread forward nevertheless and again forward and again three heavy marches in november weather let us make a fourth forced march start tomorrow before dawnkuttenberg above all things in vain tomorrow 4th november there is such a fog dark as london itself from six in the morning onwards no starting till noon and then impossible with all our efforts to reach kuttenberg we have to halt an eight miles short of it in front of kolin and pitch tents there on the morrow 5th november traun is found encamped unattackable between us and our object sits there at his ease in a friendly country with pandour whirlpools flowing out and in an irreducible case to friedrich november 5th and for three days more friedrich to no purpose tries his utmostfinds he will have to give up the elbesazawa region like the others monday november 9th friedrich gathers himself at kolin crosses the elbe by kolin bridge that day point after point of the game going against him  kolin was of course attacked that monday evening so soon as the main army crossed but so soon as the army left general nassau had taken his measures and with his great guns and his small handled the pandours in a way that pleased us  oeuvres de frederic iii 68 thursday night following they came back with regular grenadiers to support under cloud of night in great force ruffian trenck at the head of them a frightful phenomenon to weak nerves but this also nassau treated in such a fiery fashion that it vanished without return three hundred dead left on the ground and ruffian trenck riding off with his own crown brokenbeautiful indigo face streaking itself into ginghampattern for the moment  except pardubitz where also the due battalions are left friedrich now holds no post south of the elbe in this quarter elbesazawa tract is gone like the others to all appearance and we must now say silesia or prag prince leopold councilofwar being held on the matter is for keeping hold of prag pity to lose all the excellent siegeartillery we brought thither says he true too true an illmanaged business that of prag thinks friedrich sadly to himself but what is prag and artillery compared to silesia parthian retreat into silesia and let prag and the artillery go that to friedrich is clearly the sure course or perhaps the fatal alternative will not actually arrive so long as pardubitz and kolin hold and we have the elbe for barrier truth is prince karl has himself written to court that having now pushed his enemy fairly over the elbe and winter being come with its sleets and slushes ruinous to troops that have been so marched about the campaign ought to endnay his own young wife is in perilous interesting circumstances and the poor prince wishes to be home to which however it is again understood maria theresa has emphatically answered nofinish first  november 9th19th we defend the elbe river friedrich has posted himself on the north shore of the elbe from pardubitz to the other side of kolin means to defend that side of the river where go the silesian roads at bohdenetz short way across from pardubitz he himself is prince leopold is near kolin thirty miles of riverbank to dispute the controversy lasts ten days ends in elbeteinitz a celebrated passage in books and otherwise friedrich is in shaggy intricate country no want of dingles woods and quagmires now and then pleasant places toohere is kladrup for example where our father came three hundred miles to dine with the kaiser once the grooms and colts are all off at present father and kaiser are off and much is changed since then grim tussle of war now sleety winter and the giant mountains in the distance getting on their white hoods friedrich doubtless has his thoughts as he rides up and down in sight of kladrup among other places settling many things but what his thoughts were he is careful not to say except where necessary much is to be looked after in this river controversy of thirty miles detachments lie at intervals all the way and mounted sentries a sentry every five miles patrol the riverbank vigilant we hope as lynxes nothing can cross but alarm will be given and by degrees the whole prussian force be upon it this is the circle of konigsgratz this that now lies to rear and happily there are a few hussites in it not utterly indisposed to do a little spying for us and bring a glimmering of intelligence now and then  it is now the second week that frietrich has lain so with his mounted patrols in motion with his hussite spies guarding arguslike this thirty miles of river and the austrians attempt nothing or nothing with effect if the austrians go home to their winterquarters he hopes to issue from kolin again before spring and to sweep the elbesazawa tract clear of them after all maria theresa having answered no it is likely the austrians will try to get across be vigilant therefore ye mounted sentries or will they perhaps make an attempt on prag einsiedel who has no garrison of the least adequacy apprises us that in all the villages round prag people are busy making ladderswhat can that mean friedrich has learned by intercepted letters that something great is to be done on wednesday 18th he sends rothenburg with reinforcement to einsiedel lest a scalade of prag should be on the cards rothenburg is right welcome in the lines of prag though with reinforcement still ineffectual but it is not prag that is meant nor is wednesday the day through wednesday friedrich all eye and ear could observe nothing much marching to and fro on the austrian side of the river but apparently it comes to nothing the mounted patrols had better be vigilant however  on the morrow 5 am what is this that is going on audible booming of cannon of musketry and battle echoing through the woods penetrates to friedrichs quarters at bohdenetz in the pardubitz region attack upon kolin nassau defending himself there out swift scouts and see many scouts gallop out but none comes back friedrich for hours has to remain uncertain can only hope nassau will defend himself boom go the distant volleyings no scout comes back and it is not nassau or kolin it is something worse very glorious for prussian valor but ruinous to this campaign  the austrians at 2 oclock this morning austrians and saxons came in great force in dead silence to the south brink of the river opposite a place called teinitz elbeteinitz ten miles east of kolin that was the fruit of their marching yesterday they sat there forbidden to speak to smoke tobacco or do anything but breathe till all was ready till pontoons cannons had come up and some gleam of dawn had broken at the first gleam of dawn as they are shoving down their pontoon boats there comes a werda who goes from our prussian patrol across the river receiving no answer he fires and is himself shot down one wedell wedell and ziethen who keep watch in this part start instantly at sound of these shots and make a dreadful day of it for these invasive saxon and austrian multitudes naturally too they send off scouts galloping for more help to the right and to the left but that avails not wild doggery of pandours it would seem have already swum or waded the river above teinitz and belowwant of vigilance barks friedrich impatiently but such a doggery is difficult to watch with effect at any rate to the right and to the left the woods are already beset with pandours every scout sent out is killed and to east or to west there comes no news but an echoing of musketry a boom of distant cannon orlich ii 8285 saxonaustrian battalions four or five with unlimited artillery going versus wedells one battalion with musketry and ziethens hussars it is fearful odds the prussians stand to it like heroes doggedly for four hours continue the disputetill it is fairly desperate two bridges of the enemys now finishedwhereupon they manoeuvre off with parthian or prussian countenance into the woods safe towards kolin despatching definite news to friedrich which does arrive about 11 am and sets him at once on new measures  this is a great feat in the prussian military annals for which sad as the news was wedell got the name of leonidas attached to him by friedrich himself and indeed it is a gallant passage of war forcing of the elbe at teinitz of which i could give two narratives one from the prussian and one from the saxon side seyfarth beylage i 595598 heldengeschichte  ii 11751181 didactic admonitory to the military mind nay to the civic reader that has sympathy with heroisms with work done manfully and terror and

are across without a doubt we would have helped it and could not steady     friedrichs retreat especially einsiedels from prag  seeing then that they are fairly over friedrich with a creditable veracity of mind sees also that the game is done and that same night he begins manoeuvring towards silesia lest far more be lost by continuing the play one column under leopold the young dessauer goes through glatz takes the magazine of pardubitz along with it good to go in several columns the enemy will less know which to chase friedrich with another column will wait for nassau about konigsgratz then go by the more westerly road through nachod and the pass of braunau nassau who is to get across from kolin and join us northwards has due rendezvous appointed him in the konigsgratz region einsiedel in prag is to spike his guns since he cannot carry them blow up his bastions and the like and get away with all discretion and all diligencenorthwestward first to leitmeritz where our magazines are there to leave his heavier goods and make eastward towards friedland and across the silesian combs by what passes he can will have a difficult operation but must stand to it and speed steady simultaneous regular unresting velocity that is the word for all and so it is donethough with difficulty on the part of poor einsiedel for one it was thursday 19th november when the austrians

einsiedel whose disasters made considerable noise in the world that winter and afterwards  the two main columns were not much molested that which went by glatz under leopold was not pursued at all on the rear of friedrichs own column going towards braunau all the way to nachod or beyond there hung the usual doggery of pandours which required whipping off from time to time but in the defiles and difficult places due precaution was taken and they did little real damage truchsess von waldburg our old friend of the spartan feat near austerlitz in the moravianforay time whom we have known in london society as prussian envoy in bygone years was in one of the divisions of this column and one day at a village where there was a little river to cross river mietau konigsgratz branch of the elbe got provoked injudiciously into fighting with a body of these people intent not on whipping them merely but on whipping them to death truchsess had already lost some forty men and the business with such crowds of them was getting hot when all at once a loud squeaking of pigs was heard in the villageapprehensive swineherd hastily penning his pigs belike and some pig refractoryat sound of which the pandour multitude suddenly pauses quits fighting and struck by a new enthusiasm rushes wholly into the village leaving truchsess in a tragicomic humor victorious but half ashamed of himself  oeuvres de frederic iii 73 in the beginning of december friedrichs column reached home by braunau through the mountains the same way part of it had come in august not quite so brilliant in equipment now as then  it was upon einsiedels poor garrison leaving prag in such haste that the real stress of the retreat fell its difficulties great indeed and its losses great einsiedel did what was possible but all things are not possible on a weeks warning he spiked great guns shook endless hundredweights of powder and 10000 stand of arms into the river he requisitioned horses oxen without number put mines under the bastions almost none of which went off with effect he kept prag accurately shut the praguers accurately in the dark took his measures prudently and labored night and day one measure i

side decipherable with industry not now worth deciphering to english readers only that final scene of the pitchlinks the night before meeting with nassau dwells voluntarily in ones memory and is the farewell of einsiedel withal friedrich blames him to the last though a courtmartial had sat on his case some months after and honorably acquitted him good solid silent einsiedeland in some months more he went to a still higher court got still stricter justice i do not hear expressly that it was the winter marches or strain of mind but he died in 1745 and that flare of pitchlinks in rubezahls

treaty of breslau not by her fault is broken palpably a treaty no longer that they accordingly are absolved from all oaths and allegiance to the king of prussia and shall hold themselves in readiness to swear anew to her majesty which will be a great comfort to such faithful creatures suffering as her majesty explains to them that they have done under prussian tyranny for these two years past immediate deadlift effort there shall be that is certain and the almighty god assisting who does not leave such injustices unpunished we have the fixed christian hope omnipotence blessing our arms of almost immediately ehestens delivering you from this temporary bondage bisherigen joch you can pray in the mean while for the success of her majestys arms good fighting aided by prayer in a cause clearly heavens will now to appearance bring matters swiftly round again to the astonishment and confusion of bad men in heldengeschichte  ii 11941198 ib 12011206 is friedrichs answer 19th december 1744  these are her majestys views intensely true i doubt not to her devout heart robinson and the english seem not to be enthusiastic in that direction as indeed how can they they would fain be tender of silesia which they have guaranteed fain now and afterwards restrain her majesty from driving at such a pace down hill but the declivity is so encouraging her majesty is not to be restrained and goes faster and faster for the time being and indeed under less devout forms the general impression among pragmatic people saxon austrian british even was that friedrich had pretty much ruined himself and deserved to do so that this of his being mere auxiliary to a kaiser in distress was an untenable pretext now justly fallen bankrupt upon him the evident fact that he had by his frankfurt union and struggles about union reopened the door for french tribulations and roughridings in the reich was universally distasteful all chance of a general union of german princes in aid of their kaiser was extinct for the present  friedrichs rapidity had served him ill with the public in this as in some other instances friedrich contemplating his situation not selfdelusively but with the candor of real remorse was by no means yet aware how very bad it was for six months coming partly as existing facts better disclosed themselves as france saxony and others showed what spirit they were of partly as new sinister events and facts arrived one after the otherhis outlook continued to darken and darken till it had become very dark indeed there is perennially the great comfort immense if you can manage it of making front against misfortune of looking it frankly in the face and doing with a resolution hour by hour your own utmost against it friedrich never lacked that comfort and was not heard complaining but from december 13th 1744 when he hastened home to berlin under such aspects till june 4th 1745 when aspects suddenly changed are probably the worst six months friedrich had yet had in the world during which his affairs all threatening to break down about him he himself behooving to stand firm if the worst was not to realize itself had to draw largely on what silent courage or private inexpugnability of mind was in hima larger instalment of that royal quality as i compute than the fates had ever hitherto demanded of him ever hitherto though perhaps nothing like the largest of all which they had upon their books for him at a farther stage as will be seen for he was greatly drawn upon in that way in his time and he paid always no man in his century so well few men in any century better as perhaps readers may be led to guess or acknowledge on surveying and considering to see and sympathetically recognize cannot be expected of modern readers in the present great distance and changed conditions of men and things  friedrich after despatching nassau to cut out einsiedel had delivered the silesian army to the old dessauer who is to command in chief during winter and had then hastened to berlinmany things there urgently requiring his presence preparations reparations not to speak of diplomacies and what was the heaviest item of all new finance for the coming exertions in schweidnitz on leopolds appearance there had been an interview due consultings orderings which done friedrich at once took the road and was at berlin monday december 14thprecisely in the time while nassau and einsiedel were marching with torchlights in rubezahls country and near ending their difficult enterprise better or worse  friedrich fastening eagerly on home business is astonished and provoked to learn that the austrians not content with pushing him out of bohmen are themselves pushing into schlesienso old leopold reports with increasing emphasis day by day to whom friedrich sends impatient order hurl them out again gather what force you need ten thousand or were it twenty or thirty thousand and be immediate about it i will as soon be pitched herausgeschmissen out of the mark of brandenburg as out of schlesien no delay i tell you and as the old dessauer still explains that the ten or fifteen thousand he needs are actually assembling and cannot be got on march quite in a moment friedrich dashes away his incipient berlin operations will go himself and do it haggle no more you tedious old dessauer  berlin 19th december 1744 on the 21st monday one week after my arriving i leave berlin and mean to be at neisse on the 24th at latest your serenity will in the interim make out the orderofbattle which is also orderofmarch for what regiments are come in for i will on the 25th without delay cross the neisse and attack those people cost what it mayto chase them out of schlesien and glatz and follow them so far as possible your serenity will therefore take your measures and provide everything so far as in this short time you can that the project may be executable the moment i arrive friedrich to the old dessauer orlich ii 356  and rushed off accordingly in a somewhat flamy humor but at schweidnitz where the old dessauer met him again became convinced that the matter was weightier than he thought not one of tolpatchery alone but had traun himself in it upon which friedrich candidly drew bridle hastened back and with a loss of four days was at his potsdam affairs again to which he stuck henceforth ardently and i think rather with increase of gloom though without spurt of impatience farther for three months to come before his returnnay had he known it was the night before he went awaya strange little thing had happened in the opposite or western parts surprising accident to marechal de belleisle which now lies waiting his immediate consideration but let us finish silesia first     old dessauer repels the silesian invasion winter 174445  this silesian affair includes due inroad of pandours or indeed two inroads southwest and southeast and in the southwest or traun quarter regulars are the main element of it traun 20000 strong plus stormyenough pandour accompaniment is by this time through into glatz in three columnsis master of all glatz except the rockfortress itself and has spread himself right and left along the neisse river and from the southwest northwards in a skilful and dangerous manner in concert with whom far to the east are pandour whirlwinds on their own footing brandnew insurrection of them got thus far starting from olmutz and brunn scouring that eastern country as far as namslau northward a place we were at the taking of in old brieg times much more infesting the mountains of the south a rather serious thing with traun for general manager of it  with traun we say poor prince karl is off weeks ago on the saddest of errands his beautiful young wifehungarian majestys one sister viceregents of the netherlands he and she conspicuous among the bright couples of the worldshe had a bad lyingin child stillborn while those grand moldau operations went on has been ill poor lady ever since and at brussels on december 16th she herself lies dead prince karl weeping over her and the days that will not return prince karls felicities private and public had been at their zenith lately which was very high indeed but go on declining from this day never more the happiest of husbands did not wed again at all still less the greatest of captains equal or superior to caesar in the gazetteer judgment with distracted eulogies biographies and such like filling the air before long a warcaptain of quite moderate renown which we shall see sink gradually into no renown at all and even unjustly into minus quantities before all end a mad world my masters  between traun on the southwest hand and his pandours on the southeast the small prussian posts have all been driven in upon troppaujagerndorf region more and more narrowed thereand in fine two days before this new interview of leopold and the impatient king at schweidnitz have had to quit the troppaujagerndorf position to quit the hills altogether and are now in full march towards brieg of which march i should say nothing were it not that marwitz father of wilhelminas giggling marmitzes commandedand came by his death in the course of it though our wilhelmina is not now there pen in hand to tell us what the effects at baireuth were marwitz had been left for dead on the field of mollwitz lay so all night but was nursed to some kind of strength again by those giggling young women and came back to schlesien to posts of chief trust for the last year or twowas guarding the mountains and even invading mahren during the late campaignbut saw himself reduced latterly to jagerndorf and troppau and had even to retreat out of these and in the whirlpool of hurries thereuponhow is not very clear by apoplexy say some by accidental pistol from a servant of his own in actual skirmish with pandourstoo certainly one way or the other on december 23d just during that second interview at schweidnitz brave old marwitz did suddenly sink dead and is ended heldengeschichte ii 1201 even so ye poor giggling creatures and your loud weeping will not mend it at all  friedrich looking candidly into these phenomena could not but see that what with tolpatcheries what with trauns 20000 regulars and the whole army at their back his silesian border is girt in by a very considerable inroad of austrianshuge chain of them in horseshoe form 300 miles long pressing in from beyond glatz and landshut round by the southern mountains and up eastward again as far as namslau nothing but war whirlwinds in regular or irregular form in the centre of them traunand that the old dessauer really must have time to gird himself for dealing with traun and them  it was not till january 9th that old leopold 25000 strong equipped to his mind which was a difficult matter crossed the neisse river and marched direct upon traun with ziethen charging ahead actually marched after which the main wrestle was done in a week january 16th old leopold got to jagerndorf found the actual traun concentrated at jagerndorf and drew up to be ready for assault tomorrow morninghad not traun candidly computing judged it better to glide wholly away in the nighttime diligently towards mahren breaking the bridges behind him and so in effect to give up the silesian invasion for this time after which though there remained a good deal of rough tussling with pandour details and some rugged exploits of fight there isexcept that of lehwald in clearing of glatznothing farther that we can afford to speak of lehwalds exploit lehwald versus wallis same wallis who defended glogau long since which came to be talked of and got name and date action of habelschwert february 14th something almost like a pitched fight on the small scale is to the following effect  plomnitz near habelschwert 14th february 1745 old general lehwald marching in the hollow ground near habelschwert hollow of the young neisse river twenty miles south of glatz with intent to cut that country free the enemy whom he is in search of appears in great forceposted on the uphill ground ahead halffrozen difficult stream in front of them cannon on flank pandour multitude

cut in upon the same by considerable fire of effort the uphill ground halffrozen stream sylvan pandours cannonbatteries and what inexpugnabilities there may be are subdued austrian wide junglery the root of it slit asunder rolls homeward simultaneously not too fast nay it halted and reranked itself twice over finding woods and quaggy runlets to its mind but was always slit out again disrooted and finally tumbled home having had enough wenzel wallis friedrich asserts with due scorn was all this while in a chapel praying ardently to st vitus or one knows not whom without effect till they shouted to him beaten sir off or you are lost upon which he sprang to saddle and spurred with both heels piqua des deux  oeuvres de frederic iii 79 80 that was the feat of lehwald clearing the glatz country with one good cut a skilful captain now getting decidedly oldish close on sixty whom we shall meet again a dozen years hence still in harness  the old serene highness himself face the color of gunpowder and bluer in the winter frost went rushing far and wide in an open vehicle which he called his cart pushing out detachments supervising everything wheeling hither and thither as needful sweeping out the pandour world and keeping it out not much of fighting needed but a great deal of marching murmurs friedrich which in winter is as bad and wears down the force of the battalions of all which we give no detail sufficient to fancy in this manner the old dessauer flapping his wide military wings in the faces of the pandour hordes with here and there a hard twitch from beak or claws tolerably keeping down the pandour interest all winter his sons leopold and dietrich were under him occasionally beside him the junior leopold so worn down with feverish gout he could hardly sit on horseback at all while old papa went tearing about in his cart at that rate unternehmung in oberschlesien unter dem fursten leopold von anhaltdessau im januar und februar 1745 seyfarth beylage i 141152 stenzel iv 232 c  there was on the 21st of february tedeum sung in the churches of berlin for the deliverance of silesia from invasion not that even yet the pandours would be quite quiet or allow old leopold to quit his cart far from it and they returned in such increased and tempestuous state as will again require mention with the earliest springprecursors to a second far more serious and deadly invasion of silesia for which it hangs yet on the balance whether there will be a tedeum or a miserere to sing  hungarian majesty disappointed of silesiawhich it seems is not to be had all at once ehestens in the form of miraclemakes amends by a rush upon seckendorf and bavaria attacks seckendorf furiously bathyani pressing up the donau valley with browne on one hand and barenklau on the other in midwinter and makes a terrible hand of him reducing his reconquest of bavaria to nothing again nay to less of which in due time     the french fully intend to behave better next season to friedrich and their german alliesbut are prevented by various accidents november 1744april 1745 aprilaugust 1745  it is not divine miracle friedrich knows well that has lost him his late bohemian conquests without battle fought it was rash choosing of a plan inexecutable without french cooperationculpable blindness to the chance that france would break its promises and not cooperate had your majesty forgotten the jointstock principle then his majesty has sorrowful cause to remember it from this time on a still larger scale  reflections indignant or exculpatory on the conduct of the french in this business are useless to friedrich and to us the performance on their part has been nearly the worstthough their intentions while the austrian dragon had them by the throat were doubtless enthusiastically good but the big austrian dragon being jerked away from elsass by friedrichs treading on his tail 500 miles off they were charmed quite into new enthusiasm to be rid of said dragon and instead of chasing him according to bargain took to destroying his den that he might be harmless thenceforth freyburg is a captured town to the joy and glory of admiring france and friedrichs campaign has gone the road we see the freyburg illuminations having burnt out there might rise in the triumphant mind some thought of friedrich againperhaps almost of a remorseful nature certain it is the french intentions are now again magnanimous more so than ever coupled now with some attempts at fulfilment too which obliges us to mention them here they were still a matter of important hope to friedrich hope which did not quite go out till august coming though alas it did then go out in gusts of indignation on friedrichs part and as the whole of these magnanimous french intentions latter like former again came to zero we are interested only in rendering them conceivable to readers for friedrichs sakewith the more brevity the better for everybody two grand french attempts there were listen on the threshold a little   it is certain the french intend gloriously regardless of expense they are dismantling freyburg to render it harmless henceforth but withal in answer to the poor kaisers shrieks they have sent segur our old linz friend with 12000 to assist seckendorf the bravest troops in the worldwho did bravely take one beating at pfaffenhofen as will be seen and go home again they have coigny guarding those fine brisgau conquests and are furthermore diplomatizing diligently not to say truculently in the rhine countries bullying poor little fat kurtrier lean kurkoln and others to join the frankfurt union not one of whom would under menacethough it is the clear duty of all reichsprinces with a kaiser under oppressionand have marched maillebois directly after freyburg into the middlerhine countries to koln country to mainz country and to and fro in support of said compulsory diplomaciesbut without the least effect  to the middlerhine countries observe and under maillebois then under conti little matter under whom only let readers recollect the name of itfor it is the first of the french attempts to do something of a jointstock nature something for self and allies instead of for self only it caused great alarm in those months to britannic george and others and brought out poor duc dahremberg with portions no english included of the poor pragmatic army to go marching about in the winter slushes instead of resting in bed adelung iv 276 420 december 1744june 1745and is indeed a very loud business in the old gazettes and books till august coming business which almost broke poor dahrembergs heart he says till once i got out of it was turned out in fact business of pragmatic army under dahremberg versus middlerhine army under maillebois under conti business now wholly of zero versus zero to usexcept for a few dates and reflex glimmerings upon king friedrich result otherwisewe shall see the result  attempt second was still more important to friedrich being directed upon the kaiser and bavaria belleisle is to go thither and take survey belleisle thither first you may judge if the intention is sincere valori is quite eloquent upon it directly after freyburg says he sechelles that first of commissaries was sent to munchen sechelles cleared up the chaos of accounts which king louis then instantly paid your imperial majesty shall have magazines also said louis regardless of expense and your army with auxiliaries segur and 25000 of them french shall be raised to 60000 belleisle then came we will have ingolstadt the first thing in spring alas belleisle had his accident in the harz and all went aback from that time valori i 322329 aback too indisputably alland belleisles accident patience readers  the truth is attempt second and chief broke down at once bathyani beating it to pieces as will be seenthe ruins of it painfully reacting on attempt first which had the like fate some months laterand there was no third made and in fact from the date of that latter downbreak august or end of july 1745 and quite especially from september 13th by which time several irrevocable things had happened which we shall hear of the french withdrew altogether out of german entanglements and concentrated themselves upon the netherlands there to demolish his britannic majesty as the likelier enterprise this was a course to which ever since the exit of broglio and the oriflamme they had been more and more tending and inclining nothing for us but loss on loss to be had in germany and so they at last frankly gave up that bad country they fought well in the netherlands with great splendor of success under saxe versus cumberland and company they did also some successful work in italyand left friedrich to bear the brunt in germany too glad if he or another were there to take germany off their hand friedrichs feelings on his arriving at this consummation and during his gradual advance towards it which was pretty steady all along from those first drenchedhen poules mouillees procedures were amply known to excellency valori and may be conceived by readerswho are slightly interested in the dates of them at farthest and now for the belleisle accident with these faint preliminary lights     strange accident to marechal de belleisle in the harz mountains 20th december 1744  siege of freyburg being completed and the river and most other things except always the bastions which we blow up being let into their old channels there marechal de belleisle who is to have a chief management henceforththe most christian king recognizing him again as his ablest man in war or peacesets forth on a long tour of supervision of diplomacy and general arrangement to prepare matters for the next campaign need enough of a belleisle what a business we have made of it since friedrich trod on the serpents tail for us nothing but our own freyburg to show for ourselves elsewhere mere downrush of everything whitherward it likedand king friedrich got into such a humor friedrich must be put in tune again something real and good to be agreed on at berlin let that be the last thing crown of the whole the first thing is look into bavaria a little and how the kaiser poor gentleman in want of all requisites but goodwill can be put into something of fighting posture  in the end of november marechal duc de belleisle with his brother the chevalier now properly the count there having been promotions and a great retinue more alights at munchen holds counsel with the poor kaiser for certain daysmoney wanted many things wanted and all things we need not doubt much fallen out of square those seckendorf troops in their winterquarters say our french inspectors and segur people as usual do but look on it your excellency scattered along the valleys into the very edge of austria austria will swallow them the first thing next year they will never rendezvous again except in the austrian prisons surely monseigneur only a man ignorant of war or with treasonous intention or illoff for victualscould post troops in that way seckendorf is not ignorant of war say they valori i 206 for in fact suspicion runs high and there is no end to the accusations just and unjust and seckendorf is as ill treated as any of us could wish poor old soul probably nobody in all the earth but his old wife in the schloss of altenburg has

cloudcompeller is studious to be himself noiseless amid this noise and makes no alteration in the seckendorf troops but it is certain he meant to do it thinks valori  and indeed seckendorf tired of

remarkable steps  wednesday 9th december 1744 the marechal leaves munchen northwards through oettingen and the bamberganspach regions towards casseljourney of some three hundred and fifty miles with a great retinue of his own with an escort of two hundred horse from the kaiser these latter to prevent any outfall or insult in the ingolstadt quarter where the austrians have a garrison not at all very tightly blocked by the seckendorf people thereabouts no insult or outfall occurring the marechal dismisses his escort at oettingen fares forward in his twenty coaches and fourgons some score or so of vehiclesmere neutral imperial countries henceforth where the kaisers agent as marechal de belleisle can style himself and titular prince of the german empire withal has only to pay his way by

him how his troops under seckendorf are posted at vilshofen yonder hiding how perilous their post is or promising alterations perhaps rest a day or two consulting as to the common weal how the king of

landgraf may afford a hint or two thus travels magnanimous belleisle in twenty vehicles a man loaded with weighty matters in these deep winter months suffering dreadfully from rheumatic neuralgic ailments a doctor one of his needfulest equipments and has the hardest problem yet ahead of him  prince wilhelms consultations are happily lost altogether buried from sight forever to the last hintall except as to what road to berlin would be the best from cassel by leipzig through lowlying country is the great highway advisable in winter but it runs a hundred and thirty miles to right before ever starting northward such a roundabout not to say that the saxons are allies of austriaif there be anything in that enemies they to the most christian king though surely again we are on kaisers business nay we are titular prince of the reich for that matter such the kaisers grace to us well it is better perhaps to avoid the saxon territory and of course the hanoverian much more through which lies the other great road go by the harz advises landgraf wilhelm a rugged hill country but it is your hypotenuse towards berlin passes at once or nearly so from cassel territory into prussian a rugged road but a shorter and safer that is the road belleisle resolves upon twenty carriages his brother the chevalier and himself occupy one and always the courier rides before ordering forty posthorses to be ready harnessed  sunday 20th december 1744 in this way they have climbed the eastern shin of the harz range where the harz is capable of wheelcarriages and hope now to descend this night to

ready a thing takes place most unexpectedwhich made the name of elbingerode famous for eight months to come of which let us hastily give the bare facts fancy making of them what she can was monseigneur aware that this elbingerode with a patch of territory round it is hanoverian ground one of those distracted patches or ragged outskirts frequent in the german map prussia is not yet and hessencassel has ceased to be undoubtedly hanoverian apparently the landgraf and monseigneur had not thought of that but munchhausen of hanover spies informing him had the bailiff vogt advocatus has gathered twenty jager official gamekeepers with their guns and a select idle sunday population of the place with or without guns the vogt steps forward and inquires for monseigneurs passport no

soon enough apprised runs to friedrich with the newsgreets friedrich with it just alighting from that silesian run of his own friedrich not without several other things to think of is naturally sorry at such news sorry for his own sake even but not overmuch friedrich refuses to despatch a party of horse and cut out marechal de belleisle that will never do mon cherand even gets into froides plaisanteries perhaps the marechal did it himself tallard prisoner after blenheim made peace you know in englandand the like which grieved the soul of valori and convinced him of friedrichs inhumanity in a crying case  belleisle is lugged on to hanover his case not doubtful to munchhausen or the english ministrythough it raised great argument was the capture fair was it unfair is he entitled to exchange by cartel or not entitled and produced in the next eight months much angry animated pamphleteering and negotiation for we hear by and by he is to be forwarded to stade on the hamburg seacoast

about a peace in that tallard fashionwide of the truth as such a notion is far as any peace was from following to britannic george and his hanoverians it had merely seemed here was a chief warcaptain and diplomatist among the french the pivot of all these worldwide movements as valori defines him which pivot a chance offering it were well to twitch from its socket and see what would follow perhaps nothing will follow next to nothing a world all waltzing in mad war is not to be stopped by acting on any pivot your waltzing world will find new pivots or do without any and perhaps only waltz the more madly for wanting the principal one  this withdrawal of belleisle the one frenchman respected by friedrich or much interested for his own sake in things german is reckoned a main cause why the french alliance turned out so ill for friedrich and why french effort took more and more a netherlands direction thenceforth and these new french magnanimities on friedrichs behalf issued in futility again probably they never could have issued in very much but it is certain that from this point they also do become zero and that friedrich from his french alliance reaped from first to last nothing at all except a great deal of obloquy from german neighbors and from the french side endless trouble anger and disappointment in every particular which might be a joy though not unmixed to britannic majesty and the subtle followers who had ginned this fine belleisle bird in its flight over the harz range though again had they passively let him wing his way and he had got to be commander and manager as was in agitationhe belleisle and in germany instead of marechal de saxe with the netherlands as chief scenewhat an advantage might that have been to them     the kaiser karl vii gets secured from oppressions in a tragic way friedrich proposes peace but to no purpose  a still sadder cross for friedrich in the current of foreign accidents and diplomacies was the next that befell exactly a month laterat munchen 20th january 1745 hardly was belleisles back turned when her hungarian majesty by her bathyani and company broke furiously in upon the poor kaiser and his seckendorfsegur defences belleisle had not reached the harz when all was going topsyturvy there again and the donauvalley fast falling back into austrian hands nor is that the worst or nearly so  munchen 20th january 1745 this day poor kaiser karl laid down his earthly burden here and at length gave all his enemies the slip he had been ill of gout for some time a man of much malady always with no want of vexations and apprehensions too likely the austrians will drive him out of munchen again then nothing but furnished lodgings and the french to depend upon he had been much chagrined by some election just done in the chapter of salzburg adelung iv 249 276 313 the archbishop thereit was firmian he of the salzburg emigration memorable to readershad died some while ago and now in flat contradiction to imperial customs prerogatives these people had admitted an austrian garrison and then in the teeth of our express precept had elected an austrian to their benefice what can one account it but an insult as well as an injury and the neuralgic maladies press sore and the gouty twinges and belleisle is seized perhaps with important papers of ours and the seckendorfsegur detachments were ill placed nay here are the austrians already on the throat of them in midwinter it is said a babbling valet or lordinwaiting happened to talk of some skirmish that had fallen out called a battle in the valet rumor and how ill the french and bavarians had fared in it owing to their ill behavior and this add they proved to be the ounceweight too much for the so heavyladen back  the kaiser took to bed not much complaining patient mild though the saddest of all mortals and in a day or two died adieu adieu ye loved faithful ones pity me and pray for me he gave his wife poor little fat devout creature and his poor children eldest lad his heir only seventeen a tender blessing solemnly exhorted them to eschew ambition and be warned by his exampleto make their peace with

that is the austrian and causeofliberty account king friedrich from the other side has heard a directly opposite one how the kaiser at the point of death exhorted his son never forget the services which the king of france and the king of prussia have done us and do not repay them with ingratitude  oeuvres de frederic iii 92and see per contra in adelung iv 314 a in coxe c the reader can choose

would have melted a heart of stone he was in his fortyeighth year he had been of all men in his generation the most conspicuously unhappy  what a downrush of confusion there ensued on this event not to bavaria alone but to all the world and to king friedrich more than another no reader can now take the pains of conceiving the frankfurt union then has gone to air here is now no kaiser to be delivered from oppression here is a new kaiser to be electedgrandduke franz the man cry the pragmatic potentates with exultation no belleisle to disturband questions arise innumerable thereupon will france go into electioneering again the new kurbaiern only seventeen poor child cannot be set up as candidate what will france do with him what he with france whom can the french try as candidate against the grandduke kursachsen the polish majesty again belleisle himself must have paused uncertain over such a welterand probably have done like the others little or nothing in it but left it to collapse by natural gravitation  hungarian majesty checked her bavarian armaments a little if perhaps this young kurbaiern will detach himself from france and on submissive terms come over to us whereupon at munchen and in the cognate quarters such wriggling dubitating and diplomatizing as seldom wasfrench antifrench seckendorf busiest of all straining every nerve in that way and for almost three months nothing coming of ittill hungarian majesty sent her barenklaus and bathyanis upon them again and these rapidly solved the question in what way we shall see  friedrich has still his hopes of bavaria so grandiloquent are the french in regard to it who but would hope the french diplomatize to all lengths in munchen promising seas and mountains but they perform little in an effectual manner nothing bavarian army raised to 60000 counts in fact little above half that number with no general to it but an imaginary one segurs actual french contingent instead of 25000 is perhaps 12000and so of other things add to all which seckendorf is there not now as wargeneral but as extraofficial adviser busier than everscandalous old traitor say the frenchand friedrich may justly fear that bavaria will go by collapse a bad road for him  friedrich a week or two after the kaisers death seeing bavarian and french things in such a hypothetic state instructs his ambassador at london to declare his friedrichs perfect readiness and wish for peace old treaty of breslau and berlin made indubitable to me the rest of the quarrel has by decease of the kaiser gone to air to which the britannic majesty rather elated at this time as all pragmatic people are answers somewhat in a careless way well if the others like it and promises that he will propose it in the proper quarter so that henceforth there is always a hope of peace through england as well as contrariwise especially till bavaria settle itself in april next a hope of great assistance from the french here are potentialities and counterpotentialities which make the bavarian intricacy very agitating to the young king while it lasts and indeed his world is one huge imbroglio of potentialities and diplomatic intricacies agitating to behold concerning which we have again to remark how these huge spectres of diplomacy now filling friedrichs world came mostly in result to nothingshaping themselves wholly for or against in exact proportion direct or inverse to the actual quantity of battle and effective performance that happened to be found in friedrich himself diplomatic spectralities wide fatamorganas of hope and hideous big bugbears blotting out the sun of these few men ever had more than friedrich at this time and he is careful none carefuler not to neglect his diplomacies at any timethough he knows better than most that good fighting of his own is what alone can determine the value of these contingent and aerial quantitiesmere lapland witchcraft the greater part of them  a second grand intricacy and difficulty still more enigmatic and pressing the tighter by its close neighborhood was that with the saxons are the saxons enemies are they friends neutrals at lowest bound by treaty to lend austria troops but to lend for defence merely not for offence could not one by good methods make friends with his polish majesty friedrich was far from suspecting the rages that lurked in the polish majesty and least of all owing to what owing to that old moravianforay business and to his friedrichs behavior to the saxons in it excellent saxons who had behaved so beautifully to friedrich that is the sad fact however stupid polish majesty has his natural envies jealousies of a brandenburg waxing over his head at this rate but it appears the moravian foray entered for a great deal into the account and was the final overwhelming item bruhl by much descanting on that famous expeditionwith such candid eyewitnesses to appeal to such corroborative staffofficers and appliances powerful on the idle heart and weak brain of a polish majestyhas brought it so far fixed indignation for intolerable usage especially in that moravianforay time fixed not very malignant but altogether obstinate as i am told that of the pacific sheep species usually is which carried bruhl and his polish majesty to extraordinary heights and depths in years coming but that will deserve a section to itself by and by  a third difficulty privately more stringent than any is that of finance the expenses of the late bohemian expedition friedrichs army costing 75000 pounds a month have been excessive for our next campaign if it is to be done in the way essential there are by rigorous arithmetic 900000 pounds needed a frugal prussia raises no new taxes pays its wars from the treasure from the fund saved beforehand for emergencies of that kind fund which is running low threatening to be at the lees if such drain on it continue to fight with effect being the one sure hope and salve for all sores it is not in the army in the fortresses the fighting equipments that there shall be any flaw left friedrichs budget is a sore problem upon him needing endless shift and ingenuity now and onwards through this waralready during these months in the berlin schloss a great deal of those massive friedrichwilhelm plate sumptuosities especially that unparalleled musicbalcony up stairs all silver has been under fredersdorfs management quietly taken away carried over in the nighttime to the mint orlich ii 126128  and in fact no modern reader not deeper in that distressing story of the austriansuccession war than readers are again like to be can imagine to himself the difficulties of friedrich at this time as they already lay disclosed and kept gradually disclosing themselves for months coming nor will ever know what perspicacity patience of scanning sharpness of discernment dexterity of management were required at friedrichs handsand under what imminency of peril too victorious deliverance or ruin and annihilation wavering fearfully in the balance for him more than once or rather all along but it is certain the deeper one goes into that hideous medeas caldron of stupidities once so flamy now fallen extinct the more is one sensible of friedrichs difficulties and of the talent for all kinds of captaincyby no means in the field only or perhaps even chieflythat was now required of him candid readers shall accept these hints and do their bestfriedrich himself made not the least complaint of mens then misunderstanding him still less will he now we keeping henceforth the diplomacies the vaporous foreshadows and general dance of unclean spirits with their intrigues and spectralities well underground so far as possible will stick to what comes up as practical performance on friedrichs part and try to give intelligible account of that  valori says he is greatly changed and for the better by these late reverses of fortune all the world notices it says valori no longer that brief infallibility of manner that lofty light air that politely disdainful view of valori and mankind he has now need of men complains of nothing is cheerful quizzicalardently busy to grind out the notches as our proverb is has a mild humane aspect something of modesty almost of piety in him help me thou supreme power maker of men if my purposes are manlike though one does not go upon the

bit of royalty now going he must fight well next summer or it will go hard with him     chapter vivalori goes on an electioneering mission to dresden  some time in january a new frenchman a chevalier de courten if the name is known to anybody was here at berlin consulting settling about mutual interests and operations since belleisle is snatched from us it is necessary some courten should come and produce what he has got little of settlement i should fear of definite program that will hold water in regard to war operations chiefly a magazine of clouds specimens of it in ranke iii 219 for the rest the bavarian question and very specially who the new emperor is to beking of poland thinks your majestyby all means answers friedrich if you can detach him from austria that will be well which was reckoned magnanimous at least publicspirited in friedrich considering what saxonys behavior to him had already been by all means his polish majesty for kaiser do our utmost excellencies valori courten and company answers friedrichand for his own part i observe is intensely busy upon army matters looking after the main chance  and so valori is to go to dresden and manage this cloud or cobwebbery department of the thing namely persuade his polish majesty to stand for the kaisership baiern pfalz koln brandenburg there are four votes sire your own is five sure of carrying it your polish majesty backed by the most christian king and his allies and resources and polish majesty does for his own share very much desire to be kaiser but none of us yet knows how he is tied up by austria antifriedrich antifrench considerations and can only accept if it is offered me thricewilling to accept if it will fall into my mouth which on those terms it has so little chance of doingsaxony and its mysterious affairs and intentions having been to friedrich a riddle and trouble and astonishment during all this campaign readers ought to know the fact welland no reader could stand the details of such a fact here in condensed form are some scraps of excerpt which enable us to go with valori on this dresden mission and look for ourselves     1 friedrichs position towards saxony   by known treaty the polish majesty is bound to assist the hungarian with 12000 men whenever invaded in her own dominions polish majesty had 20000 in the field for that object latelypart of them 8000 of them hired by britannic subsidy as he alleges the question now is will saxony assist austria in invading silesia with or without britannic subsidy friedrich hopes that this is impossible friedrich is deeply unaware of the humor he has raised against himself in the saxon courtcircles how the polish majesty regards that moravian foray with what a perfect hatred little bruhl regards him friedrich and to what pitch of humor owing to those moravianforay starvings marchings about and inhuman treatment of the poor saxon army not to mention other offences and afflictive considerations bruhl has raised the simple polish majesty against friedrich these things as they gradually unfolded themselves to friedrich were very surprising and proved very disadvantageous at the present juncture and for a long time afterwards to friedrich disadvantageous and surprising and to saxony in the end ruinous poor saxony having got its back broken by them and never stood up in the world since ruined by this wretched little bruhl and reduced from the first place in northern teutschland to a second or third or no real place at all     2 there is a union of warsaw 8th january 1745 and still more specially a treaty of warsaw 8th january18th may 1745  january 8th 1745 before the old dessauer got ranked in schlesien against traun there had concluded itself at warsaw by way of counterpoise to the frankfurt union a union of warsaw called also quadruple alliance of warsaw the parties to which were polish majesty hungarian ditto primemovers and the two seapowers as purseholders stipulating to the effect we four will hold together in affairs of the reich versus that dangerous frankfurt union we willdo a variety of salutary things and as one practical thing there shall be this season 30000 saxons conjoined to the austrian force for which we seapowers will furnish subsidythis was the one practical point stipulated january 8th and farther than this the seapowers did not go now or afterwards in that affair  but there was then proposed by the polish and hungarian majesties in the form of secret articles an ulterior project with which the seapowers expressing mere disbelief and even abhorrence of it refused to have any concern now or henceforth polish majesty in hopes it would have been better taken had given his 30000 soldiers at a rate of subsidy miraculously low only 150000 pounds for the whole but the seapowers were inexorable perhaps almost repented of their 150000 pounds and would hear nothing farther of secret articles and delirious projects  so that the union of warsaw had to retire to its pigeonhole content with producing those 30000 saxons for the immediate occasion and there had to be concocted between the polish and hungarian majesties themselves what is now in the modern pamphlets called a treaty of warsawmuch different from the innocent union of warsaw though it is merely the specifying and fixing down of what had been shadowed out as secret codicils in said union when the seapower parties obstinately recoiled treaty of warsaw let us continue to call it though its actual birthplace was leipzig in the profoundest secrecy 18th may 1745 above four months after it had tried to be born at warsaw and failed as aforesaid warsaw union is not worth speaking of but this other is a treaty highly remarkable to the readerand to friedrich was almost infinitely so when he came to get wind of it long after  treaty which though it proved abortional and never came to fulfilment in any part of it is at this day one of the remarkablest bits of sheepskin extant in the world it was signed 18th may 1745 scholl ii 350 and had cost a great deal of painful contriving capable still of new altering and retouching to hit mutual views treaty not only for reconquering silesia which to the two majesties though it did not to the seapowers seems infallible in friedrichs now ruined circumstances but for cutting down that bad neighbor to something like the dimensions proper for a brandenburg vassalin fact quite the old detestable project of spring 1741 only more elaborated into detail in which britannic george knows better than to meddlesaxony to have share of the parings when we get them what share asked saxony and long keeps asking a road to warsaw strip of country carrying us from the end of the lausitz which is ours into poland which we trust will continue ours would be very handy duchy of glogau some small paring of silesia wont your majesty of my silesia not one handbreadth answered the queen impatiently though she did at last concede some outlying handbreadths famed old circle of schwiebus if i recollect and they have had to think of other equivalent parings for saxonys behoof magdeburg halberstadt saalecircle or one knows not what and have had and will have their adoes to get it fixed excellent bearskin to be slit into straps only the bear is still on his feetpolish majesty and hungarian polish with especial vigor bruhl quite restless upon it arelittle as valori or any mortal could dream of itengaged in this partition of the bearskin when valori arrives of their innocent union of warsaw there was from the first no secret made but the document now called treaty of warsaw needs to lie secret and thricesecret and it was not till 1756 that friedrich having unearthed it by industries of his own and studied it with great intensity for some years made it known to the world adelung v 308 397 ranke iii 231 who for some reason of his own dates 3d may instead of 18th  treaties vaporous foreshadows of events have oftenest something of the ghost in them and are importune to human nature longing for the events themselves all the more if they have proved abortional treaties and become doubly ghostlike or ghastly nevertheless the reader is to note well this treaty of warsaw as important to friedrich and him and indeed it is perhaps the remarkablest treaty abortional or realized which got to parchment in that century for though it proved abortional and no part of it now or afterwards could be executed and even the subsidy and 30000 saxons stipulated in the union of warsaw became crowsmeat in a mannerthis preternatural treaty of warsaw trodden down never so much by the heel of destiny and by the weight of new treaties superseding it or presupposing its impossibility or inconceivability would by no means die such the humor of bruhl of the two majesties and others but lay alive under the ashes carefully tended for ten or twenty years to comeand had got all europe kindled again for destruction of that bad neighbor before it would itself consent to go out and did succeed in getting saxonys back broken if not the bad neighborsin answer to the humor of little bruhl unfortunate saxony to possess such a bruhl  in those beautiful saxonaustrian developments of the treaty of warsaw czarina elizabeth bobbing about in that unlovely whirlpool of intrigues amours devotions and strong liquor which her history is took ask not for what reason a lively partand already in this spring of 1745 they hope she could by a gift of two millions for her pleasures gift so easy to you seapowers be stirred up to anger against friedrich and she did in effect from this time hover about in a manner questionable to friedrich though not yet in anger but only with the wish to be important and to make herself felt in foreign affairs whether the seapowers gave her that trifle of pocketmoney for her pleasures i never knew but it is certain they spent first and last very large amounts that way upon her and hers especially the english did with what result may be considered questionable  as for graf von bruhl most rising man of saxony once a page now by industry king august iiis first favorite and factotum the fact that he cordially hates friedrich is too evident but the why is not known to me except indeed that no manespecially no man with three hundred and sixtyfive fashionable suits of clothes usually about him different suit each day of the yearcan be comfortable in the evident contempt of another man other man of sarcastic bantering turn too tongue sharp as needles whose sayings many birds of the air are busy to carry about year after year bruhl doubtless with help enough that way if there had needed such hates him more and more as

authorized to offer 60000 men with money corresponding and no end of brilliant outlooksmust keep back his offers however if he find the people indisposed which he did to an extreme degree nothing but vague talk procrastination hesitation on the part of bruhl this wretched little bruhl has twelve tailors always sewing for him and three hundred and sixtyfive suits of clothes so many suits all pictured in a book a valet enters every morning proposes a suit which after deliberation with perhaps amendments is acceded to and worn at dinner vainest of human clotheshorses foolishest coxcomb valori has seen it is visibly his notion that it was he bruhl by his saxon auxiliaries by his masterly strokes of policy that checkmated friedrich and drove him from bohemia last year and for the rest that friedrich is ruined and will either shirk out of silesia or be cut to ribbons there by the austrian force this summer to which valori hints dissent but it is ill received valori sees the king finds him as expected the facsimile of bruhl in this matter jesuit guarini the like how otherwise they have his majesty in their leash and lead him as they please  at four every morning this guarini jesuit confessor to the king and queen comes to bruhl bruhl settles with him what his majesty shall think in reference to current business this day guarini then goes confesses both majesties confesses absolves turns in the due way to secular matters at nine bruhl himself arrives for privy council what is your majesty pleased to think on these points of current business majesty serenely issues his thoughts in the form of orders which are found correct to pattern this is the process with his majesty a poor majesty taking deeply into tobacco this is the way they have him benetted as in a dark cocoon of cobwebs rendering the whole world invisible to him which cunning arrangement is more and more perfected every year so that on all roads he travels be it to mass to hunt to dinner anywhither in his palace or out of it there are faithful creatures keeping eye who admit no unsafe man to the least glimpse of him by night or by day in this manner he goes on and before the end of him twenty

the wind it is doubly necessary for the french who have not even a candidate as yet to stand supreme and minatory in the frankfurt country and to king friedrich it is painfully questionable whether maillebois can do it do it we will doubt not that your majesty answer valori and the frenchand study to make improvements reinforcements in their rhine army and they do at least change the general of their middlerhine armythat is to say recall prince conti out of italy where he has distinguished himself and send maillebois thither in his steadwho likewise distinguishes himself there if that could be a comfort to us whether the distinguished conti will maintain that frankfurt country in spite of the austrians and their election movements is still a question with friedrich though valori

fair account of itself when the time comes our one anchor of hope as now more and more appears  on the pandour element he first tried under general hautcharmoi with winterfeld as chief active hand a direct outburst or two with a view to slash them home at once but finding that it was of no use as they always reappeared in new multitudes he renounced that took to calling in his remoter outposts and except where magazines or the like remained to be cared for let the pandours baffle about checked only by the fortified towns and more and more submerge the hill country prince karl to be expected

friedrich had quitted neisse lay cantoned in neisse valley between frankenstein and patschkau able to assemble in fortyeight hours studying with his whole strength to be ready for the mysterious prince karl on whatever side he might arriveand disregarding the pandours in comparison  the points of inrush the tideways of these pandour deluges seem to be mainly three direct through the jablunka

landshut three main ingresses at each of which there fall out little fights which are still celebrated in the prussian books and indeed well deserve reading by soldiers that would know their trade in the ratibor parts the invasive leader is a general karoly with 12000 under him who are the wildest horde of all karoly lodges in a wood for himself there is a tent his companions sleep under trees or under the open sky by the edge of morasses ranke iii 244 it was against this karoly and his horde that hautcharmois little expedition or express attacking party to drive them home again was shot out

frontier parts and were left to rove about under check only of the garrison towns friedrich being obliged to look elsewhere after higher perils which were now coming in view in which favorable circumstances karoly and consorts did at last make one stroke in those ratibor countries that of kosel which was greatly consolatory 26th may 1743 orlich ii 156158 by treachery of an ensign who had deserted to them provoked by rigor of discipline or some intolerable thing they glided stealthily one night across the ditches into kosel a halffortified place prussian works only half finished which being the key of the oder in those parts they reckoned a glorious conquest of good omen and worthy of tedeums at vienna and they did eagerly without the least molestation labor to complete the prussian works at kosel one garrison already ourswhich was not had from them without battering and i believe burning when general von nassau came to inquire after it in autumn next  friedrich had always hoped that the saxons who are not yet in declared war with him though bound by treaty to assist the queen of hungary under certain conditions would not venture on actual invasion of his territories but in this as readers anticipate friedrich finds himself mistaken weissenfels is hastening from the leitmeritz northwestern quarter where he has wintered to join prince karl who is gathering himself from olmutz and his southeastern home region their full intention is to invade silesia together and they hope now at length to make an end of friedrich and it these pandour hordes supported by the necessary grenadiers and cannoniers are sent as vanguard these cannot themselves beat him but they may induce him which they do not to divide his force they may in part burn him away as by slow fire after which he will be the easier to beat instead of which friedrich leaving the pandours to their luck lies concentrated in neisse valley watching with all his faculties prince karls own advent coming on like fate indubitable yet involved in mysteries hitherto and is perilously sensible that only in giving that a good reception is there any hope left him  prince karl who arrived in olmutz april 30th commands in chief againsaddened poor man by the loss of his young wife in december last willing to still his grief in action for the cause she lovedbut old traun is not with him

of bathyanis army now that it has finished the bavarian job is preparing to push down upon conti while bathyani who is to supersede the laggard dahremberg shall push vigorously upand before summer is over we shall hear of traun again and conti will have heard  friedrichs indignation on learning that the saxons were actually on march and gradually that they intended to invade him was great and the whole matter is portentously enigmatic to him as he lies vigilant in neisse valley waiting on the when and the how indignationand yet there is need of caution withal to be ready for events the old

upon pandours but coalesce and lie ready for the main wrestle so that from april 28th as above noticed friedrich has gone into cantonments some way up the neisse valley westward of neisse town and is

night of the 8th9th may by carelessness of somebody a spark got into the marquiss powder two powderbarrels that there were and with horrible crash sent eighty men marquis talleyrand and engineer du

interesting to us lies all between the brusselstournay road and the scheld riverall in immediate front of his royal highnessto southeastward from beleaguered tournay where said road and river intersect how shall he make some impression on the siege of tournay that is now the question and his royal highness struggles to manoeuvre accordingly  marechal de saxe whose habit is much that of vigilance forethought sagacious precaution singular in so dissolute a man has neglected nothing on this occasion he knows every foot of the ground having sieged here in his boyhood once before leaving the siegetrenches at tournay under charge of a ten or fifteen thousand he has taken camp here still with superior force 56000 as they count royal highness being only 50000 ranked barring royal highnesss way tournay or at least the marechals trenches there are on the right bank of the scheld which flows from southeast securing all on that hand the broad brussels highway comes in to him from the eastnorth of that he has nothing to fear the ground being cut with bogs no getting through upon him that way to tournay and what he calls the under scheld the upper scheld too avail them nothing there is only that triangle to the southeast between road and river where the enemy is now manoeuvring in front of him from which damage can well come and he has done his best to be secure there four villages or hamlets close to the scheld and onwards to the great roadantoine fontenoy barry ramecroix with their lanes and boscagesmake a kind of circular base to his triangle base of some six or eight miles with hollows in it brooks and northward a considerable wood bois de barry enveloping barry and ramecroix which do not prove of much interest to us though the bois does of a good deal in and before each of those villages are posts and defences in antoine and fontenoy elaborate redoubts batteries redans connecting in the wood bois de barry an abattis or wall of felled trees as well as cannon and at the point of the wood well within double range of fontenoy is a redoubt called of eu redoute deu from the regiment occupying it which will much concern his royal highness and us saxe has a hundred pieces of cannon say the english which is correct consummately disposed along this space no ingress possible anywhere except through the cannons throat torrents of fire and crossfire playing on you he is armed to the teeth as they say and has his 56000 arranged according to the best rules of tactics behind this murderous line of works if his royal highness think of breaking in he may count on a very warm reception indeed  saxe is only afraid his royal highness will not outside of these lines with a 50000 dashing fiercely round us under any kind of leading pouncing on our convoys harassing and sieging usour siege of toumay were a sad outlook and this is old austrian konigsecks opinion too though they say waldeck and the dutch impetuous in theory at least opined otherwise and strengthened royal highnesss view two young men against one old be it so then his royal highness resolute for getting in manoeuvres and investigates all monday 10th his cannon is not to arrive completely till night otherwise he would be for breaking in at once a fearless young man fearless as ever his poor father was certainly a man sans peuy this one too whether of much avis we shall see

hereabouts today begins the attack simultaneously or in swift succession on the various batteries which it will be necessary to attack and storm  the attacks took place but none of them succeeded dutch and austrians on the extreme left were to have stormed antoine by the edge of the river that was their main task right skirt of them to help us meanwhile with fontenoy and they advanced accordingly but found the shot from antoine too fierce especially when a subsidiary battery opened from across the river and took them in flank the dutch and austrians felt astonished and hastily drew aside under some sheltering mound or earthwork they had found for themselves or prudently thrown up the night before there under their earthwork stood the dutch and austrians patiently expecting a fitter timewhich indeed never occurred for always the instant they drew out the batteries from antoine and from across the river instantly opened upon them and they had to draw in again so that they stood there in a manner all day and so to speak did nothing but patiently expect when it should be time to run for which they were loudly censured and deservedly antoine is and remains a total failure on the part of the dutch and austrians  royal highness in person with his english was to attack fontenoyand is doing so by battery and storm at various points with emphasis though without result as preliminary at an early stage he had sent forward on the right by the wood of barry a brigadier ingoldsby with semples highlanders and other force to silence that redoubt yonder at the point of the woodredoubt fort or whatever it be famous redoute deu as it turned outwhich guards fontenoy to north and will take us in flank nay in rear as we storm the cannon of the village ingoldsby speed imperative on him pushed into the wood found french lighttroops god knows how many of them prowling about there found the redoubt a terribly strong thing with ditch drawbridge what not spent thirty or forty of his highlanders in some frantic attempt on it by rule of thumband found he would need artillery and other things in short ingoldsby hasten what he might could not perfect the preparations to his mind had to wait for this and for that and did not storm the redoubt deu at all but hung fire in an unaccountable manner for which he had to answer to courtmartial still more to the newspapers afterwards and prove that it was misfortune merely or misfortune and stupidity combined too evident the redoute deu was not taken then or thenceforth which might have proved the saving of the whole affair could ingoldsby have managed it royal highness attacked fontenoy and reattacked furiously thrice over and had to desist and find fontenoy impossible on those terms  here is a piece of work

lose the half of their people and hastily draw back again in a wrecked condition the cavalryhorses cannot stand such smoke and blazing nor indeed i think can the cavaliers regiment du roi rushing on full gallop to charge this column got one volley from it says espagnac which brought to the ground 460 men natural enough that horses take the bit between their teeth likewise that men take it and

firing blank this some time its cannonballs done officers in antoine are about withdrawing the artillerythen again on new order replacing it awhile all are looking towards the scheld bridge earnestly entreating his majesty to withdraw had the dutch at this point of time broken heartily in as waldeck was urging them to do upon the redoubts of antoine or had his royal highness the duke for his own behoof possessed due cavalry or artillery to act upon these ragged clouds which hang broken there very fit for being swept were there an artilleryandhorse besom to do itin either of these cases the battle was the dukes and a right fiery victory it would have been to make his name famous and confirm the english in their mad method of fighting like baresarks or janizaries rather than strategic human creatures see in buschings magazin xvi 169 your illustrious column at fontenoy it was fortuitous i say done like janizaries and so forth a criticism worth reading by soldiers  but neither of these contingencies had befallen the dutchaustrian wing did evince some wish to get possession of antoine and drew out a little but the guns also awoke upon them whereupon the dutchaustrians drew in again thinking the time not come as for the duke he had taken with him of cannon a good few but of horse none at all impossible for horse unless fontenoy and the redoubt deu were oursand his horse have been hanging about in the wood of barry all this while uncertain what to do their old commander being killed withal and their new a dubitative person and no orders left the duke had left no

over yonder dustcloud mounting higher and higher there comes the big crisis then there are the combined weissenfels and karl with their austrian saxons issuing proudly from their stone labyrinth guns equipments baggages all perfectly brought through rich silesian plain country now fairly at their feet breslau itself but a few marches offat sight of all which the austrian big host bursts forth into universal fieldmusic and shakes out its banners to the wind thursday 3d june 1745 a dramatic entry of something quite considerable on the stage of history  friedrich with nassau and generals round stands upon the fuchsberghis remarks not given his looks or emotions not described to us his thought well knownand looks at it through his tubus or spyglass there they are then and the big moment is come friedrich had seen the dust and the manoeuvring of them deeper in the hills from this same fuchsberg yesterday and inferred what was coming calculated by what roads or hilltracks they could issue and how he in each case was to deal with them his marchroutes are all settled plankbridges repaired all privately is ready for these proud austrian musical gentlemen here in the hollow friedrich has been upon this fuchsberg with his tubus daily many times since monday last it is our general observatorium says stille and commands a fine view into the interior of these hills a fuchsberg which has become notable in the prussian maps the stanowitz fuchsberg east side of striegau waterlet no tourist mistake himself for there are two or even three other fuchsbergs a mile or so northward on the western side of that stream which need to be distinguished by epithets as the striegau fuchsberg the graben fuchsberg and perhaps still others comparable to the four neisse rivers three besides the one we know which occur in this piece of country our german cousins i have often sorrowed to find have practically a most poor talent for giving names and indeed much for ages back is lying in a sad state of confusion among them many confused things rotting far and wide in contradiction to the plainest laws of nature things as well as names all the welcomer this prussian army this young friedrich leading it they beyond all earthly entities of their epoch are not in a state of confusion but of most strict conformity to the laws of arithmetic and facts of nature perhaps a very blessed phenomenon for germany in the longrun  prince karl with weissenfels general berlichingen and many plumed dignitaries are dining on the hilltop near hohenfriedberg after having given order about everything they witness there over their wine the issue of their columns from the mountains which goes on all afternoon with fieldmusic spread banners and the oldest general admits he never saw a finer

whose daybook has been preserved in lutzow pp 123132 each regiment or division taking the place appointed it all afternoon till late in the night submerging the country as in a deluge five miles long of them taking post at the foot of the hills there from hohenfriedberg round upon striegau looking towards the morrows sunrise to us poor countryfolk not a beautiful sight their light troops flying ahead and doing theft and other mischief at a sad rate  on the other hand the austrian and saxon gentlemen from their gallowshill at hohenfriedberg notice four or five miles in the distance opposite them or a little to the left of opposite a body of prussian horse and foot visibly wending northward like a long glittering serpent the glitter of their muskets flashing back yonder on the afternoon sun and us as they mount from hollow to height ten or twelve thousand of them making for striegau to appearance intending to bivouac or billet there and keep some kind of watch over us belike with an eye to being rearguard on the retreat towards breslau tomorrow or will they retreat without attempting mischief serenity of weissenfels engages to seize the heights and proper posts over yonder this night yet and will take striegau itself the first thing tomorrow morning  yes your serenities those are prussians in movement vanguard corps of dumoulin winterfeldrittmeister seydlitz rides yonderand it is not their notion to retreat without mischief for there stands not so far off on the stanowitz fuchsberg a brisk little gentleman if you could notice him with his eyes fixed on you and plans in the head of him now getting nearly mature for certain he is pushing out that column of men and all manner of other columns are getting order to push out and take their ground and tomorrow morningyou will not find him in retreat such are the phenomena in that striegauhohenfriedberg region while the sun is bending westward on thursday 3d june 1745  from hohenfriedberg which leans against the higher mountains there may be across to striegau northeast which stands well apart from them among lower hills of its own a distance of about five english miles the intervening country is of flat though upland nature the first broad stage or stairstep so to speak leading down into the general interior levels of silesia in those parts a tract which is now tolerably dried by draining but was then marshy as well as bushyflat to the eye yet must be imperceptibly convexed a little for the line of watershed is hereabouts walk from hohenfriedberg to striegau the water on your left hand flows though mainly in ditches or imperceptible oozings to the north and westthere to fall into an eastern fork of the roaring neisse one of our three new neisses which is a very quiet stream here runs close by the mountain base fed by many torrents and must get its name wuthende or roaring from the suddenness of its floods into this bound northward and westward run or ooze all waters on your left hand as you go to striegau right hand again or to eastward you will find all sauntering or running in visible brooks into striegau water little river notable to us which comes circling from the mountains past hohenfriedberg farther south and has got to some force as a stream before it reaches striegau and turns abruptly eastwardeastward to join schweidnitz water and form with it the second stairstep downwards to the plain country has its fuchsbergs kuhbergs and little knolls and heights interspersed on both sides of it in the conceivable way  so that looking eastward from the heights of hohenfriedberg our broad stage or stairstep has nothing of the nature of a valley but rather is a kind of insensibly swelling plain between two valleys or hollows of small depth and slopes both ways both ways but more towards the striegauwater valley or hollow and thence in a lazily undulating manner to other hollows and waters farther down friedrichs camp lies in the next the schweidnitzwater hollow and is five or even nine miles long from schweidnitz northwardmuch hidden from the austriansaxon gentlemen at present no hills farther mere flat country to eastward of that but to the north again about striegau the hollow deepens narrows and certain hills much notable at present rise to west of striegau definite peaked hills with granite quarries in them and basalt blocks atopstriegau it appears is in old czech dialect trziza which means triple hill the town of the three hills lutzow p 28 an ancient quaint little town of perhaps 2000 souls browngray the stones of it venerably weathered has its wide big marketplace piazza plainstones silent enough except on marketdays nestles itself compactly in the shelter of its three hills which screen it from the northwest and has a picturesque appearance its hills and it projected against the big mountain range beyond as you approach it from the plain country  hohenfriedberg at the other corner of our battlestage on the road to landshut is a village of no great compass but sticks pleasantly together does not straggle in the usual way climbs steep against its gallowshill now called siegesberg victory hill with some tower or steeplemonument on it built by subscription and would look better if trimmed a little and habitually well swept the higher mountain summits landshut way or still more if you look southeastward glatzward rise blue and huge remote on your right to left the roaring neisse range close at hand is also picturesque though less alpine in type tourists note 1858 and of all hills the notablest just now to us are those three at striegau  those three hills of striegau his serenity of weissenfels is to lay hold of this night with his extreme left were it once got deployed and bivouacked those hills if he can but prussian dumoulin is already on march thither and privately has his eye upon them on friedrichs partfor the rest this upland platform insensibly sloping two ways and as yet undrained is

for the owner of the soil who has absconded in the present crisis of things their evening smoke rising rather fainter than usual much cookery is not advisable with uhlans and tolpatchcs flying about northward between striegau and the higher mountains there is an extensive teichwirthschaft or pondhusbandry gleaming visible from hohenfriedberg gallowshill just now a combination of stagnant pools and carpponds the ground much occupied hereabouts with what they name carphusbandry which is all drained away in our time yet traceable by the studiousquaggy congeries of sluices and fishponds no road through them except on intricate dams have scrubby thickets about the borderthis also is very strong ground if weissenfels thought of defence there  which weissenfels does not but only of attack he occupies the ground nevertheless rearward of this carphusbandry as becomes a strategic man gradually bivouacking all round there to end on the three hills were his last regiments got up the carphusbandry is mainly about eisdorf hamletin pilgramshayn where weissenfels once thought of lodging lives our writing schoolmaster the mountains lie to westward flinging longer shadows as the

threehill region which is some furlong or so farther northto his surprise dumoulin finds saxon parties posting themselves thereabouts he attacks said saxon parties and after some slight tussle drives them mostly from their three hills mostly not altogether one saxon hill is precipitous on our hither side of it and we must leave that till the dawn break of the other heights dumoulin takes good possession with cannon too to be ready against dawnand ranks himself out to leftward withal along the plain ground for he is to be right wing had the other troops come up these are now all under way

going their rounds and so they are in fact sentries and watchfiresbut now nothing else there a mere shell of a camp the men of it streaming steadily along without speech without tobacco and many of them are across striegau bridge by this time  it was past eleven so close and continuous went this march before valori and his latour with their carriages and furnitures could find an interval and get well into it never will valori forget the discipline of these prussians and how they marched difficult ways the hard road is for their artillery the men march on each side sometimes to midleg in

their columns could rendezvous here he then sprang on horseback spoke briefly the essential things one of them the abovehad meant to be more minute in regard to positions and the like but all is so in

ensued battle named of striegau or hohenfriedberg excels the power of human talentif human talent had leisure for such employment it is the huge shock and clash of 70000 against 70000 placed in the way we said an enormous furious simaltas or bothatonce as the latins phrase it spreading over ten square miles rather say a wide congeries of electric simultaneities all electric playing madly into

two in the huge general explosion to assist the readers fancy in conceiving it a little is all that can be pretended to     chapter xbattle of hohenfriedberg  with the first streak of dawn the dispute renewed itself between those prussians and saxons who are on the heights of striegau the two armies are in contact here they lie wide apart as yet at the other end cannonading rises here on both sides in the dim gray of the morning for the possession of these heights the saxons are outcannonaded and dislodged other saxons start to arms in support the cry to arms spreads everywhere rouses weissenfels to horseback and by sunrise a furious storm of battle has begun in this part hot and fierce on both sides charges of horse shock after shock bayonetcharges of foot the great guns going like joves thunder and the continuous tearing storm of small guns very loud indeed such a noise as our poor schoolmaster who lives on this spot thinks he will hear only once again when the last trumpet sounds it did indeed he informs us resemble the dissolution of nature for all fell dark too a general element of sulphurous powdersmoke streaked with dull blazes and death and destruction very nigh what will become of poor pacific mortals hereabouts rittmeister seydlitz winterfeld his patron ride with knit brows in these horsecharges fiery rothenburg too truchsess von waldburg at the head of his divisionpoor truchsess known in london society a cannonball smites the life out of him and he ended here  at the first clash of horse and foot the saxons fancied they rather had it at the second their horse became distressed at the third they rolled into disorderly heaps the foot also stubborn as they were could not stand that swift firing followed by the bayonet and the sabre and were forced to give ground the morning sun shone into their eyes too they say and there had risen a breath of easterly wind which hurled the smoke upon them so that they could not see decidedly staggering backwards getting to be taken in flank and ruined though poor weissenfels does his best about five in the morning friedrich came galloping hitherward valori with him mon ami this is looking well this will do wont it the saxons are fast sinking in the scale and did nothing thenceforth but sink ever faster though they made a stiff defence fierce exasperation on both sides and disputed every inch their position in these scraggy woods and villages in these morasses and carphusbandries is very strong  it had proved to be farther north too than was expected so that the prussians had to wheel round a little right wing as a centre fighting army as radius before they could come parallel and get to work a delicate manoeuvre which they executed to valoris admiration here in the storm of battle tramp tramp velocity increasing from your centre outwards till at the end of the radius the troops are at treblequick fairly running forward and the line straight all the while admirable to valori in the hot whirlwind of battle here for the great guns go in horrid salvos unabated and the crackling thunder of the small guns terrible tussling about those carpponds that quaggy carphusbandry says the schoolmaster and the heavens blotted out in sulphurous firestreaked smoke what had become of us pacific some had run in time and they were the wisest others had squatted who could find a nook suitable most of us had gathered into the nurserygarden at the foot of our village we sat quaking thereour prayers grown tremulously vocalin tears and wail at least the women part enemies made reconcilement with each other says he and dear friends took farewell his narrative in lutzow ubi supra one general alleleu the last day to all appearance having come friedrich seeing things in this good posture gallops to the left again where much urgently requires attention from him  on the austrian side prince karl through his morning sleep at hausdorf had heard the cannonading saxons taking striegau thinks he a pleasant lullaby enough and continues to sleep and dream agitated messengers rush in at last draw his curtains prussians all in rank this side striegau water saxons beaten or nearly so at striegau we must stand to arms your highnessto arms of course answers karl and hurries now what he can to get everything in motion the bivouac itself had been in order of battle but naturally there is much to adjust to put in trim and the austrians are not distinguished for celerity of movement all the worse for them just now  on friedrichs side so far as i can gather there have happened two cross accidents first by that wheeling movement done to valoris admiration in the striegau quarter the prussian line has hitched itself up towards striegau has got curved inward and covers less ground than was counted on so that there is like to be some gap in the central part ofas in fact there was in spite of friedrichs efforts and hitchings of battalions and squadrons an indisputable gap though it turned to rich profit for friedrich prince karl paying no attention to it upon such indisputable gap a wakeful enemy might have done friedrich some perilous freak but karl was in his bed as we sayin a terrible flurry too when out of bed nothing was done upon the gap and friedrich had his unexpected profit by it before long  the second accident is almost worse striegau bridge of planks as i feared creaking under such a heavy stream of feet and wheels all night did at last break in some degree and needed to be mended so that the rearward regiments who are to form friedrichs left wing are in painful retardand are becoming frightfully necessary the austrians as yet far outflanking us capable of taking us in flank with that right wing of theirs the moment was agitating to a generalinchief valori will own this young kings bearing was perfect not the least flurry though under such a strain he has aidesdecamp dashing out everywhither with orders with expedients prince henri his younger brother galloping the fastest nay at last he begs valori himself to gallop with orders to a certain general gessler in whose brigade are dragoons which valori doeshappily without effect on gessler who knows no valori for an aidedecamp and keeps the ground appointed him rearward of that gap we talked of  happily the austrian right wing is in no haste to charge happily ziethen blocked by that incumbrance of the bridge mending finds a ford higher up the assiduous ziethen splashes across other regiments following forms in line well leftward and instead of waiting for the austrian charge charges home upon them fiercely through the difficult grounds no danger of the austrians outflanking us now they are themselves likely to get hard measure on their flank by the ford and by the bridge all regiments some of them at treblequick get to their posts still in time accident second has passed without damage forward then rapid steady and reserve your fire till within fifty pacesprinoe ferdinand of brunswick friedrichs brotherinlaw a brighteyed steady young man of great heart for fight tramps forth with his divisionsteadyall manner of divisions tramp forth and the hot storm ziethen and cavalry dashing upon that right wing of theirs kindles here also far and wide  the austrian cavalry on this wing and elsewhere it is clear were ill off we could not charge the prussian left wing say they partly because of the morasses that lay between us and partly which is remarkable because they rushed across and charged us austrian report heldengeschichte  i 1113 prince karl is sorry to report such things of his cavalry but their behavior was bad and not good the first shock threw them wavering the secondnothing would persuade them to dash forth and meet it high officers commanded obtested drew out pistols prince karl himself shot a fugitive or twoit was to no purpose they wavered worse at every new shock and at length a shock came sixth it was as the reporter counts which shook them all into the wind decidedly shy of the prussians with their new manoeuvres and terrible way of coming on as if sure of beating in the saxon quarter certain austrian regiments of horse would not charge at all merely kept firing from their carbines and when the time came ran  as for the saxons they have been beaten these two hours that is to say hopeless these two hours and getting beaten worse and worse the saxons cannot stand but neither generally will they run they dispute every ditch morass and tuft of wood especially every village wrecks of the muddy desperate business last hour

about a quarter of an hour you see the ranks beginning to shake and jumble towards indistinctness military instructions  a very hopeful symptom to you  it was at this moment that lieutenantgeneral

theological thing at landshut from first hand  june 8th 1745 the army followed dumoulins corps and marched upon landshut on arriving in that neighborhood the king was surrounded by a troop of 2000 peasantsof protestant persuasion very evidently which is much the prevailing thereaboutswho begged permission of him to massacre the catholics of these parts and clear the country of them altogether this animosity arose from the persecutions which the protestants had suffered during the austrian domination when their churches used to be taken from them and given to the popish priestschurches and almost their children such was the anxiety to make them orthodox the patience of these peasants had run over and now in the hour of hope they proposed the above sweeping measure the king was very far from granting them so barbarous a permission he told them they ought rather to conform to the scripture precept to bless those that cursed them and pray for those that despitefully used them such was the way to gain the kingdom of heaven the peasants rolling dubious eyes for a moment answered his majesty was right and desisted from their cruel pretension oeuvres de frederic ii218on hohenfriedberg day says another witness as far as the sound of the cannon was heard all round the protestants fell on their knees praying for victory to the prussians in ranke iii 259 and at breslau that evening when the thirteen trumpeting postilions came tearing in with the news what an enthusiasm without limit  prince karl has skill in choosing camps and positions his austrians are much cowed that is the grievous loss in his late fight so from june 8th when they quit silesiaby two roads to go more readilyall through that month and the next friedrich spread to the due width duly pricking into the rear of them drives the beaten hosts onward and onward they do not think of fighting their one thought is to get into positions where they can have living conveyed to them and cannot be attacked for the

details sufficient to astonish the robustest memory  friedrichs purposes at chlum or previously are not towards conquests in bohemia nor of fighting farther if he can help it but in the mean while he is eating out these bohemian vicinages no invasion of silesia possible from that quarter soon again that is one benefit and he hopes always his enemies under screw of military pressure with the one hand and offer of the olivebranch with the other will be induced to grant him peace britannic majesty after fontenoy and hohenfriedberg not to mention the first rumors of a jacobite rebellion with france to rear of it is getting eager to have friedrich settled with and withdrawn from the game againthe rather as friedrich knowing his man has ceased latterly to urge him on the subject peace with george the purseholder does not that mean peace with all the others friedrich knows the high queens indignation but he little guesses at this time the humor of bruhl and the polish majesty he has never yet sent the old dessauer in upon them always only keeps him on the slip at magdeburg still hoping actualities may not be needed he hopes too in spite of her indignation the hungarian majesty with an election on hand with the netherlands at such a pass not to speak of italy and the middle rhine will come to moderate views again on which latter points his reckoning was far from correct within three months britannic majesty and he did get to explicit agreement convention of hanover 26th august but in regard to the polish majesty and the hungarian there proved to be no such result attainable and quite other methods necessary first  of military transactions in this camp of chlum or in all these bohemiansilesian camps for near four months there is nothing or as good as nothing

say  july 5th19th middlerhine country the first electionnews that reaches friedrich is from the middlerhine country and of very bad complexion readers remember traun and his bathyanis and his intentions upon conti there in the end of may old traun things being all completed in bavaria had got on march with his bavarian army say 40000 to look into prince conti down in those parts a fact very interesting to the prince traun held leftward westward as if for the neckar valleyperhaps intending to be through upon elsass in those southern undefended portions of the rhine conti and his segur and middlerhine army stood diligently on their guard got their forces defences apparatuses hurried southward from frankfurt quarter where they lay on watch into those neckar regions which seen to be done traun whirled rapidly to rightward to northward crossed the mayn at wertheim wholly leaving the neckar and its conti having weighty business quite in the other directionon the north side of the mayn namely on the kinzig river where bathyani who has taken dahrembergs command below frankfurt and means to bestir himself in another than the dahremberg fashion is to meet him on a set day traun having thus by strategic suction pulled the middlerhine army out of his and bathyanis way hopes they two will manage a junction on the kinzig after junction they will be a little stronger than conti though decidedly weaker taken one by one traun in the long june days had such a march through the spessart forest mayn river to his left with our old friends dettingen aschaffenburg far down in the plain as was hardly ever known before pathless wildernesses rocky steeps and chasms the sweltering june sun sending down the upper snows upon him in the form of muddy slush so that the infantry

in a multiform alarming manner so that conti lost head took to mere retreating rushing about burning bridgesand in fine july 19th had flung himself bodily across the rhine clouds of tolpatches sticking to him and left old traun and his grandduke supreme lord in those parts who did not invade elsass as was now expected but lay at heidelberg intending to play pacifically a surer card all french are out of teutschland again and the game given up in what a premature and shameful manner thinks friedrich  nominally it was the grandduke that flung conti over the rhine and delivered teutschland from its plagues after which fine feat salvatory to the cause of liberty and destructive to french influence what is to prevent his election to the kaisership friedrich complains aloud conti has given it up you drafted 15000 from him for imaginary uses in the netherlandsyou have given it up then was that our bargain we have given it up answers dargenson the warminister writing to

they can nothing elseand he had one day penned a letter with that object but had thrown it into his desk again no not till the very last extremity that friedrich did at last despatch the unpleasant missive service done you in elsass let us say little of it but the repayment has been zero hitherto your bavarian expenses poor kaiser gone and peace of fussen come are now endeda round sum say of 600000 pounds is becoming indispensable here if we are to keep on our feet at all herr ranke who has seen the most christian kings response though in a capricious way finds three or four successive redactions of the difficult passage all painfully meaning impossible alaspainfully adding we will try however and after due cunctations friedrich waiting silent the whilelouis most christian king who had failed in so many things towards friedrich does empower valori to offer him a subsidy of 600000 livres a month till we see farther twenty thousand pounds a month he hopes this will suffice being himself run terribly low friedrichs feeling is to be guessed such a dole might answer to a landgraf of hessendarmstadt but to me is not in the least suitableand flatly refuses it fierement says valori ranke iii 235 299 n not the least of date allowed us in either case valori i 240  mon gros valori who could not himself help all this poor soul falls now into complete disgrace waits daily upon friedrich at the giving out of the parole but frequently his majesty does not speak to me at all hardly looks at me or only looks as if i had suddenly become zero incarnate it is now in these days i suppose that friedrich writes about the scamander battle of fontenoy and capture of pekin by way of helping one to fight the austrians according to treaty and has a touch of bitter sarcasm in uttering his complaints against such treatmentthe heart of him i suppose bitter enough most christian king has felt this of the scamander friedrich perceives louiss next letter testifies piqueand of course we are farther from help on that side than ever from the stande of the kurmark brandenburg friedrich was offered a considerable subsidy instead and joyfully accepted the same as a loanpaid it punctually back too and never all his days forgot it of those stande stenzel iv 255 ranke c     camp of dieskau britannic majesty makes peace for himself with friedrich but cannot for austria or saxony  about the middle of august there are certain saxon phenomena which awaken dread expectation in the world friedrich watching arguslike near and far in his chlum observatory has noticed that prince karl is getting reinforced in konigsgratz 10000 lately 7000 more comingand contrariwise that the saxons seem to be straggling off from him ebbing away corps after corpstowards saxony can it be there are whispers of bavarian auxiliaries being hired for them too and little bruhls late insolence bruhls evident belief that we are finished aux abois putting all this together friedrich judgeswith an indignation very naturalthat there is again some insidious saxon mischief most likely an attack on brandenburg in the wind friedrich orders the old dessauer march into them delay no longer and publishes a clangorously indignant manifesto evidently his own writing and coming from the heart in adelung v 6471 no date middle of august say the books how they have not bound by their austrian treaty wantonly invaded our silesia have since and before in spite of our forbearance done so many thingsand in fact have finally exhausted our patience and are forcing us to seek redress and safety by the natural methods which they will see how they like  old leopold advances straightway as bidden direct for the saxon frontier to whom friedrich shoots off detachmentsprince dietrich with so many thousands to reinforce papa then general gessler with so manytill papa is 30000 odd and could eat saxony at a mouthful nothing whatever being yet ready there on bruhls part though he has such immense things in the windnevertheless friedrich again paused did not yet strike the saxon question has russian bugbears no end of complications his britannic majesty now at hanover and his prudent harrington with him are in the act of laboring with all earnestness for a general agreement with friedrich without farther bitterness embroilment and bloodshed how much preferable for friedrich old dessauer therefore pauses camp of dieskau which we have often heard of close on the saxon border stands there looking over as with sword drawn 30000 good swordsbut no stroke not for almost three months more in three months wretched bruhl had not repented but on the contrary had completed his preparations and gone to workand the stroke did fall as will be seen that is bruhls posture in the matter ranke iii 231 314  to britannic george for a good while past it has been manifest that the pragmatic sanction in its original form is an extinct object that reconquest of silesia and such like is melancholy moonshine and that in fact towards fighting the french with effect it is highly necessary to make peace with friedrich of prussia again this once more is georges and his harringtons fixed view friedrichs own wishes are known or used to be ever since the late kaisers deaththough latterly he has fallen silent and even avoids the topic when offered knowing his man herrington has to apply formally to friedrichs minister at hanover very well if they are in earnest this time so friedrich instructs his minister my terms are known to you no change admissible in the termsdo not speak with me on it farther and observe within four weeks the thing finished or else broken off ranke iii 277281 and in this sense they are laboring incessantly with austria with saxonywithout the least successand excellency robinson has again a panting uncomfortable time here is a scene robinson transacts at vienna which gives us a curious facetoface glimpse of her hungarian majesty while friedrich is in his camp at chlum     schonbrunn 2d august 1745 robinson has audience of her hungarian majesty  robinson in a copious sonorous speech rather apt to be copious and to fall into the parliamentary cantofermo sets forth how extremely ill we allies are faring on the french hand nothing done upon silesia either a hopeless matter thatis it not your majesty and your majestys forces all lying there in mere deadlock and we in such need of them peace with prussia is indispensableto which her majesty listened in statuesque silence mostly never saw her so reserved before my lord  robinson madam the dutch will be obliged to accept neutrality and plump down again after such hoisting  queen well and if they did they it would be easier to accommodate with france itself and so finish the whole matter than with prussia my army could not get to the netherlands this season no general of mine would undertake conducting it at this day of the year peace with prussia what good could it do at present  robinson england has already found for subsidies this year 1178753 pounds cannot go on at that rate peace with prussia is one of the returns the english nation expects for all it has done  queen i must have silesia again without silesia the kaiserhood were an empty title or would you have us administer it under the guardiancy of prussia  robinson in bohemia itself things dont look well nothing done on friedrich your saxons seem to be qnarrelling with you and going home  queen prince karl is himself capable of fighting the prussians again till that do not speak to me of peace grant me only till october  robinson prussia will help the grandduke to kaisership  queen the grandduke is not so ambitions of an empty honor as to engage in it under the tutelage of prussia consider farther the imperial dignity is it compatible with the fatal deprivation of silesia one other battle i say good god give me only till the month of october  robinson a battle madam if won wont reconquer silesia if lost your majesty is ruined at home  queen dusseje conclure avec lui le lendemain je lui livrerais bataille ce soir had i to agree with him tomorrow i would try him in a battle this evening robinsons despatch 4th august 1745 ranke iii 287 raumer pp 161 162  her majesty is not to be hindered deaf to robinson to her britannic george who pays the money cruel man is that what you call keeping the pragmatic sanction dismembering me of province after province now in germany then in italy on pretext of necessity has not england money then does not england love the cause of liberty give me till october her majesty did take till october and later as we shall see poor george not able to hinder by power of the purse or otherwise who can hinder high females or low when they get into their humors much of this austrian obstinacy think impartial persons was of female nature we shall see what profit her majesty made by taking till october  as for george the time being run and her majesty and saxony unpersuadable he determined to accept friedrichs terms himself in hope of gradually bringing the others to do it august 26th at hanover there is signed a convention of hanover between friedrich and him peace on the old breslauberlin termsprecisely the same terms but britannic majesty to have them guaranteed by all the powers on the general peace comingso that there be no snakeprocedure henceforth silesia friedrichs without fail dear hanover unmolested even by a thought of friedrichsand her hungarian majesty to be invited nay urged by every feasible method to accede adelung v 75 is in rousset xix 441 in c c which done britannic majestyfor there has hung itself out in the scotch highlands the other day glenfinlas august 12th a certain standard tandem triumphans and unpleasant things are imminenthurries home at his best pace and has his hands full there for some time on austria on saxony he could not prevail by no manner of means answered they and went their own roadjingling his britannic subsidies in their pocket regardless of the once supreme jove who is sunk now to a very different figure on the german boards  friedrichs outlook is very bad such a war to go on and not even finance to do it with his intimates his rothenburg one time have found him sunk in gloomy thought but he wears a bright face usually no wavering or doubting in him his mind made up which is a great help that way friedrich indicates and has indicated everywhere for many months that peace precisely on the old footing is all he wants the kaiser being dead whom i took up arms to defend what farther object is there says he renounce silesia more honestly than last time engage to have it guaranteed by everybody at the general peace or perhaps hohenfriedberg will help to guarantee itand i march home my money is running down privately thinks he guarantee silesia and i shall be glad to go if not i must raise money somehow melt the big silver balustrades at berlin borrow from the stande or do something and in fact must stand here unless silesia is guaranteed and struggle till i die  that latter withal is still privately friedrichs thought under his light air he carries unspoken that grimly clear determination at all times now and henceforth and it is an immense help to the guidance of him an indispensable indeed no king or man attempting anything considerable in this world need expect to achieve it except tacitly on those same terms i will achieve it or die for the world in spite of rumors to the contrary is always much of a bedlam to the sanity so far as he may have any of every individual man a strict place moreover its very bedlamisms flowing by law as do alike the sudden muddeluges and the steady atlantic tides and all things whatsoever a world inexorable truly as gravitation itselfand it will behoove you to front it in a similar humor as the tacit basis for whatever wise plans you lay in friedrich from the first entrance of him on the stage of things we have had to recognize this prime quality in a fine tacit form to a complete degree and till his last exit we shall never find it wanting tacit enough unconscious almost not given to articulate itself at alland if there be less of piety than we could wish in the silence of it there is at least no playactor mendacity or cant of devoutness to poison the high worth of it no braver little figure stands on the earth at that epoch ready at the due season with his mind silently made upable to answer diplomatic robinsons bartensteins and the very destinies when they apply if you will withdraw your snakish notions will guarantee silesia will give him back his old treaty of berlin in an irrefragable shape he will march home if not he will never march home but be carried thither dead rather that is his intention if the gods permit     grandduke franz is elected kaiser 13th september 1745 friedrich the season and forage being done makes for silesia  there occurred at frankfurtthe clear majority seven of the nine electors bavaria itself nay bohemia this time distaff or not and all the others but friedrich and kurpfalz being so disposed or so disposable traun being master of the groundno difficulty about electing grandduke franz stephan of tuscany jointking of bohemia to be kaiser of the holy romish reich friedrichs envoy protestedas did kurpfalzs with still more vehemence and then withdrew to hanau the other seven voted september 13th 1745 and it was done a new kaiser franz stephan or franz iwith our blessing on him if that can avail much but i fear it cannot upon such mendacious emptycase of kaiserhood without even money to feed itself not to speak of governing of defending and coercing upon such entities the blessings of man avail little the gods having warned them to go do not bless them for stayinghowever tarbarrels burn the fountains play wine in some of them i hope franz is to be crowned in a fortnight hence with extraordinary magnificence at this last part of it maria theresa will in her own high person attend and proceeds accordingly towards frankfurt in the end of september say the old books so soon as the election is over  hungarian majestys bearing was not popular there according to friedrichwho always admires her after a sort and always speaks of her like a king and gentlemanbut the high lady it is intimated felt somewhat too well that she was high not sorry to have it known under the due veils that her kaiserhusband is but of a mimetic nature that it is she who has the real power and that indeed she is in a victorious posture at present very high in her carriage towards the princes of the reich and their privilegespoor kurpfalzs notary or herald coming to protest i think it was the second time about something she quite disregarded his tabards pasteboards or whatever they were and clapt him in prison the thing was commented upon but kurpfalz got no redress need we repeatlazy readers having so often met him and forgotten him againthis is a new younger kurpfalz karl theodor this one not friedrich wilhelms old friend but his successor of the sulzbach line of whom after thirty years or so we may again hear he can complain about his violated tabard will get his notary out of jail again but no redress  highish even towards her friends this empressqueen kaiserinkonigin such her new title and has a kind of thankyoufornothing air towards them prussian majesty she said had unquestionable talents but oh what a character too much levity she said by far heterodox too in the extreme a boser mannand what a neighbor has he been as to silesia she was heard to say she would as soon part with her petticoat as part with it oeuvres de frederic iii 126 128so that there is not the least prospect of peace here none answer friedrichs emissaries whom he had empowered to hint the thing which is heavy news to friedrich  early in august not long after that audience of robinsons her majesty after repeated written messages to prince karl urging him to go into fight again or attempt something had sent two high messengers prince lobkowitz duke dahremberg high dignitaries from court have come to konigsgratz with the latest urgencies the newest ideas and would fain help prince karl to attempt something daily they used to come out upon a little height in view of friedrichs tent and gaze in upon him and round all nature with big tubes he says as if they had been astronomers but never attempted anything we remember dahremberg and what part he has played from the dettingen times and onward a debauched old fellow says friedrich gone all to hebetude by his labors in that line agrees always with the last speaker prince karl seems to have little stomach himself and does not see his way into or across another battle lobkowitz again is always saying try something we are now stronger than they by their detachings by our reinforcings indeed about twice their number regular and irregular though most of the saxons are gone home after much gazing through their tubes the austrians august 23d do make a small shift of place insignificant otherwise the prussians next day do the like in consequence quit chlum burning their huts post themselves a little farther up the elbetheir left at a place called jaromirz embouchure of the aupa into elbe  oeuvres de frederic iii 129and are again unattackable  the worst fact is the multitude of pandours more and more infesting our provisionroads and that horseforage itself is at last running low detachments lie all duly round to right and left to secure our communications with silesia especially to left out of glatz where runs one of the chief roads we have but the service is becoming daily more difficult for example  neustadt 8th september in that lefthand quarter coming out of glatz at a little bohemian town called neustadt the prussian commander tauenzien by name was repeatedly assaulted and from september 8th had to stand actual siege gallantly repulsing a full 10000 with their big artillery though his walls were all breached for about a week till friedrich sent him relief prince lobkowitz our old antibelleisle friend who is always of forward fiery humor had set them on this enterprise which has turned out fruitless the king is much satisfied with tauenzien ib 132 of whom we shall hear again who indeed becomes notable to us were it only for getting one lessing as secretary by and by gotthold ephraim lessing whose fame has since gone into all countries the man having been appointed a secretary to the very destinies in some sort that is to say a writer of books which have turned out to have truth in them tauenzien a grimmish aquiline kind of man of no superfluous words has distinguished himself for the present by defending neustadt which the austrians fully counted to get hold of  let us give another little scene preparatory to quitting this country as it is evident the king and we will soon have to do country being quite eaten out pandours getting ever rifer and the season done  jaromirz early in september 1745 jaromirz is a little bohemian town on the aupa or between the aupa and metau branches of the upper elbe four or five miles north of semonitz where friedrichs quarter now is valori so seldom spoken to is lodged in a suburb there had not you better go into the town itself his majesty did once say but valori dreading nothing lodged onlandlord a burgher whom i thought respectable respectable yes he but his son had been dealing with franquini the pandour and had sold valorinight appointed measures all taken a miracle if valori escape franquini chief of 30000 pandours has come in person to superintend this important capture and lies hidden with a strong party in the woods to rearward prussians about 200 scattered in posts occupy the hedges in front for guard of the ovens to rear jaromirz being wholly ours there is no suspicion  in the dead of the night franquini emerges from the woods sends forward a party of sixty under the young judas who by methods suitable gets them stealthily conducted into papas barn which looks across a courtyard into valoris very windows from the barn it is easy on paws of velvet to get into the house if you have a judas to open it which you havebolts all drawn for you and even beams ready for barricading if you be meddled with upstairs is his

secretary one darget who had called himself valori on this dangerous occasion valori sat quaking behind his partition not till the pandours began plundering the stables did the prussian sentry catch sound of them and plunge in  friedrich had his amusement out of this adventure liked darget the clever secretary got darget to himself before long as will be seenand in quieter times dashed off a considerable explosion of rhyme called le palladion valori as prussias palladium with devils attempting to steal him and the like which was once thought an exquisite burlesquekings coveting a sight of

louis date of request and of refusal march 1750let us attend his majestys exit from bohemia     chapter xiibattle of sohr  the famed beautiful elbe river rises in romantic chasms terrible to the picturesque beholder at the roots of the riesengebirge overlooked by the hohekamms and highest summits of that chain out of eleven wells says gentle dulness eilf or elf quellen whence its name elbe for elf sure enough it starts out of various wells description in zollner briefe uber schlesien ii 305 in c c rushes out like a great peacocks or pashas tail from the roots of the giant mountains thereabouts and hurries southwardor even rather eastward at first for except the iser to westward which does not fall in for a great while its chief branches come from the eastern side aupa metau adler the drainings of glatz and of that rugged country where friedrich has been camping and manoeuvring all summer on the whole its course is southward for the first seventy or eighty miles washing jaromirz konigshof konigsgratz down to pardubitz at pardubitz it turns abruptly westward and holds on so bending even northward by hill and plain through the rest of its five or six hundred miles  its first considerable branch on that eastern or left bank is the aupa which rises in the pass of schatzlar great struggling there for convoys just now goes next by trautenau which has lately been burnt and joins the elbe at jaromirz where valori was stolen or nearly so from under the prussian left wing the aupa runs nearly straight south the elbe till meeting it has run rather southeast but after joining they go south together augmented by the metau by the adler down to pardubitz where the final turn to west occurs jaromirz which lies in the very angle of elbe and aupa is the left wing of friedrichs camp main body of the camp lies on the other side of the elbe but of course has bridges as at smirzitz where that straw sentry did his pranks lately bridges are indispensable part of our provision coming always by that bohemian neustadt from the northeast quarter out of silesia though the main course of our meal and much fighting for it is direct from the north by the pass of schatzlarchaslard as poor valori calls it  thus friedrich lay when valori escaped being stolen when tauenzien was assailed by the 10000 pandours with siege artillery and stood inexpugnable in the breach till friedrich relieved him those pandours had cut away his water for the last two days so that except for speedy relief all valor had been in vain water being gone not recoverable without difficulties neustadt was abandoned september 16th as i guessone of our main silesian roads for meal has ceased we have now only schatzlar to depend on where franquinilying westward among the glens of the upper elbe and possessed of abundant talent in the tolpatch way witness valoris narrow miss latelygives us trouble enough friedrich determines to move towards schatzlar homewards in fact eating the country well as he goes  saturday 18th september friedrich crosses the elbe at jaromirz entirely unopposed the austrians were all busy firing feudejoie for the election of their grandduke election done five days ago at frankfurt and the news just come so they crackle about and deliver rolling fire at a great rate proud to be imperial army henceforth as if that could do much for them there was also vast dining for three days among the high heads and a great deal of wine spent that probably would have been the chance to undertake something upon them better than crossing the elbe says friedrich looking back but he did not think of it in time took secondbest in place of best  he is now therefore over into that triangular piece of country between elbe and aupa if readers will consult their map in that triangle his subsequent notable operations all lie he here proposes to move northward by degreesthrough trautenau schatzlar and home well eating this bit of country too the last uneaten bit as he goes this well eaten there will be no harbor anywhere for invasion through the winter coming one of my old notes says of it in the topographic point of view  it is a triangular patch of country which has lain asleep since the creation of the world traversed only by boii boiheimers bohemians czechs and other such populations in human history but which friedrich has been fated to make rather notable to the moderns henceforth let me recommend it to the picturesque tourist especially to the military one lovers of rocky precipices quagmires brawling torrents and the unadulterated ruggedness of nature will find scope there and it was the scene of a distinguished passage of arms with notable display of human dexterity and swift presence of mind for the rest one of the wildest and perhaps except to the picturesque tourist most unpleasant regions in the world wild stony upland topmost upland we may say of europe in general or portion of such upland for the rainstorms hereabouts run several roadsinto the german ocean and atlantic by the elbe into the baltic by the oder into the black sea by the donauand it is the waste outfield whither you rise by long weeksjourneys from many sides  much of it towards the angle of elbe and aupa is occupied by a huge waste wood called kingdom forest konigreich sylva or wald peculium of old czech majesties i fancy may be sixty square miles in area the longer side of which lies along the elbe a country of rocky defiles lowish hills chaotically shoved together not wanting their brooks and quagmires straight labyrinthic passages shaggy with wild wood some poor hamlets here and there probably the sleepiest in nature are scattered about there may be patches ploughable for rye modern tourist says snappishly there are many such whole region now drained reminded me of yorkshire highlands with the western sun gilding it that fine afternoonploughable for rye buckwheat boggy grass to be gathered in summer charcoaling to do pigs at least are presumable among these straggling outposts of humanity in their obscure hamlets poor ploughing moiling creatures they little thought of becoming notable so soon none of the books all intent on mere soldiering take the least notice of them not at the pains to spell their hamlets right no more notice than if they also had been stocks and mossgrown stones nevertheless there they did evidently live for thousands of years past in a dim mannerand are much terrified to have become the seat of war all on a sudden their poor hamlets sohr staudentz prausnitz burgersdorf and others still send up a faint smoke and have in them languidly the livecoal of mysterious human existence in those woodsto judge by the last maps that have come out a thing worth considering by the passing tourist military or other  it is in this kingdom forest which he calls royaume de silva instead of sylva de royaume that friedrich now marches keeping the body of the forest well on his left and skirting the southern and eastern sides of it rough marching for his majesty painfully infested by nadastian tolpatches who run out on him from ambushes and need to be scourged one ambush in particular at a place called liebenthal second days march and near the end of itwhere our prussian hussars winding like fiery dragons on the dangerous precipices gave them better than they brought and completely quenched their appetite for that day after liebenthal the march soon ends three miles farther on at the dim woldhamlet of staudentz here a camp is pitched here till the country is well eaten out or till something else occur we propose to tarry for a time  horseforage abounds here but there is no getting of it without disturbance from those dogs you must fight for every truss of grass if a mealtrain is coming as there does every five days you have to detach 8000 foot and 3000 horse to help it safe in a fretting fatiguing time for regular troops our bakery is at trautenauwhere valori is now lodging the tolpatchery unable to take trautenau set fire to it though it is their own town their own queens town thatchy trautenau wooden too in the upper stories of it takes greedily to the fire goes all aloft in flame and then lies black a scandalous transaction thinks friedrich the prussian corn lay nearly all in cellars little got even of the prussians by such an atrocity and your own poor fellowsubjects where are they valori was burnt out here again exploded from his quarters poor manseems to have thought it a mere fire in his own lodging and that he was an unfortunate diplomatist happily he got notice privatissime for no officer dare whisper in such cases that there is an armed party setting out for silesia to guard meal that is coming valori yokes himself to this armed party and gets safe over the hills with itthen swift by extra post to breslau and to civilized partially civilized accommodation for a little rest after these hustlings and tossings  friedrich had lain at staudentz in this manner bickering continually for his forage and eating the country for about ten days and now as the latter process is well on and the season drawing to a close he determines on a shift northward thursday 30th september next let there be one other grand forage the final one in this eaten tract then northward to fresh grounds that it appears was the design but on wednesday there came in an austrian deserter who informs us that prince karl is not now in konigsgratz but in motion up the elbe already some fifty miles up past jaromirz his rear at konigshof his van at arnauon a level with burnt trautenau and farther north than we ourselves are this is important news intending to block us out from schatzlar hmh single scouts or small parties cannot live in this kingdom wood swarming with pandours friedrich sends out a colonel katzler with 500 light horse to investigate a little katzler pushes forward on such lane or forest roadtrack as there is towards konigshof beats back small hussar partiescomes in about an hours space not upon hussars merely but upon dense masses of heavy horse winding through the forest lanes and with that imperfect intelligence is obliged to return the deserter spake truth apparently and that is all we can know forage scheme is given up the order is baggage packed and march tomorrow morning at ten long before ten there had great things befallen on the morrowtry to understand this note a little  the camp of staudentzwhich two persons the king and general stille a more careful reporter who also was an eyewitness have done their best to describewill after all efforts and an ordnance map to help remain considerably unintelligible to the reader as is too usual in such cases a block of highlying ground friedrichs camp on it perhaps two miles long looks to the south small village of staudentz in front hollow beyond that and second small village deutsch prausnitz hanging on the opposite slope with shaggy heights beyond and the kingdom forest there beginning on the left defiles brooks and strait country leading towards the small town of eypel that is our left and front aspect a hollow well isolating us on those sides hollow continues all along the front hollow definite on our side of it and forming a tolerable defencethough again i perceive to rightward at no great distance there rise high grounds which considerably overhang us a thing to be marked these we could not occupy for want of men but only maintain vedettes upon them over these heights a mile or two westward of this hollow of ours runs the big winding hollow called georgengrund georges bottom which winds up and down in that kingdom forest and offers a road from konigshof to trautenau among other courses it takes  from the crown of those heights on our right flank here looking to the west you might discern perhaps three miles off from one of the sheltering nooks in the hither side of that georgengrund rising faintly visible over knolls and dingles the smoke of a little forest village that village is sohr notable ever since beyond others in the kingdom wood sohr like the other villages has its laneroads its road to trautenau to konigshof no doubt but much nearer you on our eastern slope of the heights and far hitherward of sohr which is on the western goes the great road what is now the great road from konigshof to trautenau well visible from friedrichs camp though still at some distance from it could these heights between us and sohr which lie beyond the great road be occupied we were well secured isolated on the right too as on the other sides from kingdom forest and its ambushes should have been done admits friedrich but then as it is there are not troops enough with 18000 men you cannot do everything  here however is the important point in sohr this night 29th september in a most private manner the austrians 30000 of them and more have come gliding through the woods without even their pipe lit and with thick veil of hussars ahead outposts of theirs lie squatted in the bushes behind deutsch prausnitz hardly 500 yards from friedrichs camp and eastward leftward of him in the defiles about eypel lie nadasti and ruffian trenck with ten or twelve thousand who are to take him in rear his camp of staudentz will be at a fine pass tomorrow morning the austrian gentlemen had found last week a certain bare height in the forest height still known from which they could use their astronomer tubes day after day orlich ii 225 and now they are about attempting something  thursday morning very early 30th september 1745 friedrich was in his tent busy with generals and marchrouteswhen a rapid orderly comes in from that vedette or strong piquet on the heights to our right austrians visibly moving in quantity near by and before he has done answering the officer himself arrives regular cavalry in great force long dustcloud in kingdom forest in the gray dawn and so far as we can judge it is their army coming on here is news for a poor man in the raw of a september morning by way of breakfast to him to arms is of course friedrichs instant order and he himself gallops to the piquet on the heights glass in hand austrian army sure enough thirty to thirtyfive thousand of them we only eighteen oeuvres de frederic iii 139 coming to take us on the right flank here to attack our camp by surprise will crush us northward through the defiles and trample us down in detail hmh to run for it will never do we must fight for it and even attack them as our way is though on such terms quick a plan the head of friedrich is a bank you cannot easily break by coming on it for plans such a creature for impromptu plans and unexpected dashes swift as the panthers i have hardly knownespecially when you squeeze him into a corner and fancy he is over with it friedrich gallops down with his plan clear enough and already the austrians horse and foot are deploying upon those heights he has quitted fifty squadrons of horse for left wing to them and a battery of twentyeight big guns is establishing itself where friedrichs piquet lately stood  friedrichs right flank has to become his front and face those formidable austrian heights and batteries and this with more than prussian velocity and under the play of those twentyeight big guns throwing caseshot grenades royales and so forth all the while to valori when he heard of the thing it is inconceivable how mortal troops could accomplish such a movement friedrich himself praises it as a thing honorably well done took about half an hour caseshot raining all the while soldier honorably neverminding no flurry though a speed like that of spinningtops and here we at length are staudentz now to rear of us behind our centre a good space burgersdorf in front of us to right our left reaching to prausnitz austrian lines three deep of them on the opposite height we one line only which matches them in length  they that left wing of horse should have thundered down on us attacking us not waiting our attack thinks friedrich but they have not done it they stand on their height there will perhaps fire carbines as their wont is you buddenbrock go into them with your cuirassiers buddenbrock and the cuirassiers though it is uphill go into them at a furious rate meet no countercharge mere sputter of carbinestumble them to mad wreck back upon their second line back upon their third absurdly crowded there on their narrow height no room to manoeuvre so that they plunge fifty squadrons of them wholly into the georgengrund rearward into the kingdom wood and never come on again at all buddenbrock has done his job right well  seeing which our infantry of the right wing which stood next to buddenbrock made impetuous charge uphill emulous to capture that battery of twentyeight but found it for some time a terrible attempt these heights are not to be called hills still less mountains as in some careless books but it is a stiff climb at doublequick with twentyeight big guns playing in the face of you storms of caseshot shear away this infantry are quenching its noble fury in despair infantry visibly recoiling when our sole three regiments of reserve hurry up to support round these all rallies rushes desperately on and takes the batteryof course sending the austrian left wing rapidly adrift on loss of the same  this i consider is the crisis of the fight the back of the austrian enterprise is already broken by this sad winging of it on the left but it resists still comes down againthe reserve of their left wing seen rapidly making for burgersdorf intending an attack there which we oppose with vigor setting burgersdorf on fire for temporary screen and drive the austrian reserve rapidly to rearward again but there is rally after rally of them they rank again on every new height and dispute there loath to be driven into kingdom wood after such a flourish of arms one height bushy steep height the lightlimbed valiant prince little ferdinand of brunswick had the charge of attacking and he did it with his usual impetus and irresistibilityand strangely enough the defender of it chanced to be that brother of his prince ludwig with whom he had the little interview lately prince ludwig got a wound as well as lost his height the third brother poor prince albrecht who is also here as volunteer apprentice on the prussian side gets killed there will never be another interview for all three between the camps strange times for those poor princes who have to seek soldiering for their existence  meanwhile the cavalry of buddenbrock that is to say of the right wing having now no work in that quarter is despatched to reinforce the left wing which has stood hitherto apart on its own ground not attacked or attackinga left wing refused as the soldiers style it reinforced by buddenbrock this left wing of horse does now also storm forwardnear the village of prausnitz prausnitz a little way to rear of it thereabouts is the scene of its feat feat done in such fashion that the austrians opposite will not stand the charge at all but gurgle about in a chaotic manner then gallop fairly into kingdom wood without stroke struck and disappear as their fellows had done whereupon the prussian horse breaks in upon the adjoining infantry of that flank austrian right flank left bare in this manner champs it also into chaotic whirlpools cuts away an outskirt of near 2000 prisoners and sets the rest running this seems to have been pretty much the coupdegrace of the fight and to have brought the austrian dispute to finis from the first they had rallied on the heights had struggled and disputed two general rallies they made and various partial but none had any success they were driven on bayonet in back as the phrase is with this sad slap on their right added to that old one on their left what can they now do but ebb rapidly pour in cataracts into kingdom wood and disappear there  oeuvres de frederic iii 135143 stille pp 144163 orlich ii 227243 feldzuge i 357 363 374  prince karls scheme was good says friedrich but it was ill executed he never should have let us form his first grand fault was that he waited to be attacked instead of attacking parts of his scheme were never executed at all duke dahremberg for instance it is said had so dim a notion of the ground that he drew up some miles off with his back to the prussians such is the rumorperhaps only a rumor in mockery of the hebetated old gentleman fallen unlucky on the other hand that nadasti made a failure which proved important is indubitable nadasti with some thousands of tolpatchery was at liebenthal four miles to southeast of the action ruffian trenck lay behind eypel perhaps as far to east of it trenck and nadasti were to rendezvous to unite and attack the prussian camp on its rearcamp so ran the order for it was understood the prussians would all be there we others attacking it in front and both flankswhich turned out otherwise not for nadasti alone  nadasti came to his rendezvous in time ruffian trenck did not nadasti grew tired of waiting for trenck and attacked the camp by himselfcamp but not any men camp being now empty and the men all fighting ranked at right angles to it furlongs and miles away nadasti made a rare hand of the camp plundered everything took all the kings campfurniture ready money favorite dog bichelikewise poor eichel his secretary who however tore the papers first tolpatchery exultingly gutted the camp and at last set fire to itburnt even some eight or ten poor prussian sick and also some women whom they caught we found the limbs of these poor men and women lying about reports old general lehwald who knew about it a doggery well worthy of the gallows think lehwald and i could nt help it ferocity of wild men says nadasti well but why not attack then with your ferocity confused courtmartial put these questions at vienna subsequently and ruffian trenck some say got injustice nadasti shuffling things upon him for which one cares almost nothing lehwald lying at trautenau had heard the firing at sunrise and instantly marched to help he only arrived to give nadasti a slash or two and was too late for the fight one schlichtling on guard with a weak party saved what was in the right wing of the campsmall thanks to him the main fight being so near friedrichs opinion is an officer in schlichtlings place ought to have done more and not have been so helpless  this was the battle of sohr so called because the austrians had begun there and the prussians ended there the prussian pursuit drew bridle at that village unsafe to prosecute austrians farther now in the deeps of kingdom forest the battle has lasted five hours it must be now getting towards noon and time for breakfast if indeed any were to be had but that is next to impossible nadasti having been so busy not without extreme difficulty is a manchet of bread with or without a drop of wine procured for the kings majesty this day many a tired hero will have nothing but tobacco with springwater to fall back upon never mind says the king says everybody after all it is a

manoeuvring about in the highest military style of art ranks them all in line or two suitable lines 30000 of them and then with clangorous outburst of trumpet kettledrum and all manner of fieldmusic fires off his united artillery a first time almost shaking the very hills by such a thunderous peal in the still afternoon and mark close fitted into the artillery peal commences a rolling fire like a peal spread out in threads sparkling strangely to eye and ear from right to left long spears of fire and sharp strokes of sound darting aloft successive simultaneous winding for the space of miles

for convenience of food and forage from the silesian side again prince leopold whose headquarters are about striegau intimates that he cannot yet say with certainty what districts prince karl will occupy for winterquarters in bohemia prince karl is vaguely roving about detaching pandours to the silesian mountains as if for checking our victorious nassau therealways rather creeping northward skirting western silesia with his main force 30000 or better with lobkowitz and nadasti ahead meaning what be vigilant my young friend  the private fact is prince karl does not mean to go into

contrivance of rutowski and the counsel of austrian military men for there is much consulting about it and redacting of it polish majesty himself very busy to bruhls yellow rage it is highly solacing

there occur these rapidly successive phases of activity which we study to take up in a curt form  first probably 9th or 10th november there is council held with minister podewils and the old dessauer council from which comes little benefit or none podewils and old leopold stare incredulous cannot be made to believe such a thing impossible any saxon minister or man would voluntarily bring the theatre of war into his own country in this manner thinks the old dessauer and persists to thinkon what obstinate ground friedrich never knew to which podewils who has properties in the lausitz and would so fain think them safe obstinately though more covertly adheres impossible urge both these councillors and friedrich cannot even make them believe it believe it and alas believing it is not the whole problem  happily friedrich has the privilege of ordering with or without their belief you podewils announce the matter to foreign courts you serene highness of anhalt at your swiftest collect yonder and encamp again your eye well on grune and rutowski and the instant i give you signal i am for silesia to look after prince karl the other long leg of this business old leopold according to friedrichs account is visibly glad of such opportunity to fight again before he die and yet for no reason except some senile jealousy is not content with these arrangements perversely objects to this and that at length the king saysthink of this hard word and of the eyes that accompany itwhen your highness gets armies of your own you will order them according to your mind at present it must be according to mine on then and not a moment lost for of all things we must be swift  old leopold goes accordingly friedrich himself goes in a week hence orders correspondences from podewils and the rest are flying right and leftto young leopold in silesia first of all young leopold draws out his forces towards the silesianlausitz border where prince karls intentions are now becoming visible andhere is the second phase notable  on monday 15th 18th feldzuge i 402 see rodenbeck i 122 at 7 am friedrich rushes off by crossen full speed for liegnitz with rothenburg with the prince of prussia

preliminaries there does on the thursday following at niederadelsdorf not far off take actual command of prince leopolds army which had lain encamped for some days waiting him and now with such force in hand35000 soldiers every man of them and freshened by a months restone will endeavor to do some good upon prince karl probably sooner than prince karl supposes for there is great velocity in this young king a pantherlike suddenness of spring in him cunning too as any felis of them and with claws like the felis leo on occasion here follows the brief campaign that ensued which i strive greatly to abridge  prince karls intentions towards frankfurtonoder country through the lausitz are now becoming practically manifest there is a magazine for him at guben within thirty miles of frankfurt arrangements getting ready all the way a winter march of 150 milesbut what say the spies is to hinder prince karl dreams not that friedrich is on the ground or that anybody is aware which notion friedrich finds that it will be extremely suitable to maintain in prince karl friedrich is now at adelsdorf some thirty miles eastward of the lausitz border perhaps forty or more from the route prince karl will follow through that province  it is a highlying irregularly hilly country hilly not mountainous various streams rise out of it that have a long courseamong others the spree which washes

and the fourth and last black neisse thank heaven is an upper branch of this and we have and shall have nothing to do with itthird neisse which we may call the lausitz neisse on which near the head of it there is a fine old spinning linenweaving town called zittauwhere to make it memorable one tourist has read on the townhouse an inscription worth repeating bene facere et male audire regium est to

them bober valley then queiss valley which run parallel though they join at last and become bober wholly before getting into the oderthese two valleys and rivers lie in friedrichs own territory and are between him and the lausitz queiss river being the boundary of silesia and the lausitz here it is down the neisse that prince karl means to march there are saxons already gathering about zittau and down as far as guben they are making magazines and arrangementsfor it is all their own country in those years though most of it is prussias now prince karls march will go parallel to the bober and the queiss separated from the queiss in this part by an undulating hilltract of twenty miles or more  friedrich has had somewhat to settle for the southern frontier of silesia withal which new doggeries of pandours are invadingto lie ready for prince karl on his return thither whose grand meaning all this while as friedrich well knows is silesia in the lump again had he once cut us off from brandenburg and our supplies general nassau far eastward who is doing exploits in moravia itselfhim friedrich has ordered homeward westward to his own side of the mountains to attend these new pandour gentlemen winterfeld he has called home out of those southern mountains as likely to be usefuler here on this western frontier winterfeld arrived in camp the same day with friedrich and is sent forward with a body of 3000 light troops to keep watch about the lausitz frontier and the river queiss careful not to quit our own side of that streamas we mean to hoodwink prince karl if we can  friedrich lies strictly within his own borders for a day or two till prince karl march till his own arrangements are complete friedrich himself keeps the bober winterfeld the queiss all pass freely out of the lausitz none are allowed to cross into it thereby we hear notice of prince karl he none of us perfectly quiescent we poor creatures and aware of nothing thus too friedrichin spite of his warlike manifesto which the saxons are on the eve of answering with a formal declaration of waraffects great rigor in considering the saxons as not yet at war with him respects their frontier winterfeld even punishes hussars for trespassing on lausitz ground friedrich also affects to have roads repaired which he by no means intends to travelthe whole with a view of lulling prince karl of keeping the mousetrap open as he had done in the striegau case it succeeded again quite as conspicuously and at less expense  prince karlwhose tolpatch doggery winterfeld will not allow to pass the queiss and to whom no traveller or tidings can come from beyond that riverdiscerns only on the farther shore of it winterfeld with his 3000 light troops behind these he discerns either nothing or nothing immediately momentous but contentedly supposes that this the superficies of things is all the solidcontent they have prince karl gets under way therefore nothing doubting with his saxons as vanguard down the neisse valley on the right or queissward side of it saturday 20th november is his first march in lusatian territory he lies that night spread out in three villages schonberg schonbrunn kieslingswalde feldzuge i 407 bericht von der action bey katholischhennersdorf c some ten miles long parallel to the neisse river and about four miles from it east or queissward of it karl himself is rear at schonberg fierce lobkowitz is centre the saxons are vanguard 6000 in all posted in villages which again are some ten or twelve miles ahead of prince karls forces the queiss on their right hand and the naumburg bridge of queiss where winterfeld now is about fifteen miles to east their uhlans circulate through the intervening space were much patrolling needed in such quiet circumstances and maintain the due communication there lies prince karl on saturday night 20th november 1745 an army of perhaps 40000 dnngerously straggling out above twenty miles long and appears to see no difficulty ahead the saxons i think are to continue where they are guarding the flank while the prince and lobkowitz push forward closer by neisse river in four marches more they can be in brandenburg with guben and their magazines at hand  seeing which state of matters winterfeld gives friedrich notice of it and that he winterfeld thinks the moment is come pontoons to naumburg then orders friedrich winterfeld at the proper moment is to form a bridge there one permanent bridge there already is and two fords one above it one below with a second bridge there will be roadway for four columns and a swift transit when needful sunday 21st friedrich quits the bober diligently towards naumburg marches sunday monday tuesday 23d about eleven am begins to arrive there winterfeld and passages all ready forward then and let us drive in upon prince karl and either cut him in two or force him to fight us he little thinks where or on what terms sure enough in the worst place we can choose for him friedrich begins crossing in four columns at one pm crosses continuously for four hours unopposed except some skirmishing of uhlans while his cavalry is riding the fords to right and left uhlans were driven back swiftly so soon as the cavalry got over at five in the evening he has got entirely across 35000 horse and foot ziethen is chasing the uhlans at full speed who at least will show us the wayfor by this time a mist has begun falling and the brief daylight is done  friedrich himself without waiting for the rear of his force and some while before this mist fell as i judge is pushing forward a miller lad for his guide across to hennersdorfkatholischhennersdorf a long straggling village eight or ten miles off and itself two miles longwhere he understands the saxons are miller lad guides us over height and hollow with his best skill at a brisk pacethrough one hollow where he has known the cattle pasture in summer time but which proves impassable and mere quagmire at this season no getting through it you unfortunate miller lad garcon de meunier nevertheless we did find passage through the skirts of it nay this quagmire proved the luck of us for the enemy trusting to it had no outguard there never expecting us on that side so that the vanguard ziethen and rapid hussars made an excellent thing of it ziethen sends us word that he has got into the body of hennersdorffound the saxon quartermaster quietly paying his menthat he ziethen is tolerably master of hennersdorf and will amuse the enemy till the other force come up  of course friedrich now pushes on double speed detaches other force horse and foot which was lucky says my informant for the ziethen hussars getting good plunder had by no means demolished the saxons but had left them time to draw up in firm order with a hedge in front a little west of the villagefrom which post unassailable by ziethen they would have got safe off to the main body with little but an affront and some loss of goods the new forcea rapid katzler with light horse in the van cuirassiers and foot rapidly following himsweeps past the long village through a thin wood and a defile finds the enemy firmly ranked as above said cavalry their left infantry on right flanked by an impenetrable hedge and at once strikes in at once katzler does on order given but is far too weak charges he but is countercharged tumbled back the saxons horse and foot showing excellent fight at length more prussian force coming up cuirassiers charge them in front dragoons in flank hussars in rear all attacking at once and with a will and the poor saxon cavalry is entirely cut to shreds  and now there remains only the infantry perhaps about 1000 men if one must guess who form a square ply vigorously their fieldpieces and their firearms and cannot be broken by horsecharges in fact these saxons made a fierce resistancetill before long prussian infantry came up and with counter fieldpieces and musketries blasted gaps in them upon which the cavalry got admittance and reduced the gallant fellows nearly wholly to annihilation either by death or capture there are 914 prisoners in this action 4 big guns and i know not how many kettledrums standards and the likeall that were there i suppose the number of dead not given orlich ii 291 feldzugei 400413 but in brief this saxon force is utterly cut to pieces and only scattered twos and threes of it rush through the dark mist scattering terror to this hand and that the prussians take their post at and round hennersdorf that nightbivouacking though only in sack trousers a blanket each manwe work hard my men and suffer all things for a day or two that it may save much work afterwards said the king to them and they cheerfully bivouacked  this was the action of katholischhennersdorf fought on tuesday 23d november 1745 and still celebrated in the prussian annals and reckoned a brilliant passage of war katholischhennersdorf some ten miles southwest of naumburg on the queiss for there are to my knowledge twentyfive other villages called hennersdorf and three several towns of naumburg and many castles and hamlets so named in dear germany of the nomenclatureskatholischhennersdorf is the place and tuesday about dusk the time a sharp brush of fighting not great in quantity but laid in at the right moment in the right place like the prick of a needle duly sharp into the spinal marrow of a gigantic object totally ruinous to such object never or rarely in the annals of war was as much good got of so little fighting you may with labor and peril plunge a hundred dirks into your boaconstrictor hack him with axes bray him with sledgehammers that is not uncommon but the one true prick in the spinal marrow and the artist that can guide you well to that he and it are the notable and beneficent phenomena     prince karl cut in two tumbles home again doublequick  next morning wednesday 24th the prussians are early astir again groping on all manner of roads to find what prince karl is doing in a world all covered in thick mist they can find nothing of him but broken tumbrils left baggagewagons rumor of universal marching hither and marching thitherevidences of an army fallen into universal st vitussdance distractedly hurrying to and fro not knowing whitherward for the moment except that it must be homewards homewards with velocity  prince karls farther movements are not worth particularizing ordering and crossordering march this way no back again such a scene in that mist prince karl is flowing homeward confusedly deluging and gurgling southward the best he can next afternoon near gorlitz and again one other time he appears drawn up as if for fighting but has himself no such thought flies again without a shot leaves gorlitz to capitulate that afternoon all places to capitulate or be evacuated we hear he is for zittau winterfeld with light horse hastens after him gets sight of him on the heights at zittau yonder  oeuvres de frederic iii 157 orlich ii 296 about two in the morning but the prince has not the least notion to fight prince leaves zittau to capitulatequits silently the heights of zittau at two am winterfeld very lively in the rear of him cutting off his baggageand so tumbles pellmell through the passes of gabel home to bohemia again let us save this poor note from the fire  on saturday night november 27th the prussians pursuing prince karl were cantoned in the herrnhuth neighborhoodmy informants regiment in the town of herrnhuth itself feldzuge i ubi supra yes there lay the prussians over sunday and might hear some weighty expounder if they liked considerably theological many of these poor prussian soldiers carrying a bible in their knapsack and devout psalms in the heart of them twothirds of every regiment are landeskinder native prussians each regiment from a special cantongenerally rather religious men the other third are recruits gathered in the free towns of the reich or where they can be got not distinguished by devotion these we may fancy only trained to the uttermost by spartan drill  before the week is done that first leg of the grand enterprise the princekarl leg is such a leg as we see silesia in the lumpfond dream again what a dream old dessauer getting signal where now too probably is saxony itselfranking again at aussig in bohemia prince karl5000 of his men lost and all impetus and fire gonefalls gently down the elbe to join rutowski at least and will reappear within four weeks out of saxon switzerland still rather in dismal humor  the prussian troops in four great divisions are cantoned in that lausitz country now so quiet in and about bautzen and three other towns of the neighborhood to rest and be ready for the old dessauer when we hear of him the magazine at guben in 138 wagons the gorlitz and other magazines of prince karl in the due number of wagons supply them with comfortable unexpected provender thus they lie cantoned and have with despatch effectually settled their part of the problem question now is how will it stand with the old dessauer and his part or better still would not perhaps the saxons in this humiliated state accept peace and finish the matter     chapter xivbattle of kesselsdorf  a correspondence of a certain excellency villiers english minister at dresdensir thomas villiers grandfather of the present earl of clarendonwas very famous in those weeks and is still worth mention as a trait of friedrichs procedure in this crisis friedrich not intoxicated with his swift triumph over prince karl but calculating the perils and the chances still aheadmiserably off for money tooadmits to himself that not revenge or triumph that peace is the one thing needful to him november 29th old leopold is entering saxony and in the same hours podewils at berlin by order of friedrich writes to villiers who is in dresden about peace about mediating for peace my king ready and desirous now as at all times for peace the terms of it known terms not altered not alterable no bargaining or higgling needed or allowable convention of hanover let his polish majesty accede honestly to that and all these miseries are ended correspondance du roi avec sir thomas villiers commences on podewilss part 28th november on friedrichs 4th december ends on villiers 18th december fourteen pieces in all four of them friedrichs given in oeuvres de frederic iii 183216 see ib 158 and in many other books  villiers starts instantly on this beneficent business goes to court on it that very night villiers shows himself really diligent reasonable loyal doing his very best now and afterwards but has no success at all polish majesty is obstinatei always think in the way sheep are when they feel themselves too much put uponand is deaf to everybody but bruhl bruhl answers let his prussian majesty retire from our territorywhat is he doing in the lausitz just now retire from our territory then we will treat bruhl still refuses to be desperate of his bad gameat any rate bruhls rage is yellower than ever that very evening while talking to villiers he has had preparations going onand next morning takes his master polish majesty august iii with some comfortable minimum of apparatus cigarboxes not forgotten off to prag where they can be out of danger till the thing decide itself villiers follows to prag desists not from his eloquent letters and earnest persuasions at prag but begins to perceive that the means of persuading bruhl will be a much heavier kind of artillery  on the whole negotiations have yet done little britannic george though purseholder what is his success here as little is the russian bugbear persuasive on friedrich himself the czarina of the russias a luxurious lady of far more weight than insight has just notified to him with more emphasis than ever that he shall not attack saxony that if he do she with considerable vigor will attack him that has always been a formidable puzzle for friedrich however he reflects that the russians never could draw sword or be ready with their army in less than six months probably not in twelve and has answered translating it into polite official terms feefawfum your czarish majesty question is not now of attacking but of being myself attackedand so is now running his risks with the czarina  still worse was the result he got from louis xv lately for forms sake as he tells us and not expecting anything he had november 15th made a new appeal to france ruin menacing your most christian majestys ally in this huge sudden crisis of invasive austriansaxons and for your majestys sake may i not in some measure say to which louiss answer is also given a very sickly unpleasant document testifying to considerable pique against friedrichranke says it was a joint production all the ministers gradually contributing each his little pinch of irony to make it spicier and louis signing when it was enoughvery considerable pique against friedrich and something of the stupid sulkiness as of a fat bad boy almost glad that the house is on fire because it will burn his nimble younger brother whom everybody calls so clever sorry indeed sir my brother most sorryand so you have actually signed that hanover convention with our worst enemy france is far from having done so france has done and will do great things our royal heart grieves much at your situation but is not alarmed no your majesty has such invention vigor and ability superior to any crisis our clever younger brother and herewith we pray god to have you in his holy keeping this is the purport of king louiss letterwhich friedrich folds together again looking up from perusal of it we may fancy with what a glance of those eyes louiss original in oeuvres de frederic iii 173 174 with a much more satirical paraphrase than the above and friedrichs answer adjoinedafter the events had come  he is getting instructed this young king as to alliances grand combinations french and other his third note to villiers intimates it being evident that his polish majesty will have nothing from us but fighting we must try to give it him of the best kind we have bautzen 11th december 1745 ubi supra yes truly it is the ultimate persuasive that here in condensed form are the essential details of the course it went in this instancegeneral grune on the road to berlin hearing of the rout at hennersdorf halted instantlyhastened back to saxony to join rutowski there and stand on the defensive not now in that hallefrontier region rutowski has quitted that and all the intrenchments and marshy impregnabilities there not on that hallefrontier but hovering about in the interior rutowski and grune are in junction gravitating towards dresdenexpecting prince karls advent who ought to emerge from the saxon switzerland in few days were he sharp and again enable us to make a formidable figure be speedy old dessauer you must settle the grunerutowski account before that junction not after it  the old dessauer has been tolerably successful and by no means thinks he has been losing time november 29th at three in the morning he stept over into saxony with its impregnable camps drove rutowskis rearguard or remnant out of the quagmires canals and intrenchments before daylight drove it that same evening or before dawn of the morrow out of leipzig has seized that townlays heavy contribution on it nearly 50000 pounds such our strait for finance and be sure you take only substantial men as sureties orlich ii 308and will and does after a two days rest advance with decent celerity inwards though one must first know exactly whither one must have bread and preparations and precautions do all things solidly and in order thinks the old dessauer friedrich well knows the whither and that dresden itself is or may be made the place for falling in with rutowski friedrich is now himself ready to join from the bautzen region the days and hours precious to him and spurs the old dessauer with the sharpest remonstrances all solidly and in order your majesty answers the old dessauer solid strongboned old coachhorse who has his own modes of trotting having done many a heavy mile of it in his time and whose skin one hopes is of the due thickness against undue spurring  old dessauer wishes two things bread to live upon and a sure bridge over the elbe whereby friedrich may join him old dessauer makes for torgau far north where is both an elbe bridge and a magazine which he takes torgau and pertinents now his but it is far down the elbe far off from bautzen and friedrich a nearer bridge and rendezvous your highness meissen where they make the china only fifty miles from me and twenty from dresden let that be the bridge now that you have got victual and speedy for heavens sake speedy friedrich pushes out general lehwald from bautzen with 4000 men towards meissen bridge lehwald does not himself meddle with the bridge only fires shot across upon the saxon party till the old dessauer on the other bank come upand the old dessauer impatience thinks will never come three days in torgau yes your majesty i had bread to bake and the very ovens had to be built a solid old roadster with his own modes of trotting needs thickness of skin friedrichs letters to leopold in orlich ii 431 435 6th10th december 1745  at long last on sunday 12th december about two pm the old dessauer does appear or general gessler his vanguard does appeargessler of the sixtyseven standardsalways about an hour ahead gessler has summoned meissen has not got it is haggling with it about terms when towards sunset of the short day old dessauer himself arrives whereupon the saxon commandant quits the bridge not much breaking it and glides off in the dark clear out of meissen towards dresdenchased but successfully defending himself see plan p 10 had he but stood out for two days say the saxonsprince karl had then been up and much might have been different well friedrich too would have been up and it had most likely been the same on a larger scale but the saxon commandant did not stand out he glided off safe joined rutowski and grune who are lying about wilsdruf six or seven miles on the hither side of dresden and eagerly waiting for prince karl bridge and town of meissen are your majestys reports the old dessauer that night upon which friedrich instantly rises hastening thitherward lehwald comes across meissen bridge effects the desired junction and all monday the old dessauer defiles through meissen town and territory continually advances towards dresden the saxons harassing the flanks of him a littlenay in one defile being sharp strenuous fellows they threw his rear into some confusion cut off certain carts and prisoners and the life of one brave general lieutenantgeneral roel who had charge there spurring ones trot into a gallop this comes of your fast marching of your spurring beyond the rules of war thinks old leopold and friedrich who knows otherwise is very angry for a moment  but indeed the crisis is pressing prince karl is across the metal mountains nearing dresden from the east friedrich strikes into march for the same point by meissen so soon as the bridge is his old leopold is advancing thither from the westwardsteadily hour by hour dresden city the fateful goal therein these middle days of december 1745 highland rebellion just whirling back from derby again the london shops shut for one dayit is clear there will be a big and bloody game played before we are much older very sad indeed but count bruhl is not persuadable otherwise by slumbering and sluggarding over their moneytills and fleshpots trying to take evil for good and to say it will do when it will not do respectable nations come at last to be governed by bruhls cannot help themselvesand get their backs broken in consequence why not would you have a nation live forever that is content to be governed by bruhls the gods are wiserit is now the 13th old dessauer tramping forward hour by hour towards dresden and some field of fate  on tuesday 14th by break of day old dessauer gets on march again in four columns in battle order steady all dayhard winter weather ground crisp and flecked with snow the pass at neustadt his cavalry went into it at full gallop but found nobody there that night he encamps at a place called rohrsdorf which may be eight miles westbynorth from dresden as the crow flies and ten or more if you follow the highway round by wilsdruf on your right the real direct highway from meissen to dresden is on the other side of the elbe and keeps by the riverbank a fine level road but on this western side where leopold now is the road is inland and goes with a bend leopold of course keeps command of this road his columns are on both sides of it river on their left at some miles distance and incessantly expect to find rutowski drawn out on favorable ground somewhere the country is of fertile but very broken character intersected by many brooks making obliquely towards the elbe obliquely with a leaning meissenwards country always mounting till here about rohrsdorf we seem to have almost reached the watershed and the brooks make for the elbe leaning dresden way good posts abound in such broken country with its villages and brooks with its thickets hedges and patches of swamp but rutowski has not appeared anywhere during this tuesday  our four columns therefore lie all night under arms about rohrsdorf and again by morrows dawn are astir in the old order crunching far and wide the frozen ground and advance charged to the muzzle with potential battle slightly upwards always to the actual watershed of the country leaving wilsdruf a little to their right wilsdruf is hardly past when see from this broad tableland top of the country yonder is rutowski at lastand this new wednesday will be a day yonder sure enough drawn out three or four miles long with his right to the elbe his left to that intricate village of kesselsdorf bristling with cannon deep gullet and swampy brook in front of him the strongest post a man could have chosen in those parts  the village of kesselsdorf itself lies rather in a hollow in the slight beginning or uppermost extremity of a little valley or dell called the tschonengrundwhich with its quaggy brook of a tschone wends northeastward into the elbe a course of four or five miles a little valley very deep for its length and getting altogether chasmy and precipitous towards the elbeward or lower end kesselsdorf itself as we said is mainly in a kind of hollow between old leopold and kesselsdorf the ground rather mounts and there is perceptibly a flat knoll or rise at the head of it where the village begins some trees there and abundance of cannon and grenadiers at this moment it is the southwestern or leftmost point of rutowskis line impregnable with its cannonbatteries and grenadiers rightward rutowski extends in long lines with the quaggydell of tschonengrund in front of him parallel to him dell ever deepening as it goes northeastward at the extreme right or elbe point of it where grune and the austrians stand it has grown so chasmy we judge that grune can neither advance nor be  mapplan goes herebook 15 continuation page 10  advanced uponewhich he did all day in a purely meditative posture rutowski numbers 35000 now on this ground with immensity of cannon 32000 we with only the usual fieldartillery and such a tschonengrund with its halffrozen quagmires ahead a ticklish case for the old man as he grimly reconnoitres it in the winter morning  grim old dessauer having reconnoitred and rapidly considered decides to try itwhat elsewill range himself on the west side of that tschonengrund horse and foot two lines wide as rutowski opposite him but means to direct his main and prime effort against kesselsdorf which is clearly the key of the position if it can be taken for which end the old dessauer lengthens himself out to rightward so as to outflank kesselsdorfneglecting grune refusing grune as the soldiers sayour horse of the right wing reached from the wood called lerchenbusoh larchbush rightward as far as freyberg road foot all between that lerchenbusch and the big birchtree on the road to wilsdruf horse of the left wing from there to roitsch stille p 181 who was present see plan it was about two pm before the old man got all his deployments completed what corps of his deploying this way or that came within wind of kesselsdorf were saluted with cannon thirty pieces or more which are in battery in three batteries on the knoll there but otherwise no fighting as yet at two the old dessauer is complete he reverently doffs his hat as had always been his wont in prayer to god before going in a grim fervor of prayer is in his heart doubtless though the words as reported are not very regular or orthodox o herr gott help me yet this once let me not be disgraced in my old days or if thou wilt not help me dont help those hundsvogte damned scoundrels so to speak but leave us to try it ourselves that is the old scandinavian of a dessauers prayer a kind of godur he too priest as well as captain prayer mythically true as given mythically not otherwise ranke iii 334 n which done he waves his hat once on in gods name and the storm is loose prussian right wing pushing grandly forward bent in that manner to take kesselsdorf and its firethroats in flank  the prussians tramp on with the usual grimbrowed resolution foot in front horse in rear but they have a terrible problem at that kesselsdorf with its retrenched batteries and numerous grenadiers fighting under cover the very ground is sore against them uphill and the trampled snow wearing into a slide so that you sprawl and stagger sadly thirtyone big guns and about 9000 small pouring out mere death on you from that knollhead the prussians stagger cannot stand it bend to rightwards and get out of shotrange cannot manage it this bout rally reinforce try it again again with a will but again there is not a way the prussians are again repulsed fall back down this slippery course in more disorder than the first time had the saxons stood still steadily handling arms how on such terms could the prussians ever have managed it  but at sight of this second repulse the saxon grenadiers and especially one battalion of austrians who were there the only austrians who fought this day gave a shout victoryand in the height of their enthusiasm rushed out this austrian battalion first and the saxons after them to charge these prussians and sweep the world clear of them it was the ruin of their battle a fatal hollaing before you are out of the woods old leopold quick as thought noticing the thing hurls cavalry on these victorious downplunging grenadiers slashes them asunder into mere recoiling whirlpools of ruin so that few of them got back unwounded and the prussians storming in along with themaided by ever new prussians from beyond the tschonengrund eventhe place was at length carried and the saxon battle became hopeless  for their right being in such hurricane the prussians from the centre as we hint storm forward withal will not be held back by the tschonengrund they find the tschonengrund quaggy in the extreme brook frozen at the sides but waistdeep of liquid mud in the centre cross it nevertheless towards the upper part of ityoung moritz of dessau leading the way to help his old father in extremity they climb the opposite sidequite slippery in places but helping one another upno saxons there till you get fairly atop which was an oversight on the saxon part fairly atop moritz is saluted by the saxons with diligent musketvolleys but moritz also has musketvolleys in him bayonetcharges in him eager to help his old papa at this hard pinch old papa has the saxons in flank sends more and ever more other cavalry in on them and in fact the right wing altogether storms violently through kesselsdorf and sweeps it clean whole regiments of the saxons are made prisoners roels light horse we see there taking standards cutting violently in to avenge roels death and the affront they had at meissen lately furious moritz on their front from across the tschonengrund furious roel ghost of roel and others in their flank through kesselsdorf no standing for the saxons longer  about nightfalltheir horse having made poorish fight though the foot had stood to it like menthey roll universally away the prussian left wing of horse are summoned through the tschonengrund to chase had there remained another hour of daylight the saxon army had been one wide ruin hidden in darkness the saxon army ebbed confusedly towards dresden with the loss of 6000 prisoners and 3000 killed and wounded a completely beaten army it is the last battle the saxons fought as a nationor probably will fight battle called of kesselsdorf wednesday 15th december 1745  prince karl had arrived at dresden the night before heard all this volleying and cannonading from the distance but did not see good to interfere at all too wide apart some say quartered at unreasonably distant villages by some irrefragable ignorant warclerk of bruhls appointingfatal bruhl others say his highness had himself no mind and made excuses that his troops were tired disheartened by the two beatings latelywhat will become of us in case of a third or fourth it is certain prince karl did nothing nor has grimes corps the right wing done anything except meditateit stood there unattacked unattacking till deep in the dark night when rutowski remembered it and sent it order to come home one austrian battalion that of grenadiers on the knoll at kesselsdorf did actually fightand did begin that fatal outbreak and quitting of the post there which lost the battle to us say the saxons  had those grenadiers stood in their place there is no prussian but admits that it would have been a terrible business to take kesselsdorf and its batteries but they did not stand they rushed out shouting victory and lost us the battle and that is the good we have got of the sublime austrian alliance and that is the pass our grand scheme of partitioning prussia has come to fatal little bruhl of the three hundred and sixtyfive clothessuits valet fatally become divine in valethoodare not you costing your country dear  old

i had the honor of forewarning you by the word i wrote to the abbe never mind what abbe another valoriclerk from sonnenwalde my halfway house between berlin and this city i went first of all to m de vaugrenand our envoy here who had the goodness to open himself to me on the business now on hand in my opinion nothing can be added to the excellent considerations he has been urging on the king of prussia and the count de podewils  at halfpast 8 i went to his prussian majestys i found he was engaged with his concertlodges in the lubomirski palace has his snatch of melody in the evening of such discordant daysand i could not see him till after halfpast 9 i announced myself to m eichel he was too overwhelmed with affairs to give me audience i asked for count rothenburg he was at cards with the princess lubomirski at last i did get to the king who received me in the most agreeable way but was just going to supper said he must put off answering till tomorrow morning morning of this day m de vaugrenand had been so good as prepare me on the rumors of a peace with saxony and the queen of hungary i went to m podewils who said a great many kind things to me for you i could only sketch out the matter at that time and represented to podewils the brilliant position of his master who had become arbiter of the peace of europe that the moment was come for making this peace a general one and that perhaps there would be room for repentance afterwards if the opportunity were slighted he said his masters object was that same and thus closed the conversation by general questions  this morning i again presented myself at the king of prussias i had to wait and wait in fine it was not till halfpast 5 in the evening that he returned or gave me admittance and i stayed with him till after 7when concerttime was at hand again listen to a remarkable dialogue of the conquering hero with a humble friend whom he likes his majesty condescended a daigne to enter with me into all manner of details and began by telling me  that m de valori had done admirably not to come himself with that letter from the king most christian our king letter the sickly document above spoken of that there could not have been an answer expectedthe letter being almost of ironical strain his majesty most christian not giving him the least hope but merely talking of his fine genius and how that would extricate him from the perilous entanglement and inspire him with a wise resolution in the matter that he had in effect taken a resolution the wisest he could and was making his peace with saxony and the queen of hungary that he had felt all the dangers of the difficult situations he had been insheer destruction yawning all round him in huge imminency more than once and no friend heedingthat weary of playing always doubleorquits he had determined to end it and get into a state of tranquillity which both himself and his people had such need of that france could not without difficulty have remedied his mishaps and that he saw by the kings letter there was not even the wish to do it that his friedrichs military career was completedso far as he could foresee or decide that he would not again expose his country to the caprices of fortune whose past constancy to him was sufficiently astonishing to raise fears of a reverse hear that his ambitions were fulfilled in having compelled his enemies to ask peace from him in their own capital with the chancellor of bohemia harrach typifying fallen austrian pride obliged to cooperate  that he would always be attached to our kings interests and set all the value in the world on his friendship but that he had not been sufficiently assisted to be content that observing henceforth an exact neutrality he might be enabled to do offices of mediation and to carry to the one side and to the other words of peace that he offered himself for that object and would be charmed to help in it but that he was fixed to stop there that in regard to the basis of general peace he had two ideas which the reader can attend to and see where they differed from the event and where notone was that france should keep ypres furnes tournay which france did not giving up the netherlands otherwise with ostend to the english to the english in exchange for cape breton the other was to give up more of our conquests we gave them all up and got only the glory and our codfishery cape breton back the english being equally generous and bargain for liberty to reestablish dunkirk in its old condition not a word of your dunkirk there is your cape breton and we also will go home with what glory there isnot difficult to carry but that it was by england we must make the overtures without addressing ourselves to the court of vienna and put it in his friedrichs power to propose a receivable project of peace that he well conceived the great point was the queen of spain termagant and jenkinss ear termagants husband still living is a lappet of termagants self but that she must content herself with parma and piacenza for the infant don philip which the termagant did and give back her hold of savoy partial hold of no use to her without the passes to the king of sardinia and of the jenkinssear question generous england will say nothing next to nothing hopes a modicum of putty and diplomatic varnish may close that troublesome questionwhich springs meanwhile in the centre of the world  these kind condescensions of his majesty emboldened me to represent to him the brilliant position he now held and how noble it would be after having been the hero of germany to become instead of ones own pacificator the pacificator of europe i grant you said he mon cher darget but it is too dangerous a part for playing a reverse brings me to the edge of ruin i know too well the mood of mind i was in last time i left berlin with that threelegged immensity of atropos not yet mown down at hennersdorf by a lucky cut ever to expose myself to it again if luck had been against me there i saw myself a monarch without throne and my subjects in the cruelest oppression a bad game that always mere check to your king no other movei refer it to you friend dargetin fine i wish to be at peace  i represented to him that the house of austria would never with a tranquil eye see his house in possession of silesia those that come after me said he will do as they like the future is beyond mans reach those that come after will do as they can i have acquired it is theirs to preserve i am not in alarm about the austriansand this is my answer to what you have been saying about the weakness of my guarantees they dread my army the luck that i have i am sure of their sitting quiet for the dozen years or so which may remain to me of lifequiet till i have most likely done with it what are we never to have any good of our life then ne doisje donc jamais jouir there is more for me in the true greatness of laboring for the happiness of my subjects than in the repose of europe i have put saxony out of a condition to do hurt she owes 14775000 crowns of debt two millions and a quarter sterling and by the defensive alliance which i form with her i provide myself but ask bruhl withal a help against austria i would not henceforth attack a cat except to defend myself these are his very words adds dargetand well worth noting ambition gloire and my interests were the occasion of my first campaigns the late kaisers situation and my zeal for france not to mention interests again gave rise to these second and i have been fighting always since for my own hearthsfor my very existence i might say once more i know the state i had got intoif i saw prince karl at the gates of paris i would not stirand us at the gates of vienna answered i promptly with the same indifferenceyes and i swear it to you darget in a word i want to have some good of my life veux jouir what are we poor human atoms to get up projects that cost so much blood let us live and help to live  the rest of the conversation passed in general talk about literature theatres and such objects my reasonings and objectings on the great matter i need not farther detail by the frank discourse

having lost his dear little prussian wife and got into ill health and spirits he retired on leave to paris and next year had to give up the thought of returningthough he still and to the end continued

schidlo and settlement of haggles on the navigation of the elbe there was not kept by the saxons but continued a haggle still this one point is the eleventh article inconceivably small but liable to turn up on us again in a memorable manner that let us translatefor m de voltaires sake and time coming steuer means landtax obersteuereinnahme will be something like royal exchequer therefore and steuerschein will be approximately equivalent to exchequer bill article eleventh stipulates  all subjects and servants of his majesty the king of prussia who hold bonds of the saxon obersteuereinnahme shall be paid in full capital and interest at the times and to the amount specified in said steuerscheine or bonds that is article elevenththe saxon exchequer says an old note on it thanks to bruhls extravagance has been as good as bankrupt paying with inconvertible paper with scheine things to be shown for some time past which paper has accordingly sunk let us say 25 per cent below its nominal amount in gold all prussian subjects who hold these bonds are to be paid in gold saxons and others will have to be content with paper till things come round again if things ever do yesand by ill chance the matter will attract m de voltaires keen eye in the interim  friedrich stayed eight days in dresden the loud theme of gazetteers and rumors the admired of two classes in all countries of the many who admire success and also of the few who can understand what it is to deserve success among his own countrymen this last winter has kindled all their admirations to the flaming pitch saved by him from imminent destruction their enemies swept home as if by one invincible nay sent home in a kind of noble shame conquered by generosity these feelings though not encouraged to speak run very high the dresdeners in private society found him delightful the high ladies especially could you have thought it terrific mars to become radiant apollo in this manner from considerable collections of anecdotes illustrating this fact in a way now fallen vapid to usi select only the introduction  do readers recollect friedrichs first visit to dresden in 1728 seventeen years ago and a certain charming young countess flemming at that time only fourteen who like a hebe as she was contrived beautiful surprises for him and among other things presented him so gracefully on the part of august the strong with his first fluteno reader of this history can recollect it nor indeed except in a mythic sense believe it a young countess flemming daughter of old feldmarschall flemming doubtless
