schools that on him too some secret night in spring   came the old frenzy of a hundred fools  to make some thing the old want dark and deep   the thirst of men the hunger of the stars since first it tinged even the eternals sleep   with monstrous dreams of trees and towns and mars  when all he made for the first time he saw   scattering stars as misers shake their pelf then in the last strange wrath broke his own law   and made a graven image of himself     by the babe unborn  if trees were tall and grasses short   as in some crazy tale if here and there a sea were blue   beyond the breaking pale  if a fixed fire hung in the air   to warm me one day through if deep green hair grew on great hills   i know what i should do  in dark i lie dreaming that there   are great eyes cold or kind and twisted streets and silent doors   and living men behind  let stormclouds come better an hour   and leave to weep and fight than all the ages i have ruled   the empires of the night  i think that if they gave me leave   within that world to stand i would be good through all the day   i spent in fairyland  they should not hear a word from me   of selfishness or scorn if only i could find the door   if only i were born     the worlds lover  my eyes are full of lonely mirth   reeling with want and worn with scars for pride of every stone on earth   i shake my spear at all the stars  a live bat beats my crest above   lean foxes nose where i have trod and on my naked face the love   which is the loneliness of god  outlawed since that great day gone by   when before prince and pope and queen i stood and spoke a blasphemy   behold the summer leaves are green  they cursed me what was that to me   who in that summer darkness furled with but an owl and snail to see   had blessed and conquered all the world  they bound me to the scourgingstake   they laid their whips of thorn on me i wept to see the green rods break   though blood be beautiful to see  beneath the gallows foot abhorred   the crowds cry crucify and kill higher the priests sing praise the lord   the warlock dies and higher still  shall heaven and earth hear one cry sent   even from the hideous gibbet height praise to the lord omnipotent   the vultures have a feast tonight     the skeleton  chattering finch and waterfly are not merrier than i here among the flowers i lie laughing everlastingly no i may not tell the best surely friends i might have guessed death was but the good kings jest   it was hid so carefully     a chord of colour  my lady clad herself in grey   that caught and clung about her throat then all the long grey winter day   on me a living splendour smote and why grey palmers holy are   and why grey minsters great in story and grey skies ring the morning star   and grey hairs are a crown of glory  my lady clad herself in green   like meadows where the windwaves pass then round my spirit spread i ween   a splendour of forgotten grass then all that dropped of stem or sod   hoarded as emeralds might be i bowed to every bush and trod   amid the live grass fearfully  my lady clad herself in blue   then on me like the seer long gone the likeness of a sapphire grew   the throne of him that sat thereon then knew i why the fashioner   splashed reckless blue on sky and sea and ere twas good enough for her   he tried it on eternity  beneath the gnarled old knowledgetree   sat like an owl the evil sage the worlds a bubble solemnly   he read and turned a second page a bubble then old crow i cried   god keep you in your weary wit a bubblehave you ever spied   the colours i have seen on it     the happy man  to teach the grey earth like a child   to bid the heavens repent i only ask from fate the gift   of one man well content  him will i find though when in vain   i search the feast and mart the fading flowers of liberty   the painted masks of art  i only find him at the last   on one old hill where nod golgothas ghastly trinity   three persons and one god     the unpardonable sin  i do not cry beloved neither curse   silence and strength these two at least are good   he gave me sun and stars and ought he could but not a womans love for that is hers  he sealed her heart from sage and questioner   yea with seven seals as he has sealed the grave   and if she give it to a drunken slave the day of judgment shall not challenge her  only this much if one deserving well   touching your thin young hands and making suit   feel not himself a crawling thing a brute buried and bricked in a forgotten hell  prophet and poet be he over sod   prince among angels in the highest place   god help me i will smite him on the face before the glory of the face of god     a novelty  why should i care for the ages   because they are old and grey to me like sudden laughter   the stars are fresh and gay the world is a daring fancy   and finished yesterday  why should i bow to the ages   because they were drear and dry slow trees and ripening meadows   for me go roaring by a living charge a struggle   to escalade the sky  the eternal suns and systems   solid and silent all to me are stars of an instant   only the fires that fall from gods good rocket rising   on this night of carnival     ultimate  the vision of a haloed host   that weep around an empty throne and aureoles dark and angels dead   man with his own life stands alone  i am he says his bankrupt creed   i am and is again a clod the sparrow starts the grasses stir   for he has said the name of god     the donkey  when fishes flew and forests walked   and figs grew upon thorn some moment when the moon was blood   then surely i was born  with monstrous head and sickening cry   and ears like errant wings the devils walking parody   on all fourfooted things  the tattered outlaw of the earth   of ancient crooked will starve scourge deride me i am dumb   i keep my secret still  fools for i also had my hour   one far fierce hour and sweet there was a shout about my ears   and palms before my feet     the beatific vision  through what fierce incarnations furled   in fire and darkness did i go ere i was worthy in the world   to see a dandelion grow  well if in any woes or wars   i bought my naked right to be grew worthy of the grass nor gave   the wren my brother shame for me  but what shall god not ask of him   in the last time when all is told who saw her stand beside the hearth   the firelight garbing her in gold     the hope of the streets  the still sweet meadows shimmered and i stood   and cursed them bloom of hedge and bird of tree and bright and high beyond the hunchbacked wood   the thunder and the splendour of the sea  give back the babylon where i was born   the lips that gape give back the hands that grope and noise and blood and suffocating scorn   an eddy of fierce facesand a hope  that mid those myriad heads one head find place   with brown hair curled like breakers of the sea and two eyes set so strangely in the face   that all things else are nothing suddenly     ecclesiastes  there is one sin to call a green leaf grey   whereat the sun in heaven shuddereth there is one blasphemy for death to pray   for god alone knoweth the praise of death  there is one creed neath no worldterrors wing   apples forget to grow on appletrees there is one thing is needfuleverything   the rest is vanity of vanities     the song of the children  the world is ours till sunset   holly and fire and snow and the name of our dead brother   who loved us long ago  the grown folk mighty and cunning   they write his name in gold but we can tell a little   of the million tales he told  he taught them laws and watchwords   to preach and struggle and pray but he taught us deep in the hayfield   the games that the angels play  had he stayed here for ever   their world would be wise as ours and the king be cutting capers   and the priest be picking flowers  but the dark day came they gathered   on their faces we could see they had taken and slain our brother   and hanged him on a tree     the fish  dark the sea was but i saw him   one great head with goggle eyes like a diabolic cherub   flying in those fallen skies  i have heard the hoarse deniers   i have known the wordy wars i have seen a man by shouting   seek to orphan all the stars  i have seen a fool halffashioned   borrow from the heavens a tongue so to curse them more at leisure   and i trod him not as dung  for i saw that finny goblin   hidden in the abyss untrod and i knew there can be laughter   on the secret face of god  blow the trumpets crown the sages   bring the age by reason fed he that sitteth in the heavens   he shall laughthe prophet said     gold leaves  lo i am come to autumn   when all the leaves are gold grey hairs and golden leaves cry out   the year and i are old  in youth i sought the prince of men   captain in cosmic wars our titan even the weeds would show   defiant to the stars  but now a great thing in the street   seems any human nod where shift in strange democracy   the million masks of god  in youth i sought the golden flower   hidden in wood or wold but i am come to autumn   when all the leaves are gold     thou shalt not kill  i had grown weary of him of his breath and hands and features i was sick to death each day i heard the same dull voice and tread i did not hate him but i wished him dead and he must with his blank face fill my life then my brain blackened and i snatched a knife  but ere i struck my souls grey deserts through a voice cried know at least what thing you do this is a common man knowest thou o soul what this thing is somewhere where seasons roll there is some living thing for whom this man is as seven heavens girt into a span for some one soul you take the world away now know you well your deed and purpose slay  then i cast down the knife upon the ground and saw that mean man for one moment crowned i turned and laughed for there was no one by the man that i had sought to slay was i     a certain evening  that night the whole world mingled   the souls were babes at play and angel danced with devil   and god cried holiday  the sea had climbed the mountain peaks   and shouted to the stars to come to play and down they came   splashing in happy wars  the pine grew apples for a whim   the carthorse built a nest the oxen flew the flowers sang   the sun rose in the west  and neath the load of many worlds   the lowest life god made lifted his huge and heavy limbs   and into heaven strayed  to where the highest life god made   before his presence stands but god himself cried holiday   and she gave me both her hands     a man and his image  all day the nations climb and crawl and pray   in one long pilgrimage to one white shrine where sleeps a saint whose pardon like his peace   is wide as death as common as divine  his statue in an aureole fills the shrine   the reckless nightingale the roaming fawn share the broad blessing of his lifted hands   under the canopy above the lawn  but one strange night a night of gale and flood   a sound came louder than the wild winds tone the gravegates shook and opened and one stood   blue in the moonlight rotten to the bone  then on the statue graven with holy smiles   there came another smiletremendousone of an egyptian god why should you rise   do i not guard your secret from the sun  the nations come they kneel among the flowers   sprung from your blood blossoms of may and june which do not poison themis it not strange   speak and the dead man shuddered in the moon  shall i not cry the truththe dead man cowered   is it not sad with life so tame and cold what earth should fade into the suns white fires   with the best jest in all its tales untold  if i should cry that in this shrine lie hid   stories that satan from his mouth would spew wild tales that men in hell tell hoarselyspeak   saint and deliverer  should i slander you  slowly the cowering corse reared up its head   nay i am vile  but when for all to see you stand there pure and painlessdeath of life   let the stars falli say you slander me  you make me perfect public colourless   you make my virtues sit at easeyou lie for mine were never easylost or saved   i had a souli was and where am i  where is my good the little real hoard   the secret tears the sudden chivalries the tragic love the futile triumphwhere   thief dog and son of devilswhere are these  i will lift up my head in leprous loves   lost and the souls dishonourable scars by god i was a better man than this   that stands and slanders me to all the stars  come down and with an awful cry the corse   sprang on the sacred tomb of many tales and stone and bone locked in a loathsome strife   swayed to the singing of the nightingales  then one was thrown and where the statue stood   under the canopy above the lawn the corse stood grey and lean with lifted hands   raised in tremendous welcome to the dawn  now let all nations climb and crawl and pray   though i be basest of my old red clan they shall not scale with cries or sacrifice   the stature of the spirit of a man     the mariner  the violet scent is sacred   like dreams of angels bright the hawthorn smells of passion   told in a moonless night  but the smell is in my nostrils   through blossoms red or gold of my own green flower unfading   a bitter smell and bold  the lily smells of pardon   the rose of mirth but mine smells shrewd of death and honour   and the doom of adams line  the heavy scent of wineshops   floats as i pass them by but never a cup i quaff from   and never a house have i  till dropped down forty fathoms   i lie eternally and drink from gods own goblet   the green wine of the sea     the triumph of man  i plod and peer amid mean sounds and shapes   i hunt for dusty gain and dreary praise   and slowly pass the dismal grinning days monkeying each other like a line of apes  what care there was one hour amid all these   when i had stripped off like a tawdry glove   my starriest hopes and wants for very love of time and desolate eternities  yea for one great hours triumph not in me   nor any hope of mine did i rejoice   but in a meadow game of girls and boys some sunset in the centuries to be     cyclopean  a mountainous and mystic brute no rein can curb no arrow shoot upon whose domed deformed back i sweep the planets scorching track  old is the elf and wise men say his hair grows green as ours grows grey he mocks the stars with myriad hands high as that swinging forest stands  but though in pigmy wanderings dull i scour the deserts of his skull i never find the face eyes teeth lowering or laughing underneath  i met my foe in an empty dell his face in the sun was naked hell i thought one silent bloody blow no priest would curse no crowd would know  then cowered a daisy half concealed watched for the fame of that poor field and in that flower and suddenly earth opened its one eye on me     joseph  if the stars fell nights nameless dreams   of bliss and blasphemy came true if skies were green and snow were gold   and you loved me as i love you  o long light hands and curled brown hair   and eyes where sits a naked soul dare i even then draw near and burn   my fingers in the aureole  yes in the one wise foolish hour   god gives this strange strength to a man he can demand though not deserve   where ask he cannot seize he can  but once the bloods wild wedding oer   were not dread his half dark desire to see the christchild in the cot   the virgin mary by the fire     modern elfland  i cut a staff in a churchyard copse   i clad myself in ragged things i set a feather in my cap   that fell out of an angels wings  i filled my wallet with white stones   i took three foxgloves in my hand i slung my shoes across my back   and so i went to fairyland  but lo within that ancient place   science had reared her iron crown and the great cloud of steam went up   that telleth where she takes a town  but cowled with smoke and starred with lamps   that strange lands light was still its own the word that witched the woods and hills   spoke in the iron and the stone  not natures hand had ever curved   that mute unearthly porters spine like sleeping dragons sudden eyes   the signals leered along the line  the chimneys thronging crooked or straight   were fingers signalling the sky the dog that strayed across the street   seemed fourlegged by monstrosity  in vain i cried though you too touch   the new times desecrating hand through all the noises of a town   i hear the heart of fairyland  i read the name above a door   then through my spirit pealed and passed this is the town of thine own home   and thou hast looked on it at last     eternities  i cannot count the pebbles in the brook   well hath he spoken swear not by thy head   thou knowest not the hairs though he we read writes that wild number in his own strange book  i cannot count the sands or search the seas   death cometh and i leave so much untrod   grant my immortal aureole o my god and i will name the leaves upon the trees  in heaven i shall stand on gold and glass   still brooding earths arithmetic to spell   or see the fading of the fires of hell ere i have thanked my god for all the grass     a christmas carol  the christchild lay on marys lap   his hair was like a light o weary weary were the world   but here is all aright  the christchild lay on marys breast   his hair was like a star o stern and cunning are the kings   but here the true hearts are  the christchild lay on marys heart   his hair was like a fire o weary weary is the world   but here the worlds desire  the christchild stood at marys knee   his hair was like a crown and all the flowers looked up at him   and all the stars looked down     alone  blessings there are of cradle and of clan   blessings that fall of priests and princes hands   but never blessing full of lives and lands broad as the blessing of a lonely man  though that old king fell from his primal throne   and ate among the cattle yet this pride   had found him in the deepest grass and cried an ecce homo with the trumpets blown  and no mad tyrant with almighty ban   who in strong madness dreams himself divine   but hears through fumes of flattery and of wine the thunder of this blessing name him man  let all earth rot past saints and seraphs plea   yet shall a voice cry through its last lost war   this is the world this red wreck of a star that a man blessed beneath an aldertree     kings cross station  this circled cosmos whereof man is god   has suns and stars of green and gold and red and cloudlands of great smoke that range oer range   far floating hide its iron heavens oerhead  god shall we ever honour what we are    and see one moment ere the age expire the vision of man shouting and erect    whirled by the shrieking steeds of flood and fire  or must fate act the same grey farce again   and wait till one amid times wrecks and scars speaks to a ruin here what poetrace   shot such cyclopean arches at the stars     the human tree  many have earths lovers been tried in seas and wars i ween yet the mightiest have i seen   yea the best saw i one that in a field alone stood up stiller than a stone lest a moth should fly  birds had nested in his hair on his shoon were mosses rare insect empires flourished there   worms in ancient wars but his eyes burn like a glass hearing a great sea of grass   roar towards the stars  from them to the human tree rose a cry continually thou art still our father we   fain would have thee nod make the skies as blood below thee though thou slay us we shall know thee   answer us o god  show thine ancient flame and thunder split the stillness once asunder lest we whisper lest we wonder   art thou there at all but i saw him there alone standing stiller than a stone   lest a moth should fall     to them that mourn  weg may 1898  lift up your heads in life in death   god knoweth his head was high quit we the cowards broken breath   who watched a strong man die  if we must say no more his peer   cometh the flag is furled stand not too near him lest he hear   that slander on the world  the good green earth he loved and trod   is still with many a scar writ in the chronicles of god   a giantbearing star  he fell but britains banner swings   above his sunken crown black death shall have his toll of kings   before that cross goes down  once more shall move with mighty things   his house of ancient tale where kings whose hands were kissed of kings   went in and came out pale  o young ones of a darker day   in arts wan colours clad whose very love and hate are grey   whose very sin is sad  pass on one agony longdrawn   was merrier than your mirth when handinhand came death and dawn   and spring was on the earth     the outlaw  priest is any songbird stricken   is one leaf less on the tree is this wine less red and royal   that the hangman waits for me  he upon your cross that hangeth   it is writ of priestly pen on the night they built his gibbet   drank red wine among his men  quaff like a brave man as he did   wine and death as heaven pours this is my fate o ye rulers   o ye pontiffs what is yours  to wait trembling lest yon loathly   gallowsshape whereon i die in strange temples yet unbuilded   blaze upon an altar high     behind  i saw an old man like a child his blue eyes bright his white hair wild who turned for ever and might not stop round and round like an urchins top  fool i cried while you spin round others grow wise are praised are crowned ever the same round road he trod this is better i seek for god  we see the whole world left and right yet at the blind back hides from sight the unseen master that drives us forth to east and west to south and north  over my shoulder for eighty years i have looked for the gleam of the sphere of spheres in all your turning what have you found at least i know why the world goes round     the end of fear  though the whole heaven be oneeyed with the moon   though the dead landscape seem a thing possessed   yet i go singing through that land oppressed as one that singeth through the flowers of june  no more with forestfingers crawling free   oer dark flint wall that seems a wall of eyes   shall evil break my soul with mysteries of some worldpoison maddening bush and tree  no more shall leering ghosts of pimp and king   with bloody secrets veiled before me stand   last night i held all evil in my hand closed and behold it was a little thing  i broke the infernal gates and looked on him   who fronts the strong creation with a curse   even the god of a lost universe smiling above his hideous cherubim  and pierced far down in his souls crypt unriven   the last black crooked sympathy and shame   and hailed him with that ringing rainbow name erased upon the oldest book in heaven  like emptied idiot masks sins loves and wars   stare at me now for in the night i broke   the bubble of a great worlds jest and woke laughing with laughter such as shakes the stars     the holy of holies  elder father though thine eyes shine with hoary mysteries canst thou tell what in the heart of a cowslip blossom lies  smaller than all lives that be secret as the deepest sea stands a little house of seeds like an elfins granary  speller of the stones and weeds skilled in natures crafts and creeds tell me what is in the heart of the smallest of the seeds  god almighty and with him cherubim and seraphim filling all eternity adonai elohim     the mirror of madmen  i dreamed a dream of heaven white as frost the splendid stillness of a living host vast choirs of upturned faces line oer line then my blood froze for every face was mine  spirits with sunset plumage throng and pass glassed darkly in the sea of gold and glass but still on every side in every spot i saw a million selves who saw me not  i fled to quiet wastes where on a stone perchance i found a saint who sat alone i came behind he turned with slow sweet grace and faced me with my happy hateful face  i cowered like one that in a tower doth bide shut in by mirrors upon every side then i saw islanded in skies alone and silent one that sat upon a throne  his robe was bordered with rich rose and gold green purple silver out of sunsets old but oer his face a great cloud edged with fire because it covereth the worlds desire  but as i gazed a silent worshipper methought the cloud began to faintly stir then i fell flat and screamed with grovelling head if thou hast any lightning strike me dead  but spare a brow where the clean sunlight fell the crown of a new sin that sickens hell let me not look aloft and see mine own feature and form upon the judgmentthrone  then my dream snapped and with a heart that leapt i saw across the tavern where i slept the sight of all my life most full of grace a gindamned drunkards wan halfwitted face     ecb  before the grass grew over me   i knew one good man through and through and knew a soul and body joined   are stronger than the heavens are blue  a wisdom worthy of thy joy   o great heart read i as i ran now though men smite me on the face   i cannot curse the face of man  i loved the man i saw yestreen   hanged with his babes blood on his palms i loved the man i saw today   who knocked not when he came with alms  hushfor thy sake i even faced   the knowledge that is worse than hell and loved the man i saw but now   hanging head downwards in the well     the desecraters  witness all that unrepenting   feathers flying music high i go down to death unshaken   by your mean philosophy  for your wages take my body   that at least to you i leave set the sulky plumes upon it   bid the grinning mummers grieve  stand in silence steep your raiment   in the night that hath no star don the mortal dress of devils   blacker than their spirits are  since ye may not of your mercy   ere i lie on such a hearse hurl me to the living jackals   god hath built for sepulchres     an alliance  this is the weird of a worldold folk   that not till the last link breaks not till the night is blackest   the blood of hengist wakes when the sun is black in heaven   the moon as blood above and the earth is full of hatred   this people tells its love  in change eclipse and peril   under the whole worlds scorn by blood and death and darkness   the saxon peace is sworn that all our fruit be gathered    and all our race take hands and the sea be a saxon river    that runs through saxon lands  lo not in vain we bore him    behold it not in vain four centuries dooms of torture    choked in the throat of spain ere priest or tyrant triumph   we know how wellwe know bone of that bone can whiten   blood of that blood can flow  deep grows the hate of kindred   its roots take hold on hell no peace or praise can heal it   but a stranger heals it well seas shall be red as sunsets   and kings bones float as foam and heaven be dark with vultures   the night our son comes home     the ancient of days  a child sits in a sunny place   too happy for a smile and plays through one long holiday   with balls to roll and pile a painted windmill by his side   runs like a merry tune but the sails are the four great winds of heaven   and the balls are the sun and moon  a staring dollshouse shows to him   green floors and starry rafter and manycoloured graven dolls   live for his lonely laughter the dolls have crowns and aureoles   helmets and horns and wings for they are the saints and seraphim   the prophets and the kings     the last masquerade  a wan new garment of young green   touched as you turned your soft brown hair   and in me surged the strangest prayer ever in lovers heart hath been  that i who saw your youths bright page   a rainbow change from robe to robe   might see you on this earthly globe crowned with the silver crown of age  your dear hair powdered in strange guise   your dear face touched with colours pale   and gazing through the mask and veil the mirth of your immortal eyes     the earths shame  name not his deed in shuddering and in haste   we dragged him darkly oer the windy fell that night there was a gibbet in the waste     and a new sin in hell  be his deed hid from commonwealths and kings   by all men born be one true tale forgot but three things braver than all earthly things     faced him and feared him not  above his head and sunken secret face   nested the sparrows young and dropped not dead from the red blood and slime of that lost place     grew daisies white not red  and from high heaven looking upon him   slowly upon the face of god did come a smile the cherubim and seraphim     hid all their faces from     vanity  a wan sky greener than the lawn   a wan lawn paler than the sky she gave a flower into my hand   and all the hours of eve went by  who knows what round the corner waits   to smite if shipwreck snare or slur shall leave me with a head to lift   worthy of him that spoke with her  a wan sky greener than the lawn   a wan lawn paler than the sky she gave a flower into my hand   and all the days of life went by  live ill or well this thing is mine from all i guard it ill or well one tawdry tattered faded flower to show the jealous kings in hell     the lamp post  laugh your best o blazoned forests   me ye shall not shift or shame with your beauty here among you   man hath set his spear of flame  lamp to lamp we send the signal   for our lord goes forth to war since a voice ere stars were builded   bade him colonise a star  laugh ye cruel as the morning   deck your heads with fruit and flower though our souls be sick with pity   yet our hands are hard with power  we have read your evil stories   we have heard the tiny yell through the voiceless conflagration   of your green and shining hell  and when men with fires and shouting   break your old tyrannic pales and where ruled a single spider   laugh and weep a million tales  this shall be your best of boasting   that some poet poor of spine full and sated with our wisdom   full and fiery with our wine  shall steal out and make a treaty   with the grasses and the showers rail against the grey townmother   fawn upon the scornful flowers  rest his head among the roses   where a quiet songbird sounds and no sword made sharp for traitors   hack him into meat for hounds     the pessimist  you that have snarled through the ages take your answer and go i know your hoary question the riddle that all men know you have weighed the stars in a balance and grasped the skies in a span take if you must have answer the word of a common man  deep in my life lies buried one love unhealed unshriven one hunger still shall haunt meyea in the streets of heaven this is the burden babbler this is the curse shall cling this is the thing i bring you this is the pleasant thing  gainst you and all your sages no joy of mine shall strive this one dead self shall shatter the men you call alive my grief i send to smite you no pleasure no belief lord of the battered grievance what do you know of grief  i only know the praises to heaven that one man gave that he came on earth for an instant to stand beside a grave the peace of a field of battle where flowers are born of blood i only know one evil that makes the whole world good  beneath this single sorrow the globe of moon and sphere turns to a single jewel so bright and brittle and dear that i dread lest god should drop it to be dashed into stars below  you that have snarled through the ages take your answer and go     a fairy tale  all things grew upwards foul and fair the great trees fought and beat the air with monstrous wings that would have flown but the old earth clung to her own holding them back from heavenly wars though every flower sprang at the stars  but he broke free while all things ceased some hour increasing he increased the town beneath him seemed a map above the church he cocked his cap above the cross his feather flew above the birds and still he grew  the trees turned grass the clouds were riven his feet were mountains lost in heaven through strange new skies he rose alone the earth fell from him like a stone and his own limbs beneath him far seemed tapering down to touch a star  he reared his head shaggy and grim staring among the cherubim the seven celestial floors he rent one crystal dome still oer him bent above his head more clear than hope all heaven was a microscope     a portrait  fair faces crowd on christmas night   like seven suns arow but all beyond is the wolfish wind   and the crafty feet of the snow  but through the rout one figure goes   with quick and quiet tread her robe is plain her form is frail   wait if she turn her head  i say no word of line or hue   but if that face you see your soul shall know the smile of faiths   awful frivolity  know that in this grotesque old masque   too loud we cannot sing or dance too wild or speak too wide   to praise a hidden thing  that though the jest be old as night   still shaketh sun and sphere an everlasting laughter   too loud for us to hear     femina contra mundum  the sun was black with judgment and the moon         blood but between i saw a man stand saying to me at least         the grass is green  there was no star that i forgot to fear         with love and wonder the birds have loved me but no answer came         only the thunder  once more the man stood saying a cottage door         wherethrough i gazed that instant as i turnedyea i am vile         yet my eyes blazed  for i had weighed the mountains in a balance         and the skies in a scale i come to sell the starsold lamps for new         old stars for sale  then a calm voice fell all the thunder through         a tone less rough thou hast begun to love one of my works         almost enough     to a certain nation  we will not let thee be for thou art ours   we thank thee still though thou forget these things for that hours sake when thou didst wake all powers   with a great cry that god was sick of kings  leave thee there grovelling at their rusted greaves   these hulking cowards on a painted stage who with imperial pomp and laurel leaves   show their marengoone man in a cage  these for whom stands no type or title given   in all the squalid tales of gore and pelf though cowed by crashing thunders from all heaven   cain never said my brother slew himself  tear you the truth out of your drivelling spy   the maniac whom you set to swing deaths scythe nay torture not the torturerlet him lie   what need of racks to teach a worm to writhe  bear with us o our sister not in pride   nor any scorn we see thee spoiled of knaves but only shame to hear where danton died   thy foul dead kings all laughing in their graves  thou hast a right to rule thyself to be   the thing thou wilt to grin to fawn to creep to crown these clumsy liars ay and we   who knew thee once we have a right to weep     the praise of dust  what of vile dust the preacher said   methought the whole world woke the dead stone lived beneath my foot   and my whole body spoke  you that play tyrant to the dust   and stamp its wrinkled face this patient star that flings you not   far into homeless space  come down out of your dusty shrine   the living dust to see the flowers that at your sermons end   stand blazing silently  rich white and bloodred blossom stones   lichens like fire encrust a gleam of blue a glare of gold   the vision of the dust  pass them all by till as you come   where at a citys edge under a treei know it well   under a lattice ledge  the sunshine falls on one brown head   you too o cold of clay eater of stones may haply hear   the trumpets of that day  when god to all his paladins   by his own splendour swore to make a fairer face than heaven   of dust and nothing more     the ballad of the battle of gibeon  five kings rule oer the amorite mighty as fear and old as night swathed with unguent and gold and jewel waxed they merry and fat and cruel zedek of salem a terror and glory whose face was hid while his robes were gory and hoham of hebron whose loathly face is heavy and dark oer the ruin of races and piram of jarmuth drunk with strange wine who dreamed he had fashioned all stars that shine and debir of eglon wild without pity who raged like a plague in the midst of his city and japhia of lachish a fire that flameth who did in the daylight what no man nameth  these five kings said one to another king unto king oer the world is brother seeing that now for a sign and a wonder a red eclipse and a tongue of thunder a shape and a finger of desolation is come against us a kingless nation gibeon hath failed us it were not good that a man remember where gibeon stood then gibeon sent to our captain crying son of nun let a shaft be flying for unclean birds are gathering greedily slack not thy hand but come thou speedily yea we are lost save thou maintainst us for the kings of the mountains are gathered against us  then to our people spake the deliverer gibeon is high yet a host may shiver her gibeon hath sent to me crying for pity for the lords of the cities encompass the city with chariot and banner and bowman and lancer and i swear by the living god i will answer gird you o israel quiver and javelin shield and sword for the road we travel in verily as i have promised pay i life unto gibeon death unto ai  sudden and still as a bolt shot right up on the city we went by night never a bird of the air could say this was the children of israels way  only the hosts sprang up from sleeping saw from the heights a dark stream sweeping sprang up straight as a great shout stung them and heard the deliverers warcry among them heard under cupola turret and steeple the awful cry of the kingless people  started the weak of them shouted the strong of them crashed we a thunderbolt into the throng of them blindly with heads bent and shields forced before us we heard the dense roar of the strife closing oer us and drunk with the crash of the song that it sung them we drove the great spearblade in gods name among them  redder and redder the swordflash fell our eyes and our nostrils were hotter than hell till full all the crest of the spearsurge shocking us hoham of hebron cried out mocking us nay what need of the warswords plying out of the desert the dust comes flying a little red dust if the wind be blowing who shall reck of its coming or going back the deliverer spake as a clarion mock at thy slaves thou eater of carrion laughest thou at us in thy kingly clowning we that laughed upon ramases frowning we that stood up proud unpardoned when his face was dark and his heart was hardened pharaoh we knew and his steeds not faster than the word of the lord in thine ear o master  sheer through the turban his wantons wove him clean to the skull the deliverer clove him and the two hosts reeled at the sign appalling as the great king fell like a great house falling  loudly we shouted and living and dying bore them all backward with strength and strong crying and caleb struck zedek hard at the throat and japhia of lachish zebulon smote the warswords and axes were clashing and groaning the fallen were fighting and foaming and moaning the warspears were breaking the warhorns were braying ere the hands of the slayers were sated with slaying and deep in the grasses grown gory and sodden the treaders of all men were trampled and trodden and over them routed and reeled like cattle high over the turn of the tide of the battle high over noises that deafen and cover us rang the deliverers voice out over us  stand thou still thou sun upon gibeon stand thou moon in the valley of ajalon shout thou people a cry like thunder for the kings of the earth are broken asunder now we have said as the thunder says it something is stronger than strength and slays it now we have written for all time later five kings are great yet a law is greater stare o sun in thine own great glory this is the turn of the whole worlds story stand thou still thou sun upon gibeon stand thou moon in the valley of ajalon  smite amid spearblades blazing and breaking more than we know of is rising and making stab with the javelin crash with the car cry for we know not the thing that we are stand o sun that in horrible patience smiled on the smoke and the slaughter of nations thou shalt grow sad for a little crying thou shalt be darkened for one mans dying stand thou still thou sun upon gibeon stand thou moon in the valley of ajalon  after the battle was broken and spent up to the hill the deliverer went flung up his arms to the stormclouds flying and cried unto israel mightily crying come up o warriors come up o brothers tribesmen and herdsmen maidens and mothers the bondmans son and the bondmans daughter the hewer of wood and the drawer of water he that carries and he that brings and set your foot on the neck of kings  this is the story of gibeon fight where we smote the lords of the amorite where the banners of princes with slaughter were sodden and the beards of seers in the rank grass trodden where the trees were wrecked by the wreck of cars and the reek of the red field blotted the stars where the dead heads dropped from the swords that sever because his mercy endureth for ever     vulgarised  all round they murmur o profane   keep thy hearts secret hid as gold but i by god would sooner be   some knight in shattering wars of old  in brown outlandish arms to ride   and shout my love to every star with lungs to make a poor maids name   deafen the iron ears of war  here where these subtle cowards crowd   to stand and so to speak of love that the four corners of the world   should hear it and take heed thereof  that to this shrine obscure there be   one witness before all men given as naked as the hanging christ   as shameless as the sun in heaven  these whimperershave they spared to us   one dripping woe one reeking sin these thieves that shatter their own graves   to prove the soul is dead within  they talk by god is it not time   some of loves chosen broke the girth and told the good all men have known   since the first morning of the earth     the ballad of godmakers  a bird flew out at the break of day   from the nest where it had curled and ere the eve the bird had set   fear on the kings of the world  the first tree it lit upon   was green with leaves unshed the second tree it lit upon   was red with apples red  the third tree it lit upon   was barren and was brown save for a dead man nailed thereon   on a hill above a town  that right the kings of the earth were gay   and filled the cup and can last night the kings of the earth were chill   for dread of a naked man  if he speak two more words they said   the slave is more than the free if he speak three more words they said   the stars are under the sea  said the king of the east to the king of the west   i wot his frown was set lo let us slay him and make him as dung   it is well that the world forget  said the king of the west to the king of the east   i wot his smile was dread nay let us slay him and make him a god   it is well that our god be dead  they set the young man on a hill   they nailed him to a rod and there in darkness and in blood   they made themselves a god  and the mightiest word was left unsaid   and the world had never a mark and the strongest man of the sons of men   went dumb into the dark  then hymns and harps of praise they brought   incense and gold and myrrh and they thronged above the seraphim   the poor dead carpenter  thou art the prince of all they sang   ocean and earth and air then the bird flew on to the cruel cross   and hid in the dead mans hair  thou art the sun of the world they cried   speak if our prayers be heard and the brown bird stirred in the dead mans hair   and it seemed that the dead man stirred  then a shriek went up like the worlds last cry   from all nations under heaven and a master fell before a slave   and begged to be forgiven  they cowered for dread in his wakened eyes   the ancient wrath to see and the bird flew out of the dead christs hair   and lit on a lemontree     at night  how many million stars there be that only god hath numberéd but this one only chosen for me in time before her face was fled shall not one mortal man alive     hold up his head     the woodcutter  we came behind him by the wall   my brethren drew their brands and they had strength to strike him down   and i to bind his hands  only once to a lantern gleam   he turned his face from the wall and it was as the accusing angels face   on the day when the stars shall fall  i grasped the axe with shaking hands   i stared at the grass i trod for i feared to see the whole bare heavens   filled with the face of god  i struck the serpentine slow blood   in four arms soaked the moss before me by the living christ   the blood ran in a cross  therefore i toil in forests here   and pile the wood in stacks and take no fee from the shivering folk   till i have cleansed the axe  but for a curse god cleared my sight   and where each tree doth grow i see a life with awful eyes   and i must lay it low     art colours  on must we go we search dead leaves   we chase the sunsets saddest flames the nameless hues that oer and oer   in lawless wedding lost their names  god of the daybreak better be   black savages and grin to gird our limbs in gaudy rags of red   the laughingstock of brute and bird  and feel again the fierce old feast   blue for seven heavens that had sufficed a gold like shining hoards a red   like roses from the blood of christ     the two women  lo very fair is she who knows the ways   of joy in pleasures mocking wisdom old the eyes that might be cold to flattery kind   the hair that might be grey with knowledge gold  but thou art more than these things o my queen   for thou art clad in ancient wars and tears and looking forth framed in the crown of thorns   i saw the youngest face in all the spheres     the wild knight  the wasting thistle whitens on my crest the barren grasses blow upon my spear a green pale pennon blazon of wild faith and love of fruitless things yea of my love among the golden loves of all the knights alone most hopeless sweet and blasphemous the love of god         i hear the crumbling creeds like cliffs washed down by water change and pass i hear a noise of words age after age a new cold wind that blows across the plains and all the shrines stand empty and to me all these are nothing priests and schools may doubt who never have believed but i have loved ah friends i know it passing well the love wherewith i love it shall not bring to me return or hire or any pleasant thing ay i have tried it ay i know its roots earthquake and plague have burst on it in vain and rolled back shattered         babbling neophytes blind startled foolsthink you i know it not think you to teach me  know i not his ways strangevisaged blunders mystic cruelties all all i know him for i love him go  so with the wan waste grasses on my spear i ride for ever seeking after god my hair grows whiter than my thistle plume and all my limbs are loose but in my eyes the star of an unconquerable praise for in my soul one hope for ever sings that at the next white corner of a road my eyes may look on him         hushi shall know the place when it is found a twisted path under a twisted peartreethis i saw in the first dream i had ere i was born wherein he spoke         but the grey clouds come down in hail upon the icy plains i ride burning for ever in consuming fire     the wild knight  a dark manorhouse shuttered and unlighted outlined against a pale sunset in front a large but neglected garden to the right in the foreground the porch of a chapel with coloured windows lighted hymns within  above the porch a grotesque carved bracket supporting a lantern astride of it sits captain redfeather a flagon in his hand  redfeather  i have drunk to all i know of to every leaf on the tree to the highest bird of the heavens to the lowest fish of the sea what toast what toast remaineth drunk down in the same good wine by the tipplers cup in the tavern and the priests cup

grass so green and wine so red is not so black as you have painted him  drinks  priest  blaspheming profligate  redfeather hurls the flagon among them            howl ye dumb dogs i named your kinglet me have one great shout flutter the seraphim like startled birds make god recall the good days of his youth ere saints had saddened him when he came back conqueror of chaos in a six days war with all the sons of god shouting for joy   priest  and youwhat is your right and who are you to praise god  redfeather          a lost soul in earth or heaven what has a better right  priest          go pagan

     the godless world be thanked there is no god to spy on me catch me and crown me with a vulgar crown for what i do if i should once believe the horror of that ancient eavesdropper behind the starry arras of the skies i shouldwell well enough of menaces should not do the thing i come to do what do i come to do let me but try to spell it to my soul             suppose a man perfectly free and utterly alone free of all love of law equally free of all the love of mutiny it breeds free of the love of heaven and also free of all the love of hell it drives us to not merely void of rules unconscious of them so strong that naught alive could do him hurt so wise that he knew all things and so great that none knew what he was or what he did a lawless giant  a pause then in a low voice          would he not be good hate is the weakness of a thwarted thing pride is the weakness of a thing unpraised but he this man he would be like a child girt with the tomes of some vast library who reads romance after romance and smiles when every tale ends well impersonal as god he growsmelted in suns and stars so would this boundless man whom none could spy taunt him with virtue censure him with vice rejoice in all mens joys with golden pen write all the live romances of the earth to a triumphant close             alone and free in this grey cool clean garden washed with winds what do i come to do among the grass the daisies and the dews an awful thing to prove i am that man             that while these saints taunt me with trembling dare me to revenge i breathe an upper air of ancient good and strong eternal laughter send my sun and rain upon the evil and the just turn my left cheek unto the smiter he that told me sword in hand that i had fallen lower than anger knew not i had risen higher than pride             enough the deeds are mine  takes out the titledeeds  i come to write the end of a romance a good romance the characterslord orm type of the starvéd heart and storéd brain who strives to hate and cannot fronting him redfeather rake in process of reform at root a poet i have hopes of him he can love virtue for he still loves vice he is not all burnt out he beats me there how i beat him in owning it in love he is still young and has the joy of shame and for the lady olivewho shall speak a man may weigh the courage of a man but if there be a bottomless abyss it is a womans valour such as i can only bow the knee and hide the face thank god there is no god to spy on me and bring his curséd crowns             no there is none the old incurable hunger of the world surges in wolfish wars age after age there was no god before me none sees where between the brutewomb and the deaf dead grave unhoping unrecorded unrepaid i make with smoke fire and burntoffering this sacrifice to chaos lights the papers none behold me write in fire the end of the romance burn i am god and crown myself with stars upon creation day before was night and chaos of a blind and cruel world i am the first god i will trample hell fight conquer make the story of the stars like this poor story end like a romance  the paper burns  before was brainless night but i am god

behold the daisy has a ring of red  that hour with half of blessing half of ban   a great voice went through heaven and earth and hell   crying we are tricked my great ones is it well now is the secret stolen by a man  then waxed i like the wind because of this   and ran like gospel and apocalypse   from door to door with new anarchic lips crying the very blasphemy of bliss  in the last wreck of nature dark and dread   shall in eclipses hideous hieroglyph   one wild form reel on the last rocking cliff and shout the daisy has a ring of red
