ezra pound somewhere he may be named only to be cursed as wanton and mocker poseur trifler and vagrant or he may be classed as filling a niche today like that of keats in a preceding epoch the point is he will be mentioned  this is a simple statement of fact but though mr pound is well known even having been the victim of interviews for sunday papers it does not follow that his work is thoroughly known there are twenty people who have their opinion of him for every one who has read his writings with any care of those twenty there will be some who are shocked some who are ruffled some who are irritated and one or two whose sense of dignity is outraged the twentyfirst critic will probably be one who knows and admires some of the poems but who either says pound is primarily a scholar a translator or pounds early verse was beautiful his later work shows nothing better than the itch for advertisement a mischievous desire to be annoying or a childish desire to be original there is a third type of reader rare enough who has perceived mr pound for some years who has followed his career intelligently and who recognizes its consistency  this essay is not written for the first twenty critics of literature nor for that rare twentysecond who has just been mentioned but for the admirer of a poem here or there whose appreciation is capable of yielding him a larger return if the reader is already at the stage where he can maintain at once the two propositions pound is merely a scholar and pound is merely a yellow journalist or the other two propositions pound is merely a technician and pound is merely a prophet of chaos then there is very little hope but there are readers of poetry who have not yet reached this hypertrophy of the logical faculty their attention might be arrested not by an outburst of praise but by a simple statement the present essay aims merely at such a statement it is not intended to be either a biographical or a critical study it will not dilate upon beauties it is a summary account of ten years work in poetry the citations from reviews will perhaps stimulate the reader to form his own opinion we do not wish to form it for him nor shall we enter into other phases of mr pounds activity during this ten years his writings and views on art and music though these would take an important place in any comprehensive biography    ii   pounds first book was published in venice venice was a halting point after he had left america and before he had settled in england and here in 1908 a lume spento appeared the volume is now a rarity of literature it was published by the author and made at a venetian press where the author was able personally to supervise the printing on paper which was a remainder of a supply which had been used for a history of the church pound left venice in the same year and took a lume spento with him to london it was not to be expected that a first book of verse published by an unknown american in venice should attract much attention the evening standard has the distinction of having noticed the volume in a review summing it up as      wild and haunting stuff absolutely poetic original     imaginative passionate and spiritual those who do not     consider it crazy may well consider it inspired coming     after the trite and decorous verse of most of our decorous     poets this poet seems like a minstrel of provençe at a     suburban musical evening the unseizable magic of poetry     is in the queer paper volume and words are no good in     describing it  as the chief poems in a lume spento were afterwards incorporated in personae the book demands mention only as a date in the authors history personae the first book published in london followed early in 1909 few poets have undertaken the siege of london with so little backing few books of verse have ever owed their success so purely to their own merits pound came to london a complete stranger without either literary patronage or financial means he took personae to mr elkin mathews who has the glory of having published yeats wind among the reeds and the books of the rhymers club in which many of the poets of the 90s now famous found a place mr mathews first suggested as was natural to an unknown author that the author should bear part of the cost of printing i have a shilling in my pocket if that is any use to you said the latter well said mr mathews i want to publish it anyway his acumen was justified the book was it is true received with opposition but it was received there were a few appreciative critics notably mr edward thomas the poet known also as edward eastaway he has since been killed in france thomas writing in the english review then in its brightest days under the editorship of ford madox hueffer recognized the firsthand intensity of feeling in personae      he has  hardly any of the superficial good qualities of     modern versifiers he has not the current melancholy or     resignation or unwillingness to live nor the kind of     feeling for nature which runs to minute description and     decorative metaphor he cannot be usefully compared with any     living writers full of personality and with such power     to express it that from the first to the last lines of most     of his poems he holds us steadily in his own pure grave     passionate world the beauty of it in praise of ysolt     is the beauty of passion sincerity and intensity not of     beautiful words and images and suggestions  the thought     dominates the words and is greater than they are here     idyll for glaucus the effect is full of human passion and     natural magic without any of the phrases which a reader of     modern verse would expect in the treatment of such a     subject  mr scott james in the daily news speaks in praise of his metres      at first the whole thing may seem to be mere madness and     rhetoric a vain exhibition of force and passion without     beauty but as we read on these curious metres of his seem     to have a law and order of their own the brute force of mr     pounds imagination seems to impart some quality of     infectious beauty to his words sometimes there is a strange     beating of anapaests when he quickens to his subject again     and again he unexpectedly ends a line with the second half     of a reverberant hexameter        flesh shrouded bearing the secret       and a few lines later comes an example of his favourite     use of spondee followed by dactyl and spondee which comes     in strangely and as we first read it with the appearance     of discord but afterwards seems to gain a curious and     distinctive vigour        eyes dreams lips and the night goes      another line like the end of a hexameter is        but if eer i come to my loves land  but even so favourable a critic pauses to remark that      he baffles us by archaic words and unfamiliar metres he     often seems to be scorning the limitations of form and     metre breaking out into any sort of expression which suits     itself to his mood  and counsels the poet to have a little more respect for his art  it is in fact just this adaptability of metre to mood an adaptability due to an intensive study of metre that constitutes an important element in pounds technique few readers were prepared to accept or follow the amount of erudition which entered into personae and its close successor exultations or to devote the care to reading them which they demand it is here that many have been led astray pound is not one of those poets who make no demand of the reader and the casual reader of verse disconcerted by the difference between pounds poetry and that on which his taste has been trained attributes his own difficulties to excessive scholarship on the part of the author this he will say of some of the poems in provençal form or on provençal subjects is archaeology it requires knowledge on the part of its reader and true poetry does not require such knowledge but to display knowledge is not the same thing as to expect it on the part of the reader and of this sort of pedantry pound is quite free he is it is true one of the most learned of poets in america he had taken up the study of romance languages with the intention of teaching after work in spain and italy after pursuing the provençal verb from milan to freiburg he deserted the thesis on lope de vega and the phd and the professorial chair and elected to remain in europe mr pound has spoken out his mind from time to time on the subject of scholarship in american universities its deadness its isolation from genuine appreciation and the active creative life of literature he has always been ready to battle against pedantry as for his own learning he has studied poetry carefully and has made use of his study in his own verse personae and exultations show his talent for turning his studies to account he was supersaturated in provençe he had tramped over most of the country and the life of the courts where the troubadours thronged was part of his own life to him yet though personae and exultations do exact something from the reader they do not require a knowledge of provençal or of spanish or italian very few people know the arthurian legends well or even malory if they did they might realize that the idylls of the king are hardly more important than a parody or a chaucer retold for children but no one accuses tennyson of needing footnotes or of superciliousness toward the uninstructed the difference is merely in what people are prepared for most readers could no more relate the myth of atys correctly than they could give a biography of bertrand de born it is hardly too much to say that there is no poem in these volumes of mr pound which needs fuller explanation than he gives himself what the poems do require is a trained ear or at least the willingness to be trained  the metres and the use of language are unfamiliar there are certain traces of modern influence we cannot agree with mr scottjames that among these are w e henley kipling chatterton and especially walt whitmanleast of all walt whitman probably there are only two yeats and browning yeats in la fraisne in personae for instance in the attitude and somewhat in the vocabulary    i wrapped my tears in an ellum leaf   and left them under a stone   and now men call me mad because i have thrown   all folly from me putting it aside   to leave the old barren ways of men   for browning mr pound has always professed strong admiration see mesmerism in personae there are traces of him in cino and famam librosque cano in the same volume but it is more profitable to comment upon the variety of metres and the original use of language  ezra pound has been fathered with vers libre in english with all its vices and virtues the term is a loose oneany verse is called free by people whose ears are not accustomed to itin the second place pounds use of this medium has shown the temperance of the artist and his belief in it as a vehicle is not that of the fanatic he has said himself that when one has the proper material for a sonnet one should use the sonnet form but that it happens very rarely to any poet to find himself in possession of just the block of stuff which can perfectly be modelled into the sonnet it is true that up to very recently it was impossible to get free verse printed in any periodical except those in which pound had influence and that now it is possible to print free verse second third or tenthrate in almost any american magazine who is responsible for the bad free verse is a question of no importance inasmuch as its authors would have written bad verse in any form pound has at least the right to be judged by the success or failure of his own pounds vers libre is such as is only possible for a poet who has worked tirelessly with rigid forms and different systems of metric his canzoni are in a way aside from his direct line of progress they are much more nearly studies in mediaeval appreciation than any of his other verse but they are interesting apart from their merit as showing the poet at work with the most intricate provençal formsso intricate that the pattern cannot be exhibited without quoting an entire poem m jean de bosschere whose french is translated in the egoist has already called attention to the fact that pound was the first writer in english to use five provençal forms quotation will show however the great variety of rhythm which pound manages to introduce into the ordinary iambic pentameter    thy gracious ways                     o lady of my heart have   oer all my thought their golden glamour cast   as amber torchflames where strange menatarms   tread softly neath the damask shield of night   rise from the flowing steel in part reflected   so on my mailed thought that with thee goeth   though dark the way a golden glamour falleth  within the iambic limits there are no two lines in the whole poem that have an identical rhythm  we turn from this to a poem in exultations the night litany    o god what great kindness             have we done in times past             and forgotten it   that thou givest this wonder unto us             o god of waters    o god of the night             what great sorrow   cometh unto us             that thou thus repayest us   before the time of its coming  there is evident and more strongly in certain later poems a tendency toward quantitative measure such a freedom as this lays so heavy a burden upon every word in a line that it becomes impossible to write like shelley leaving blanks for the adjectives or like swinburne whose adjectives are practically blanks other poets have manipulated a great variety of metres and forms but few have studied the forms and metres which they use so carefully as has pound his ballad of the goodly fere shows great knowledge of the ballad form    i ha seen him cow a thousand men   on the hills o galilee   they whined as he walked out calm between   wi his eyes like the grey o the sea    like the sea that brooks no voyaging   with the winds unleashed and free   like the sea that he cowed at genseret   wi twey words spoke suddently    a master of men was the goodly fere   a mate of the wind and sea   if they think they ha slain our goodly fere   they are fools eternally    i ha seen him eat o the honeycomb   sin they nailed him to the tree  and from this we turn to a very different form in the altaforte which is perhaps the best sestina that has been written in english    damn it all all this our south stinks peace   you whoreson dog papiols come lets to music   i have no life save when the swords clash   but ah when i see the standards gold vair purple opposing   and the broad fields beneath them turn crimson   then howl i my heart nigh mad with rejoicing    in hot summer have i great rejoicing   when the tempests kill the earths foul peace   and the lightnings from black heaven flash crimson   and the fierce thunders roar me their music   and the winds  shriek through the clouds mad opposing   and through all the riven skies gods swords clash  i have quoted two verses to show the intricacy of the pattern  the provençal canzon like the elizabethan lyric was written for music mr pound has more recently insisted in a series of articles on the work of arnold dolmetsch in the egoist on the importance of a study of music for the poet                                       such a relation between poetry and music is very different from what is called the music of shelley or swinburne a music often nearer to rhetoric or the art of the orator than to the instrument for poetry to approach the condition of music pound quotes approvingly the dictum of pater it is not necessary that poetry should be destitute of meaning instead of slightly veiled and resonant abstractions like    time with a gift of tears   grief with a glass that ran  of swinburne or the mossiness of mallarmé pounds verse is always definite and concrete because he has always a definite emotion behind it    though ive roamed through many places   none there is that my heart troweth   fair as that wherein fair groweth   one whose laud here interlaces   tuneful words that ive essayed   let this tune be gently played   which my voice herward upraises  at the end of this poem the author appends the note      the form and measure are those of piere vidals ab     lalen tir vas me laire the song is fit only to be     sung and is not to be spoken  there are here and there deliberate archaisms or oddities eg herward there are deliberately arbitrary images having their place in the total effect of the poem     red leaf that art blown upward and out and over   the green sheaf of the world     the lotos that pours   her fragrance into the purple cup     black lightning  in a more recent poem  but no word is ever chosen merely for the tinkle each has always its part in producing an impression which is produced always through language words are perhaps the hardest of all material of art for they must be used to express both visual beauty and beauty of sound as well as communicating a grammatical statement it would be interesting to compare pounds use of images with mallarmés i think it will be found that the formers by the contrast will appear always sharp in outline even if arbitrary and not photographic such images as those quoted above are as precise in their way as    sur le noel morte saison   lorsque les loups vivent de vent   and the rest of that memorable testament  so much for the imagery as to the freedom of his verse pound has made several statements in his articles on dolmetsch which are to the point      any work of art is a compound of freedom and order it is     perfectly obvious that art hangs between chaos on the one     side and mechanics on the other a pedantic insistence upon     detail tends to drive out major form a firm hold on major     form makes for a freedom of detail in painting men intent     on minutiae gradually lost the sense of form and form     combination an attempt to restore this sense is branded as     revolution it is revolution in the philological sense of     the term      art is a departure from fixed positions felicitous     departure from a norm  the freedom of pounds verse is rather a state of tension due to constant opposition between free and strict there are not as a matter of fact two kinds of verse the strict and the free there is only a mastery which comes of being so well trained that form is an instinct and can be adapted to the particular purpose in hand                                      after exultations came the translation of the sonnets and ballate of guido cavalcanti it is worth noting that the writer of a long review in the questspeaking in praise of the translation yet found fault with the author not on the ground of excessive mediaevalism but because      he is concerned rather with the future than with a somewhat     remote past so that in spite of his love for the mediaeval     poets his very accomplishment as a distinctly modern poet     makes against his success as a wholly acceptable translator     of cavalcanti the heir of the troubadours the scholastic  yet the daily news in criticising canzoni had remarked that mr pound      seems to us rather a scholar than a poet and we should like     to see him giving his unusual talent more to direct     translation from the provençal  and mr j c squire now the literary editor of the new statesman in an appreciative review in the new age had counselled the poet that he would      gain and not lose if he could forget all about the poets of     dantes day their roses and their flames their gold and     their falcons and their literary amorousness and walk out     of the library into the fresh air  in ripostes there are traces of a different idiom superficially the work may appear less important the diction is more restrained the flights shorter the dexterity of technique is less arresting by romantic readers the book would be considered less passionate but there is a much more solid substratum to this book there is more thought greater depth if less agitation on the surface the effect of london is apparent the author has become a critic of men surveying them from a consistent and developed point of view he is more formidable and disconcerting in short much more mature that he abandons nothing of his technical skill is evident from the translation from the anglosaxon the seafarer it is not a slight achievement to have brought to life alliterative verse perhaps the seafarer is the only successful piece of alliterative verse ever written in modern english alliterative verse which is not merely a clever tour de force but which suggests the possibility of a new development of this form mr richard aldington whose own accomplishments as a writer of vers libre qualify him to speak called the poem unsurpassed and unsurpassable and a writer in the new age a literary organ which has always been strongly opposed to metrical innovations called it one of the finest literary works of art produced in england during the last ten years and the rough stern beauty of the anglosaxon we may remark is at the opposite pole from that of the provençal and italian poets to whom pound had previously devoted his attention    may i for my own self songs truth reckon   journeys jargon how i in harsh days   hardship endured oft  but we can notice in ripostes other evidences than of versatility only certain poems show mr pound turning to more modern subjects as in the portrait dune femme or the mordant epigram an object many readers are apt to confuse the maturing of personality with desiccation of the emotions there is no desiccation in ripostes this should be evident to anyone who reads carefully such a poem as a girl we quote it entire without comment    the tree has entered my hands   the sap has ascended my arms   the tree has grown in my breast   downward   the branches grow out of me like arms    tree you are   moss you are   you are violets with wind above them   a childso highyou are   and all this is folly to the world  the return is an important study in verse which is really quantitative we quote only a few lines    see they return ah see the tentative   movements and the slow feet   the trouble in the pace and the uncertain   wavering  ripostes belongs to the period when mr pound was being attacked because of his propaganda he became known as the inventor of imagism and later as the high priest of vorticism as a matter of fact the actual propaganda of mr pound has been very small in quantity the impression which his personality made however is suggested by the following note in punch which is always a pretty reliable barometer of the english middleclass grin      mr welkin mark exactly opposite long janes begs to     announce that he has secured for the english market the     palpitating works of the new montana usa poet mr     ezekiel ton who is the most remarkable thing in poetry     since robert browning mr ton who has left america to     reside for a while in london and impress his personality on     english editors publishers and readers is by far the     newest poet going whatever other advertisements may say he     has succeeded where all others have failed in evolving a     blend of the imagery of the unfettered west the vocabulary     of wardour street and the sinister abandon of borgiac     italy  in 1913 someone writing to the new york nation from the university of illinois illustrates the american more serious disapproval this writer begins by expressing his objections to the principle of futurism pound has perhaps done more than anyone to keep futurism out of england his antagonism to this movement was the first which was not due merely to unintelligent dislike for anything new and was due to his perception that futurism was incompatible with any principles of form in his own words futurism is accelerated impressionism the writer in the nation then goes on to analyze the modern hypertrophy of romanticism into    the exaggeration of the importance of a personal emotion   the abandonment of all standards of form   the suppression of all evidence that a particular composition   is animated by any directing intelligence  as for the first point here are mr pounds words in answer to the question do you agree that the great poet is never emotional      yes absolutely if by emotion is meant that he is at the     mercy of every passing mood the only kind of emotion     worthy of a poet is the inspirational emotion which     energises and strengthens and which is very remote from the     everyday emotion of sloppiness and sentiment  and as for the platform of imagism here are a few of pounds donts for imagists      pay no attention to the criticisms of men who have never     themselves written a notable work      use no superfluous word and no adjective which does not     reveal something      go in fear of abstractions dont retail in mediocre verse     what has already been done in good prose      dont imagine that the art of poetry is any simpler than the     art of music or that you can please the expert before you     have spent at least as much effort on the art of verse as     the average piano teacher spends on the art of music      be influenced by as many great artists as you can but have     the decency either to acknowledge the debt outright or try     to conceal it      consider the definiteness of dantes presentation as     compared with miltons read as much of wordsworth as does     not seem to be unutterably dull      if you want the gist of the matter go to sappho catullus     villon when he is in the vein gautier when he is not too     frigid or if yon have not the tongues seek out the     leisurely chaucer      good prose will do you no harm there is good discipline to     be had by trying to write it translation is also good     training  the emphasis here is certainly on discipline and form the chicago tribune recognized this as sound sense adding      if this is imagism  we are for establishing imagism by     constitutional amendment and imprisoning without recourse to     ink or paper all literary ladies or gents who break any of     these canons  but other reviewers were less approving while the writer in the nation quoted above dreads the anarchy impending mr william archer was terrified at the prospect of hieratic formalisation mr archer believes in the simple untaught muse      mr pounds commandments tend too much to make of poetry a     learned selfconscious craft to be cultivated by a guild     of adepts from whose austere laboratories spontaneity and     simplicity are excluded a great deal of the best poetry     in the world has very little technical study behind it     there are scores and hundreds of people in england who could     write this simple metre ie of a shropshire lad     successfully  to be hanged for a cat and drowned for a rat is perhaps sufficient exculpation  probably mr pound has won odium not so much by his theories as by his unstinted praise of certain contemporary authors whose work he has liked such expressions of approval are usually taken as a grievancemuch more so than any personal abuse which is comparatively a complimentby the writers who escape his mention he does not say a b and c are bad poets or novelists but when he says the work of x y and z is in such and such respects the most important work in verse or prose since so and so then a b and c are aggrieved also pound has frequently expressed disapproval of milton and wordsworth  after ripostes mr pounds idiom has advanced still farther inasmuch as cathay the volume of translations from the chinese appeared prior to lustra it is sometimes thought that his newer idiom is due to the chinese influence this is almost the reverse of the truth the late ernest fenollosa left a quantity of manuscripts including a great number of rough translations literally exact from the chinese after certain poems subsequently incorporated in lustra had appeared in poetry mrs fenollosa recognized that in pound the chinese manuscripts would find the interpreter whom her husband would have wished she accordingly forwarded the papers for him to do as he liked with it is thus due to mrs fenollosas acumen that we have cathay it is not as a consequence of cathay that we have lustra this fact must be borne in mind  poems afterward embodied in lustra appeared in poetry in april 1913 under the title of contemporanea they included among others tenzone the condolence the garret salutation the second and dance figure  there are influences but deviously it is rather a gradual development of experience into which literary experiences have entered these have not brought the bondage of temporary enthusiasms but have liberated the poet from his former restricted sphere there is catullus and martial gautier laforgue and tristan corbière whitman is certainly not an influence there is not a trace of him anywhere whitman and mr pound are antipodean to each other of contemporanea the chicago evening post discriminatingly observed      your poems in the april poetry are so mockingly so     delicately so unblushingly beautiful that you seem to have     brought back into the world a grace which probably never     existed but which we discover by an imaginative process in     horace and catullus  it was a true insight to ally pound to the latin not to the greek poets  certain of the poems in lustra have offended admirers of the verse of the personae period when a poet alters or develops many of his admirers are sure to drop off any poet if he is to survive as a writer beyond his twentyfifth year must alter he must seek new literary influences he will have different emotions to express this is disconcerting to that public which likes a poet to spin his whole work out of the feelings of his youth which likes to be able to open a new volume of his poems with the assurance that they will be able to approach it exactly as they approached the preceding they do not like that constant readjustment which the following of mr pounds work demands thus has lustra been a disappointment to some though it manifests no falling off in technique and no impoverishment of feeling some of the poems including several of the contemporanea are a more direct statement of views than pounds verse had ever given before of these poems m jean de bosschère writes      everywhere his poems incite man to exist to profess a     becoming egotism without which there can be no real     altruism        i beseech you enter your life       i beseech you learn to say i       when i question you       for you are no part but a whole       no portion but a being       one must be capable of reacting to stimuli for a moment     as a real live person even in face of as much of ones own     powers as are arrayed against one the virile complaint     the revolt of the poet all which shows his emotionthat     is poetry        speak against unconscious oppression       speak against the tyranny of the unimaginative       speak against bonds          be against all forms of oppression         go out and defy opinion      this is the old cry of the poet but more precise as an     expression of frank disgust        go to the adolescent who are smothered in family       o how hideous it is       to see three generations of one house gathered together       it is like an old tree without shoots       and with some branches rotted and falling      each poem holds out these cries of revolt or disgust but     they are the result of his still hoping and feeling      let us take arms against this sea of stupidities pound      has experience of the folly of the philistines who read his     verse real pain is born of this stupid interpretation and     one does not realize how deep it is unless one can feel     through the ejaculations and the laughter what has caused     these wounds which are made deeper by what he knows and     what he has lost      the tone which is at once jocund and keen is one of     pounds qualities ovid catullushe does not disown them     he only uses these accents for his familiars with the     others he is on the edge of paradox pamphleteering indeed     of abuse  this is the proper approach to the poems at the beginning of lustra and to the short epigrams which some readers find pointless or certainly not poetry they should read then the dance figure or near périgord and remember that all these poems come out of the same man    thine arms are as a young sapling under the bark   thy face as a river with lights    white as an almond are thy shoulders   as new almonds stripped from the husk  or the ending of near périgord    bewildering spring and by the auvezère   poppies and dayseyes in the green émail   rose over us and we knew all that stream   and our two horses had traced out the valleys   knew the low flooded lands squared out with poplars   in the young days when the deep sky befriended   and great wings beat above us in the twilight   and the great wheels in heaven   bore us together  surging  and apart    believing we should meet with lips and hands     there shut up in his castle tairirans   she who had nor ears nor tongue save in her hands   gone ah goneuntouched unreachable   she who could never live save through one person   she who could never speak save to one person   and all the rest of her a shifting change   a broken bundle of mirrors   then turn at once to to a friend writing on cabaret dancers  it is easy to say that the language of cathay is due to the chinese if one looks carefully at 1 pounds other verse 2 other peoples translations from the chinese eg giless it is evident that this is not the case the language was ready for the chinese poetry compare for instance a passage from provincia deserta    i have walked                into périgord   i have seen the torchflames highleaping   painting the front of that church   and under the dark whirling laughter   i have looked back over the stream                and seen the high building   seen the long minarets the white shafts   i have gone in ribeyrac                and in sarlat   i have climbed rickety stairs heard talk of croy   walked over en bertrans old layout   have seen narbonne and cahors and chalus   have seen excideuil carefully fashioned  with a passage from the river song    he goes out to hori to look at the wingflapping storks   he returns by way of sei rock to hear the new nightingales   for the gardens at jorun are full of new nightingales   their sound is mixed in this flute   their voice is in the twelve pipes here  it matters very little how much is due to rihaku and how much to pound mr ford madox hueffer has observed if these are original verses then mr pound is the greatest poet of this day he goes on to say      the poems in cathay are things of a supreme beauty what     poetry should be that they are and if a new breath of     imagery and handling can do anything for our poetry that     new breath these poems bring      poetry consists in so rendering concrete objects that the     emotions produced by the objects shall arise in the     reader      where have you better rendered or more permanently     beautiful a rendering of the feelings of one of those     lonely watchers in the outposts of progress whether it be     ovid in hyrcania a roman sentinel upon the great wall of     this country or merely ourselves in the lonely recesses of     our minds than the lament of the frontier guard      beauty is a very valuable thing perhaps it is the most     valuable thing in life but the power to express emotion so     that it shall communicate itself intact and exactly is     almost more valuable of both these qualities mr pounds     book is very full therefore i think we may say that this     is much the best work he has done for however closely he     may have followed his originalsand of that most of us have     no means of judgingthere is certainly a good deal of mr     pound in this little volume  cathay and lustra were followed by the translations of noh plays the noh are not so important as the chinese poems certainly not so important for english the attitude is less unusual to us the work is not so solid so firm cathay will i believe rank with the seafarer in the future among mr pounds original work the noh will rank among his translations it is rather a dessert after cathay there are however passages which as pound has handled them are different both from the chinese and from anything existent in english there is for example the fine speech of the old kagekiyo as he thinks of his youthful valour      he thought how easy this killing he rushed with his     spearshaft gripped under his arm he cried out i am     kagekiyo of the heike he rushed on to take them he     pierced through the helmet vizards of miyanoya miyanoya     fled twice and again and kagekiyo cried you shall not     escape me he leaped and wrenched off his helmet eya     the vizard broke and remained in his hand and miyanoya     still fled afar and afar and he looked back crying in     terror how terrible how heavy your arm and kagekiyo     called at him how tough the shaft of your neck is and     they both laughed out over the battle and went off each his     own way  the times literary supplement spoke of mr pounds mastery of beautiful diction and his cunningly rhythmically prose in its review of the noh  even since lustra mr pound has moved again this move is to the epic of which three cantos appear in the american lustra they have already appeared in poetrymiss monroe deserves great honour for her courage in printing an epic poem in this twentieth centurybut the version in lustra is revised and is improved by revision we will leave it as a test when anyone has studied mr pounds poems in chronological order and has mastered lustra and cathay he is prepared for the cantos but not till then if the reader then fails to like them he has probably omitted some step in his progress and had better go back and retrace the journey     bibliography of
