halfhour and was now nearly full in many ways the strollers though not the most magnificent is the pleasantest club in new york its ideals are comfort without pomp and it is given over after eleven oclock at night mainly to the stage everybody is young cleanshaven and full of conversation and the conversation strikes a purely professional note  everybody in the room on this july night had come from the theater most of those present had been acting but a certain number had been to the opening performance of the latest betterthanraffles play there had been something of a boom that season in dramas whose heroes appealed to the public more pleasantly across the footlights than they might have done in real life in the play that had opened tonight arthur mifflin an exemplary young man off the stage had been warmly applauded for a series of actions which performed anywhere except in the theater would certainly have debarred him from remaining a member of the strollers or any other club in faultless evening dress with a debonair smile on his face he had broken open a safe stolen bonds and jewelry to a large amount and escaped without a blush of shame via the window he had foiled a detective through four acts and held up a band of pursuers with a revolver a large audience had intimated complete approval throughout  its a hit all right said somebody through the smoke  these nearraffles plays always are grumbled willett who played bluff fathers in musical comedy a few years ago they would have been scared to death of putting on a show with a crook as hero now it seems to me the public doesnt want anything else not that they know what they do want he concluded mournfully  the belle of boulogne in which willett sustained the role of cyrus k higgs a chicago millionaire was slowly fading away on a diet of paper and this possibly prejudiced him  raikes the character actor changed the subject if willett once got started on the wrongs of the illfated belle general conversation would become impossible willett denouncing the stupidity of the public as purely a monologue artiste  i saw jimmy pitt at the show said raikes everybody displayed interest  jimmy pitt when did he come back i thought he was in italy  he came on the lusitania i suppose she docked this morning  jimmy pitt said sutton of the majestic theater how long has he been away last i saw of him was at the opening of the outsider at the astor thats a couple of months ago  hes been traveling in europe i believe said raikes lucky beggar to be able to i wish i could  sutton knocked the ash off his cigar  i envy jimmy he said i dont know anyone id rather be hes got much more money than any man except a professional plute has any right to hes as strong as an ox i shouldnt say hed ever had anything worse than measles in his life hes got no relations and he isnt married  sutton who had been married three times spoke with some feeling  hes a good chap jimmy said raikes  yes said arthur mifflin yes jimmy is a good chap ive known him for years i was at college with him he hasnt got my brilliance of intellect but he has some wonderfully fine qualities for one thing i should say he had put more deadbeats on their legs again than half the men in new york put together  well growled willett whom the misfortunes of the belle had soured whats there in that its mighty easy to do the philanthropist act when youre next door to a millionaire  yes said mifflin warmly but its not so easy when youre getting thirty dollars a week on a newspaper when jimmy was a reporter on the news there used to be a whole crowd of fellows just living on him not borrowing an occasional dollar mind you but living on himsleeping on his sofa and staying to breakfast it made me mad i used to ask him why he stood for it he said there was nowhere else for them to go and he thought he could see them through all rightwhich he did though i dont see how he managed it on thirty a week  if a mans fool enough to be an easy mark began willett  oh cut it out said raikes we dont want anybody knocking jimmy here  all the same said sutton it seems to me that it was mighty lucky that he came into that money you cant keep open house for ever on thirty a week by the way arthur how was that i heard it was his uncle  it wasnt his uncle said mifflin it was by way of being a romance of sorts i believe fellow who had been in love with jimmys mother years ago went west made a pile and left it to mrs pitt or her children she had been dead some time when that happened jimmy of course hadnt a notion of what was coming to him when suddenly he got a solicitors letter asking him to call he rolled round and found that there was about five hundred thousand dollars just waiting for him to spend it  jimmy pitt had now definitely ousted love the cracksman as a topic of conversation everybody present knew him most of them had known him in his newspaper days and though every man there would have perished rather than admit it they were grateful to jimmy for being exactly the same to them now that he could sign a check for half a million as he had been on the old thirtyaweek basis inherited wealth of course does not make a young man nobler or more admirable but the young man does not always know this  jimmys had a queer life said mifflin hes been pretty much everything in his time did you know he was on the stage before he took up newspaperwork only on the road i believe he got tired of it and cut it out thats always been his trouble he wouldnt settle down to anything he studied law at yale but he never kept it up after he left the stage he moved all over the states without a cent picking up any odd job he could get he was a waiter once for a couple of days but they fired him for breaking plates then he got a job in a jewelers shop i believe hes a bit of an expert on jewels and another time he made a hundred dollars by staying three rounds against kid brady when the kid was touring the country after he got the championship away from jimmy garwin the kid was offering a hundred to anyone who could last three rounds with him jimmy did it on his head he was the best amateur of his weight i ever saw the kid wanted him to take up scrapping seriously but jimmy wouldnt have stuck to anything long enough in those days hes one of the gypsies of the world he was never really happy unless he was on the move and he doesnt seem to have altered since he came into his money  well he can afford to keep on the move now said raikes i wish i  did you ever hear about jimmy and mifflin was beginning when the odyssey of jimmy pitt was interrupted by the opening of the door and the entrance of ulysses in person  jimmy pitt was a young man of medium height whose great breadth and depth of chest made him look shorter than he really was his jaw was square and protruded slightly and this combined with a certain athletic jauntiness of carriage and a pair of piercing brown eyes very much like those of a bullterrier gave him an air of aggressiveness which belied his character he was not aggressive he had the goodnature as well as the eyes of a bullterrier also he possessed when stirred all the bullterriers dogged determination  there were shouts of welcome  hullo jimmy  when did you get back  come and sit down plenty of room over here  where is my wandering boy tonight  waiter whats yours jimmy  jimmy dropped into a seat and yawned  well he said how goes it hullo raikes werent you at love the cracksman i thought i saw you hullo arthur congratulate you you spoke your piece nicely  thanks said mifflin we were just talking about you jimmy you came on the lusitania i suppose  she didnt break the record this time said sutton  a somewhat pensive look came into jimmys eyes  she came much too quick for me he said i dont see why they want to rip along at that pace he went on hurriedly i like to have a chance of enjoying the seaair  i know that seaair murmured mifflin  jimmy looked up quickly  what are you babbling about arthur  i said nothing replied mifflin suavely  what did you think of the show tonight jimmy asked raikes  i liked it arthur was fine i cant make out though why all this incense is being burned at the feet of the cracksman to judge by some of the plays they produce now youd think that a man had only to be a successful burglar to become a national hero one of these days we shall have arthur playing charles peace to a cheering house  it is the tribute said mifflin that boneheadedness pays to brains it takes brains to be a successful cracksman unless the gray matter is surging about in your cerebrum as in mine you cant hope  jimmy leaned back in his chair and spoke calmly but with decision  any man of ordinary intelligence he said could break into a house  mifflin jumped up and began to gesticulate this was heresy  my good man what absolute  i could said jimmy lighting a cigarette  there was a roar of laughter and approval for the past few weeks during the rehearsals of love the cracksman arthur mifflin had disturbed the peace at the strollers with his theories on the art of burglary this was his first really big part and he had soaked himself in it he had read up the literature of burglary he had talked with men from pinkertons he had expounded his views nightly to his brother strollers preaching the delicacy and difficulty of cracking a crib till his audience had rebelled it charmed the strollers to find jimmy obviously of his own initiative and not to be suspected of having been suborned to the task by themselves treading with a firm foot on the experts favorite corn within five minutes of their meeting  you said arthur mifflin with scorn  i  you why you couldnt break into an egg unless it was a poached one  whatll you bet said jimmy  the strollers began to sit up and take notice the magic word bet when uttered in that room had rarely failed to add a zest to life they looked expectantly at arthur mifflin  go to bed jimmy said the portrayer of cracksmen ill come with you and tuck you in a nice strong cup of tea in the morning and you wont know there has ever been anything the matter with you  a howl of disapproval rose from the company indignant voices accused arthur mifflin of having a yellow streak encouraging voices urged him not to be a quitter  see they scorn you said jimmy and rightly be a man arthur whatll you bet  mr mifflin regarded him with pity  you dont know what youre up against jimmy he said youre half a century behind the times you have an idea that all a burglar needs is a mask a blue chin and a dark lantern i tell you he requires a highly specialized education ive been talking to these detective fellows and i know now take your case you worm have you a thorough knowledge of chemistry physics toxicology  sure  electricity and microscopy  you have discovered my secret  can you use an oxyacetylene blowpipe  i never travel without one  what do you know about the administration of anaesthetics  practically everything it is one of my favorite hobbies  can you make soup  soup  soup said mr mifflin firmly  jimmy raised his eyebrows  does an architect make bricks he said i leave the rough preliminary work to my corps of assistants they make my soup  you mustnt think jimmys one of your common yeggs said sutton hes at the top of his profession thats how he made his money i never did believe that legacy story  jimmy said mr mifflin couldnt crack a childs moneybox jimmy couldnt open a sardinetin  jimmy shrugged his shoulders  whatll you bet he said again come on arthur youre earning a very good salary whatll you bet  make it a dinner for all present suggested raikes a canny person who believed in turning the wayside happenings of life when possible to his personal profit  the suggestion was well received  all right said mifflin how many of us are there one two three fourloser buys a dinner for twelve  a good dinner interpolated raikes softly  a good dinner said jimmy very well how long do you give me arthur  how long do you want  there ought to be a timelimit said raikes it seems to me that a flyer like jimmy ought to be able to manage it at short notice why not tonight nice fine night if jimmy doesnt crack a crib tonight its up to him that suit you jimmy  perfectly  willett interposed willett had been endeavoring to drown his sorrows all the evening and the fact was a little noticeable in his speech  see here he said hows jjimmy going to prove hes done it  personally i can take his word said mifflin  that be hhanged for a tale whawhats to prevent him saying hes done it whether he has or not  the strollers looked uncomfortable nevertheless it was jimmys affair  why youd get your dinner in any case said jimmy a dinner from any host would smell as sweet  willett persisted with muddled obstinacy  thashthash not point its principle of thing have thish thing square and bove board i say thash what i say  and very creditable to you being able to say it said jimmy cordially see if you can manage truly rural  what i say isthis jimmys a fakir and what i say is whats prevent him saying hes done it when hasnt done it  thatll be all right said jimmy im going to bury a brass tube with the stars and stripes in it under the carpet  willett waved his hand  thash quite shfactory he said with dignity nothing more to say  or a better idea said jimmy ill carve a big j on the inside of the front door then anybody who likes can make inquiries next day well im off home glad its all settled anybody coming my way  yes said arthur mifflin well walk first nights always make me as jumpy as a cat if i dont walk my legs off i shant get to sleep tonight at all  if you think im going to help you walk your legs off my lad youre mistaken i propose to stroll gently home and go to bed  every little helps said mifflin come along  you want to keep an eye on jimmy arthur said sutton hell sandbag you and lift your watch as soon as look at you i believe hes arsene lupin in disguise     chapter ii  pyramus and thisbe   the two men turned up the street they walked in silence arthur mifflin was going over in his mind such outstanding events of the evening as he rememberedthe nervousness the relief of finding that he was gripping his audience the growing conviction that he had made good while jimmy seemed to be thinking his own private thoughts they had gone some distance before either spoke  who is she jimmy asked mifflin  jimmy came out of his thoughts with a start  whats that  who is she  i dont know what you mean  yes you do the sea air who is she  i dont know said jimmy simply  you dont know well whats her name  i dont know  doesnt the lusitania still print a passengerlist  she does  and you couldnt find out her name in five days  no  and thats the man who thinks he can burgle a house said mifflin despairingly  they had arrived now at the building on the second floor of which was jimmys flat  coming in said jimmy  well i was rather thinking of pushing on as far as the park i tell you i feel all on wires  come in and smoke a cigar youve got all night before you if you want to do marathons i havent seen you for a couple of months i want you to tell me all the news  there isnt any nothing happens in new york the papers say things do but they dont however ill come in it seems to me that youre the man with the news  jimmy fumbled with his latchkey  youre a bright sort of burglar said mifflin disparagingly why dont you use your oxyacetylene blowpipe do you realize my boy that youve let yourself in for buying a dinner for twelve hungry men next week in the cold light of the morning when reason returns to her throne thatll come home to you  i havent done anything of the sort said jimmy unlocking the door  dont tell me you really mean to try it  what else did you think i was going to do  but you cant you would get caught for a certainty and what are you going to do then say it was all a joke suppose they fill you full of bulletholes nice sort of fool youll look appealing to some outraged householders sense of humor while he pumps you full of lead with a colt  these are the risks of the profession you ought to know that arthur think what you went through tonight  arthur mifflin looked at his friend with some uneasiness he knew how very reckless jimmy could be when he had set his mind on accomplishing anything since under the stimulus of a challenge he ceased to be a reasoning being amenable to argument and in the present case he knew that willetts words had driven the challenge home jimmy was not the man to sit still under the charge of being a fakir no matter whether his accuser had been sober or drunk  jimmy meanwhile had produced whiskey and cigars now he was lying on his back on the lounge blowing smokerings at the ceiling  well said arthur mifflin at length  well what  what i meant was is this silence to be permanent or are you going to begin shortly to amuse elevate and instruct somethings happened to you jimmy there was a time when you were a bright little chap a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy where be your gibes now your gambols your songs your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table in a roar when you were paying for the dinner yon remind me more of a deafmute celebrating the fourth of july with noiseless powder than anything else on earth wake up or i shall go jimmy we were practically boys together tell me about this girlthe girl you loved and were idiot enough to lose  jimmy drew a deep breath  very well said mifflin complacently sigh if you like its better than nothing  jimmy sat up  yes dozens of times said mifflin  what do you mean  you were just going to ask me if i had ever been in love werent you  i wasnt because i know you havent you have no soul you dont know what love is  have it your own way said mifflin resignedly  jimmy bumped back on the sofa  i dont either he said thats the trouble  mifflin looked interested  i know he said youve got that strange premonitory fluttering when the heart seems to thrill within you like some baby bird singing its first song when  oh cut it out  when you ask yourself timidly is it can it really be and answer shyly no yes i believe it is ive been through it dozens of times it is a recognized early symptom unless prompt measures are taken it will develop into something acute in these matters stand on your uncle arthur he knows  you make me sick jimmy retorted  you have our ear said mifflin kindly tell me all  theres nothing to tell  dont lie james  well practically nothing  thats better  it was like this  good  jimmy wriggled himself into a more comfortable position and took a sip from his glass  i didnt see her until the second day out  i know that second day out well  we didnt really meet at all  just happened to be going to the same spot eh  as a matter of fact it was like this like a fool id bought a secondclass ticket  what our young rockerbilt astergould the boy millionaire traveling secondclass why  i had an idea it would be better fun everybodys so much more cheery in the second cabin you get to know people so much quicker nine trips out of ten id much rather go second  and this was the tenth  she was in the firstcabin said jimmy  mifflin clutched his forehead  wait he cried this reminds me of somethingsomething in shakespeare romeo and juliet no ive got itpyramus and thisbe  i dont see the slightest resemblance  read your midsummer nights dream pyramus and thisbe says the story did talk through the chink of a wall quoted mifflin  we didnt  dont be so literal you talked across a railing  we didnt  do you mean to say you didnt talk at all  we didnt say a single word  mifflin shook his head sadly  i give you up he said i thought you were a man of enterprise what did you do  jimmy sighed softly  i used to stand and smoke against the railing opposite the barbers shop and she used to walk round the deck  and you used to stare at her  i would look in her direction sometimes corrected jimmy with dignity  dont quibble you stared at her you behaved like a common rubberneck and you know it i am no prude james but i feel compelled to say that i consider your conduct that of a libertine used she to walk alone  generally  and now you love her eh you went on board that ship happy careless heartfree you came off it grave and saddened thenceforth for you the world could contain but onewoman and her you had lost  mifflin groaned in a hollow and bereaved manner and took a sip from his glass to buoy him up  jimmy moved restlessly on the sofa  do you believe in love at first sight he asked fatuously he was in the mood when a man says things the memory of which makes him wake up hot all over for nights to come  i dont see what first sights got to do with it said mifflin according to your own statement you stood and glared at the girl for five days without letting up for a moment i can quite imagine that you might glare yourself into love with anyone by the end of that time  i cant see myself settling down said jimmy thoughtfully and until you feel that you want to settle down i suppose you cant be really in love  i was saying practically that about you at the club just before you came in my somewhat neat expression was that you were one of the gypsies of the world  by george youre quite right  i always am  i suppose its having nothing to do when i was on the news i was never like this  you werent on the news long enough to get tired of it  i feel now i cant stay in a place more than a week its having this money that does it i suppose  new york said mifflin is full of obliging persons who will be delighted to relieve you of the incubus well james i shall leave you i feel more like bed now by the way i suppose you lost sight of this girl when you landed  yes  well there arent so many girls in the united statesonly twenty million or is it forty million something small all youve got to do is to search around a bit goodnight  goodnight  mr mifflin clattered down the stairs a minute later the sound of his name being called loudly from the street brought jimmy to the window mifflin was standing on the pavement below looking up  jimmy  whats the matter now  i forgot to ask was she a blonde  what  was she a blonde yelled mifflin  no snapped jimmy  dark eh bawled mifflin making night hideous  yes said jimmy shutting the window  jimmy  the window went up again  well  me for blondes  go to bed  very well goodnight  goodnight  jimmy withdrew his head and sat down in the chair mifflin had vacated a moment later he rose and switched off the light it was pleasanter to sit and think in the dark his thoughts wandered off in many channels but always came back to the girl on the lusitania it was absurd of course he didnt wonder that arthur mifflin had treated the thing as a joke good old arthur glad he had made a success but was it a joke who was it that said the point of a joke is like the point of a needle so small that it is apt to disappear entirely when directed straight at oneself if anybody else had told him such a limping romance he would have laughed himself only when you are the center of a romance however limping you see it from a different angle of course told badly it was absurd he could see that but something away at the back of his mind told him that it was not altogether absurd and yetlove didnt come like that in a flash you might just as well expect a house to spring into being in a moment or a ship or an automobile or a table or ahe sat up with a jerk in another instant he would have been asleep  he thought of bed but bed seemed a long way offthe deuce of a way acres of carpet to be crawled over and then the dickens of a climb at the end of it besides undressing nuisanceundressing that was a nice dress the girl had worn on the fourth day out tailormade he liked tailormades he liked all her dresses he liked her had she liked him so hard to tell if you dont get a chance of speaking she was dark arthur liked blondes arthur was a fool good old arthur glad he had made a success now he could marry if he liked if he wasnt so restless if he didnt feel that he couldnt stop more than a day in any place but would the girl have him if they had never spoken it made it so hard to  at this point jimmy went to sleep     chapter iii  mr mceachern   at about the time when jimmys meditations finally merged themselves in dreams a certain mr john mceachern captain of police was seated in the parlor of his uptown villa reading he was a man built on a large scale everything about him was largehis hands his feet his shoulders his chest and particularly his jaw which even in his moments of calm was aggressive and which stood out when anything happened to ruffle him like the ram of a battleship in his patrolman days which had been passed mainly on the east side this jaw of his had acquired a reputation from park row to fourteenth street no gangfight however absorbing could retain the undivided attention of the young blood of the bowery when mr mceacherns jaw hove in sight with the rest of his massive person in close attendance he was a man who knew no fear and he had gone through disorderly mobs like an east wind  but there was another side to his character in fact that other side was so large that the rest of him his readiness in combat and his zeal in breaking up public disturbances might be said to have been only an offshoot for his ambition was as large as his fist and as aggressive as his jaw he had entered the force with the single idea of becoming rich and had set about achieving his object with a strenuous vigor that was as irresistible as his mighty locuststick some policemen are born grafters some achieve graft and some have graft thrust upon them mr mceachern had begun by being the first had risen to the second and for some years now had been a prominent member of the small and hugely prosperous third class the class that does not go out seeking graft but sits at home and lets graft come to it  in his search for wealth he had been content to abide his time he did not want the trifling sum that every new york policeman acquires his object was something bigger and he was prepared to wait for it he knew that small beginnings were an annoying but unavoidable preliminary to all great fortunes probably captain kidd had started in a small way certainly mr rockefeller had he was content to follow in the footsteps of the masters  a patrolmans opportunities of amassing wealth are not great mr mceachern had made the best of a bad job he had not disdained the dollars that came as single spies rather than in battalions until the time should arrive when he might angle for whales he was prepared to catch sprats  much may be done even on a small scale by perseverance in those early days mr mceacherns observant eye had not failed to notice certain peddlers who obstructed the traffic divers tradesmen who did the same by the sidewalk and of restaurant keepers not a few with a distaste for closing at one oclock in the morning his researches in this field were not unprofitable in a reasonably short space of time he had put by the three thousand dollars that were the price of his promotion to detectivesergeant he did not like paying three thousand dollars for promotion but there must be sinking of capital if an investment is to prosper mr mceachern came across and climbed one more step up the ladder  as detectivesergeant he found his horizon enlarged there was more scope for a man of parts things moved more rapidly the world seemed full of philanthropists anxious to dress his front and do him other little kindnesses mr mceachern was no churl he let them dress his front he accepted the little kindnesses presently he found that he had fifteen thousand dollars to spare for any small flutter that might take his fancy singularly enough this was the precise sum necessary to make him a captain  he became a captain and it was then that he discovered that el dorado was no mere poets dream and that tom tiddlers ground where one might stand picking up gold and silver was as definite a locality as brooklyn or the bronx at last after years of patient waiting he stood like moses on the mountain looking down into the promised land he had come to where the big money was  the captain was now reading the little notebook wherein he kept a record of his investments which were numerous and varied that the contents were satisfactory was obvious at a glance the smile on his face and the reposeful position of his jaw were proof enough of that there were notes relating to houseproperty railroad shares and a dozen other profitable things he was a rich man  this was a fact that was entirely unsuspected by his neighbors with whom he maintained somewhat distant relations accepting no invitations and giving none for mr mceachern was playing a big game other eminent buccaneers in his walk of life had been content to be rich men in a community where moderate means were the rule but about mr mceachern there was a touch of the napoleonic he meant to get into societyand the society he had selected was that of england other people have noted the factwhich had impressed itself very firmly on the policemans mindthat between england and the united states there are three thousand miles of deep water in the united states he would be a retired policecaptain in england an american gentleman of large and independent means with a beautiful daughter  that was the ruling impulse in his lifehis daughter molly though if he had been a bachelor he certainly would not have been satisfied to pursue a humble career aloof from graft on the other hand if it had not been for molly he would not have felt as he gathered in his dishonest wealth that he was conducting a sort of holy war ever since his wife had died in his detectivesergeant days leaving him with a yearold daughter his ambitions had been inseparably connected with molly  all his thoughts were on the future this new york life was only a preparation for the splendors to come he spent not a dollar unnecessarily when molly was home from school they lived together simply and quietly in the small house which mollys taste made so comfortable the neighbors knowing his profession and seeing the modest scale on which he lived told one another that here at any rate was a policeman whose hands were clean of graft they did not know of the stream that poured week by week and year by year into his bank to be diverted at intervals into the most profitable channels until the time should come for the great change economy was his motto the expenses of his home were kept within the bounds of his official salary all extras went to swell his savings  he closed his book with a contented sigh and lighted another cigar cigars were his only personal luxury he drank nothing ate the simplest food and made a suit of clothes last for quite an unusual length of time but no passion for economy could make him deny himself smoke  he sat on thinking it was very late but he did not feel ready for bed a great moment had arrived in his affairs for days wall street had been undergoing one of its periodical fits of jumpiness there had been rumors and counterrumors until finally from the confusion there had soared up like a rocket the one particular stock in which he was most largely interested he had unloaded that morning and the result had left him slightly dizzy the main point to which his mind clung was that the time had come at last he could make the great change now at any moment that suited him  he was blowing clouds of smoke and gloating over this fact when the door opened admitting a bullterrier a bulldog and in the wake of the procession a girl in a kimono and red slippers     chapter iv  molly   why molly said the policeman what are you doing out of bed i thought you were asleep  he placed a huge arm around her and drew her to his lap as she sat there his great bulk made her seem smaller than she really was with her hair down and her little red slippers dangling half a yard from the floor she seemed a child mceachern looking at her found it hard to realize that nineteen years had passed since the moment when the doctors raised eyebrows had reproved him for his monosyllabic reception of the news that the baby was a girl  do you know what the time is he said two oclock  much too late for you to be sitting here smoking said molly severely how many cigars do you smoke a day suppose you had married someone who wouldnt let you smoke  never stop your husband smoking my dear thats a bit of advice for you when youre married  im never going to marry im going to stop at home and darn your socks  i wish you could he said drawing her closer to him but one of these days youre going to marry a prince and now run back to bed its much too late  its no good father dear i couldnt get to sleep ive been trying hard for hours ive counted sheep till i nearly screamed its rastus fault he snores so  mr mceachern regarded the erring bulldog sternly  why do you have the brutes in your room  why to keep the boogaboos from getting me of course arent you afraid of the boogaboos getting you but youre so big you wouldnt mind youd just hit them and theyre not brutesare you darlings youre angels and you nearly burst yourselves with joy because auntie had come back from england didnt you father did they miss me when i was gone did they pine away  they got like skeletons we all did  you  i should say so  then why did you send me away to england  i wanted you to see the country did you like it  i hated being away from you  but you liked the country  i loved it  mceachern drew a breath of relief the only possible obstacle to the great change did not exist  how would you like to go back to england molly  to england when ive just come home  if i went too  molly twisted around so that she could see his face better  theres something the matter with you father youre trying to say something and i want to know what it is tell me quick or ill make rastus bite you  it wont take long dear ive been lucky in some investments while you were away and im going to leave the force and take you over to england and find a prince for you to marryif you think you would like it  father itll be perfectly splendid  well start fair in england molly ill just be john mceachern from america and if anybody wants to know anything about me im a man who has made money on wall streetand thats no lieand has come over to england to spend it  molly gave his arm a squeeze her eyes were wet  father dear she whispered i believe youve been doing it all for me youve been slaving away for me ever since i was born stinting yourself and saving money just so that i could have a good time later on  no no  its true she said she turned on him with a tremulous laugh i dont believe youve had enough to eat for years i believe youre all skin and bone never mind tomorrow ill take you out and buy you the best dinner youve ever had out of my own money well go to sherrys and you shall start at the top of the menu and go straight down it till youve had enough  that will make up for everything and now dont you think you ought to be going to bed youll be losing all that color you got on the ship  soonnot just yet i havent seen you for such ages she pointed at the bullterrier look at tommy standing there and staring he cant believe ive really come back father there was a man on the lusitania with eyes exactly like tommysall brown and brightand he used to stand and stare just like tommys doing  if i had been there said her father wrathfully id have knocked his head off  no you wouldnt because im sure he was really a very nice young man he had a chin rather like yours father besides you couldnt have got at him to knock his head off because he was traveling secondclass  secondclass then you didnt talk with him  we couldnt you wouldnt expect him to shout at me across the railing only whenever i walked round the deck he seemed to be there  staring  he may not have been staring at me probably he was just looking the way the ship was going and thinking of some girl in new york i dont think you can make much of a romance out of it father  i dont want to my dear princes dont travel in the secondcabin  he may have been a prince in disguise  more likely a drummer grunted mr mceachern  drummers are often quite nice arent they  princes are nicer  well ill go to bed and dream of the nicest one i can think of come along dogs stop biting my slipper tommy why cant you behave like rastus still you dont snore do you arent you going to bed soon father i believe youve been sitting up late and getting into all sorts of bad habits while ive been away im sure you have been smoking too much when youve finished that cigar youre not even to think of another till tomorrow promise  not one  not one im not going to have my father getting like the people you read about in the magazine advertisements you dont want to feel sudden shooting pains do you  no my dear  and have to take some awful medicine  no  then promise  very well my dear i promise  as the door closed the captain threw away the stump he was smoking and remained for a moment in thought then he drew another cigar from his case lighted it and resumed the study of the little notebook it was past three oclock when he went to his bedroom     chapter v  a thief in the night   how long the light had been darting about the room like a very much enlarged firefly jimmy did not know it seemed to him like hours for it had woven itself into an incoherent waking dream of his and for a moment as the mists of sleep passed away from his brain he fancied that he was dreaming still then sleep left him and he realized that the light which was now moving slowly across the bookcase was a real light  that the man behind it could not have been there long was plain or he would have seen the chair and its occupant he seemed to be taking the room step by step as jimmy sat up noiselessly and gripped the arms of the chair in readiness for a spring the light passed from the bookcase to the table another foot or so to the left and it would have fallen on jimmy  from the position of the ray jimmy could see that the burglar was approaching on his side of the table though until that day he had not been in the room for two months its geography was clearly stamped on his minds eye he knew almost to a foot where his visitor was standing consequently when rising swiftly from the chair he made a football dive into the darkness it was no speculative dive it had a conscious aim and it was not restrained by any uncertainty as to whether the road to the burglars knees was clear or not  his shoulder bumped into a human leg his arms closed instantaneously on it and pulled there was a yelp of dismay and a crash the lantern bounced away across the room and wrecked itself on the reef of the steamheater its owner collapsed in a heap on top of jimmy  jimmy underneath at the fall speedily put himself uppermost with a twist of his body he had every advantage the burglar was a small man and had been taken very much by surprise and any fight there might have been in him in normal circumstances had been shaken out of him by the fall he lay still not attempting to struggle  jimmy halfrose and pulling his prisoner by inches to the door felt up the wall till he found the electriclight button  the yellow glow that flooded the room disclosed a short stocky youth of obviously bowery extraction a shock of vivid red hair was the first thing about him that caught the eye a poet would have described it as titian its proprietors friends and acquaintances probably called it carrots looking up at jimmy from under this wealth of crimson was a not unpleasing face it was not handsome certainly but there were suggestions of a latent goodhumor the nose had been broken at one period of its career and one of the ears was undeniably of the cauliflower type but these are little accidents which may happen to any highspirited young gentleman in costume the visitor had evidently been guided rather by individual taste than by the dictates of fashion his coat was of rusty black his trousers of gray picked out with stains of various colors beneath the coat was a faded redandwhite sweater a hat of soft felt lay on the floor by the table  the cut of the coat was poor and the fit of it spoiled by a bulge in one of the pockets diagnosing this bulge correctly jimmy inserted his hand and drew out a dingy revolver  well he said rising  like most people he had often wondered what he should do if he were to meet a burglar and he had always come to the conclusion that curiosity would be his chief emotion his anticipations were proved perfectly correct now that he had abstracted his visitors gun he had no wish to do anything but engage him in conversation a burglars life was something so entirely outside his experience he wanted to learn the burglars point of view incidentally he reflected with amusement as he recalled his wager he might pick up a few useful hints  the man on the floor sat up and rubbed the back of his head ruefully  gee he muttered i tought some guy had trown de buildin at me  it was only little me said jimmy sorry if i hurt you at all you really want a mat for that sort of thing  the mans hand went furtively to his pocket then his eye caught sight of the revolver which jimmy had placed on the table with a sudden dash he seized it  now den boss he said between his teeth  jimmy extended his hand and unclasped it six shells lay in the palm  why worry he said sit down and let us talk of life  its a fair cop boss said the man resignedly  away with melancholy said jimmy im not going to call the police you can beat it whenever you like  the man stared  i mean it said jimmy whats the trouble ive no grievance i wish though if you havent any important engagement you would stop and talk awhile first  a broad grin spread itself across the others face there was something singularly engaging about him when he grinned  gee if youse aint goin to call de cops ill talk till de chickens roost agin  talking however said jimmy is dry work are you by any chance on the wagon  whats dat me on your way boss  then youll find a pretty decent whiskey in that decanter help yourself i think youll like it  a musical gurgling followed by a contented sigh showed that the statement had been tested and proved correct  cigar asked jimmy  me fer dat assented his visitor  take a handful  i eats dem alive said the marauder jovially gathering in the spoils  jimmy crossed his legs  by the way he said let there be no secrets between us whats your name mine is pitt james willoughby pitt  mullins is my monaker boss spike dey calls me  and you make a living at this sort of thing  not so woise  how did you get in here  spike mullins grinned  gee aint de window open  if it hadnt been  id a busted it  jimmy eyed the fellow fixedly  can you use an oxyacetylene blowpipe he demanded  spike was on the point of drinking he lowered his glass and gaped  whats dat he said  an oxyacetylene blowpipe  search me said spike blankly dat gets past me  jimmys manner grew more severe  can you make soup  soup boss  he doesnt know what soup is said jimmy despairingly my good man im afraid you have missed your vocation you have no business to be trying to burgle you dont know the first thing about the game  spike was regarding the speaker with disquiet over his glass till now the redhaired one had been very well satisfied with his methods but criticism was beginning to sap his nerve he had heard tales of masters of his craft who made use of fearsome implements such as jimmy had mentioned burglars who had an airy acquaintanceship bordering on insolent familiarity with the marvels of science men to whom the latest inventions were as familiar as his own jemmy was to himself could this be one of that select band his host began to take on a new aspect in his eyes  spike said jimmy  huh  have you a thorough knowledge of chemistry physics  on your way boss  toxicology  search me  electricity and microscopy   nine ten dats de finish im down an out  jimmy shook his head sadly  give up burglary he said its not in your line better try poultryfarming  spike twiddled his glass abashed  now i said jimmy airily am thinking of breaking into a house tonight  gee exclaimed spike his suspicions confirmed at last i tought youse was in de game boss sure youre de guy dats onto all de curves i tought so all along  i should like to hear said jimmy amusedly as one who draws out an intelligent child how you would set about burgling one of those uptown villas my own work has been on a somewhat larger scale and on the other side of the atlantic  de odder side  i have done as much in london as anywhere else said jimmy a great town london full of opportunities for the fine worker did you hear of the cracking of the new asiatic bank in lombard street  no boss whispered spike was dat you  jimmy laughed  the police would like an answer to the same question he said selfconsciously perhaps you heard nothing of the disappearance of the duchess of havants diamonds  wasdat  the thief said jimmy flicking a speck of dust from his coat sleeve was discovered to have used an oxyacetylene blowpipe  the rapturous intake of spikes breath was the only sound that broke the silence through the smoke his eyes could be seen slowly widening  but about this villa said jimmy i am always interested even in the humblest sides of the profession now tell me supposing you were going to break into a villa what time of night would you do it  i always tinks its best either late like dis or when de folks is in at supper said spike respectfully  jimmy smiled a faint patronizing smile and nodded  well and what would you do  id rubber around some to see isnt dere a window open somewheres said spike diffidently  and if there wasnt  id climb up de porch an into one of de bedrooms said spike almost blushing he felt like a boy reading his first attempts at original poetry to an established critic what would this master cracksman this polished wielder of the oxyacetylene blowpipe this expert in toxicology microscopy and physics think of his callow outpourings  how would you get into the bedroom  spike hung his head  bust de catch wit me jemmy he whispered shamefacedly  burst the catch with your jemmy  its de only way i ever learned pleaded spike  the expert was silent he seemed to be thinking the other watched his face humbly  how would youse do it boss he ventured timidly at last  eh  how would youse do it  why im not sure said the master graciously whether your way might not do in a case like that its crude of course but with a few changes it would do  gee boss is dat right queried the astonished disciple  it would do said the master frowning thoughtfully it would do quite wellquite well  spike drew a deep breath of joy and astonishment that his methods should meet with approval from such a mind  gee he whisperedas who would say i and napoleon     chapter vi  an exhibition performance   cold reason may disapprove of wagers but without a doubt there is something joyous and lovable in the type of mind that rushes at the least provocation into the making of them something smacking of the spacious days of the regency nowadays the spirit seems to have deserted england when mr asquith became premier of great britain no earnest forms were to be observed rolling peanuts along the strand with a toothpick when mr asquith is dethroned it is improbable that any briton will allow his beard to remain unshaved until the liberal party returns to office it is in the united states that the wager has found a home it is characteristic of some minds to dash into a wager with the fearlessness of a soldier in a forlorn hope and once in to regard it almost as a sacred trust some men never grow up out of the schoolboy spirit of daring  to this class jimmy pitt belonged he was of the same type as the man in the comic opera who proposed to the lady because somebody bet him he wouldnt there had never been a time when a challenge a dare had not acted as a spur to him in his newspaper days life had been one long series of challenges they had been the essence of the business a story had not been worth getting unless the getting were difficult  with the conclusion of his newspaper life came a certain flatness into the scheme of things there were times many times when jimmy was bored he hungered for excitement and life appeared to have so little to offer the path of the rich man was so smooth and it seemed to lead nowhere this task of burgling a house was like an unexpected treat to a child with an intensity of purpose that should have touched his sense of humor but as a matter of fact did not appeal to him as ludicrous in any way he addressed himself to the work the truth was that jimmy was one of those men who are charged to the brim with force somehow the force had to find an outlet if he had undertaken to collect birds eggs he would have set about it with the same tense energy  spike was sitting on the edge of his chair dazed but happy his head still buzzing from the unhopedfor praise jimmy looked at his watch it was nearly three oclock a sudden idea struck him the gods had provided gifts why not take them  spike  huh  would you care to come and crack a crib with me now  reverential awe was written on the redhaired ones face  gee boss  would you  surest ting you know boss  or rather proceeded jimmy would you care to crack a crib while i came along with you strictly speaking i am here on a vacation but a trifle like this isnt real work its this way he explained ive taken a fancy to you spike and i dont like to see you wasting your time on coarse work you have the root of the matter in you and with a little coaching i could put a polish on you i wouldnt do this for everyone but i hate to see a man bungling who might do better i want to see you at work come right along and well go uptown and you shall start in dont get nervous just work as you would if i were not there i shall not expect too much rome was not built in a day when we are through i will criticize a few of your mistakes how does that suit you  gee boss great an i know where deres a peach of a place boss regular soft proposition a friend of mine told me its  very well then one moment though  he went to the telephone before he had left new york on his travels arthur mifflin had been living at a hotel near washington square it was probable that he was still there he called up the number the nightclerk was an old acquaintance of his  hello dixon said jimmy is that you im pittpitt yes im back how did you guess yes very pleasant has mr mifflin come in yet gone to bed never mind call him up will you good presently the sleepy and outraged voice of mr mifflin spoke at the other end of the line  whats wrong who the devils that  my dear arthur where you pick up such expressions i cant thinknot from me  is that you jimmy what in the name of  heavens what are you kicking about the nights yet young arthur touching that little arrangement we madecracking that crib you know are you listening have you any objection to my taking an assistant along with me i dont want to do anything contrary to our agreement but theres a young fellow here whos anxious that i should let him come along and pick up a few hints hes a professional all right not in our class of course but quite a fair rough workman hearthur arthur these are harsh words then am i to understand you have no objection very well only dont say later on that i didnt play fair goodnight  he hung up the receiver and turned to spike  ready  aint youse goin to put on your gumshoes boss  jimmy frowned reflectively as if there was something in what this novice suggested he went into the bedroom and returned wearing a pair of thin patentleather shoes  spike coughed tentatively  wont youse need your gun he hazarded  jimmy gave a short laugh  i work with brains not guns he said let us be going  there was a taxicab near by as there always is in new york jimmy pushed spike in and they drove off to jimmy new york stopped somewhere about seventysecond street anything beyond that was getting on for the middle west and seemed admirably suited as a field for the cracksman he had a vague idea of uptown as a remote desolate district badly lightedif lighted at alland sparsely dotted with sleepy policemen  the luxury of riding in a taxicab kept spike dumb for several miles having arrived at what seemed a sufficiently remote part of america jimmy paid the driver who took the money with that magnificently aloof air which characterizes the taxichauffeur a lesser man might have displayed some curiosity about the illmatched pair the chauffeur having lighted a cigarette drove off without any display of interest whatsoever it might have been part of his ordinary duties to drive gentlemen in evening clothes and shockheaded youths in particolored sweaters about the city at three oclock in the morning  we will now said jimmy stroll on and prospect it is up to you spike didnt you say something about knowing a suitable house somewhere are we anywhere near it  spike looked at the number of the street  we got some way to go boss he said i wisht youse hadnt sent away de cab  did you think we were going to drive up to the door pull yourself together my dear man  they walked on striking eastward out of broadway it caused jimmy some surprise to find that the muchenduring thoroughfare extended as far as this it had never occurred to him before to ascertain what broadway did with itself beyond times square  it was darker now that they had moved from the center of things but it was still far too light for jimmys tastes he was content however to leave matters entirely to his companion spike probably had his methods for evading publicity on these occasions  spike plodded on block after block he passed until finally the houses began to be more scattered  at last he halted before a fairsized detached house  dis is de place he said a friend of mine tells me of it i didnt know he was me friend dough before he puts me wise about dis joint i tought hed got it in fer me cos of last week when i scrapped wit him about sometin i tought after that he was layin fer me but de next time he seen me he put me wise to dis place  coals of fire said jimmy he was of a forgiving disposition a single raindrop descended on the nape of his neck in another moment a smart shower had begun  this matter has passed out of our hands said jimmy we must break in if only to get shelter get busy my lad  there was a handy window only a few feet from the ground spike pulled from his pocket a small bottle  whats that inquired jimmy  molasses boss said spike deferentially  he poured the contents of the bottle on a piece of paper which he pressed firmly against the windowpane then drawing out a short steel instrument he gave the paper a sharp tap the glass broke almost inaudibly the paper came away leaving a gap in the pane spike inserted his hand shot back the catch and softly pushed up the window  elementary said jimmy elementary but quite neat  there was now a shutter to be negotiated this took longer but in the end spikes persuasive methods prevailed  jimmy became quite cordial  you have been wellgrounded spike he said and after all that is half the battle the advice i give to every novice is learn to walk before you try to run master the a b c of the craft first with a little careful coaching you will do just so pop in  spike climbed cautiously over the sill followed by jimmy the latter struck a match and found the electric light switch they were in a parlor furnished and decorated with surprising taste jimmy had expected the usual hideousness but here everything from the wallpaper to the smallest ornaments was wonderfully well selected  business however was business this was no time to stand admiring artistic effects in roomfurnishing there was that big j to be carved on the front door if twere done then twere well twere done quickly  he was just moving to the door when from some distant part of the house came the bark of a dog another joined in the solo became a duet the air was filled with their clamor  gee cried spike  the remark seemed more or less to sum up the situation  tis sweet says byron to hear the watchdogs honest bark jimmy and spike found two watchdogs honest barks cloying spike intimated this by making a feverish dash for the open window unfortunately for the success of this maneuver the floor of the room was covered not with a carpet but with tastefully scattered rugs and underneath these rugs it was very highly polished spike treading on one of these islands was instantly undone no power of will or muscle can save a man in such a case spike skidded his feet flew from under him there was a momentary flash of red head as of a passing meteor the next moment he had fallen on his back with a thud that shook the house even in the crisis the thought flashed across jimmys mind that this was not spikes lucky night  upstairs the efforts of the canine choir had begun to resemble the a che la morte duet in il trovatore particularly good work was being done by the baritone dog  spike sat up groaning equipped though he was by nature with a skull of the purest and most solid ivory the fall had disconcerted him his eyes like those of shakespeares poet rolling in a fine frenzy did glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven he passed his fingers tenderly through his vermilion hair  heavy footsteps were descending the stairs in the distance the soprano dog had reached a in alt and was holding it while his fellow artiste executed runs in the lower register  get up hissed jimmy theres somebody coming get up you idiot cant you  it was characteristic of jimmy that it never even occurred to him to desert the fallen one and depart alone spike was his brotherinarms he would as soon have thought of deserting him as a seacaptain would of abandoning the ship  consequently as spike despite all exhortations continued to remain on the floor rubbing his head and uttering gee at intervals in a melancholy voice jimmy resigned himself to fate and stood where he was waiting for the door to open  it opened the next moment as if a cyclone had been behind it     chapter vii  getting acquainted   a cyclone entering a room is apt to alter the position of things this cyclone shifted a footstool a small chair a rug and spike the chair struck by a massive boot whirled against the wall the footstool rolled away the rug crumpled up and slid spike with a yell leaped to his feet slipped again fell and finally compromised on an allfours position in which attitude he remained blinking  while these stirring acts were in progress there was the sound of a door opening upstairs followed by a scuttering of feet and an appalling increase in the canine contribution to the current noises the duet had now taken on quite a wagnerian effect  there raced into the room first a white bullterrier he of the soprano voice anda bad secondhis fellow artiste the baritone a massive bulldog bearing a striking resemblance to the big man with the big lower jaw whose entrance had started the cyclone  and then in theatrical parlance the entire company held the picture upstage with his hand still on the door stood the man with the jaw downstage jimmy center spike and the bulldog their noses a couple of inches apart inspected each other with mutual disfavor on the extreme o p side the bullterrier who had fallen foul of a wickerwork table was crouching with extended tongue and rolling eyes waiting for the next move  the householder looked at jimmy jimmy looked at the householder spike and the bulldog looked at each other the bullterrier distributed his gaze impartially around the company  a typical scene of quiet american homelife murmured jimmy  the householder glowered  hands up you devils he roared pointing a mammoth revolver  the two marauders humored his whim  let me explain said jimmy pacifically shuffling warily around in order to face the bullterrier who was now strolling in his direction with an illassumed carelessness  keep still you blackguard  jimmy kept still the bullterrier with the same abstracted air was beginning a casual inspection of his right trouserleg  relations between spike and the bulldog meanwhile had become more strained the sudden flinging up of the formers arms had had the worst effects on the animals nerves spike the croucher on allfours he might have tolerated but spike the semaphore inspired him with thoughts of battle he was growling in a moody reflective manner his eye was full of purpose  it was probably this that caused spike to look at the householder till then he had been too busy to shift his gaze but now the bulldogs eye had become so unpleasing that he cast a pathetic glance up at the man by the door  gee he cried its de boss say boss call off de dawg its sure goin to nip de hull head offn me  the other lowered the revolver in surprise  so its you you limb of satan he remarked i thought i had seen that damned red head of yours before what are you doing in my house  spike uttered a howl in which indignation and selfpity were nicely blended  ill lay for that swede he cried ill soak it to him good boss ive had a raw deal on de level i has deys a feller i know a fat swedeole larsen his monaker isan dis feller an me started in scrapping last week an i puts it all over him so he had it in for me but he comes up to me like as if hes meanin to be good an he says hes got a soft proposition fer me if ill give him half so i says all right where is it an he gives me de number of dis house an says dis is where a widderlady lives all alone an has got silver mugs and tings to boin an dat shes away down sout so dere aint nobody in de house gee ill soak it to dat swede it was a raw deal boss he was just hopin to put me in bad wit you dats how it was boss honest  the big man listened to this sad story of grecian gifts in silence not so the bulldog which growled from start to finish  spike eyed it uneasily  wont you call off de dawg boss he said  the other stooped and grasped the animals collar jerking him away  the same treatment suggested jimmy with approval would also do a world of good to this playful and affectionate animalunless he is a vegetarian in which case dont bother  the big man glowered at him  who are you he demanded  my name began jimmy is  say said spike hes a champion burglar boss  the householder shut the door  eh he said  hes a champion burglar from de odder side he sure is from lunnon gee hes de guy tell him about de bank you opened an de jools you swiped from de duchess an de whatdyecallit blowpipe  it seemed to jimmy that spike was showing a certain want of tact when you are discovered by a householderwith revolverin his parlor at halfpast three in the morning it is surely an injudicious move to lay stress on your proficiency as a burglar the householder may be supposed to take that for granted the side of your character that should be advertised in such a crisis is the nonburglarious allusion should be made to the fact that as a child you attended sunday school regularly and to what the minister said when you took the divinity prize the idea should be conveyed to the householders mind that if let off with a caution your innate goodness of heart will lead you to reform and to avoid such scenes in future  with some astonishment therefore jimmy found that these revelations so far from prejudicing the man with the revolver against him had apparently told in his favor the man behind the gun was regarding him rather with interest than disapproval  so youre a crook from london are you  jimmy did not hesitate if being a crook from london was a passport into citizens parlors in the small hours and more particularly if it carried with it also a safeconduct out of them jimmy was not the man to refuse the role he bowed  well youll have to come across now youre in new york understand that and come across good  sure he will said spike charmed that the tension had been relieved and matters placed upon a pleasant and businesslike footing hell be good hes next to de game sure  sure echoed jimmy courteously he did not understand but things seemed to be taking a turn for the better so why disturb the harmony  dis gent said spike respectfully is boss of de cops a policecaptain he corrected himself  a light broke upon jimmys darkness he wondered he had not understood before he had not been a newspaperman in new york for a year without finding out something of the inner workings of the police force he saw now why the others manner had changed  pleased to meet you he said we must have a talk together one of these days  we must said the policecaptain significantly he was rich richer than he had ever hoped to be but he was still on tom tiddlers ground and meant to make the most of it  of course i dont know your methods on this side but anything thats usual  ill see you at my office spike mullins will show you where it is  very well you must forgive this preliminary informal call we came in more to shelter from the rain than anything  you did did you  jimmy felt that it behooved him to stand on his dignity the situation demanded it  why he said with some hauteur in the ordinary course of business i should hardly waste time over a small crib like  its banks fer his murmured spike rapturously he eats dem alive an jools from duchesses  i admit a partiality for jewels and duchesses said jimmy and now as its a little late perhaps we had betterready spike goodnight then pleased to have met you  ill see you at my office  i may possibly look in i shall be doing very little work in new york i fancy i am here merely on a vacation  if you do any work at all said the policeman coldly youll look in at my office or youll wish you had when its too late  of course of course i shouldnt dream of omitting any formality that may be usual but i dont fancy i shall break my vacation by the way one little thing have you any objections to my carving a j on your frontdoor  the policeman stared  on the inside it wont show its just a whim of mine if you have no objection  i dont want any of your began the policeman  you misunderstand me its only that it means paying for a dinner i wouldnt for the world  the policeman pointed to the window  out you get he said abruptly ive had enough of you and dont you forget to come to my office  spike still deeply mistrustful of the bulldog rastus jumped at the invitation he was through the window and out of sight in the friendly darkness almost before the policeman had finished speaking jimmy remained  i shall be delighted he had begun then he stopped in the doorway was standing a girla girl whom he recognized her startled look told him that she too had recognized him  not for the first time since he had set out from his flat that night in spikes company jimmy was conscious of a sense of the unreality of things it was all so exactly as it would have happened in a dream he had gone to sleep thinking of this girl and here she was but a glance at the man with the revolver brought him back to earth there was nothing of the dreamworld about the policecaptain  that gentleman whose back was toward the door had not observed the addition to the company molly had turned the handle quietly and her slippered feet made no sound it was the amazed expression on jimmys face that caused the captain to look toward the door  molly  the girl smiled though her face was white jimmys evening clothes had reassured her she did not understand how he came to be there but evidently there was nothing wrong she had interrupted a conversation not a conflict  i heard the noise and you going downstairs and i sent the dogs down to help you father she said and then after a little i came down to see if you were all right  mr mceachern was perplexed mollys arrival had put him in an awkward position to denounce the visitor as a cracksman was now impossible for he knew too much the only real fear of the policemans life was lest some word of his moneymaking methods might come to his daughters ears  quite a brilliant idea came to him  a man broke in my dear he said this gentleman was passing and saw him  distinctly said jimmy an uglylooking customer  but he slipped out of the window and got away concluded the policeman  he was very quick said jimmy i think he may have been a professional acrobat  he didnt hurt you father  no no my dear  perhaps i frightened him said jimmy airily  mr mceachern scowled furtively at him  we mustnt detain you mr  pitt said jimmy my name is pitt he turned to molly i hope you enjoyed the voyage  the policeman started  you know my daughter  by sight only im afraid we were fellowpassengers on the lusitania unfortunately i was in the secondcabin i used to see your daughter walking the deck sometimes  molly smiled  i remember seeing yousometimes  mceachern burst out  then you  he stopped and looked at molly the girl was bending over rastus tickling him under the ear  let me show you the way out mr pitt said the policeman shortly his manner was abrupt but when one is speaking to a man whom one would dearly love to throw out of the window abruptness is almost unavoidable  perhaps i should be going said jimmy  goodnight mr pitt said molly  i hope we shall meet again said jimmy  this way mr pitt growled mceachern holding the door  please dont trouble said jimmy he went to the window and flinging his leg over the sill dropped noiselessly to the ground  he turned and put his head in at the window again  i did that rather well he said pleasantly i think i must take up thissort of thing as a profession goodnight     chapter viii  at dreever   in the days before he began to expend his surplus energy in playing rugby football the welshman was accustomed whenever the monotony of his everyday life began to oppress him to collect a few friends and make raids across the border into england to the huge discomfort of the dwellers on the other side it was to cope with this habit that dreever castle in the county of shropshire came into existence it met a longfelt want in time of trouble it became a haven of refuge from all sides people poured into it emerging cautiously when the marauders had disappeared in the whole history of the castle there is but one instance recorded of a bandit attempting to take the place by storm and the attack was an emphatic failure on receipt of a ladleful of molten lead aimed to a nicety by one john the chaplain evidently one of those sporting parsons this warrior retired done to a turn to his mountain fastnesses and was never heard of again he would seem however to have passed the word around among his friends for subsequent raiding parties studiously avoided the castle and a peasant who had succeeded in crossing its threshold was for the future considered to be home and out of the game  such was the dreever of old in later days the welshman having calmed down considerably it had lost its militant character the old walls still stood gray menacing and unchanged but they were the only link with the past the castle was now a very comfortable countryhouse nominally ruled over by hildebrand spencer poynt de burgh john hannasyde coombecrombie twelfth earl of dreever spennie to his relatives and intimates a lighthaired young gentleman of twentyfour but in reality the possession of his uncle and aunt sir thomas and lady julia blunt  lord dreevers position was one of some embarrassment at no point in their history had the dreevers been what one might call a parsimonious family if a chance presented itself of losing money in a particularly wild and futile manner the dreever of the period had invariably sprung at it with the vim of an energetic bloodhound the south sea bubble absorbed two hundred thousand pounds of good dreever money and the remainder of the family fortune was squandered to the ultimate penny by the sportive gentleman who held the title in the days of the regency when watiers and the cocoa tree were in their prime and fortunes had a habit of disappearing in a single evening when spennie became earl of dreever there was about one dollar and thirty cents in the family coffers  this is the point at which sir thomas blunt breaks into dreever history sir thomas was a small pink fussy obstinate man with a genius for trade and the ambition of an alexander the great probably one of the finest and most complete specimens of the cameoverwaterloobridgewithhalfa crowninmypocketandnowlookatme class of millionaires in existence he had started almost literally with nothing by carefully excluding from his mind every thought except that of making money he had risen in the world with a gruesome persistence which nothing could check at the age of fiftyone he was chairman of blunts stores ltd a member of parliament silent as a wax figure but a great comfort to the party by virtue of liberal contributions to its funds and a knight this was good but he aimed still higher and meeting spennies aunt lady julia coombecrombie just at the moment when financially the dreevers were at their lowest ebb he had effected a very satisfactory deal by marrying her thereby becoming as one might say chairman of dreever ltd until spennie should marry money an act on which his chairman vehemently insisted sir thomas held the purse and except in minor matters ordered by his wife of whom he stood in uneasy awe had things entirely his own way  one afternoon a little over a year after the events recorded in the preceding chapter sir thomas was in his private room looking out of the window from which the view was very beautiful the castle stood on a hill the lower portion of which between the house and the lake had been cut into broad terraces the lake itself and its island with the little boathouse in the center gave a glimpse of fairyland  but it was not altogether the beauty of the view that had drawn sir thomas to the window he was looking at it chiefly because the position enabled him to avoid his wifes eye and just at the moment he was rather anxious to avoid his wifes eye a somewhat stormy boardmeeting was in progress and lady julia who constituted the board of directors had been heckling the chairman the point under discussion was one of etiquette and in matters of etiquette sir thomas felt himself at a disadvantage  i tell you my dear he said to the window i am not easy in my mind  nonsense snapped lady julia absurdridiculous  lady julia blunt when conversing resembled a maxim gun more than anything else  but your diamonds my dear  we can take care of them  but why should we have the trouble now if we  its no trouble  when we were married there was a detective  dont be childish thomas detectives at weddings are quite customary  but  bah  i paid twenty thousand pounds for that rope of diamonds said sir thomas obstinately switch things upon a cash basis and he was more at ease  may i ask if you suspect any of our guests of being criminals inquired lady julia with a glance of chill disdain  sir thomas looked out of the window at the moment the sternest censor could have found nothing to cavil at in the movements of such of the houseparty as were in sight some were playing tennis some clockgolf and others were smoking  why no he admitted  of course absurdquite absurd  but the servants we have engaged a number of new servants lately  with excellent recommendations  sir thomas was on the point of suggesting that the recommendations might be forged but his courage failed him julia was sometimes so abrupt in these little discussions she did not enter into his point of view he was always a trifle inclined to treat the castle as a branch of blunts stores as proprietor of the stores he had made a point of suspecting everybody and the results had been excellent in blunts stores you could hardly move in any direction without bumping into a gentlemanly detective efficiently disguised for the life of him sir thomas could not see why the same principle should not obtain at dreever guests at a country house do not as a rule steal their hosts possessions but then it is only an occasional customer at a store who goes in for shoplifting it was the principle of the thing he thought be prepared against every emergency with sir thomas blunt suspiciousness was almost a mania he was forced to admit that the chances were against any of his guests exhibiting larcenous tendencies but as for the servants he thoroughly mistrusted them all except saunders the butler it had seemed to him the merest prudence that a detective from a private inquiry agency should be installed at the castle while the house was full somewhat rashly he had mentioned this to his wife and lady julias critique of the scheme had been terse and unflattering  i suppose said lady julia sarcastically you will jump to the conclusion that this man whom spennie is bringing down with him today is a criminal of some sort  eh is spennie bringing a friend  there was not a great deal of enthusiasm in sir thomass voice his nephew was not a young man whom he respected very highly spennie regarded his uncle with nervous apprehension as one who would deal with his shortcomings with vigor and severity sir thomas for his part looked on spennie as a youth who would get into mischief unless under his uncles eye  i had a telegram from him just now lady julia explained  who is his friend  he doesnt say he just says hes a man he met in london  hm  and what does hm mean demanded lady julia  a man can pick up strange people in london said sir thomas judicially  nonsense  just as you say my dear  lady julia rose  as for what you suggest about the detective it is of course absolutely absurd  quite so my dear  you mustnt think of it  just as you say my dear  lady julia left the room  what followed may afford some slight clue to the secret of sir thomas blunts rise in the world it certainly suggests singleness of purpose which is one of the essentials of success  no sooner had the door closed behind lady julia than he went to his writingtable took pen and paper and wrote the following letter  to the manager wragges detective agency holborn bars london e c  sir with reference to my last of the 28th ult i should be glad if you would send down immediately one of your best men am making arrangements to receive him kindly instruct him to present himself at dreever castle as applicant for position of valet to myself i will see and engage him on his arrival and further instruct him in his duties  yours faithfully  thos blunt  p s i shall expect him tomorrow evening there is a good train leaving paddington at 215  sir thomas read this over put in a comma then placed it in an envelope and lighted a cigar with the air of one who can be checked yes but vanquished never     chapter ix  friends new and old   on the night of the day on which sir thomas blunt wrote and dispatched his letter to wragges detective agency jimmy pitt chanced to stop at the savoy  if you have the money and the clothes and do not object to being turned out into the night just as you are beginning to enjoy yourself there are few things pleasanter than supper at the savoy hotel london but as jimmy sat there eying the multitude through the smoke of his cigarette he felt despite all the brightness and glitter that this was a flat world and that he was very much alone in it  a little over a year had passed since the merry evening at policecaptain mceacherns during that time he had covered a good deal of new ground his restlessness had reasserted itself somebody had mentioned morocco in his hearing and a fortnight later he was in fez  of the principals in that nights drama he had seen nothing more it was only when after walking home on air rejoicing over the strange chance that had led to his finding and having speech with the lady of the lusitania he had reached fiftyninth street that he realized how he had also lost her it suddenly came home to him that not only did he not know her address but he was ignorant of her name spike had called the man with the revolver boss throughoutonly that and nothing more except that he was a policecaptain jimmy knew as little about the man as he had before their meeting and spike who held the key to the mystery had vanished his acquaintances of that night had passed out of his life like figures in a waking dream as far as the big man with the pistol was concerned this did not distress him he had known that massive person only for about a quarter of an hour but to his thinking that was ample spike he would have liked to meet again but he bore the separation with much fortitude there remained the girl of the ship and she had haunted him with unfailing persistence during every one of the three hundred and eightyfour days that had passed since their meeting  it was the thought of her that had made new york seem cramped for weeks jimmy had patrolled the likely streets the park and riverside drive in the hope of meeting her he had gone to the theaters and restaurants but with no success sometimes he had wandered through the bowery on the chance of meeting spike he had seen red heads in profusion but never again that of his young disciple in the art of burglary in the end he had wearied of the other friends of the strollers had gone out again on his wanderings he was greatly missed especially by that large section of his circle which was in a perpetual state of wanting a little to see it through till saturday for years jimmy had been to these unfortunates a human bank on which they could draw at will it offended them that one of those rare natures which are always good for two dollars at any hour of the day should be allowed to waste itself on places like morocco and spainespecially morocco where by all accounts there were brigands with almost a new york sense of touch  they argued earnestly with jimmy they spoke of raisuli and kaid maclean but jimmy was not to be stopped the gadfly was vexing him and he had to move  for a year he had wandered realizing every day the truth of horaces philosophy for those who travel that a man cannot change his feelings with his climate until finally he had found himself as every wanderer does at charing cross  at this point he had tried to rally such running away he told himself was futile he would stand still and fight the fever in him  he had been fighting it now for a matter of two weeks and already he was contemplating retreat a man at luncheon had been talking about japan  watching the crowd jimmy had found his attention attracted chiefly by a party of three a few tables away the party consisted of a girl rather pretty a lady of middle age and stately demeanor plainly her mother and a lighthaired weedy young man in the twenties it had been the almost incessant prattle of this youth and the peculiarly highpitched gurgling laugh which shot from him at short intervals that had drawn jimmys notice upon them and it was the curious cessation of both prattle and laugh that now made him look again in their direction  the young man faced jimmy and jimmy looking at him could see that all was not well with him he was pale he talked at random a slight perspiration was noticeable on his forehead  jimmy caught his eye there was a hunted look in it  given the time and the place there were only two things that could have caused this look either the lighthaired young man had seen a ghost or he had suddenly realized that he had not enough money to pay the check  jimmys heart went out to the sufferer he took a card from his case scribbled the words can i help on it and gave it to a waiter to take to the young man who was now in a state bordering on collapse  the next moment the lighthaired one was at his table talking in a feverish whisper  i say he said its frightfully good of you old chap its frightfully awkward ive come out with too little money i hardly like toyouve never seen me before  dont rub in my misfortunes pleaded jimmy it wasnt my fault  he placed a fivepound note on the table  say when he said producing another  i say thanks fearfully the young man said i dont know what id have done he grabbed at the note ill let you have it back tomorrow heres my card is your address on your card i cant remember oh by jove ive got it in my hand all the time the gurgling laugh came into action again freshened and strengthened by its rest savoy mansions eh ill come round tomorrow thanks frightfully again old chap i dont know what i should have done  its been a treat said jimmy deprecatingly  the young man flitted back to his table bearing the spoil jimmy looked at the card he had left lord dreever it read and in the corner the name of a wellknown club the name dreever was familiar to jimmy everyone knew of dreever castle partly because it was one of the oldest houses in england but principally because for centuries it had been advertised by a particularly gruesome ghoststory everyone had heard of the secret of dreever which was known only to the earl and the family lawyer and confided to the heir at midnight on his twentyfirst birthday jimmy had come across the story in corners of the papers all over the states from new york to onehorseville iowa he looked with interest at the lighthaired young man the latest depository of the awful secret it was popularly supposed that the heir after hearing it never smiled again but it did not seem to have affected the present lord dreever to any great extent his gurgling laugh was drowning the orchestra probably jimmy thought when the family lawyer had told the lighthaired young man the secret the latters comment had been no really by jove i say you know  jimmy paid his bill and got up to go  it was a perfect summer nighttoo perfect for bed jimmy strolled on to the embankment and stood leaning over the balustrade looking across the river at the vague mysterious mass of buildings on the surrey side  he must have been standing there for some time his thoughts far away when a voice spoke at his elbow  i say excuse me have youhullo it was his lighthaired lordship of dreever i say by jove why were always meeting  a tramp on a bench close by stirred uneasily in his sleep as the gurgling laugh rippled the air  been looking at the water inquired lord dreever i have i often do dont you think it sort of makes a chap feeloh you know sort ofi dont know how to put it  mushy said jimmy  i was going to say poetical suppose theres a girl  he paused and looked down at the water jimmy was sympathetic with this mood of contemplation for in his case too there was a girl  i saw my party off in a taxi continued lord dreever and came down here for a smoke only i hadnt a match have you  jimmy handed over his matchbox lord dreever lighted a cigar and fixed his gaze once more on the river  ripping it looks he said  jimmy nodded  funny thing said lord dreever in the daytime the water here looks all muddy and beastly damn depressing i call it but at night he paused i say he went on after a moment did you see the girl i was with at the savoy  yes said jimmy  shes a ripper said lord dreever devoutly  on the thames embankment in the small hours of a summer morning there is no such thing as a stranger the man you talk with is a friend and if he will listenas by the etiquette of the place he mustyou may pour out your heart to him without restraint it is expected of you  im fearfully in love with her said his lordship  she looked a charming girl said jimmy  they examined the water in silence from somewhere out in the night came the sound of oars as the policeboat moved on its patrol  does she make you want to go to japan asked jimmy suddenly  eh said lord dreever startled japan  jimmy adroitly abandoned the position of confidant and seized that of confider  i met a girl a year agoonly really met her once and even thenoh well anyway its made me so restless that i havent been able to stay in one place for more than a month on end i tried morocco and had to quit i tried spain and that wasnt any good either the other day i heard a fellow say that japan was a pretty interesting sort of country i was wondering whether i wouldnt give it a trial  lord dreever regarded this traveled man with interest  it beats me he said wonderingly what do you want to leg it about the world like that for whats the trouble why dont you stay where the girl is  i dont know where she is  dont know  she disappeared  where did you see her last asked his lordship as if molly were a mislaid penknife  new york  but how do you mean disappeared dont you know her address  i dont even know her name  but dash it all i say i mean have you ever spoken to her  only once its rather a complicated story at any rate shes gone  lord dreever said that it was a rum business jimmy conceded the point  seems to me said his lordship were both in the cart  whats your trouble  lord dreever hesitated  oh well its only that i want to marry one girl and my uncles dead set on my marrying another  are you afraid of hurting your uncles feelings  its not so much hurting his feelings itsoh well its too long to tell now i think ill be getting home im staying at our place in eaton square  how are you going if youll walk ill come some of the way with you  right you are lets be pushing along shall we  they turned up into the strand and through trafalgar square into piccadilly piccadilly has a restful aspect in the small hours some men were cleaning the road with water from a long hose the swishing of the torrent on the parched wood was musical  just beyond the gate of hyde park to the right of the road stands a cabmens shelter conversation and emotion had made lord dreever thirsty he suggested coffee as a suitable conclusion to the nights revels  i often go in here when im up in town he said the cabbies dont mind theyre sportsmen  the shelter was nearly full when they opened the door it was very warm inside a cabman gets so much fresh air in the exercise of his professional duties that he is apt to avoid it in private life the air was heavy with conflicting scents fried onions seemed to be having the best of the struggle for the moment though plug tobacco competed gallantly a keenly analytical nose might also have detected the presence of steak and coffee  a dispute seemed to be in progress as they entered  you dont wish you was in russher said a voice  yus i do wish i wos in russher retorted a shriveled mummy of a cabman who was blowing patiently at a saucerful of coffee  why do you wish you was in russher asked the interlocutor introducing a massa bones and massa johnsing touch into the dialogue  because yer can wade over yer knees in blaaaad there said the mummy  in wot  in blaaadruddy blaaad thats why i wish i wos in russher  cheery cove that said lord dreever i say can you give us some coffee  i might try russia instead of japan said jimmy meditatively  the lethal liquid was brought conversation began again other experts gave their views on the internal affairs of russia jimmy would have enjoyed it more if he had been less sleepy his back was wedged comfortably against the wall of the shelter and the heat of the room stole into his brain the voices of the disputants grew fainter and fainter  he had almost dozed off when a new voice cut through the murmur and woke him it was a voice he knew and the accent was a familiar accent  gents excuse me  he looked up the mists of sleep shredded away a ragged youth with a crop of fiery red hair was standing in the doorway regarding the occupants of the shelter with a grin halfwhimsical halfdefiant  jimmy recognized him it was spike mullins  excuse me said spike mullins is dere any gent in dis bunch of professional beauts wants to give a poor orphan dat suffers from a painful toist something to drink gents is courteously requested not to speak all in a crowd  shet that blanky door said the mummy cabman sourly  and op it added his late opponent we dont want none of your sort ere  den you aint my longlost brudders after all said the newcomer regretfully i tought youse didnt look handsome enough for dat goodnight to youse gents  shet that door cant yer when im telling yer said the mummy with increased asperity  spike was reluctantly withdrawing when jimmy rose  one moment he said  never in his life had jimmy failed to stand by a friend in need spike was not perhaps exactly a friend but even an acquaintance could rely on jimmy when down in the world and spike was manifestly in that condition  a look of surprise came into the bowery boys face followed by one of stolid woodenness he took the sovereign that jimmy held out to him with a muttered word of thanks and shuffled out of the room  cant see what you wanted to give him anything for said lord dreever chapll only spend it getting soused  oh he reminded me of a man i used to know  did he barnums whatisit i should think said his lordship shall we be moving     chapter x  jimmy adopts a lame dog   a black figure detached itself from the blacker shadows and shuffled stealthily to where jimmy stood on the doorstep  that you spike asked jimmy  dats right boss  come on in  he led the way up to his rooms switched on the electric light and shut the door spike stood blinking at the sudden glare he twirled his battered hat in his hands his red hair shone fiercely  jimmy inspected him out of the corner of his eye and came to the conclusion that the mullins finances must be at a low ebb spikes costume differed in several important details from that of the ordinary wellgroomed man about town there was nothing of the flaneur about the bowery boy his hat was of the soft black felt fashionable on the east side of new york it was in poor condition and looked as if it had been up too late the night before a black tailcoat burst at the elbows and stained with mud was tightly buttoned across his chest this evidently with the idea of concealing the fact that he wore no shirtan attempt which was not wholly successful a pair of gray flannel trousers and boots out of which two toes peeped coyly completed the picture  even spike himself seemed to be aware that there were points in his appearance which would have distressed the editor of a mens fashionpaper  scuse these duds he said me mans bin an mislaid de trunk wit me best suit in dis is me number two  dont mention it spike said jimmy you look a perfect matinee idol have a drink  spikes eyes gleamed as he reached for the decanter he took a seat  cigar spike  sure tanks boss  jimmy lighted his pipe spike after a few genteel sips threw off his restraint and finished the rest of his glass at a gulp  try another suggested jimmy  spikes grin showed that the idea had been well received  jimmy sat and smoked in silence for a while he was thinking the thing over he felt like a detective who has found a clue at last he would be able to discover the name of the lusitania girl the discovery would not take him very far certainly but it would be something possibly spike might even be able to fix the position of the house they had broken into that night  spike was looking at jimmy over his glass in silent admiration this flat which jimmy had rented for a year in the hope that the possession of a fixed abode might help to tie him down to one spot was handsomely even luxuriously furnished to spike every chair and table in the room had a romance of its own as having been purchased out of the proceeds of that new asiatic bank robbery or from the revenue accruing from the duchess of havants jewels he was dumb with reverence for one who could make burglary pay to this extent in his own case the profession had rarely provided anything more than bread and butter and an occasional trip to coney island  jimmy caught his eye and spoke  well spike he said curious that we should meet like this  de limit agreed spike  i cant imagine you three thousand miles from new york how do you know the cars still run both ways on broadway  a wistful look came into spikes eyes  ive been dis side tree months i tought it was time i give old lunnon a call tings was gettin too fierce in noo york de cops was layin fer me dey didnt seem like as if they had any use fer me so i beat it  bad luck said jimmy  fierce agreed spike  say spike said jimmy do you know i spent a whole heap of time before i left new york looking for you  gee i wish youd found me did youse want me to help on some lay boss is

wrinkled  its gone he said at last it was somewheres up some street up de town  thats a lot of help said jimmy try again  itll come back some time boss sure  then im going to keep an eye on you till it does just for the moment youre the most important man in the world to me where are you living  me why in de park dats right one of dem swell detached benches wit a southern exposure  well unless you prefer it you neednt sleep in the park any more you can pitch your moving tent with me  what here boss  unless we move  me fer dis said spike rolling luxuriously in his chair  youll want some clothes said jimmy well get those tomorrow youre the sort of figure they can fit off the peg youre not too tall which is a good thing  bad ting fer me boss if id been taller id have stood fer being a cop an bin buyin a brownstone house on fifth avenue by dis its de cops makes de big money in little old manhattan dats who it is  the man who knows said jimmy tell me more spike i suppose a good many of the new york force do get rich by graft  sure look at old man mceachern  i wish i could tell me about him spike you seemed to know him pretty well  me sure dere wasnt a woise old grafter dan him in de bunch he was out fer de dough all de time but say did youse ever see his girl  whats that said jimmy sharply  i seen her once spike became almost lyrical in his enthusiasm gee she was a boida peach fer fair id have left me happy home fer her molly was her monaker she  jimmy was glaring at him  cut it out he cried  whats dat boss said spike  cut it out said jimmy savagely  spike looked at him amazed  sure he said puzzled but realizing that his words had not pleased the great man  jimmy chewed the stem of his pipe irritably while spike full of excellent intentions sat on the edge of his chair drawing sorrowfully at his cigar and wondering what he had done to give offense  boss said spike  well  boss whats doin here put me next to de game is it de old lay banks an jools from duchesses youll be able to let me sit in at de game wont you  jimmy laughed  id quite forgotten i hadnt told you about myself spike ive retired  the horrid truth sank slowly into the others mind  say whats dat boss youre cuttin it out  thats it absolutely  aint youse swiping no more jools  not me  nor usin de whatsitsname blowpipe  i have sold my oxyacetylene blowpipe given away my anaesthetics and am going to turn over a new leaf and settle down as a respectable citizen  spike gasped his world had fallen about his ears his excursion with jimmy the master cracksman in new york had been the highest and proudest memory of his life and now that they had met again in london he had looked forward to a long and prosperous partnership in crime he was content that his own share in the partnership should be humble it was enough for him to be connected however humbly with such a master he had looked upon the richness of london and he had said with blucher what a city to loot  and here was his idol shattering the visions with a word  have another drink spike said the lost leader sympathetically its a shock to you i guess  i tought boss  i know i know these are lifes tragedies im very sorry for you but it cant be helped ive made my pile so why continue  spike sat silent with a long face jimmy slapped him on the shoulder  cheer up he said how do you know that living honestly may not be splendid fun numbers of people do it you know and enjoy themselves tremendously you must give it a trial spike  me boss what me too  sure youre my link withi dont want to have you remembering that address in the second month of a tenyear stretch at dartmoor prison im going to look after you spike my son like a lynx well go out together and see life brace up spike be cheerful grin  after a moments reflection the other grinned albeit faintly  thats right said jimmy well go into society spike hand in hand youll be a terrific success in society all you have to do is to look cheerful brush your hair and keep your hands off the spoons for in the best circles they invariably count them after the departure of the last guest  sure said spike as one who thoroughly understood this sensible precaution  and now said jimmy well be turning in can you manage sleeping on the sofa one night some fellows would give their bed up to you not me however ill have a bed made up for you tomorrow  me said spike gee ive been sleepin in de park all de last week dis is to de good boss     chapter xi  at the turn of the road   next morning when jimmy having sent spike off to the tailors with instructions to get a haircut en route was dealing with a combination of breakfast and luncheon at his flat lord dreever called  thought i should find you in observed his lordship well laddie how goes it having breakfast eggs and bacon great scott i couldnt touch a thing  the statement was borne out by his looks the son of a hundred earls was pale and his eyes were markedly fishlike  a fellow ive got stopping with metaking him down to dreever with me todayman i met at the clubfellow named hargate dont know if you know him no well he was still up when i got back last night and we stayed up playing billiardshes rotten at billiards something frightful i give him twentytill five this morning i feel fearfully cheap wouldnt have got up at all only im due to catch the twofifteen down to dreever its the only good train he dropped into a chair  sorry you dont feel up to breakfast said jimmy helping himself to marmalade i am generally to be found among those lining up when the gong goes ive breakfasted on a glass of water and a bag of birdseed in my time that sort of thing makes you ready to take whatever you can get seen the paper  thanks  jimmy finished his breakfast and lighted a pipe lord dreever laid down the paper  i say he said what i came round about was this what have you got on just now  jimmy had imagined that his friend had dropped in to return the fivepound note he had borrowed but his lordship maintained a complete reserve on the subject jimmy was to discover later that this weakness of memory where financial obligations were concerned was a leading trait in lord dreevers character  today do you mean said jimmy  well in the near future what i mean is why not put off that japan trip you spoke about and come down to dreever with me  jimmy reflected after all japan or dreever it made very little difference and it would be interesting to see a place about which he had read so much  thats very good of you he said youre sure it will be all right it wont be upsetting your arrangements  not a bit the more the merrier can you catch the twofifteen its fearfully short notice  heavens yes i can pack in ten minutes thanks very much  good business therell be shooting and all that sort of rot oh and by the way are you any good at acting i mean there are going to be private theatricals of sorts a man called charteris insisted on getting them upalways getting up theatricals rot i call it but you cant stop him do you do anything in that line  put me down for what you like from emperor of morocco to confused noise without i was on the stage once im particularly good at shifting scenery  good for you well so long twofifteen from paddington remember ill meet you there ive got to go and see a fellow now  ill look out for you  a sudden thought occurred to jimmy spike he had forgotten spike for the moment it was vital that the bowery boy should not be lost sight of again he was the one link with the little house somewhere beyond one hundred and fiftieth street he could not leave the bowery boy at the flat a vision rose in his mind of spike alone in london with savoy mansions as a base for his operations no spike must be transplanted to the country but jimmy could not seem to see spike in the country his boredom would probably be pathetic but it was the only way  lord dreever facilitated matters  by the way pitt he said youve got a man of sorts of course one of those frightful fellows who forgot to pack your collars bring him along of course  thanks said jimmy i will  the matter had scarcely been settled when the door opened and revealed the subject of discussion wearing a broad grin of mingled pride and bashfulness and looking very stiff and awkward in one of the brightest tweed suits ever seen off the stage spike stood for a moment in the doorway to let his appearance sink into the spectator then advanced into the room  how do dese strike you boss he inquired genially as lord dreever gaped in astonishment at this bright being  pretty nearly blind spike said jimmy what made you get those we use electric light here  spike was full of news  say boss dat clothinstores a willy wonder sure de old mug what showed me round give me de frozen face when i come in foist whats doin he says to de woods wit you git de hook but i hauls out de plunks you give me an tells him how im here to get a dude suit an gee if he dont haul

boss  i noticed that spike said jimmy i could see you in the dark  dont you like de duds boss inquired spike anxiously  theyre great said jimmy youd make solomon in all his glory look like a tramp cyclist  dats right agreed spike deyse de limit  and apparently oblivious to the presence of lord dreever who had been watching him in blank silence since his entrance the bowery boy proceeded to execute a mysterious shuffling dance on the carpet  this was too much for the overwrought brain of his lordship  goodbye pitt he said im off got to see a man  jimmy saw his guest to the door  outside lord dreever placed the palm of his right hand on his forehead  i say pitt he said  hullo  who the devils that  who spike oh thats my man  your man is he always like that i mean going on like a frightful musichall comedian dancing you know and i say what on earth language was that he was talking i couldnt understand one word in ten  oh thats american the bowery variety  oh well i suppose its all right if you understand it i cant by gad he broke off with a chuckle id give something to see him talking to old saunders our butler at home hes got the manners of a duke  spike should revise those said jimmy  what do you call him  spike  rummy name isnt it  oh i dont know short for algernon  he seemed pretty chummy  thats his independent bringingup were all like that in america  well so long  so long  on the bottom step lord dreever halted  i say ive got it  good for you got what  why i knew id seen that chaps face somewhere before only i couldnt place him ive got him now hes the johnny who came into the shelter last night chap you gave a quid to  spikes was one of those faces that without being essentially beautiful stamp themselves on the memory  youre quite right said jimmy i was wondering if you would recognize him the fact is hes a man i once employed over in new york and when i came across him over here he was so evidently wanting a bit of help that i took him on again as a matter of fact i needed somebody to look after my things and spike can do it as well as anybody else  i see not bad my spotting him was it well i must be off goodbye twofifteen at paddington meet you there take a ticket for dreever if youre there before me  eight goodbye  jimmy returned to the diningroom spike who was examining as much as he could of himself in the glass turned round with his wonted grin  say whos de gazebo boss aint he de mug youse was wit last night  thats the man were going down with him to the country today spike so be ready  on your way boss whats dat  he has invited us to his country house and were going  what botof us  yes i told him you were my servant i hope you arent offended  nit whats dere to be raw about boss  thats all right well wed better

rugged simplicity said jimmy but what youre wearing is a town suit excellent for the park or the marchionesss thursday crush but essentially metropolitan you must get something else for the country something dark and quiet ill come and help you choose it now  why wont dis go in de country  not on your life spike it would unsettle the rustic mind theyre fearfully particular about that sort of thing in england  deys to de bad said the baffled disciple of beau brummel with deep discontent  and theres just one more thing spike i know youll excuse my mentioning it when were at dreever castle you will find yourself within reach of a good deal of silver and other things would it be too much to ask you to forget your professional instincts i mentioned this before in a general sort of way but this is a particular case  aint i to get busy at all den queried spike  not so much as a saltspoon said jimmy firmly now well whistle a cab and go and choose you some more clothes  accompanied by spike who came within an ace of looking almost respectable in new blue serge small gentsoff the peg jimmy arrived at paddington station with a quarter of an hour to spare lord dreever appeared ten minutes later accompanied by a man of about jimmys age he was tall and thin with cold eyes and tight thin lips his clothes fitted him in the way clothes do fit one man in a thousand they were the best part of him his general appearance gave one the idea that his meals did him little good and his meditations rather less he had practically no conversation  this was lord dreevers friend hargate lord dreever made the introductions but even as they shook hands jimmy had an impression that he had seen the man before yet where or in what circumstances he could not remember hargate appeared to have no recollection of him so he did not mention the matter a man who has led a wandering life often sees faces that come back to him later on absolutely detached from their context he might merely have passed lord dreevers friend on the street but jimmy had an idea that the other had figured in some episode which at the moment had had an importance what that episode was had escaped him he dismissed the thing from his mind it was not worth harrying his memory about  judicious tipping secured the three a compartment to themselves hargate having read the evening paper went to sleep in the far corner jimmy and lord dreever who sat opposite each other fell into a desultory conversation  after awhile lord dreevers remarks took a somewhat intimate turn jimmy was one of those men whose manner invites confidences his lordship began to unburden his soul of certain facts relating to the family  have you ever met my uncle thomas he inquired you know blunts stores well hes blunt its a company now but he still runs it he married my aunt youll meet him at dreever  jimmy said he would be delighted  i bet you wont said the last of the dreevers with candor hes a frightful manthe limit always fussing round like a hen gives me a fearful time i can tell you look here i dont mind telling youwere palshes dead set on my marrying a rich girl  well that sounds all right there are worse hobbies any particular rich girl  theres always one he sicks me on to one after another quite nice girls you know some of them only i want to marry somebody else that girl you saw me with at the savoy  why dont you tell your uncle  hed have a fit she hasnt a penny nor have i except what i get from him of course this is strictly between ourselves  of course  i know everybody thinks theres money attached to the title but there isnt not a penny when my aunt julia married sir thomas the whole frightful show was pretty well in pawn so you see how it is  ever think of work asked jimmy  work said lord dreever reflectively well you know i shouldnt mind work only im dashed if i can see what i could do i shouldnt know how nowadays you want a fearful specialized education and so on tell you what though i shouldnt mind the diplomatic service one of these days i shall have a dash at asking my uncle to put up the money i believe i shouldnt be halfbad at that im rather a quick sort of chap at times you know lots of fellows have said so  he cleared his throat modestly and proceeded  it isnt only my uncle thomas he said theres aunt julia too shes about as much the limit as he is i remember when i was a kid she was always sitting on me she does still wait till you see her sort of woman who makes you feel that your hands are the color of tomatoes and the size of legs of mutton if you know what i mean and talks as if she were biting at you frightful  having unburdened himself of these criticisms lord dreever yawned leaned back and was presently asleep  it was about an hour later that the train which had been taking itself less seriously for some time stopping at stations of quite minor importance and generally showing a tendency to dawdle halted again a board with the legend dreever in large letters showed that they had reached their destination  the stationmaster informed lord dreever that her ladyship had come to meet the train in the motorcar and was now waiting in the road outside  lord dreevers jaw fell  oh lord he said shes probably motored in to get the afternoon letters that means shes come in the runabout and theres only room for two of us in that i forgot to telegraph that you were coming pitt i only wired about hargate dash it i shall have to walk  his fears proved correct the car at the station door was small it was obviously designed to seat four only  lord dreever introduced hargate and jimmy to the statuesque lady in the tonneau and then there was an awkward silence  at this point spike came up chuckling amiably with a magazine in his hand  gee said spike say boss de mug what wrote dis piece must have bin livin out in de woods say deres a gazebo what wants to swipe de heroines jools whats locked in a drawer so dis mug what do you tink he does spike laughed shortly in professional scorn why  is this gentleman a friend of yours spennie inquired lady julia politely eying the redhaired speaker coldly  its spennie looked appealingly at jimmy  its my man said jimmy spike he added in an undertone to the woods chase yourself fade away  sure said the abashed spike dats right it aint up to me to come buttin in sorry boss sorry gents sorry loidy me for de tall grass  theres a luggagecart of sorts said lord dreever pointing  sure said spike affably he trotted away  jump in pitt said lord dreever im going to walk  no ill walk said jimmy id rather i want a bit of exercise which way do i go  frightfully good of you old chap said lord dreever sure you dont mind i do bar walking rightho you keep straight on  he sat down in the tonneau by his aunts side the last jimmy saw was a hasty vision of him engaged in earnest conversation with lady julia he did not seem to be enjoying himself nobody is at his best in conversation with a lady whom he knows to be possessed of a firm belief in the weakness of his intellect a prolonged conversation with lady julia always made lord dreever feel as if he were being tied into knots  jimmy watched them out of sight and started to follow at a leisurely pace it certainly was an ideal afternoon for a country walk the sun was just hesitating whether to treat the time as afternoon or evening eventually it decided that it was evening and moderated its beams after london the country was deliciously fresh and cool jimmy felt an unwonted content it seemed to him just then that the only thing worth doing in the world was to settle down somewhere with three acres and a cow and become pastoral  there was a marked lack of traffic on the road once he met a cart and once a flock of sheep with a friendly dog sometimes a rabbit would dash out into the road stop to listen and dart into the opposite hedge all hindlegs and white scut but except for these he was alone in the world  and gradually there began to be borne in upon him the conviction that he had lost his way  it is difficult to judge distance when one is walking but it certainly seemed to jimmy that he must have covered five miles by this time he must have mistaken the way he had doubtless come straight he could not have come straighter on the other hand it would be quite in keeping with the cheap substitute which served the earl of dreever in place of a mind that he should have forgotten to mention some important turning jimmy sat down by the roadside  as he sat there came to him from down the road the sound of a horses feet trotting he got up here was somebody at last who would direct him  the sound came nearer the horse turned the corner and jimmy saw with surprise that it bore no rider  hullo he said accident and by jove a sidesaddle  the curious part of it was that the horse appeared in no way a wild horse it gave the impression of being out for a little trot on its own account a sort of equine constitutional  jimmy stopped the horse and led it back the way it had come as he turned the bend in the road he saw a girl in a ridinghabit running toward him she stopped running when she caught sight of him and slowed down to a walk  thank you ever so much she said taking the reins from him dandy you naughty old thing i got off to pick up my crop and he ran away  jimmy looked at her flushed smiling face and stood staring  it was molly mceachern     chapter xii  making a start   selfpossession was one of jimmys leading characteristics but for the moment he found himself speechless this girl had been occupying his thoughts for so long thatin his mindhe had grown very intimate with her it was something of a shock to come suddenly out of his dreams and face the fact that she was in reality practically a stranger he felt as one might with a friend whose memory has been wiped out it went against the grain to have to begin again from the beginning after all the time they had been together  a curious constraint fell upon him  why how do you do mr pitt she said holding out her hand  jimmy began to feel better it was something that she remembered his name  its like meeting somebody out of a dream said molly i have sometimes wondered if you were real everything that happened that night was so like a dream  jimmy found his tongue  you havent altered he said you look just the same  well she laughed after all its not so long ago is it  he was conscious of a dull hurt to him it had seemed years but he was nothing to herjust an acquaintance one of a hundred but what more he asked himself could he have expected and with the thought came consolation the painful sense of having lost ground left him he saw that he had been allowing things to get out of proportion he had not lost ground he had gained it he had met her again and she remembered him what more had he any right to ask  ive crammed a good deal into the time he explained ive been traveling about a bit since we met  do you live in shropshire asked molly  no im on a visit at least im supposed to be but ive lost the way to the place and i am beginning to doubt if i shall ever get there i was told to go straight on ive gone straight on and here i am lost in the snow do you happen to know whereabouts dreever castle is  she laughed  why she said i am staying at dreever castle myself  what  so the first person you meet turns out to be an experienced guide youre lucky mr pitt  youre right said jimmy slowly i am  did you come down with lord dreever he passed me in the car just as i was starting out he was with another man and lady julia blunt surely he didnt make you walk  i offered to walk somebody had to apparently he had forgotten to let them know he was bringing me  and then he misdirected you hes very casual im afraid  inclined that way perhaps  have you known lord dreever long  since a quarter past twelve last night  last night  we met at the savoy and later on the embankment we looked at the river together and told each other the painful stories of our lives and this morning he called and invited me down here  molly looked at him with frank amusement  you must be a very restless sort of person she said you seem to do a great deal of moving about  i do said jimmy i cant keep still ive got the gofever like that man in kiplings book  but he was in love  yes said jimmy he was thats the bacillus you know  she shot a quick glance at him he became suddenly interesting to her she was at the age of dreams and speculations from being merely an ordinary young man with rather more ease of manner than the majority of the young men she had met he developed in an instant into something worthy of closer attention he took on a certain mystery and romance she wondered what sort of girl it was that he loved examining him in the light of this new discovery she found him attractive something seemed to have happened to put her in sympathy with him she noticed for the first time a latent forcefulness behind the pleasantness of his manner his selfpossession was the selfpossession of the man who has been tried and has found himself  at the bottom of her consciousness too there was a faint stirring of some emotion which she could not analyze not unlike pain it was vaguely reminiscent of the agony of loneliness which she had experienced as a small child on the rare occasions when her father had been busy and distrait and had shown her by his manner that she was outside his thoughts this was but a pale suggestion of that misery nevertheless there was a resemblance it was a rather desolate shutout sensation halfresentful  it was gone in a moment but it had been there it had passed over her heart as the shadow of a cloud moves across a meadow in the summertime  for some moments she stood without speaking jimmy did not break the silence he was looking at her with an appeal in his eyes why could she not understand she must understand  but the eyes that met his were those of a child  as they stood there the horse which had been cropping in a perfunctory manner at the short grass by the roadside raised its head and neighed impatiently there was something so human about the performance that jimmy and the girl laughed simultaneously the utter materialism of the neigh broke the spell it was a noisy demand for food  poor dandy said molly he knows hes near home and he knows its his dinnertime  are we near the castle then  its a long way round by the road but we can cut across the fields arent these english fields and hedges just perfect i love them of course i loved america but  have you left new york long asked jimmy  we came over here about a month after you were at our house  you didnt spend much time there then  father had just made a good deal of money in wall street he must have been making it when i was on the lusitania he wanted to leave new york so we didnt wait we were in london all the winter then we went over to paris it was there we met sir thomas blunt and lady julia have you met them they are lord dreevers uncle and aunt  ive met lady julia  do you like her  jimmy hesitated  well you see  i know shes your hostess but you havent started your visit yet so youve just got time to say what you really think of her before you have to pretend shes perfect  well  i detest her said molly crisply i think shes hard and hateful  well i cant say she struck me as a sort of female cheeryble brother lord dreever introduced me to her at the station she seemed to bear it pluckily but with some difficulty  shes hateful repeated molly so is he sir thomas i mean hes one of those fussy bullying little men they both bully poor lord dreever till i wonder he doesnt rebel they treat him like a schoolboy it makes me wild its such a shamehes so nice and goodnatured i am so sorry for him  jimmy listened to this outburst with mixed feelings it was sweet of her to be so sympathetic but was it merely sympathy there had been a ring in her voice and a flush on her cheek that had suggested to jimmys sensitive mind a personal interest in the downtrodden peer reason told him that it was foolish to be jealous of lord dreever a good fellow of course but not to be taken seriously the primitive man in him on the other hand made him hate all mollys male friends with an unreasoning hatred not that he hated lord dreever he liked him but he doubted if he could go on liking him for long if molly were to continue in this sympathetic strain  his affection for the absent one was not put to the test mollys next remark had to do with sir thomas  the worst of it is she said father and sir thomas are such friends in paris they were always together father did him a very good turn  how was that  it was one afternoon just after we arrived a man got into lady julias room while we were all out except father father saw him go into the room and suspected something was wrong and went in after him the man was trying to steal lady julias jewels he had opened the box where they were kept and was actually holding her rope of diamonds in his hand when father found him its the most magnificent thing i ever saw sir thomas told father he gave a hundred thousand dollars for it  but surely said jimmy hadnt the management of the hotel a safe for valuables  of course they had but you dont know sir thomas he wasnt going to trust any hotel safe hes the sort of a man who insists on doing everything in his own way and who always imagines he can do things better himself than anyone else can do them for him he had had this special box made and would never keep the diamonds anywhere else naturally the thief opened it in a minute a clever thief would have no difficulty with a thing like that  what happened  oh the man saw father and dropped the jewels and ran off down the corridor father chased him a little way but of course it was no good so he went back and shouted and rang every bell he could see and gave the alarm but the man was never found still he left the diamonds that was the great thing after all you must look at them tonight at dinner they really are wonderful are you a judge of precious stones at all  i am rather said jimmy in fact a jeweler i once knew told me i had a natural gift in that direction and so of course sir thomas was pretty grateful to your father  he simply gushed he couldnt do enough for him you see if the diamonds had been stolen im sure lady julia would have made sir thomas buy her another rope just as good hes terrified of her im certain he tries not to show it but he is and besides having to pay another hundred thousand dollars he would never have heard the last of it it would have ruined his reputation for being infallible and doing everything better than anybody else  but didnt the mere fact that the thief got the jewels and was only stopped by a fluke from getting away with them do that  molly bubbled with laughter  she never knew sir thomas got back to the hotel an hour before she did ive never seen such a busy hour he had the manager up harangued him and swore him to secrecywhich the poor manager was only too glad to agree to because it wouldnt have done the hotel any good to have it known and the manager harangued the servants and the servants harangued one another and everybody talked at the same time and father and i promised not to tell a soul so lady julia doesnt know a word about it to this day and i dont see why she ever shouldthough one of these days ive a good mind to tell lord dreever think what a hold he would have over them theyd never be able to bully him again  i shouldnt said jimmy trying to keep a touch of coldness out of his voice this championship of lord dreever however sweet and admirable was a little distressing  she looked up quickly  you dont think i really meant to do you  no no said jimmy hastily of course not  well i should think so said molly indignantly after i promised not to tell a soul about it  jimmy chuckled  its nothing he said in answer to her look of inquiry  you laughed at something  well said jimmy apologetically its onlyits nothing reallyonly what i mean is you have just told one soul a good deal about it havent you  molly turned pink then she smiled  i dont know how i came to do it she declared it just rushed out of its own accord i suppose it is because i know i can trust you  jimmy flushed with pleasure he turned to her and halfhalted but she continued to walk on  you can he said but how do you know you can  she seemed surprised  why she said she stopped for a moment and then went on hurriedly with a touch of embarrassment why how absurd of course i know cant you read faces i can look she said pointing now you can see the castle how do you like it  they had reached a point where the fields sloped sharply downward a few hundred yards away backed by woods stood the gray mass of stone which had proved such a killjoy of old to the welsh sportsmen during the pheasant season even now it had a certain air of defiance the setting sun lighted the waters of the lake no figures were to be seen moving in the grounds the place resembled a palace of sleep  well said molly  its wonderful  isnt it im so glad it strikes you like that i always feel as if i had invented everything round here it hurts me if people dont appreciate it  they went down the hill  by the way said jimmy are you acting in these theatricals they are getting up  yes are you the other man they were going to get thats why lord dreever went up to london to see if he couldnt find somebody the man who was going to play one of the parts had to go back to london on business  poor brute said jimmy it seemed to him at this moment that there was only one place in the world where a man might be even reasonably happy what sort of part is it lord dreever said i should be wanted to act what do i do  if youre lord herbert which is the part they wanted a man for you talk to me most of the time  jimmy decided that the piece had been well cast   the dressinggong sounded just as they entered the hall from a door on the left there emerged two men a big man and a little one in friendly conversation the big mans back struck jimmy as familiar  oh father molly called and jimmy knew where he had seen the back before  the two men stopped  sir thomas said molly this is mr pitt  the little man gave jimmy a rapid glance possibly with the object of detecting his more immediately obvious criminal points then as if satisfied as to his honesty became genial  i am very glad to meet you mr pitt very glad he said we have been expecting you for some time  jimmy explained that he had lost his way  exactly it was ridiculous that you should be compelled to walk perfectly ridiculous it was grossly careless of my nephew not to let us know that you were coming my wife told him so in the car  i bet she did said jimmy to himself really he said aloud by way of lending a helping hand to a friend in trouble i preferred to walk i have not been on a country road since i landed in england he turned to the big man and held out his hand i dont suppose you remember me mr mceachern we met in new york  you remember the night mr pitt scared away our burglar father said molly  mr mceachern was momentarily silent on his native asphalt there are few situations capable of throwing the new york policeman off his balance in that favored clime savoir faire is represented by a shrewd blow of the fist and a masterful stroke with the truncheon amounts to a satisfactory repartee thus shall you never take the policeman of manhattan without his answer in other surroundings mr mceachern would have known how to deal with the young man whom with such good reason he believed to be an expert criminal but another plan of action was needed here first and foremost of all the hints on etiquette that he had imbibed since he entered this more reposeful life came the maxim never make a scene scenes he had gathered were of all things what polite society most resolutely abhorred the natural man in him must be bound in chains the sturdy blow must give way to the honeyed word a cold really was the most vigorous retort that the best circles would countenance it had cost mr mceachern some pains to learn this lesson but he had done it he shook hands and gruffly acknowledged the acquaintanceship  really really chirped sir thomas amiably so you find yourself among old friends mr pitt  old friends echoed jimmy painfully conscious of the expolicemans eyes which were boring holes in him  excellent excellent let me take you to your room it is just opposite my own this way  in his younger days sir thomas had been a floorwalker of no mean caliber a touch of the professional still lingered in his brisk movements he preceded jimmy upstairs with the restrained suavity that can be learned in no other school  they parted from mr mceachern on the first landing but jimmy could still feel those eyes the policemans stare had been of the sort that turns corners goes upstairs and pierces walls     chapter xiii  spikes views   nevertheless it was in an exalted frame of mind that jimmy dressed for dinner it seemed to him that he had awakened from a sort of stupor life so gray yesterday now appeared full of color and possibilities most men who either from choice or necessity have knocked about the world for any length of time are more or less fatalists jimmy was an optimistic fatalist he had always looked on fate not as a blind dispenser at random of gifts good and bad but rather as a benevolent being with a pleasing bias in his own favor he had almost a napoleonic faith in his star at various periods of his life notably at the time when as he had told lord dreever he had breakfasted on birdseed he had been in uncommonly tight corners but his luck had always extricated him it struck him that it would be an unthinkable piece of bad sportsmanship on fates part to see him through so much and then to abandon him just as he had arrived in sight of what was by far the biggest thing of his life of course his view of what constituted the biggest thing in life had changed with the years every ridge of the hill of supreme moments in turn had been mistaken by him for the summit but this last he felt instinctively was genuine for good or bad molly was woven into the texture of his life in the stormy period of the early twenties he had thought the same of other girls who were now mere memories as dim as those of figures in a halfforgotten play in their case his convalescence had been temporarily painful but brief force of will and an active life had worked the cure he had merely braced himself and firmly ejected them from his mind a week or two of aching emptiness and his heart had been once more in readiness all nicely swept and garnished for the next lodger  but in the case of molly it was different he had passed the age of instantaneous susceptibility like a landlord who has been cheated by previous tenants he had become wary he mistrusted his powers of recuperation in case of disaster the will in these matters just like the mundane bouncer gets past its work for some years now jimmy had had a feeling that the next arrival would come to stay and he had adopted in consequence a gently defensive attitude toward the other sex molly had broken through this and he saw that his estimate of his willpower had been just methods that had proved excellent in the past were useless now there was no trace here of the dimly consoling feeling of earlier years that there were other girls in the world he did not try to deceive himself he knew that he had passed the age when a man can fall in love with any one of a number of types  this was the finish one way or the other there would be no second throw she had him however it might end he belonged to her  there are few moments in a mans day when his brain is more contemplative than during that brief space when he is lathering his face preparatory to shaving plying the brush jimmy reviewed the situation he was perhaps a little too optimistic not unnaturally he was inclined to look upon his luck as a sort of special train which would convey him without effort to paradise fate had behaved so exceedingly handsomely up till now by a series of the most workmanlike miracles it had brought him to the point of being mollys fellowguest at a countryhouse this as reason coldly pointed out a few moments later was merely the beginning but to jimmy thoughtfully lathering it seemed the end it was only when he had finished shaving and was tying his cravat that he began to perceive obstacles in his way and sufficiently big obstacles at that  in the first place molly did not love him and he was bound to admit there was no earthly reason why she ever should a man in love is seldom vain about his personal attractions also her father firmly believed him to be a masterburglar  otherwise said jimmy scowling at his reflection in the glass everythings splendid he brushed his hair sadly  there was a furtive rap at the door  hullo said jimmy yes  the door opened slowly a grin surmounted by a mop of red hair appeared round the edge of it  hullo spike come in whats the matter  the rest of mr mullins entered the room  gee boss i wasnt sure was dis your room say who do you tink i nearly bumped me coco aginst out in de corridor downstairs why old man

waved the clothesbrush oh you boss he cried whats eatin youse aw its a shame not to come along you boss say whats doin why aint youse sittin in at de game oh you boss  whatever reply jimmy might have made to this impassioned appeal was checked by a sudden bang on the door almost simultaneously the handle turned  gee cried spike its de cop  jimmy smiled pleasantly  come in mr mceachern he said come in journeys end in lovers meeting you know my friend mr mullins i think shut the door and sit down and lets talk of many things     chapter xiv  check and a counter move   mr mceachern stood in the doorway breathing heavily as the result of a long connection with evildoers the expoliceman was somewhat prone to harbor suspicions of those round about him and at the present moment his mind was aflame indeed a more trusting man might have been excused for feeling a little doubtful as to the intentions of jimmy and spike when mceachern had heard that lord dreever had brought home a casual london acquaintance he had suspected as a possible drawback to the visit the existence of hidden motives on the part of the unknown lord dreever he had felt was precisely the sort of youth to whom the professional buncosteerer would attach himself with shouts of joy never he had assured himself had there been a softer proposition than his lordship since buncosteering became a profession  when he found that the strange visitor was jimmy pitt his suspicions had increased a thousandfold  and when going to his room to get ready for dinner he had nearly run into spike mullins in the corridor his frame of mind had been that of a man to whom a sudden ray of light reveals the fact that he is on the brink of a black precipice jimmy and spike had burgled his house together in new york and here they were together again at dreever castle to say that the thing struck mceachern as sinister is to put the matter baldly there was once a gentleman who remarked that he smelt a rat and saw it floating in the air exconstable mceachern smelt a regiment of rats and the air seemed to him positively congested with them  his first impulse had been to rush to jimmys room there and then but he had learned societys lessons well though the heavens might fall he must not be late for dinner so he went and dressed and an obstinate tie put the finishing touches to his wrath  jimmy regarded him coolly without moving from the chair in which he had seated himself spike on the other hand seemed embarrassed he stood first on one leg and then on the other as if he were testing the respective merits of each and would make a definite choice later on  you scoundrels growled mceachern  spike who had been standing for a few moments on his right leg and seemed at last to have come to a decision hastily changed to the left and grinned feebly  say youse wont want me any more boss he whispered  no you can go spike  you stay where you are you redheaded devil said mceachern tartly  run along spike said jimmy  the bowery boy looked doubtfully at the huge form of the expoliceman which blocked access to the door  would you mind letting my man pass said jimmy  you stay began mceachern  jimmy got up and walked round to the door which he opened spike shot out he was not lacking in courage but he disliked embarrassing interviews and it struck him that jimmy was the man to handle a situation of this kind he felt that he himself would only be in the way  now we can talk comfortably said jimmy going back to his chair  mceacherns deepset eyes gleamed and his forehead grew red but he mastered his feelings  and now said he then paused  yes asked jimmy  what are you doing here  nothing at the moment  you know what i mean why are you here you and that redheaded devil spike mullins he jerked his head in the direction of the door  i am here because i was very kindly invited to come by lord dreever  i know you  you have that privilege seeing that we only met once its very good of you to remember me  whats your game what do you mean to do  to do well i shall potter about the garden you know and shoot a bit perhaps and look at the horses and think of life and feed the chickensi suppose there are chickens somewhere aboutand possibly go for an occasional row on the lake nothing more oh yes i believe they want me to act in some theatricals  youll miss those theatricals youll leave here tomorrow  tomorrow but ive only just arrived dear heart  i dont care about that out you go tomorrow ill give you till tomorrow  i congratulate you said jimmy one of the oldest houses in england  what do you mean  i gathered from what you said that you had bought the castle isnt that so if it still belongs to lord dreever dont you think you ought to consult him before revising his list of guests  mceachern looked steadily at him his manner became quieter  oh you take that tone do you  i dont know what you mean by that tone what tone would you take if a comparative stranger ordered you to leave another mans house  mceacherns massive jaw protruded truculently in the manner that had scared good behavior into brawling east siders  i know your sort he said ill call your bluff and you wont get till tomorrow either itll be now  why should we wait for the morrow you are queen of my heart tonight murmured jimmy encouragingly  ill expose you before them all ill tell them everything  jimmy shook his head  too melodramatic he said i call on heaven to judge between this man and me kind of thing i shouldnt what do you propose to tell anyway  will you deny that you were a crook in new york  i will i was nothing of the kind  what  if youll listen i can explain  explain the others voice rose again you talk about explaining you scum when i caught you in my own parlor at three in the morningyou  the smile faded from jimmys face  half a minute he said it might be that the ideal course would be to let the storm expend itself and then to explain quietly the whole matter of arthur mifflin and the bet that had led to his one excursion into burglary but he doubted it thingsincluding his temperhad got beyond the stage of quiet explanations mceachern would most certainly disbelieve his story what would happen after that he did not know a scene probably a melodramatic denunciation at the worst before the other guests at the best before sir thomas alone he saw nothing but chaos beyond that his story was thin to a degree unless backed by witnesses and his witnesses were three thousand miles away worse he had not been alone in the policemans parlor a man who is burgling a house for a bet does not usually do it in the company of a professional burglar well known to the police  no quiet explanations must be postponed they could do no good and would probably lead to his spending the night and the next few nights at the local policestation and even if he were spared that fate it was certain that he would have to leave the castleleave the castle and molly  he jumped up the thought had stung him  one moment he said  mceachern stopped  well  youre going to tell them that asked jimmy  i am  jimmy walked up to him  are you also going to tell them why you didnt have me arrested that night he said  mceachern started jimmy planted himself in front of him and glared up into his face it would have been hard to say which of the two was the angrier the policeman was flushed and the veins stood out on his forehead jimmy was in a white heat of rage he had turned very pale and his muscles were quivering jimmy in this mood had once cleared a los angeles barroom with the leg of a chair in the space of two and a quarter minutes by the clock  are you he demanded are you  mceacherns hand hanging at his side lifted itself hesitatingly the fingers brushed against jimmys shoulder  jimmys lip twitched  yes he said do it do it and see what happens by god if you put a hand on me ill finish you do you think you can bully me do you think i care for your size  mceachern dropped his hand for the first time in his life he had met a man who instinct told him was his match and more he stepped back a pace  jimmy put his hands in his pockets and turned away he walked to the mantelpiece and leaned his back against it  you havent answered my question he said perhaps you cant  mceachern was wiping his forehead and breathing quickly  if you like said jimmy well go down to the drawingroom now and you shall tell your story and ill tell mine i wonder which they will think the more interesting damn you he went on his anger rising once more what do you mean by it you come into my room and bluster and talk big about exposing crooks what do you call yourself i wonder do you realize what you are why poor spikes an angel compared with you he did take chances he wasnt in a position of trust you  he stopped  hadnt you better get out of here dont you think he said curtly  without a word mceachern walked to the door and went out  jimmy dropped into a chair with a deep breath he took up his cigarettecase but before he could light a match the gong sounded from the distance  he rose and laughed rather shakily he felt limp as an effort at conciliating papa he said im afraid that wasnt much of a success  it was not often that mceachern was visited by ideas he ran rather to muscle than to brain but he had one that evening during dinner his interview with jimmy had left him furious but baffled he knew that his hands were tied frontal attack was useless to drive jimmy from the castle would be out of the question all that could be done was to watch him while he was there for he had never been more convinced of anything in his life than that jimmy had wormed his way into the houseparty with felonious intent the appearance of lady julia at dinner wearing the famous rope of diamonds supplied an obvious motive the necklace had an international reputation probably there was not a prominent thief in england or on the continent who had not marked it down as a possible prey it had already been tried for once it was big game just the sort of lure that would draw the type of criminal mceachern imagined jimmy to be  from his seat at the far end of the table jimmy looked at the jewels as they gleamed on their wearers neck they were almost too ostentatious for what was after all an informal dinner it was not a rope of diamonds it was a collar there was something oriental and barbaric in the overwhelming display of jewelry it was a prize for which a thief would risk much  the conversation becoming general with the fish was not of a kind to remove from his mind the impression made by the sight of the gems it turned on burglary  lord dreever began it  oh i say he said i forgot to tell you aunt julia number six was burgled the other night  number 6a eaton square was the familys london house  burgled cried sir thomas  well broken into said his lordship gratified to find that he had got the ear of his entire audience even lady julia was silent and attentive chap got in through the scullery window about one oclock in the morning  and what did you do inquired sir thomas  oh ieri was out at the time said lord dreever but something frightened the feller he went on hurriedly and he made a bolt for it without taking anything  burglary said a young man whom jimmy subsequently discovered to be the dramaloving charteris leaning back and taking advantage of a pause is the hobby of the sportsman and the life work of the avaricious he took a little pencil from his waistcoat pocket and made a rapid note on his cuff  everybody seemed to have something to say on the subject one young lady gave it as her opinion that she would not like to find a burglar under her bed somebody else had heard of a fellow whose father had fired at the butler under the impression that he was a housebreaker and had broken a valuable bust of socrates lord dreever had known a man at college whose brother wrote lyrics for musical comedy and had done one about a burglars best friend being his mother  life said charteris who had had time for reflection is a house which we all burgle we enter it uninvited take all that we can lay hands on and go out again he scribbled lifehouseburgle on his cuff and replaced the pencil  this mans brother i was telling you about said lord dreever says theres only one rhyme in the english language to burglar and thats gurgler unless you count pergola he says  personally said jimmy with a glance at mceachern i have rather a sympathy for burglars after all they are one of the hardestworking classes in existence they toil while everybody else is asleep besides a burglar is only a practical socialist people talk a lot about the redistribution of wealth the burglar goes out and does it i have found burglars some of the decentest criminals i have ever met  i despise burglars ejaculated lady julia with a suddenness that stopped jimmys eloquence as if a tap had been turned off if i found one coming after my jewels and i had a pistol id shoot him  jimmy met mceacherns eye and smiled kindly at him the expoliceman was looking at him with the gaze of a baffled but malignant basilisk  i take very good care no one gets a chance at your diamonds my dear said sir thomas without a blush i have had a steel box made for me he added to the company in general with a special lock a very ingenious arrangement quite unbreakable i imagine  jimmy with mollys story fresh in his mind could not check a rapid smile mr mceachern watching intently saw it to him it was fresh evidence if any had been wanted of jimmys intentions and of his confidence of success mceacherns brow darkened during the rest of the meal tense thought rendered him even more silent than was his wont at the dinnertable the difficulty of his position was he saw great jimmy to be foiled must be watched and how could he watch him  it was not until the coffee arrived that he found an answer to the question with his first cigarette came the idea that night in his room before going to bed he wrote a letter it was an unusual letter but singularly enough almost identical with one sir thomas blunt had written that very morning  it was addressed to the manager of dodsons private inquiry agency of bishopsgate street e c and ran as follows  sir  on receipt of this kindly send down one of your smartest men instruct him to stay at the village inn in character of american seeing sights of england and anxious to inspect dreever castle i will meet him in the village and recognize him as old new york friend and will then give him further instructions yours faithfully  j mceachern  p s kindly not send a rube but a real smart man   this brief but pregnant letter cost some pains in its composition mceachern was not a ready writer but he completed it at last to his satisfaction there was a crisp purity in the style that pleased him he sealed up the envelope and slipped it into his pocket he felt more at ease now such was the friendship that had sprung up between sir thomas blunt and himself as the result of the jewel episode in paris that he could count with certainty on the successful working of his scheme the grateful knight would not be likely to allow any old new york friend of his preserver to languish at the village inn the sleuthhound would at once be installed at the castle where unsuspected by jimmy he could keep an eye on the course of events any looking after that mr james pitt might require could safely be left in the hands of this expert  with considerable fervor mr mceachern congratulated himself on his astuteness with jimmy above stairs and spike below the sleuthhound would have his hands full     chapter xv  mr mceachern intervenes   life at the castle during the first few days of his visit filled jimmy with a curious blend of emotions mainly unpleasant fate in its projimmy capacity seemed to be taking a rest in the first place the part allotted to him was not that of lord herbert the character who talked to molly most of the time the instant charteris learned from lord dreever that jimmy had at one time actually been on the stage professionally he decided that lord herbert offered too little scope for the new mans talents  absolutely no good to you my dear chap he said its just a small dude part hes simply got to be a silly ass  jimmy pleaded that he could be a sillier ass than anybody living but charteris was firm  no he said you must be captain browne fine acting part the biggest in the piece full of fat lines spennie was to have played it and we were in for the worst frost in the history of the stage now youve come its all right spennies the ideal lord herbert hes simply got to be himself weve got a success now my boy rehearsal after lunch dont be late and he was off to beat up the rest of the company  from that moment jimmys troubles began charteris was a young man in whom a passion for the stage was ineradicably implanted it mattered nothing to him during these days that the sun shone that it was pleasant on the lake and that jimmy would have given five pounds a minute to be allowed to get molly to himself for halfanhour every afternoon all he knew or cared about was that the local nobility and gentry were due to arrive at the castle within a week and that as yet very few of the company even knew their lines having hustled jimmy into the part of captain browne he gave his energy free play he conducted rehearsals with a vigor that occasionally almost welded the rabble he was coaching into something approaching coherency he painted scenery and left it aboutwet and people sat on it he nailed up horseshoes for luck and they fell on people but nothing daunted him he never rested  mr charteris said lady julia rather frigidly after one energetic rehearsal is indefatigable he whirled me about  it was perhaps his greatest triumph properly considered that he had induced lady julia to take a part in his piece but to the born organizer of amateur theatricals no miracle of this kind is impossible and charteris was one of the most inveterate organizers in the country there had been some talklate at night in the billiard roomof his being about to write in a comic footman role for sir thomas but it had fallen through not it was felt because charteris could not have hypnotized his host into undertaking the part but rather because sir thomas was histrionically unfit  mainly as a result of the producers energy jimmy found himself one of a crowd and disliked the sensation he had not experienced much difficulty in mastering the scenes in which he appeared but unfortunately those who appeared with him had it occurred to jimmy daily after he had finished running through the lines with a series of agitated amateurs male and female that for all practical purposes he might just as well have gone to japan in this confused welter of rehearsers his opportunities of talking with molly were infinitesimal and worse she did not appear to mind she was cheerful and apparently quite content to be engulfed in a crowd probably he thought with some melancholy if she met his eye and noted in it a distracted gleam she put it down to the cause that made other eyes in the company gleam distractedly during this week  jimmy began to take a thoroughly jaundiced view of amateur theatricals and of these amateur theatricals in particular he felt that in the electric flame department of the infernal regions there should be a special gridiron reserved exclusively for the man who invented these performances so diametrically opposed to the true spirit of civilization at the close of each day he cursed charteris with unfailing regularity  there was another thing that disturbed him that he should be unable to talk with molly was an evil but a negative evil it was supplemented by one that was positive even in the midst of the chaos of rehearsals he could not help noticing that molly and lord dreever were very much together alsoand this was even more sinisterhe observed that both sir thomas blunt and mr mceachern were making determined efforts to foster the state of affairs  of this he had sufficient proof one evening when after scheming and plotting in a way that had made the great efforts of machiavelli and richelieu seem like the work of raw novices he had cut molly out from the throng and carried her off for the alleged purpose of helping him feed the chickens there were as he had suspected chickens attached to the castle they lived in a little world of noise and smells at the back of the stables bearing an iron pot full of a poisonouslooking mash and accompanied by molly he had felt for perhaps a minute and a half like a successful general it is difficult to be romantic when you are laden with chickenfeed in an unwieldy iron pot but he had resolved that this portion of the proceedings should be brief the birds should dine that evening on the quicklunch principle thento the more fitting surroundings of the rosegarden there was plenty of time before the hour of the sounding of the dressinggong perhaps even a row on the lake  what ho said a voice  behind them with a propitiatory smile on his face stood his lordship of dreever  my uncle told me i should find you out here what have you got in there pitt is this what you feed them on i say you know queer coves hens i wouldnt touch that stuff for a fortune what looks to me poisonous  he met jimmys eye and stopped there was that in jimmys eye that would have stopped an avalanche his lordship twiddled his fingers in pink embarrassment  oh look said molly theres a poor little chicken out there in the cold it hasnt had a morsel give me the spoon mr pitt here chick chick dont be silly im not going to hurt you ive brought you your dinner  she moved off in pursuit of the solitary fowl which had edged nervously away lord dreever bent toward jimmy  frightfully sorry pitt old man he whispered feverishly didnt want to come couldnt help it he sent me out he halflooked over his shoulder and he added rapidly as molly came back the old boys up at his bedroom window now watching us through his operaglasses  the return journey to the house was performed in silenceon jimmys part in thoughtful silence he thought hard and he had been thinking ever since  he had material for thought that lord dreever was as clay in his uncles hands he was aware he had not known his lordship long but he had known him long enough to realize that a backbone had been carelessly omitted from his composition what his uncle directed that would he do the situation looked bad to jimmy the order he knew had gone out that lord dreever was to marry money and molly was an heiress he did not know how much mr mceachern had amassed in his dealings with new york crime but it must be something considerable things looked black  then jimmy had a reaction he was taking much for granted lord dreever might be hounded into proposing to molly but what earthly reason was there for supposing that molly would accept him he declined even for an instant to look upon spennies title in the light of a lure molly was not the girl to marry for a title he endeavored to examine impartially his lordships other claims he was a pleasant fellow withto judge on short acquaintanceshipan undeniably amiable disposition that much must be conceded but against this must be placed the equally undeniable fact that he was also as he would have put it himself a most frightful ass he was weak he had no character altogether the examination made jimmy more cheerful he could not see the lighthaired one even with sir thomas blunt shoving behind as it were accomplishing the knights ends shove he never so wisely sir thomas could never make a romeo out of spennie dreever  it was while sitting in the billiardroom one night after dinner watching his rival play a hundred up with the silent hargate that jimmy came definitely to this conclusion he had stopped there to watch more because he wished to study his man at close range than because the game was anything out of the common as an exposition of billiards as a matter of fact it would have been hard to imagine a worse game lord dreever who was conceding twenty was poor and his opponent an obvious beginner again as he looked on jimmy was possessed of an idea that he had met hargate before but once more he searched his memory and drew blank he did not give the thing much thought being intent on his diagnosis of lord dreever who by a fluky series of cannons had wobbled into the forties and was now a few points ahead of his opponent  presently having summed his lordship up to his satisfaction and grown bored with the game jimmy strolled out of the room he paused outside the door for a moment wondering what to do there was bridge in the smokingroom but he did not feel inclined for bridge from the drawingroom came sounds of music he turned in that direction then stopped again he came to the conclusion that he did not feel sociable he wanted to think a cigar on the terrace would meet his needs  he went up to his room for his cigarcase the window was open he leaned out there was almost a full moon and it was very light out of doors his eye was caught by a movement at the further end of the terrace where the shadow was a girl came out of the shadow walking slowly  not since early boyhood had jimmy descended stairs with such a rare burst of speed he negotiated the nasty turn at the end of the first flight at quite a suicidal pace fate however had apparently wakened again and resumed business for he did not break his neck a few moments later he was out on the terrace bearing a cloak which he had snatched up en route in the hall  i thought you might be cold he said breathing quickly  oh thank you said molly how kind of you he put it round her shoulders have you been running  i came downstairs rather fast  were you afraid the boogaboos would get you she laughed i was thinking of when i was a small child i was always afraid of them i used to race downstairs when i had to go to my room in the dark unless i could persuade someone to hold my hand all the way there and back  her spirits had risen with jimmys arrival things had been happening that worried her she had gone out on to the terrace to be alone when she heard his footsteps she had dreaded the advent of some garrulous fellowguest full of small talk jimmy somehow was a comfort he did not disturb the atmosphere little as they had seen of each other something in himshe could not say whathad drawn her to him he was a man whom she could trust instinctively  they walked on in silence words were pouring into jimmys mind but he could not frame them he seemed to have lost the power of coherent thought  molly said nothing it was not a night for conversation the moon had turned terrace and garden into a fairyland of black and silver it was a night to look and listen and think  they walked slowly up and down as they turned for the second time mollys thoughts formed themselves into a question twice she was on the point of asking it but each time she checked herself it was an impossible question she had no right to put it and he had no right to answer yet something was driving her on to ask it  it came out suddenly without warning  mr pitt what do you think of lord dreever  jimmy started no question could have chimed in more aptly with his thoughts even as she spoke he was struggling to keep himself from asking her the same thing  oh i know i ought not to ask she went on hes your host and youre his friend i know but  her voice trailed off the muscles of jimmys back tightened and quivered but he could find no words  i wouldnt ask anyone else but youredifferent somehow i dont know what i mean we hardly know each other but  she stopped again and still he was dumb  i feel so alone she said very quietly almost to herself something seemed to break in jimmys head his brain suddenly cleared he took a step forward  a huge shadow blackened the white grass jimmy wheeled round it was mceachern  i have been looking for you molly my dear he said heavily i thought you must have gone to bed  he turned to jimmy and addressed him for the first time since their meeting in the bedroom  will you excuse us mr pitt  jimmy bowed and walked rapidly toward the house at the door he stopped and looked back the two were standing where he had left them     chapter xvi  a marriage arranged   neither molly nor her father had moved or spoken while jimmy was covering the short strip of turf that ended at the stone steps of the house mceachern stood looking down at her in grim silence his great body against the dark mass of the castle wall seemed larger than ever in the uncertain light to molly there was something sinister and menacing in his attitude she found herself longing that jimmy would come back she was frightened why she could not have said it was as if some instinct told her that a crisis in her affairs had been reached and that she needed him for the first time in her life she felt nervous in her fathers company ever since she was a child she had been accustomed to look upon him as her protector hut now she was afraid  father she cried  what are you doing out here  his voice was tense and strained  i came out because i wanted to think father dear  she thought she knew his moods but this was one that she had never seen it frightened her  why did he come out here  mr pitt he brought me a wrap  what was he saying to you  the rain of questions gave molly a sensation of being battered she felt dazed and a little mutinous what had she done that she should be assailed like this  he was saying nothing she said rather shortly  nothing what do you mean what was he saying tell me  mollys voice shook as she replied  he was saying nothing she repeated do you think im not telling the truth father he had not spoken a word for ever so long we just walked up and down i was thinking and i suppose he was too at any rate he said nothing ii think you might believe me  she began to cry quietly her father had never been like this before it hurt her  mceacherns manner changed in a flash in the shock of finding jimmy and molly together on the terrace he had forgotten himself he had had reason to be suspicious sir thomas blunt from whom he had just parted had told him a certain piece of news which had disturbed him the discovery of jimmy with molly had lent an added significance to that piece of news he saw that he had been rough in a moment he was by her side his great arm round her shoulder petting and comforting her as he had done when she was a child he believed her word without question and his relief made him very tender gradually the sobs ceased she leaned against his arm  im tired father she whispered  poor little girl well sit down  there was a seat at the end of the terrace mceachern picked molly up as if she had been a baby and carried her to it she gave a little cry  i didnt mean i was too tired to walk she said laughing tremulously how strong you are father if i was naughty you could take me up and shake me till i was good couldnt you  of course and send you to bed too so you be careful young woman  he lowered her to the seat molly drew the cloak closer round her and shivered  cold dear  no  you shivered  it was nothing yes it was she went on quickly it was father will you promise me something  of course what  dont ever be angry with me like that again will you i couldnt bear it really i couldnt i know its stupid of me but it hurt you dont know how it hurt  but my dear  oh i know its stupid but  but my darling it wasnt so i was angry but it wasnt with you  with were you angry with mr pitt  mceachern saw that he had traveled too far he had intended that jimmys existence should be forgotten for the time being he had other things to discuss but it was too late now he must go forward  i didnt like to see you out here alone with mr pitt dear he said i was afraid  he saw that he must go still further forward it was more than awkward he wished to hint at the undesirability of an entanglement with jimmy without admitting the possibility of it not being a man of nimble brain he found this somewhat beyond his powers  i dont like him he said briefly hes crooked  mollys eyes opened wide the color had gone from her face  crooked father  mceachern perceived that he had traveled very much too far almost to disaster he longed to denounce jimmy but he was gagged if molly were to ask the question that jimmy had asked in the bedroomthat fatal unanswerable question the price was too great to pay  he spoke cautiously vaguely feeling his way  i couldnt explain to you my dear you wouldnt understand you must remember my dear that out in new york i was in a position to know a great many queer characterscrooks molly i was working among them  but father that night at our house you didnt know mr pitt he had to tell you his name  i didnt know himthen said her father slowly butbut he pausedbut i made inquiries he concluded with a rush and found out things  he permitted himself a long silent breath of relief he saw his way now  inquiries said molly why  why  why did you suspect him  a moment earlier the question might have confused mceachern but not now he was equal to it he took it in his stride  its hard to say my dear a man who has had as much to do with crooks as i have recognizes them when he sees them  did you think mr pitt lookedlooked like that her voice was very small there was a drawn pinched expression on her face she was paler than ever  he could not divine her thoughts he could not know what his words had done how they had shown her in a flash what jimmy was to her and lighted her mind like a flame revealing the secret hidden there she knew now the feeling of comradeship the instinctive trust the sense of dependencethey no longer perplexed her they were signs which she could read  and he was crooked  mceachern proceeded belief made him buoyant  i did my dear i can read them like a book ive met scores of his sort broadway is full of them good clothes and a pleasant manner dont make a man honest ive run up against a mighty hightoned bunch of crooks in my day its a long time since i gave up thinking that it was only the ones with the low foreheads and the thick ears that needed watching its the innocent willies who look as if all they could do was to lead the cotillon this man pitts one of them im not guessing mind you i know i know his line and all about him im watching him hes here on some game how did he get here why he scraped acquaintance with lord dreever in a london restaurant its the commonest trick on the list if i hadnt happened to be here when he came i suppose hed have made his haul by now why he came all prepared for it have you seen an ugly grinning redheaded scoundrel hanging about the place his valet so he says valet do you know who that is thats one of the most notorious yeggmen on the other side there isnt a policeman in new york who doesnt know spike mullins even if i knew nothing of this pitt that would be enough whats an innocent man going round the country with spike mullins for unless they are standing in together at some game thats who mr pitt is my dear and thats why maybe i seemed a little put out when i came upon you and him out here alone together see as little of him as you can in a large party like this it wont be difficult to avoid him  molly sat staring out across the garden at first every word had been a stab several times she had been on the point of crying out that she could bear it no longer but gradually a numbness succeeded the pain she found herself listening apathetically  mceachern talked on he left the subject of jimmy comfortably conscious that even if there had ever existed in mollys heart any budding feeling of the kind he had suspected it must now be dead he steered the conversation away until it ran easily among commonplaces he talked of new york of the preparations for the theatricals molly answered composedly she was still pale and a certain listlessness in her manner might have been noticed by a more observant man than mr mceachern beyond this there was nothing to show that her heart had been born and killed but a few minutes before women have the red indian instinct and molly had grown to womanhood in those few minutes  presently lord dreevers name came up it caused a momentary pause and mceachern took advantage of it it was the cue for which he had been waiting he hesitated for a moment for the conversation was about to enter upon a difficult phase and he was not quite sure of himself then he took the plunge  i have just been talking to sir thomas my dear he said he tried to speak casually and as a natural result infused so much meaning into his voice that molly looked at him in surprise mceachern coughed confusedly diplomacy he concluded was not his forte he abandoned it in favor of directness he was telling me that you had refused lord dreever this evening  yes i did said molly how did sir thomas know  lord dreever told him  molly raised her eyebrows  i shouldnt have thought it was the sort of thing he would talk about she said  sir thomas is his uncle  of course so he is said molly dryly i forgot that would account for it wouldnt it  mr mceachern looked at her with some concern there was a hard ring in her voice which he did not altogether like his greatest admirer had never called him an intuitive man and he was quite at a loss to see what was wrong as a schemer he was perhaps a little naive he had taken it for granted that molly was ignorant of the maneuvers which had been going on and which had culminated that afternoon in a stammering proposal of marriage from lord dreever in the rosegarden this however was not the case the woman incapable of seeing through the machinations of two men of the mental caliber of sir thomas blunt and mr mceachern has yet to be born for some considerable time molly had been alive to the wellmeant plottings of that worthy pair and had derived little pleasure from the fact it may be that woman loves to be pursued but she does not love to be pursued by a crowd  mr mceachern cleared his throat and began again  you shouldnt decide a question like that too hastily my dear  i didntnot too hastily for lord dreever at any rate poor dear  it was in your power said mr mceachern portentously to make a man happy  i did said molly bitterly you should have seen his face light up he could hardly believe it was true for a moment and then it came home to him and i thought he would have fallen on my neck he did his very best to look heartbrokenout of politenessbut it was no good he whistled most of the way back to the houseall flat but very cheerfully  my dear what do you mean  molly had made the discovery earlier in their conversation that her father had moods whose existence she had not expected it was his turn now to make a similar discovery regarding herself  i mean nothing father she said im just telling you what happened he came to me looking like a dog thats going to be washed  why of course he was nervous my dear  of course he couldnt know that i was going to refuse him  she was breathing quickly he started to speak but she went on looking straight before her her face was very white in the moonlight  he took me into the rosegarden was that sir thomass idea there couldnt have been a better setting im sure the roses looked lovely presently i heard him gulp and i was so sorry for him i would have refused him then and put him out of his misery only i couldnt very well till he had proposed could i so i turned my back and sniffed at a rose and then he shut his eyesi couldnt see him but i know he shut his eyesand began to say his lesson  molly  she laughed hysterically  he did he said his lesson he gabbled it when he had got as far as well dont you know what i mean is thats what i wanted to say you know i turned round and soothed him i said i didnt love him he said no no of course not i said he had paid me a great compliment he said not at all looking very anxious poor darling as if even then he was afraid of what might come next but i reassured him and he cheered up and we walked back to the house together as happy as could be  mceachern put his hand round her shoulders she winced but let it stay he attempted gruff conciliation  my dear youve been imagining things of course he isnt happy why i saw the young fellow  recollecting that the last time he had seen the young fellowshortly after dinnerthe young fellow had been occupied in juggling with every appearance of mental peace two billiardballs and a box of matches he broke off abruptly  molly looked at him  father  my dear  why do you want me to marry lord dreever  he met the attack stoutly  i think hes a fine young fellow he said avoiding her eyes  hes quite nice said molly quietly  mceachern had been trying not to say it he did not wish to say it if it could have been hinted at he would have done it but he was not good at hinting a lifetime passed in surroundings where the subtlest hint is a drive in the ribs with a truncheon does not leave a man an adept at the art he had to be blunt or silent  hes the earl of dreever my dear  he rushed on desperately anxious to cover the nakedness of the statement in a comfortable garment of words  why you see youre young molly its only natural you shouldnt look on these things sensibly you expect too much of a man you expect this young fellow to be like the heroes of the novels you read when youve lived a little longer my dear youll see that theres nothing in it it isnt the hero of the novel you want to marry its the man wholl make you a good husband  this remark struck mr mceachern as so pithy and profound that he repeated it  he went on molly was sitting quite still looking into the shrubbery he assumed she was listening but whether she was or not he must go on talking the situation was difficult silence would make it more difficult  now look at lord dreever he said theres a young man with one of the oldest titles in england he could go anywhere and do what he liked and be excused for whatever he did because of his name but he doesnt hes got the right stuff in him he doesnt go racketing around  his uncle doesnt allow him enough pocketmoney said molly with a jarring little laugh perhaps thats why  there was a pause mceachern required a few moments in which to marshal his arguments once more he had been thrown out of his stride  molly turned to him the hardness had gone from her face she looked up at him wistfully  father dear listen she said we always used to understand each other so well he patted her shoulder affectionately you cant mean what you say you know i dont love lord dreever you know hes only a boy dont you want me to marry a man i love this old place but surely you cant think that it can really matter in a thing like this you dont really mean that about the hero of the novel im not stupid like that i only wantoh i cant put it into words but dont you see  her eyes were fixed appealingly on him it only needed a word from himperhaps not even a wordto close the gulf that had opened between them  he missed the chance he had had time to think and his arguments were ready again with stolid goodhumor he marched along the line he had mapped out he was kindly and shrewd and practical and the gulf gaped wider with every word  you mustnt be rash my dear you mustnt act without thinking in these things lord dreever is only a boy as you say but he will grow you say you dont love him nonsense you like him you would go on liking him more and more and why because you could make what you pleased of him youve got character my dear with a girl like you to look after him he would go a long way a very long way its all there it only wants bringing out and think of it molly countess of dreever theres hardly a better title in england it would make me very happy my dear its been my one hope all these years to see you in the place where you ought to be and now the chance has come molly dear dont throw it away  she had leaned back with closed eyes a wave of exhaustion had swept over her she listened in a dull dream she felt beaten they were too strong for her there were too many of them what did it matter why not give in and end it all and win peace that was all she wantedpeace now what did it all matter  very well father she said listlessly  mceachern stopped short  youll do it dear he cried you will  very well father  he stooped and kissed her  my own dear little girl he said  she got up  im rather tired father she said i think ill go in  two minutes later mr mceachern was in sir thomas blunts study five minutes later sir thomas pressed the bell  saunders appeared  tell his lordship said sir thomas that i wish to see him a moment he is in the billiardroom i think     chapter xvii  jimmy remembers something   the game between hargate and lord dreever was still in progress when jimmy returned to the billiardroom a glance at the board showed that the score was seventysixtynine in favor of spot  good game said jimmy whos spot  i am said his lordship missing an easy cannon for some reason he appeared in high spirits hargates been going great guns i was eleven ahead a moment ago but he made a break of twelve  lord dreever belonged to the class of billiardplayers to whom a doublefigure break is a thing to be noted and greeted with respect  fluky muttered the silent hargate deprecatingly this was a long speech for him since their meeting at paddington station jimmy had seldom heard him utter anything beyond a monosyllable  not a bit of it dear old son said lord dreever handsomely youre coming on like a twoyearold i shant be able to give you twenty in a hundred much longer  he went to a sidetable and mixed himself a whiskeyandsoda singing a brief extract from musical comedy as he did so there could be no shadow of doubt that he was finding life good for the past few days and particularly that afternoon he had been rather noticeably ill at ease jimmy had seen him hanging about the terrace at halfpast five and had thought that he looked like a mute at a funeral but now only a few hours later he was beaming on the world and chirping like a bird  the game moved jerkily along jimmy took a seat and watched the score mounted slowly lord dreever was bad but hargate was worse at length in the eighties his lordship struck a brilliant vein when he had finished his break his score was ninetyfive hargate who had profited by a series of misses on his opponents part had reached ninetysix  this is shortening my life said jimmy leaning forward  the balls had been left in an ideal position even hargate could not fail to make a cannon he made it  a close finish to even the worst game is exciting jimmy leaned still further forward to watch the next stroke it looked as if hargate would have to wait for his victory a good player could have made a cannon as the balls lay but not hargate they were almost in a straight line with white in the center  hargate swore under his breath there was nothing to be done he struck carelessly at white white rolled against red seemed to hang for a moment and shot straight back against spot the game was over  great scott what a fluke cried the silent one becoming quite garrulous at the miracle  a quiet grin spread itself slowly across jimmys face he had remembered what he had been trying to remember for over a week  at this moment the door opened and saunders appeared sir thomas would like to see your lordship in his study he said  eh what does he want  sir thomas did not confide in me your lordship  eh what oh no well see you later you men  he rested his cue against the table and put on his coat jimmy followed him out of the door which he shut behind him  one second dreever he said  eh hullo whats up  any money on that game asked jimmy  why yes by jove now you mention it there was an even fiver anderby the way old manthe fact is just for the moment im frightfullyyou havent such a thing as a fiver anywhere about have you the fact is  my dear fellow of course ill square up with him now shall i  fearfully obliged if you would thanks old man pay it tomorrow  no hurry said jimmy plenty more in the old oak chest  he went back to the room hargate was practising cannons he was on the point of making a stroke when jimmy opened the door  care for a game said hargate  not just at present said jimmy  hargate attempted his cannon and failed badly jimmy smiled  not such a good shot as the last he said  no  fine shot that other  fluke  i wonder  jimmy lighted a cigarette  do you know new york at all he asked  been there  ever been in the strollers club  hargate turned his back but jimmy had seen his face and was satisfied  dont know it said hargate  great place said jimmy mostly actors and writers and so on the only drawback is that some of them pick up queer friends  hargate did not reply he did not seem interested  yes went on jimmy for instance a pal of mine an actor named mifflin introduced a man a year ago as a members guest for a fortnight and this man rooked the fellows of i dont know how much at billiards the old game you know nursing his man right up to the end and then finishing with a burst of course when that happens once or twice it may be an accident but when a man who poses as a novice always manages by a really brilliant shot  hargate turned round  they fired this fellow out said jimmy  look here  yes  what do you mean  its a dull yarn said jimmy apologetically ive been boring you by the way dreever asked me to square up with you for that game in case he shouldnt be back here you are  he held out an empty hand  got it  what are you going to do demanded hargate  what am i going to do queried jimmy  you know what i mean if youll keep your mouth shut and stand in its halves is that what youre after  jimmy was delighted he knew that by rights the proposal should have brought him from his seat with stern set face to wreak vengeance for the insult but on such occasions he was apt to ignore the conventions his impulse when he met a man whose code of behavior was not the ordinary code was to chat with him and extract his point of view he felt as little animus against hargate as he had felt against spike on the occasion of their first meeting  do you make much at this sort of game he asked  hargate was relieved this was businesslike  pots he said with some enthusiasm pots i tell you if youll stand in  bit risky isnt it  not a bit of it an occasional accident  i suppose youd call me one  hargate grinned  it must be pretty tough work said jimmy you must have to use a tremendous lot of selfrestraint  hargate sighed  thats the worst of it he admitted the having to seem a mug at the game ive been patronized sometimes by young fools who thought they were teaching me till i nearly forgot myself and showed them what real billiards was  theres always some drawback to the learned professions said jimmy  but theres a heap to make up for it in this one said hargate well look here is it a deal youll stand in  jimmy shook his head  i guess not he said its good of you but commercial speculation never was in my line im afraid you must count me out of this  what youre going to tell  no said jimmy im not im not a vigilance committee i wont tell a soul  why then began hargate relieved  unless of course jimmy went on you play billiards again while youre here  hargate stared  but damn it man if i dont whats the good look here what am i to do if they ask me to play  give your wrist as an excuse  my wrist  yes you sprained it tomorrow after breakfast it was bad luck i wonder how you came to do it you didnt sprain it much but just enough to stop you playing billiards  hargate reflected  understand said jimmy  oh very well said hargate sullenly but he burst out if i ever get a chance to get even with you  you wont said jimmy dismiss the rosy dream get even you dont know me theres not a flaw in my armor im a sort of modern edition of the stainless knight tennyson drew galahad from me i move through life with almost a sickening absence of sin but hush we are observed at least we shall be in another minute somebody is coming down the passage you do understand dont you sprained wrist is the watchword  the handle turned it was lord dreever back again from his interview  hullo dreever said jimmy weve missed you hargate has been doing his best to amuse me with acrobatic tricks but youre too reckless hargate old man mark my words one of these days youll be spraining your wrist you should be more careful what going goodnight pleasant fellow hargate he added as the footsteps retreated down the passage well my lad whats the matter with you you look depressed  lord dreever flung himself on to the lounge and groaned hollowly  damn damn damn he observed  his glassy eye met jimmys and wandered away again  what on earths the matter demanded jimmy you go out of here caroling like a songbird and you come back moaning like a lost soul whats happened  give me a brandyandsoda pitt old man theres a good chap im in a fearful hole  why whats the matter  im engaged groaned his lordship  engaged i wish youd explain what on earths wrong with you dont you want to be engaged whats your  he broke off as a sudden awful suspicion dawned upon him who is she he cried  he gripped the stricken peers shoulder and shook it savagely unfortunately he selected the precise moment when the latter was in the act of calming his quivering nervecenters with a gulp of brandyandsoda and for the space of some two minutes it seemed as if the engagement would be broken off by the premature extinction of the dreever line a long and painful fit of coughing however ended with his lordship still alive and on the road to recovery  he eyed jimmy reproachfully but jimmy was in no mood for apologies  who is she he kept demanding whats her name  might have killed me grumbled the convalescent  who is she  what why miss mceachern  jimmy had known what the answer would be but it was scarcely less of a shock for that reason  miss mceachern he echoed  lord dreever nodded a somber nod  youre engaged to her  another somber nod  i dont believe it said jimmy  i wish i didnt said his lordship wistfully ignoring the slight rudeness of the remark but worse luck its true  for the first time since the disclosure of the name jimmys attention was directed to the remarkable demeanor of his successful rival  you dont seem overpleased he said  pleased have a fiver each way on pleased no im not exactly leaping with joy  then what the devil is it all about what do you mean whats the idea if you dont want to marry miss mceachern why did you propose to her  lord dreever closed his eyes  dear old boy dont its my uncle  your uncle  didnt i explain it all to youabout him wanting me to marry you know i told you the whole thing  jimmy stared in silence  do you mean to say he said slowly  he stopped it was a profanation to put the thing into words  what old man  jimmy gulped  do you mean to say you want to marry miss mceachern simply because she has money he said  it was not the first time that he had heard of a case of a british peer marrying for such a reason but it was the first time that the thing had filled him with horror in some circumstances things come home more forcibly to us  its not me old man murmured his lordship its my uncle  your uncle good god jimmy clenched his hands despairingly do you mean to say that you let your uncle order you about in a thing like this do you mean to say youre such asuch asuch a gelatinebackboneless worm  old man i say protested his lordship wounded  id call you a wretched knockkneed skunk only i dont want to be fulsome i hate flattering a man to his face  lord dreever deeply pained halfrose from his seat  dont get up urged jimmy smoothly i couldnt trust myself his lordship subsided hastily he was feeling alarmed he had never seen this side of jimmys character at first he had been merely aggrieved and disappointed he had expected sympathy how the matter had become more serious jimmy was pacing the room like a young and hungry tiger at present it was true there was a billiardtable between them but his lordship felt that he could have done with good stout bars he nestled in his seat with the earnest concentration of a limpet on a rock it would be deuced bad form of course for jimmy to assault his host but could jimmy be trusted to remember the niceties of etiquette  why the devil she accepted you i cant think said jimmy half to himself stopping suddenly and glaring across the table  lord dreever felt relieved this was not polite perhaps but at least it was not violent  thats what beats me too old man he said  between you and me its a jolly rum business this afternoon  what about this afternoon  why she wouldnt have me at any price  you asked her this afternoon  yes and it was all right then she refused me like a bird wouldnt hear of it came damn near laughing in my face and then tonight he went on his voice squeaky at the thought of his wrongs my uncle sends for me and says shes changed her mind and is waiting for me in the morningroom i go there and she tells me in about three words that shes been thinking it over and that the whole fearful thing is on again i call it jolly rough on a chap i felt such a frightful ass you know i didnt know what to do whether to kiss her i mean  jimmy snorted violently  eh said his lordship blankly  go on said jimmy between his teeth  i felt a fearful fool you know i just said right ho or somethingdashed if i know now what i did sayand legged it its a jolly rum business the whole thing it isnt as if she wanted me i could see that with half an eye she doesnt care a hang for me its my belief old man he said solemnly that shes been badgered into it i believe my uncles been at her  jimmy laughed shortly  my dear man you seem to think your uncles persuasive influence is universal i guess its confined to you  well anyhow i believe thats whats happened what do you say  why say anything there doesnt seem to be much need  he poured some brandy into a glass and added a little soda  you take it pretty stiff observed his lordship with a touch of envy  on occasion said jimmy emptying the glass     chapter xviii  the lochinvar method   as jimmy sat smoking a last cigarette in his bedroom before going to bed that night spike mullins came in jimmy had been thinking things over he was one of those men who are at their best in a losing game imminent disaster always had the effect of keying him up and putting an edge on his mind the news he had heard that night had left him with undiminished determination but conscious that a change of method would be needed he must stake all on a single throw now young lochinvar rather than romeo must be his model he declined to believe himself incapable of getting anything that he wanted as badly as he wanted molly he also declined to believe that she was really attached to lord dreever he suspected the hand of mceachern in the affair though the suspicion did not clear up the mystery by any means molly was a girl of character not a feminine counterpart of his lordship content meekly to do what she was told in a matter of this kind the whole thing puzzled him  well spike he said  he was not too pleased at the interruption he was thinking and he wanted to be alone  something appeared to have disturbed spike his bearing was excited  say boss guess what you know dat guy dat come dis afternoonde guy from de village dat came wit old man mceachern  galer said jimmy what about him  there had been an addition to the guests at the castle that afternoon mr mceachern walking in the village had happened upon an old new york acquaintance of his who touring england had reached dreever and was anxious to see the historic castle mr mceachern had brought him thither introduced him to sir thomas and now mr samuel galer was occupying a room on the same floor as jimmys he had appeared at dinner that night a short woodenfaced man with no more conversation than hargate jimmy had paid little attention to the newcomer  what about him he said  hes a sleut boss  a what  a sleut  a detective  dats right a fly cop  what makes you think that  tink why i can tell dem by deir eyes an deir feet an de whole of dem i could pick out a fly cop from a bunch of a tousand hes a sure nough sleut all right all right i seen him rubber in at youse boss  at me why at me why of course i see now our friend mceachern has got him in to

surprised at you do you know youre getting a regular mephistopheles spike suppose i hadnt an iron will what would happen you really must select your subjects of conversation more carefully youre bad company for the likes of me  spike shuffled despondently  but boss  jimmy shook his head  it cant be done my lad  but it can boss protested spike its dead easy ive been up to de room an i seen de box

dats right boss why look what i got dis afternoon just snoopin around an not really tryin to git busy at all it was just lyin about  he plunged his hand into his pocket and drew it out again as he unclosed his fingers jimmy caught the gleam of precious stones  what the he gasped  spike was looking at his treasuretrove with an air of affectionate proprietorship  where on earth did you get those asked jimmy  out of one of de rooms dey belonged to one of de loidies it was de easiest old ting ever boss i just went in when dere was nobody around an dere dey was on de toible i never butted into anytin so soft  spike  yes boss  do you remember the room you took them from  sure it was de foist on de  then just listen to me for a moment my bright boy when were at breakfast tomorrow you want to go to that room and put those things backall of them mind youjust where you found them do you understand  spikes jaw had fallen  put dem back boss he faltered  every single one of them  boss said spike plaintively  remember every single one of them just where it belongs see  very well boss  the dejection in his voice would have moved the sternest to pity gloom had enveloped spikes spirit the sunlight had gone out of his life  it had also gone out of the lives of a good many other people at the castle this was mainly due to the growing shadow of the day of the theatricals  for pure discomfort there are few things in the world that can compete with the final rehearsals of an amateur theatrical performance at a countryhouse every day the atmosphere becomes more heavily charged with restlessness and depression the producer of the piece especially if he be also the author of it develops a sort of intermittent insanity he plucks at his mustache if he has one at his hair if he has not he mutters to himself he gives vent to occasional despairing cries the soothing suavity that marked his demeanor in the earlier rehearsals disappears he no longer says with a winning smile splendid old man splendid couldnt be better but i think well take that over just once more if you dont mind instead he rolls his eyes and snaps out once more please thisll never do at this rate we might just as well cut out the show altogether whats that no it wont be all right on the night now then once more and do pull yourselves together this time after this the scene is sulkily resumed and conversation when the parties concerned meet subsequently is cold and strained  matters had reached this stage at the castle everybody was thoroughly tired of the piece and but for the thought of the disappointment which presumably would rack the neighboring nobility and gentry if it were not to be produced would have resigned their places without a twinge of regret people who had schemed to get the best and longest parts were wishing now that they had been content with first footman or giles a villager  ill never run an amateur show again as long as i live confided charteris to jimmy almost tearfully its not good enough most of them arent wordperfect yet  itll be all right  oh dont say itll be all right on the night  i wasnt going to said jimmy i was going to say itll be all right after the night people will soon forget how badly the thing went  youre a nice comforting sort of man arent you said charteris  why worry said jimmy if you go on like this itll be westminster abbey for you in your prime youll be getting brainfever  jimmy himself was one of the few who were feeling reasonably cheerful he was deriving a keen amusement at present from the maneuvers of mr samuel galer of new york this lynxeyed man having been instructed by mr mceachern to watch jimmy was doing so with a thoroughness that would have roused the suspicions of a babe if jimmy went to the billiardroom after dinner mr galer was there to keep him company if during the course of the day he had occasion to fetch a handkerchief or a cigarettecase from his bedroom he was sure on emerging to stumble upon mr galer in the corridor the employees of dodsons private inquiry agency believed in earning their salaries  occasionally after these encounters jimmy would come upon sir thomas blunts valet the other man in whom spikes trained eye had discerned the distinguishing marks of the sleuth he was usually somewhere round the corner at these moments and when collided with apologized with great politeness jimmy decided that he must have come under suspicion in this case vicariously through spike spike in the servants hall would of course stand out conspicuously enough to catch the eye of a detective on the look out for sin among the servants and he himself as spikes employer had been marked down as a possible confederate  it tickled him to think that both these giant brains should be so greatly exercised on his account  he had been watching molly closely during these days so far no announcement of the engagement had been made it struck him that possibly it was being reserved for public mention on the night of the theatricals the whole county would be at the castle then there could be no more fitting moment he sounded lord dreever and the latter said moodily that he was probably right  theres going to be a dance of sorts after the show he said and itll be done then i suppose no getting out of it after that itll be all over the county trust my uncle for that hell get on a table and shout it shouldnt wonder and itll be in the morning post next day and katiell see it only two days more oh lord  jimmy deduced that katie was the savoy girl concerning whom his lordship had vouchsafed no particulars save that she was a ripper and hadnt a penny  only two days like the battle of waterloo it was going to be a closerun affair more than ever now he realized how much molly meant to him and there were moments when it seemed to him that she too had begun to understand that night on the terrace seemed somehow to have changed their relationship he thought he had got closer to her they were in touch before she had been frank cheerful unembarrassed now he noticed a constraint in her manner a curious shyness there was a barrier between them but it was not the old barrier he had ceased to be one of a crowd  but it was a race against time the first day slipped by a blank and the second till now it was but a matter of hours the last afternoon had come  not even mr samuel galer of dodsons private inquiry agency could have kept a more unflagging watch than did jimmy during those hours there was no rehearsal that afternoon and the members of the company in various stages of nervous collapse strayed distractedly about the grounds first one then another would seize upon molly while jimmy watching from afar cursed their pertinacity  at last she wondered off alone and jimmy quitting his ambush followed  she walked in the direction of the lake it had been a terribly hot oppressive afternoon there was thunder in the air through the trees the lake glittered invitingly  she was standing at the waters edge when jimmy came up her back was turned she was rocking with her foot a canadian canoe that lay alongside the bank she started as he spoke his feet on the soft turf had made no sound  can i take you out on the lake he said  she did not answer for a moment she was plainly confused  im sorry she said iim waiting for lord dreever  jimmy saw that she was nervous there was tension in the air she was looking away from him out across the lake and her face was flushed  wont you he said  im sorry she said again  jimmy looked over his shoulder down the lower terrace was approaching the long form of his lordship he walked with pensive jerkiness not as one hurrying to a welcome tryst as jimmy looked he vanished behind the great clump of laurels that stood on the lowest terrace in another minute he would reappear round them  gently but with extreme dispatch jimmy placed a hand on either side of mollys waist the next moment he had swung her off her feet and lowered her carefully to the cushions in the bow of the canoe  then jumping in himself with a force that made the boat rock he loosened the mooringrope seized the paddle and pushed off     chapter xix  on the lake   in making love as in every other branch of life consistency is the quality most to be aimed at to hedge is fatal a man must choose the line of action that he judges to be best suited to his temperament and hold to it without deviation if lochinvar snatches the maiden up on his saddlebow he must continue in that vein he must not fancy that having accomplished the feat he can resume the episode on lines of devotional humility prehistoric man who conducted his courtship with a club never fell into the error of apologizing when his bride complained of headache  jimmy did not apologize the idea did not enter his mind he was feeling prehistoric his heart was beating fast and his mind was in a whirl but the one definite thought that came to him during the first few seconds of the journey was that he ought to have done this earlier this was the right way pick her up and carry her off and leave uncles and fathers and butterhaired peers of the realm to look after themselves this was the way alone together in their own little world of water with nobody to interrupt and nobody to overhear he should have done it before he had wasted precious golden time hanging about while futile men chattered to her of things that could not possibly be of interest but he had done the right thing at last he had got her she must listen to him now she could not help listening they were the only inhabitants of this new world  he looked back over his shoulder at the world they had left the last of the dreevers had rounded the clump of laurels and was standing at the edge of the water gazing perplexedly after the retreating canoe  these poets put a thing very neatly sometimes said jimmy reflectively as he dug the paddle into the water the man who said distance lends enchantment to the view for instance dreever looks quite nice when you see him as far away as this with a good strip of water in between  molly gazing over the side of the boat into the lake abstained from feasting her eyes on the picturesque spectacle  why did you do it she said in a low voice  jimmy shipped the paddle and allowed the canoe to drift the ripple of the water against the prow sounded clear and thin in the stillness the world seemed asleep the sun blazed down turning the water to flame the air was hot with the damp electrical heat that heralds a thunderstorm mollys face looked small and cool in the shade of her big hat jimmy as he watched her felt that he had done well this was indeed the way  why did you do it she said again  i had to  take me back  no  he took up the paddle and placed a broader strip of water between the two worlds then paused once more  i have something to say to you first he said  she did not answer he looked over his shoulder again his lordship had disappeared  do you mind if i smoke  she nodded he filled his pipe carefully and lighted it the smoke moved sluggishly up through the still air there was a long silence a fish jumped close by falling back in a shower of silver drops molly started at the sound and halfturned  that was a fish she said as a child might have done  jimmy knocked the ashes out of his pipe  what made you do it he asked abruptly echoing her own question  she drew her fingers slowly through the water without speaking  you know what i mean dreever told me  she looked up with a flash of spirit which died away as she spoke  what right she stopped and looked away again  none said jimmy but i wish you would tell me  she hung her head jimmy bent forward and touched her hand  dont he said for gods sake dont you mustnt  i must she said miserably  you shant its wicked  i must its no good talking about it its too late  its not you must break it off today  she shook her head her fingers still dabbled mechanically in the water the sun was hidden now behind a gray veil which deepened into a sullen black over the hill behind the castle the heat had grown more oppressive with a threat of coming storm  what made you do it he asked again  dont lets talk about it  please  he had a momentary glimpse of her face there were tears in her eyes at the sight his selfcontrol snapped  you shant he cried its ghastly i wont let you you must understand now you must know what you are to me do you think i shall let you  a low growl of thunder rumbled through the stillness like the muttering of a sleepy giant the black cloud that had hung over the hill had crept closer the heat was stifling in the middle of the lake some fifty yards distant lay the island cool and mysterious in the gathering darkness  jimmy broke off and seized the paddle  on this side of the island was a boathouse a little creek covered over with boards and capable of sheltering an ordinary rowboat he ran the canoe in just as the storm began and turned her broadside on so that they could watch the rain which was sweeping over the lake in sheets  he began to speak again more slowly now  i think i loved you from the first day i saw you on the ship and then i lost you i found you again by a miracle and lost you again i found you here by another miracle but this time i am not going to lose you do you think im going to stand by and see you taken from me byby  he took her hand  molly you cant love him it isnt possible if i thought you did i wouldnt try to spoil your happiness id go away but you dont you cant hes nothing molly  the canoe rocked as he leaned toward her  molly  she said nothing but for the first time her eyes met his clear and unwavering he could read fear in them fearnot of himself of something vague something he could not guess at but they shone with a light that conquered the fear as the sun conquers fire and he drew her to him and kissed her again and again murmuring incoherently  suddenly she wrenched herself away struggling like some wild thing the boat plunged  i cant she cried in a choking voice i mustnt oh i cant  he stretched out a hand and clutched at the rail than ran along the wall the plunging ceased he turned she had hidden her face and was sobbing quietly with the forlorn hopelessness of a lost child  he made a movement toward her but drew back he felt dazed  the rain thudded and splashed on the wooden roof a few drops trickled through a crack in the boards he took off his coat and placed it gently over her shoulders  molly  she looked up with wet eyes  molly dear what is it  i mustnt it isnt right  i dont understand  i mustnt jimmy  he moved cautiously forward holding the rail till he was at her side and took her in his arms  what is it dear tell me  she clung to him without speaking  you arent worrying about him are youabout dreever theres nothing to worry about itll be quite easy and simple ill tell him if you like he knows you dont care for him and besides theres a girl in london that he  no no its not that  what is it dear whats troubling you  jimmy she stopped  he waited  yes  jimmy my father wouldntfatherfatherdoesnt  doesnt like me  she nodded miserably  a great wave of relief swept over jimmy he had imaginedhe hardly knew what he had imagined some vast insuperable obstacle some tremendous catastrophe whirling them asunder he could have laughed aloud in his happiness so this was it this was the cloud that brooded over themthat mr mceachern did not like him the angel guarding eden with a fiery sword had changed into a policeman with a truncheon  he must learn to love me he said lightly  she looked at him hopelessly he could not see he could not understand and how could she tell him her fathers words rang in her brain he was crooked he was here on some game he was being watched but she loved him she loved him oh how could she make him understand  she clung tighter to him trembling he became serious again dear you mustnt worry he said it cant be helped hell come round once were married  no no oh cant you understand i couldnt i couldnt  jimmys face whitened he looked at her anxiously  but dear he said you cantdo you mean to saywill that he searched for a wordstop you he concluded  it must she whispered  a cold hand clutched at his heart his world was falling to pieces crumbling under his eyes  butbut you love me he said slowly it was as if he were trying to find the key to a puzzle idont see  you couldnt you cant youre a man you dont know its so different for a man hes brought up all his life with the idea of leaving home he goes away naturally  but dear you couldnt live at home all your life whoever you married  but this would be different father would never speak to me again i should never see him again he would go right out of my life jimmy i couldnt a girl cant cut away twenty years of her life and start fresh like that i should be haunted i should make you miserable every day a hundred little things would remind me of him and i shouldnt be strong enough to resist them you dont know how fond he is of me how good he has always been ever since i can remember weve been such friends youve only seen the outside of him and i know how different that is from what he really is all his life he has thought only of me he has told me things about himself which nobody else dreams of and i know that all these years he has been working just for me jimmy you dont hate me for saying this do you  go on he said drawing her closer to him  i cant remember my mother she died when i was quite little so he and i have been the only onestill you came  memories of those early days crowded her mind as she spoke making her voice tremble halfforgotten trifles many of them fraught with the glamour and fragrance of past happiness  we have always been together he trusted me and i trusted him and we saw things through together when i was ill he used to sit up all night with me night after night onceid only got a little fever really but i thought i was terribly badi heard him come in late and called out to him and he came straight in and sat and held my hand all through the night and it was only by accident i found out later that it had been raining and that he was soaked through it might have killed him we were partners jimmy dear i couldnt do anything to hurt him now could i it wouldnt be square  jimmy had turned away his head for fear his face might betray what he was feeling he was in a hell of unreasoning jealousy he wanted her body and soul and every word she said bit like a raw wound a moment before and he had felt that she belonged to him now in the first shock of reaction he saw himself a stranger an intruder a trespasser on holy ground  she saw the movement and her intuition put her in touch with his thoughts  no no she cried no jimmy not that  their eyes met and he was satisfied  they sat there silent the rain had lessened its force and was falling now in a gentle shower a strip of blue sky pale and watery showed through the gray over the hills on the island close behind them a thrush had begun to sing  what are we to do she said at last what can we do  we must wait he said it will all come right it must nothing can stop us now  the rain had ceased the blue had routed the gray and driven it from the sky the sun low down in the west shone out bravely over the lake the air was cool and fresh  jimmys spirits rose with a bound he accepted the omen this was the world as it really was smiling and friendly not gray as he had fancied it he had won nothing could alter that what remained to be done was trivial he wondered how he could ever have allowed it to weigh upon him  after awhile he pushed the boat out of its shelter on to the glittering water and seized the paddle  we must be getting back he said i wonder what the time is i wish we could stay out forever but it must be late molly  yes  whatever happens youll break off this engagement with dreever shall i tell him i will if you like  no i will ill write him a note if i dont see him before dinner  jimmy paddled on a few strokes  its no good he said suddenly i cant keep it in molly do you mind if i sing a bar or two ive got a beastly voice but im feeling rather happy ill stop as soon as i can  he raised his voice discordantly  covertly from beneath the shade of her big hat molly watched him with troubled eyes the sun had gone down behind the hills and the water had ceased to glitter there was a suggestion of chill in the air the great mass of the castle frowned down upon them dark and forbidding in the dim light  she shivered     chapter xx  a lesson in picquet   lord dreever meanwhile having left the waterside lighted a cigarette and proceeded to make a reflective tour of the grounds he felt aggrieved with the world mollys desertion in the canoe with jimmy did not trouble him he had other sorrows one is never at ones best and sunniest when one has been forced by a ruthless uncle into abandoning the girl one loves and becoming engaged to another to whom one is indifferent something of a jaundiced tinge stains ones outlook on life in such circumstances moreover lord dreever was not by nature an introspective young man but examining his position as he walked along he found himself wondering whether it was not a little unheroic he came to the conclusion that perhaps it was of course uncle thomas could make it deucedly unpleasant for him if he kicked that was the trouble if only he had evensay a couple of thousands a year of his ownhe might make a fight for it but dash it uncle tom could cut off supplies to such a frightful extent if there was trouble that he would have to go on living at dreever indefinitely without so much as a fearful quid to call his own  imagination boggled at the prospect in the summer and autumn when there was shooting his lordship was not indisposed to a stay at the home of his fathers but all the year round better a broken heart inside the radius than a sound one in the country in the winter  but by gad mused his lordship if i had as much as a coupleyes dash it even a couple of thousand a year id chance it and ask katie to marry me dashed if i wouldnt  he walked on drawing thoughtfully at his cigarette the more he reviewed the situation the less he liked it there was only one bright spot in it and this was the feeling that now money must surely get a shade less tight extracting the precious ore from sir thomas hitherto had been like pulling backteeth out of a bulldog but now on the strength of this infernal engagement surely the uncle might reasonably be expected to scatter largesse to some extent  his lordship was just wondering whether if approached in a softened mood the other might not disgorge something quite big when a large warm raindrop fell on his hand from the bushes round about came an ever increasing patter the sky was leaden  he looked round him for shelter he had reached the rosegarden in the course of his perambulations at the far end was a summerhouse he turned up his coatcollar and ran  as he drew near he heard a slow and dirgelike whistling proceeding from the interior plunging in out of breath just as the deluge began he found hargate seated at the little wooden table with an earnest expression on his face the table was covered with cards hargate had not yet been compelled to sprain his wrist having adopted the alternative of merely refusing invitations to play billiards  hello hargate said his lordship isnt it coming down by jove  hargate glanced up nodded without speaking and turned his attention to the cards once more he took one from the pack in his left hand looked at it hesitated for a moment as if doubtful whereabouts on the table it would produce the most artistic effect and finally put it face upward then he moved another card from the table and put it on top of the other one throughout the performance he whistled painfully  his lordship regarded his guest with annoyance  that looks frightfully exciting he said disparagingly what are you playing at patience  hargate nodded again this time without looking up  oh dont sit there looking like a frog said lord dreever irritably talk man  hargate gathered up the cards and proceeded to shuffle them in a meditative manner whistling the while  oh stop it said his lordship  hargate nodded and obediently put down the deck  look here said lord dreever this is boring me stiff lets have a game of something anything to pass away the time curse this rain we shall be cooped up here till dinner at this rate ever played picquet i could teach it you in five minutes  a look almost of awe came into hargates face the look of one who sees a miracle performed before his eyes for years he had been using all the large stock of diplomacy at his command to induce callow youths to play picquet with him and here was thisadmirable young man this pearl among young men positively offering to teach him the game it was too much happiness what had he done to deserve this he felt as a toilworn lion might feel if some antelope instead of making its customary beeline for the horizon were to trot up and insert its head between his jaws  ii shouldnt mind being shown the idea he said  he listened attentively while lord dreever explained at some length the principles that govern the game of picquet every now and then he asked a question it was evident that he was beginning to grasp the idea of the game  what exactly is repiquing he asked as his lordship paused  its like this said his lordship returning to his lecture  yes i see now said the neophyte  they began playing lord dreever as was only to be expected in a contest between teacher and student won the first two hands hargate won the next  ive got the hang of it all right now he said complacently its a simple sort of game make it more exciting dont you think if we played for something  all right said lord dreever slowly if you like  he would not have suggested it himself but after all dash it if the man really asked for itit was not his fault if the winning of a hand should have given the fellow the impression that he knew all there was to be known about picquet of course picquet was a game where skill was practically bound to win butafter all hargate probably had plenty of money he could afford it  all right said his lordship again how much  something fairly moderate ten bob a hundred  there is no doubt that his lordship ought at this suggestion to have corrected the novices notion that ten shillings a hundred was fairly moderate he knew that it was possible for a poor player to lose four hundred points in a twenty minutes game and usual for him to lose two hundred but he let the thing go  very well he said  twenty minutes later hargate was looking somewhat ruefully at the scoresheet i owe you eighteen shillings he said shall i pay you now or shall we settle up in a lump after weve finished  what about stopping now said lord dreever its quite fine out  no lets go on ive nothing to do till dinner and i dont suppose you have  his lordships conscience made one last effort  youd much better stop you know hargate really he said you can lose a frightful lot at this game  my dear dreever said hargate stiffly i can look after myself thanks of course if you think you are risking too much by all means  oh if you dont mind said his lordship outraged im only too frightfully pleased only remember i warned you  ill bear it in mind by the way before we start care to make it a sovereign a hundred  lord dreever could not afford to play picquet for a sovereign a hundred or indeed to play picquet for money at all but after his adversarys innuendo it was impossible for a young gentleman of spirit to admit the humiliating fact he nodded  about time i fancy said hargate looking at his watch an hour later that we were going in to dress for dinner  his lordship made no reply he was wrapped in thought  lets see thats twenty pounds you owe me isnt it continued hargate shocking bad luck you had  they went out into the rosegarden  jolly everything smells after the rain said hargate who seemed to have struck a conversational patch freshened everything up  his lordship did not appear to have noticed it he seemed to be thinking of something else his air was pensive and abstracted  theres just time said hargate looking at his watch again for a short stroll i want to have a talk with you  oh said lord dreever  his air did not belie his feelings he looked pensive and was pensive it was deuced awkward this twenty pounds business  hargate was watching him covertly it was his business to know other peoples business and he knew that lord dreever was impecunious and depended for supplies entirely on a prehensile uncle for the success of the proposal he was about to make he depended on this fact  whos this man pitt asked hargate  oh pal of mine said his lordship why  i cant stand the fellow  i think hes a good chap said his lordship in fact remembering jimmys good samaritanism i know he is why dont you like him  i dont know i dont  oh said his lordship indifferently he was in no mood to listen to the likes and dislikes of other men  look here dreever said hargate i want you to do something for me i want you to get pitt out of the place  lord dreever eyed his guest curiously  eh he said  hargate repeated his remark  you seem to have mapped out quite a program for me said lord dreever  get him out of it continued hargate vehemently jimmys prohibition against billiards had hit him hard he was suffering the torments of tantalus the castle was full of young men of the kind to whom he most resorted easy marks every one and here he was simply through jimmy careened like a disabled battleship it was maddening make him go you invited him here he doesnt expect to stop indefinitely i suppose if you left hed have to too what you must do is to go back to london tomorrow you can easily make some excuse hell have to go with you then you can drop him in london and come back thats what you must do  a delicate pink flush might have been seen to spread itself over lord dreevers face he began to look like an angry rabbit he had not a great deal of pride in his composition but the thought of the ignominious role that hargate was sketching out for him stirred what he had to its shallow bottom talking on hargate managed to add the last straw  of course he said that money you lost to me at picquetwhat was it twenty twenty pounds wasnt it well we would look on that as canceled of course that will be all right  his lordship exploded  will it he cried pink to the ears will it by george ill pay you every frightful penny of it tomorrow and then you can clear out instead of pitt what do you take me for i should like to know  a fool if you refuse my offer  ive a jolly good mind to give you a most frightful kicking  i shouldnt try if i were you its not the sort of game youd shine at better stick to picquet  if you think i cant pay your rotten money  i do but if you can so much the better money is always useful  i may be a fool in some ways  you understate it my dear man  but im not a cad  youre getting quite rosy dreever wrath is good for the complexion  and if you think you can bribe me you never made a bigger mistake in your life  yes i did said hargate when i thought you had some glimmerings of intelligence but if it gives you any pleasure to behave like the juvenile lead in a melodrama by all means do personally i shouldnt have thought the game would be worth the candle but if your keen sense of honor compels you to pay the twenty pounds all right you mentioned tomorrow that will suit me so well let it go it at that  he walked off leaving lord dreever filled with the comfortable glow that comes to the weak man who for once has displayed determination he felt that he must not go back from his dignified standpoint that money would have to be paid and on the morrow hargate was the sort of man who could and would make it exceedingly unpleasant for him if he failed a debt of honor was not a thing to be trifled with  but he felt quite safe he knew he could get the money when he pleased it showed he reflected philosophically how out of evil cometh good his greater misfortune the engagement would as it were neutralize the less for it was ridiculous to suppose that sir thomas having seen his ends accomplished and being presumably in a spacious mood in consequence would not be amenable to a request for a mere twenty pounds  he went on into the hall he felt strong and capable he had shown hargate the stuff there was in him he was spennie dreever the man of blood and iron the man with whom it were best not to trifle but it was really come to think of it uncommonly lucky that he was engaged to molly he recoiled from the idea of attempting unfortified by that fact to extract twenty pounds from sir thomas for a carddebt  in the hall he met saunders  i have been looking for your lordship said the butler  eh well here i am  just so your lordship miss mceachern entrusted me with this note to deliver to you in the event of her not being hable to see you before dinner personally your lordship  right ho thanks  he started to go upstairs opening the envelope as he went what could the girl be writing to him about surely she wasnt going to start sending him loveletters or any of that frightful rot deuced difficult it would be to play up to that sort of thing  he stopped on the first landing to read the note and at the opening line his jaw fell the envelope fluttered to the ground  oh my sainted aunt he moaned clutching at the banisters now i am in the soup     chapter xxi  loathsome gifts   there are doubtless men so constructed that they can find themselves accepted suitors without any particular whirl of emotion king solomon probably belonged to this class and even henry the eighth must have become a trifle blase in time but to the average man the sensations are complex and overwhelming a certain stunned feeling is perhaps predominant blended with this is relief the relief of a general who has brought a difficult campaign to a successful end or of a member of a forlorn hope who finds that the danger is over and that he is still alive to this must be added a newly born sense of magnificence our suspicion that we were something rather out of the ordinary run of men is suddenly confirmed our bosom heaves with complacency and the world has nothing more to offer  with some there is an alloy of apprehension in the metal of their happiness and the strain of an engagement sometimes brings with it even a faint shadow of regret she makes me buy things one swain in the third quarter of his engagement was overheard to moan to a friend two new ties only yesterday he seemed to be debating with himself whether human nature could stand the strain  but whatever tragedies may cloud the end of the period its beginning at least is bathed in sunshine  jimmy regarding his lathered face in the glass as he dressed for dinner that night marveled at the excellence of this best of all possible worlds  no doubts disturbed him that the relations between mr mceachern and himself offered a permanent bar to his prospects he did not believe for the moment he declined to consider the existence of the exconstable at all in a world that contained molly there was no room for other people they were not in the picture they did not exist  to him musing contentedly over the goodness of life there entered in the furtive manner habitual to that unreclaimed buccaneer spike mullins it may have been that jimmy read his own satisfaction and happiness into the faces of others but it certainly seemed to him that there was a sort of restrained joyousness about spikes demeanor the bowery boys shuffles on the carpet were almost a dance his face seemed to glow beneath his crimson hair  well said jimmy and how goes the world with young lord fitzmullins spike have you ever been best man  whats dat boss  best man at a wedding chap who stands by the bridegroom with a hand on the scruff of his neck to see that he goes through with it fellow who looks after everything crowds the money on to the minister at the end of the ceremony and then goes off and mayries the first bridesmaid and lives happily ever  spike shook his head  i aint got no use for gittin married boss  spike the misogynist you wait spike some day love will awake in your heart and youll start writing poetry  ise not dat kind of mug boss protested the bowery boy i aint got no use fer goils its a mutts game  this was rank heresy jimmy laid down the razor from motives of prudence and proceeded to lighten spikes reprehensible darkness  spike youre an ass he said you dont know anything about it if you had any sense at all youd understand that the only thing worth doing in life is to get married you boneheaded bachelors make me sick think what it would mean to you having a wife think of going out on a cold winters night to crack a crib knowing that there would be a cup of hot soup waiting for you when you got back and your slippers all warmed and comfortable and then shed sit on your knee and youd tell her how you shot the policeman and youd examine the swag together why i cant imagine anything cozier perhaps there would be little spikes running about the house cant you see them jumping with joy as you slid in through the window and told the great news fahzers killed a pleeceman cry the tiny eager voices candy is served out all round in honor of the event goldenhaired little jimmy mullins my godson gets a dime for having thrown a stone at a plainclothes detective that afternoon all is joy and wholesome revelry take my word for it spike theres nothing like domesticity  dere was a goil once said spike meditatively only i was never her steady she married a cop  she wasnt worthy of you spike said jimmy sympathetically a girl capable of going to the bad like that would never have done for you you must pick some nice sympathetic girl with a romantic admiration for your line of business meanwhile let me finish shaving or i shall be late for dinner great doings on tonight spike  spike became animated  sure boss i dats just what  if you could collect all the blue blood that will be under this roof tonight spike into one vat youd be able to start a dyeingworks dont try though they mightnt like it by the way have you seen anything moreof course you have what i mean is have you talked at all with that valet man the one you think is a detective  why boss dats just  i hope for his own sake hes a better performer than my old friend galer that man is getting on my nerves spike he pursues me like a smelldog i expect hes lurking out in the passage now did you see him  did i boss why  jimmy inspected spike gravely  spike he said theres something on your mind youre trying to say something what is it out with it  spikes excitement vented itself in a rush of words  gee boss theres bin doins tonight fer fair  me cocos still buzzin sure ting why say when i was to sir tummas dressinroom dis afternoon  what  surest ting you know just before de storm come on when it was all as dark as could be well i was  jimmy interrupted  in sir thomass dressingroom what the  spike looked somewhat embarrassed he grinned apologetically and shuffled his feet  ive got dem boss he said with a smirk  got them got what  dese  spike plunged a hand in a pocket and drew forth in a glittering mass lady julia blunts rope of diamonds     chapter xxii  two of a trade disagree   one hundred tousand plunks murmured spike gazing lovingly at them i says to myself de boss aint got no time to be gittin after dem himself hes too busy dese days wit jollyin along de swells so its up to me i says cos de bossll be tickled to deat all right all right if we can git away wit dem so i  jimmy gave tongue with an energy that amazed his faithful follower the nightmare horror of the situation had affected him much as a sudden blow in the parts about the waistcoat might have done but now as spike would have said he caught up with his breath the smirk faded slowly from the others face as he listened not even in the bowery full as it was of candid friends had he listened to such a trenchant summingup of his mental and moral deficiencies  boss he protested  thats just a sketchy outline said jimmy pausing for breath i cant do you justice impromptu like thisyoure too vast and overwhelming  but boss whats eatin you aint youse tickled  tickled jimmy sawed the air tickled you lunatic cant you see what youve done  ive got dem said spike whose mind was not readily receptive of new ideas it seemed to him that jimmy missed the main point  didnt i tell you there was nothing doing when you wanted to take those things the other day  spikes face cleared as he had suspected jimmy had missed the point  why say boss yes sure but dose was little dinky tings of course youse wouldnt stand fer swipin chickenfeed like dem but dese is different dese dimonds is boids its one hundred tousand plunks fer dese  spike said jimmy with painful calm  huh  will you listen for a moment  sure  i know its practically hopeless to get an idea into your head one wants a proper outfitdrills blastingpowder and so on but theres just a chance perhaps if i talk slowly has it occurred to you spike my bonny blueeyed spike that every other man more or less in this stately home of england is a detective who has probably received instructions to watch you like a lynx do you imagine that your blameless past is a sufficient safeguard i suppose you think that these detectives will say to themselves now whom shall we suspect we must leave out spike mullins of course because he naturally wouldnt dream of doing such a thing it cant be dear old spike whos got the stuff  but boss interposed spike brightly i aint dats right i aint got it youse has  jimmy looked at the speaker with admiration after all there was a breezy delirium about spikes methods of thought that was rather stimulating when you got used to it the worst of it was that it did not fit in with practical everyday life under different conditionssay during convivial evenings at bloomingdalehe could imagine the bowery boy being a charming companion how pleasantly for instance such remarks as that last would while away the monotony of a padded cell  but laddie he said with steely affection listen once more reflect ponder does it not seep into your consciousness that we are as it were subtly connected in this house in the minds of certain bad persons are we not imagined by mr mceachern for instance to be working handinhand like brothers do you fancy that mr mceachern chatting with his tame sleuthhound over their cigars will have been reticent on this point i think not how do you propose to baffle that gentlemanly sleuth spike who i may mention once again has rarely moved more than two yards away from me since his arrival  an involuntary chuckle escaped spike  sure boss dats all right  all right is it well well what makes you think it is all right  why say boss dose sleuts is out of business a merry grin split spikes face its funny boss gee its got a circus skinned listen deys bin an arrest each other  jimmy moodily revised his former view even in bloomingdale this sort of thing would be coldly received genius must ever walk alone spike would have to get along without hope of meeting a kindred spirit another fellowbeing in tune with his brainprocesses  dats right chuckled spike leastways it aint  no no said jimmy soothingly i quite understand  its dis way boss one of dem has bin an arrest de odder mug dey had a scrap

me it is my bright brainy persevering friend galer who has been handcuffed and locked in the coalcellar  spike grinned broadly  sure dats right he said  its a judgment said jimmy delightedly thats what it is no man has a right to be such a consummate ass as galer it isnt decent  there had been moments when mceacherns faithful employee had filled jimmy with an odd sort of fury a kind of hurt pride almost to the extent of making him wish that he really could have been the desperado mceachern fancied him never in his life before had he sat still under a challenge and this espionage had been one behind the clumsy watcher he had seen always the selfsatisfied figure of mceachern if there had been anything subtle about the man from dodsons he could have forgiven him but there was not years of practise had left spike with a sort of sixth sense as regarded representatives of the law he could pierce the most cunning disguise but in the case of galer even jimmy could detect the detective  go on he said  spike proceeded  well de odder mug de one down an out on de floor wit de irons on  galer in fact said jimmy handsome dashing galer  sure well hes too busy catchin up wit his breat to

this is it but in this hour of mirth and goodwill we must not forget  spike interrupted pleased by the enthusiastic reception of his narrative he proceeded to point out the morals that were to be deduced therefrom  so youse see boss he said its all to de merry when dey rubbers for de jools an finds dem gone deyll tink dis galer guy swiped dem dey wont tink of us  jimmy looked at the speaker gravely  of course said he what a reasoner you are spike galer was just opening the door from the outside by your account when the valet man sprang at him naturally theyll think that he took the jewels especially as they wont find them on him a man who can open a locked safe through a closed door is just the sort of fellow who would be able to get rid of the swag neatly while rolling about the floor with the valet his not having the jewels will make the case all the blacker against him and what will make them still more certain that he is the thief is that he really is a detective spike you ought to be in some sort of a home you know  the bowery boy looked disturbed  i didnt tink of dat boss he admitted  of course not one cant think of everything now if you will just hand me those diamonds i will put them back where they belong  put dem back boss  what else would you propose id get you to do it only i dont think putting things back is quite in your line  spike handed over the jewels the boss was the boss and what he said went but his demeanor was tragic telling eloquently of hopes blighted  jimmy took the necklace with something of a thrill he was a connoisseur of jewels and a fine gem affected him much as a fine picture affects the artistic he ran the diamonds through his fingers then scrutinized them again more closely this time  spike watched him with a slight return of hope it seemed to him that the boss was wavering perhaps now that he had actually handled the jewels he would find it impossible to give them up to spike a diamond necklace of cunning workmanship was merely the equivalent of so many plunks but he knew that there were men otherwise sane who valued a jewel for its own sake  its a boid of a necklace boss he murmured encouragingly  it is said jimmy in its way ive never seen anything much better sir thomas will be glad to have it back  den youre goin to put it back boss  i am said jimmy ill do it just before the theatricals there should be a chance then theres one good thing this afternoons affair will have cleared the air of sleuthhounds a little     chapter xxiii  family jars   hildebrand spencer poynt de burgh john hannasyde coombecrombie twelfth earl of dreever was feeling like a toad under the harrow he read the letter again but a second perusal made it no better very briefly and clearly molly had broken off the engagement she thought it best she was afraid it could make neither of us happy all very true thought his lordship miserably his sentiments to a t at the proper time he would have liked nothing better but why seize for this declaration the precise moment when he was intending on the strength of the engagement to separate his uncle from twenty pounds that was what rankled that molly could have no knowledge of his sad condition did not occur to him he had a sort of feeling that she ought to have known by instinct nature as has been pointed out had equipped hildebrand spencer poynt de burgh with one of those cheapsubstitute minds what passed for brain in him was to genuine gray matter as justasgood imitation coffee is to real mocha in moments of emotion and mental stress consequently his reasoning like spikes was apt to be in a class of its own  he read the letter for the third time and a gentle perspiration began to form on his forehead this was awful the presumable jubilation of katie the penniless ripper of the savoy when he should present himself to her a free man did not enter into the mental picture that was unfolding before him she was too remote between him and her lay the fearsome figure of sir thomas rampant filling the entire horizon nor is this to be wondered at there was probably a brief space during which perseus concentrating his gaze upon the monster did not see andromeda and a knight of the middle ages jousting in the gentlemens singles for a smile from his lady rarely allowed the thought of that smile to occupy his whole mind at the moment when his boilerplated antagonist was descending upon him in the wake of a sharp spear  so with spennie dreever bright eyes might shine for him when all was over but in the meantime what seemed to him more important was that bulging eyes would glare  if only this had happened latereven a day later the reckless impulsiveness of the modern girl had undone him how was he to pay hargate the money hargate must be paid that was certain no other course was possible lord dreevers was not one of those natures that fret restlessly under debt during his early career at college he had endeared himself to the local tradesmen by the magnitude of the liabilities he had contracted with them it was not the being in debt that he minded it was the consequences hargate he felt instinctively was of a revengeful nature he had given hargate twenty pounds worth of snubbing and the latter had presented the bills if it were not paid things would happen hargate and he were members of the same club and a member of a club who loses money at cards to a fellow member and fails to settle up does not make himself popular with the committee  he must get the money there was no avoiding that conclusion but how  financially his lordship was like a fallen country with a glorious history there had been a time during his first two years at college when he had reveled in the luxury of a handsome allowance this was the golden age when sir thomas blunt being so to speak new to the job and feeling that having reached the best circles he must live up to them had scattered largesse lavishly for two years after his marriage with lady julia he had maintained this admirable standard crushing his natural parsimony he had regarded the money so spent as capital sunk in an investment by the end of the second year he had found his feet and began to look about him for ways of retrenchment his lordships allowance was an obvious way he had not to wait long for an excuse for annihilating it there is a game called poker at which a man without much control over his features may exceed the limits of the handsomest allowance his lordships face during a game of poker was like the surface of some quiet pond ruffled by every breeze the blank despair of his expression when he held bad cards made bluffing expensive the honest joy that bubbled over in his eyes when his hand was good acted as an efficient dangersignal to his grateful opponents two weeks of poker had led to his writing to his uncle a distressed but confident request for more funds and the avuncular foot had come down with a joyous bang taking his stand on the evils of gambling sir thomas had changed the conditions of the moneymarket for his nephew with a thoroughness that effectually prevented the possibility of the youths being again caught by the fascinations of poker the allowance vanished absolutely and in its place there came into being an arrangement by this his lordship was to have whatever money he wished but he must ask for it and state why it was needed if the request were reasonable the cash would be forthcoming if preposterous it would not the flaw in the scheme from his lordships point of view was the difference of opinion that can exist in the minds of two men as to what the words reasonable and preposterous may be taken to mean  twenty pounds for instance would in the lexicon of sir thomas blunt be perfectly reasonable for the current expenses of a man engaged to molly mceachern but preposterous for one to whom she had declined to remain engaged it is these subtle shades of meaning that make the english language so full of pitfalls for the foreigner  so engrossed was his lordship in his meditations that a voice spoke at his elbow ere he became aware of sir thomas himself standing by his side  well spennie my boy said the knight time to dress for dinner i think eh eh  he was plainly in high good humor the thought of the distinguished company he was to entertain that night had changed him temporarily as with some wave of a fairy wand into a thing of joviality and benevolence one could almost hear the milk of human kindness gurgling and splashing within him the irony of fate tonight such was his mood a dutiful nephew could have come and felt in his pockets and helped himselfif circumstances had been different oh woman woman how you bar us from paradise  his lordship gurgled a wordless reply thrusting the fateful letter hastily into his pocket he would break the news anon soonnot yetlater onin fact anon  up in your part my boy continued sir thomas you mustnt spoil the play by forgetting your lines that wouldnt do  his eye was caught by the envelope that spennie had dropped a momentary lapse from the jovial and benevolent was the result his fussy little soul abhorred small untidinesses  dear me he said stooping i wish people would not drop paper about the house i cannot endure a litter he spoke as if somebody had been playing hareandhounds and scattering the scent on the stairs this sort of thing sometimes made him regret the old days in blunts stores rule sixtyseven imposed a fine of halfacrown on employees convicted of paperdropping  i began his lordship  whysir thomas straightened himselfits addressed to you  i was just going to pick it up itserthere was a note in it  sir thomas gazed at the envelope again joviality and benevolence resumed their thrones  and in a feminine handwriting he chuckled he eyed the limp peer almost roguishly i see i see he said very charming quite delightful girls must have their little romance i suppose you two young people are exchanging loveletters all day delightful quite delightful dont look as if you were ashamed of it my boy i like it i think its charming  undoubtedly this was the opening beyond a question his lordship should have said at this point  uncle i cannot tell a lie i cannot even allow myself to see you laboring under a delusion which a word from me can remove the contents of this note are not what you suppose they run as follows  what he did say was  uncle can you let me have twenty pounds  those were his amazing words they slipped out he could not stop them  sir thomas was taken aback for an instant but not seriously he started as might a man who stroking a cat receives a sudden but trifling scratch  twenty pounds eh he said reflectively  then the milk of human kindness swept over displeasure like a tidal wave this was a night for rich gifts to the deserving  why certainly my boy certainly do you want it at once  his lordship replied that he did please and he had seldom said anything more fervently  well well well see what we can do come with me  he led the way to his dressingroom like nearly all the rooms at the castle it was large one wall was completely hidden by the curtain behind which spike had taken refuge that afternoon  sir thomas went to the dressingtable and unlocked a small drawer  twenty you said five ten fifteenhere you are my boy  lord dreever muttered his thanks sir thomas accepted the guttural acknowledgment with a friendly pat on the shoulder  i like a little touch like that he said  his lordship looked startled  i wouldnt have touched you he began if it hadnt been  a little touch like that letterwriting sir thomas went on it shows a warm heart she is a warmhearted girl spennie a charming warmhearted girl youre uncommonly lucky my boy  his lordship crackling the four banknotes silently agreed with him  but come i must be dressing dear me it is very late we shall have to hurry by the way my boy i shall take the opportunity of making a public announcement of the engagement tonight it will be a capital occasion for it i think perhaps at the conclusion of the theatricals a little speechsomething quite impromptu and informal just asking them to wish you happiness and so on i like the idea there is an oldworld air about it that appeals to me yes  he turned to the dressingtable and removed his collar  well run along my boy he said you must not be late his lordship tottered from the room  he did quite an unprecedented amount of thinking as he hurried into his evening clothes but the thought occurring most frequently was that whatever happened all was well in one way at any rate he had the twenty pounds there would be something colossal in the shape of disturbances when his uncle learned the truth it would be the biggest thing since the san francisco earthquake but what of it he had the money  he slipped it into his waistcoatpocket he would take it down with him and pay hargate directly after dinner  he left the room the flutter of a skirt caught his eye as he reached the landing a girl was coming down the corridor on the other side he waited at the head of the stairs to let her go down before him as she came on to the landing he saw that it was molly  for a moment there was an awkward pause  eri got your note said his lordship  she looked at him and then burst out laughing  you know you dont mind the least little bit she said not a scrap now do you  well you see  dont make excuses do you  well its like this you see i  he caught her eye next moment they were laughing together  no but look here you know said his lordship what i mean is it isnt that i donti mean look here theres no reason why we shouldnt be the best of pals  why of course there isnt  no really i say thats ripping shake hands on it  they clasped hands and it was in this affecting attitude that sir thomas blunt bustling downstairs discovered them  aha he cried archly well well well but dont mind me dont mind me  molly flushed uncomfortably partly because she disliked sir thomas even when he was not arch and hated him when he was partly because she felt foolish and principally because she was bewildered she had not looked forward to meeting sir thomas that night it was always unpleasant to meet him but it would be more unpleasant than usual after she had upset the scheme for which he had worked so earnestly she had wondered whether he would be cold and distant or voluble and heated in her pessimistic moments she had anticipated a long and painful scene that he should be behaving like this was not very much short of a miracle she could not understand it  a glance at lord dreever enlightened her that miserable creature was wearing the air of a timid child about to pull a large cracker he seemed to be bracing himself up for an explosion  she pitied him sincerely so he had not told his uncle the news yet of course he had scarcely had time saunders must have given him the note as he was going up to dress  there was however no use in prolonging the agony sir thomas must be told sooner or later she was glad of the chance to tell him herself she would be able to explain that it was all her doing  im afraid theres a mistake she said  eh said sir thomas  ive been thinking it over and i came to the conclusion that we werentwell i broke off the engagement  sir thomas always prominent eyes protruded still further the color of his florid face deepened suddenly he chuckled  molly looked at him amazed sir thomas was indeed behaving unexpectedly tonight  i see it he wheezed youre having a joke with me so this is what you were hatching as i came downstairs dont tell me if you had really thrown him over you wouldnt have been laughing together like that its no good my dear i might have been taken in if i had not seen you but i did  no no cried molly youre wrong youre quite wrong when you saw us we were just agreeing that we should be very good friends that was all i broke off the engagement before that i  she was aware that his lordship had emitted a hollow croak but she took it as his method of endorsing her statement not as a warning  i wrote lord dreever a note this evening she went on telling him that i couldnt possibly  she broke off in alarm with the beginning of her last speech sir thomas had begun to swell until now he looked as if he were in imminent danger of bursting his face was purple to mollys lively imagination his eyes appeared to move slowly out of his head like a snails from the back of his throat came strange noises  ssso he stammered  he gulped and tried again  so this he said so this so that was what was in that letter eh  lord dreever a limp bundle against the banisters smiled weakly  eh yelled sir thomas  his lordship started convulsively  er yes he said yes yes that was it dont you know  sir thomas eyed his nephew with a baleful stare molly looked from one to the other in bewilderment  there was a pause during which sir thomas seemed partially to recover command of himself doubts as to the propriety of a family row in midstairs appeared to occur to him he moved forward  come with me he said with awful curtness  his lordship followed bonelessly molly watched them go and wondered more than ever there was something behind this it was not merely the breakingoff of the engagement that had roused sir thomas he was not a just man but he was just enough to be able to see that the blame was not lord dreevers there had been something more she was puzzled  in the hall saunders was standing weapon in hand about to beat the gong  not yet snapped sir thomas wait  dinner had been ordered especially early that night because of the theatricals the necessity for strict punctuality had been straitly enjoined upon saunders at some inconvenience he had ensured strict punctuality and nowbut we all have our cross to bear in this world saunders bowed with dignified resignation  sir thomas led the way into his study  be so good as to close the door he said  his lordship was so good  sir thomas backed to the mantelpiece and stood there in the attitude which for generations has been sacred to the elderly briton feet well apart hands clasped beneath his coattails his stare raked lord dreever like a searchlight  now sir he said  his lordship wilted before the gaze  the fact is uncle  never mind the facts i know them what i require is an explanation  he spread his feet further apart the years had rolled back and he was plain thomas blunt again of blunts stores dealing with an erring employee  you know what i mean he went on i am not referring to the breakingoff of the engagement what i insist upon learning is your reason for failing to inform me earlier of the contents of that letter  his lordship said that somehow dont you know there didnt seem to be a chance you know he had several times been on the pointbutwell somehowwell thats how it was  no chance cried sir thomas indeed why did you require that money i gave you  oh eri wanted it for something  very possibly for what  ithe fact is i owed it to a fellow  ha how did you come to owe it  his lordship shuffled  you have been gambling boomed sit thomas am i right  no no i say no no it wasnt gambling it was a game of skill we were playing picquet  kindly refrain from quibbling you lost this money at cards then as i supposed just so  he widened the space between his feet he intensified his glare he might have been posing to an illustrator of pilgrims progress for a picture of apollyon straddling right across the way  so he said you deliberately concealed from me the contents of that letter in order that you might extract money from me under false pretenses dont speak his lordship had gurgled you did your behavior was that of aof a  there was a very fair selection of evildoers in all branches of business from which to choose he gave the preference to the racetrack  of a common welsher he concluded but i wont put up with it no not for an instant i insist upon your returning that money to me here and now if you have not got it with you go and fetch it  his lordships face betrayed the deepest consternation he had been prepared for much but not for this that he would have to undergo what in his schooldays he would have called a jaw was inevitable and he had been ready to go through with it it might hurt his feelings possibly but it would leave his purse intact a ghastly development of this kind he had not foreseen  but i say uncle he bleated  sir thomas silenced him with a grand gesture  ruefully his lordship produced his little all sir thomas took it with a snort and went to the door  saunders was still brooding statuesquely over the gong  sound it said sir thomas  saunders obeyed him with the air of an unleashed hound  and now said sir thomas go to my dressingroom and place these notes in the small drawer of the table  the butlers calm expressionless yet withal observant eye took in at a glance the signs of trouble neither the inflated air of sir thomas nor the puncturedballoon bearing of lord dreever escaped him  something hup he said to his immortal soul as he moved upstairs been a fair old rare old row seems to me  he reserved his more polished periods for use in public in conversation with his immortal soul he was wont to unbend somewhat     chapter xxiv  the treasure seeker   gloom wrapped his lordship about during dinner as with a garment he owed twenty pounds his assets amounted to seven shillings and fourpence he thought and thought again quite an intellectual pallor began to appear on his normally pink cheeks saunders silently sympathetiche hated sir thomas as an interloper and entertained for his lordship under whose father also he had served a sort of paternal fondnesswas ever at his elbow with the magic bottle and to spennie emptying and reemptying his glass almost mechanically wine the healer brought an idea to obtain twenty pounds from any one person of his acquaintance was impossible to divide the twenty by four and persuade a generous quartette to contribute five pounds apiece was more feasible  hope began to stir within him again  immediately after dinner he began to flit about the castle like a family specter of active habits the first person he met was charteris  hullo spennie said charteris i wanted to see you it is currently reported that you are in love at dinner you looked as if you had influenza whats your trouble for goodness sake bear up till the shows over dont go swooning on the stage or anything do you know your lines  the fact is said his lordship eagerly its this way i happen to wantcan you lend me a fiver  all i have in the world at this moment said charteris is eleven shillings and a postagestamp if the stamp would be of any use to you as a start no you know its from small beginnings like that that great fortunes are amassed however  two minutes later lord dreever had resumed his hunt  the path of the borrower is a thorny one especially if like spennie his reputation as a payerback is not of the best  spennie in his time had extracted small loans from most of his male acquaintances rarely repaying the same he had a tendency to forget that he had borrowed halfacrown here to pay a cab and ten shillings there to settle up for a dinner and his memory was not much more retentive of larger sums this made his friends somewhat wary the consequence was that the great treasurehunt was a failure from start to finish he got friendly smiles he got honeyed apologies he got earnest assurances of goodwill but he got no money except from jimmy pitt  he had approached jimmy in the early stages of the hunt and jimmy being in the mood when he would have loaned anything to anybody yielded the required five pounds without a murmur  but what was five pounds the garment of gloom and the intellectual pallor were once more prominent when his lordship repaired to his room to don the loud tweeds which as lord herbert he was to wear in the first act  there is a good deal to be said against stealing as a habit but it cannot be denied that in certain circumstances it offers an admirable solution of a financial difficulty and if the penalties were not so exceedingly unpleasant it is probable that it would become far more fashionable than it is  his lordships mind did not turn immediately to this outlet from his embarrassment he had never stolen before and it did not occur to him directly to do so now there is a conservative strain in all of us but gradually as it was borne in upon him that it was the only course possible unless he were to grovel before hargate on the morrow and ask for time to payan unthinkable alternativehe found himself contemplating the possibility of having to secure the money by unlawful means by the time he had finished his theatrical toilet he had definitely decided that this was the only thing to be done  his plan was simple he knew where the money was in the dressingtable in sir thomass room he had heard saunders instructed to put it there what could be easier than to go and get it everything was in his favor sir thomas would be downstairs receiving his guests the coast would be clear why it was like finding the money  besides he reflected as he worked his way through the bottle of mumms which he had had the forethought to abstract from the suppertable as a nervesteadier it wasnt really stealing dash it all the man had given him the money it was his own he had half a mindhe poured himself out another glass of the elixirto give sir thomas a jolly good talkingto into the bargain yes dash it all  he shot his cuffs fiercely the british lion was roused  a mans first crime is as a rule a shockingly amateurish affair now and then it is true we find beginners forging with the accuracy of old hands or breaking into houses with the finish of experts but these are isolated cases the average tyro lacks generalship altogether spennie dreever may be cited as a typical novice it did not strike him that inquiries might be instituted by sir thomas when he found the money gone and that suspicion might conceivably fall upon himself courage may be born of champagne but rarely prudence  the theatricals began at halfpast eight with a duologue the audience had been hustled into their seats happier than is usual in such circumstances owing to the rumor which had been circulated that the proceedings were to terminate with an informal dance the castle was singularly well constructed for such a purpose there was plenty of room and a sufficiency of retreat for those who sat out in addition to a conservatory large enough to have married off half the couples in the county  spennies idea had been to establish an alibi by mingling with the throng for a few minutes and then to get through his burglarious specialty during the duologue when his absence would not be noticed it might be that if he disappeared later in the evening people would wonder what had become of him  he lurked about until the last of the audience had taken their seats as he was moving off through the hall a hand fell upon his shoulder conscience makes cowards of us all spennie bit his tongue and leaped three inches into the air  hello charteris he said gaspingly  charteris appeared to be in a somewhat overwrought condition rehearsals had turned him into a pessimist and now that the actual moment of production had arrived his nerves were in a thoroughly jumpy condition especially as the duologue was to begin in two minutes and the obliging person who had undertaken to prompt had disappeared  spennie said charteris where are you off to  whatwhat do you mean i was just going upstairs  no you dont youve got to come and prompt that devil blake has vanished ill wring his neck come along  spennie went reluctantly halfway through the duologue the official prompter returned with the remark that he had been having a bit of a smoke on the terrace and that his watch had gone wrong leaving him to discuss the point with charteris spennie slipped quietly away  the delay however had had the effect of counteracting the uplifting effects of the mumms the british lion required a fresh fillip he went to his room to administer it by the time he emerged he was feeling just right for the task in hand a momentary doubt occurred to him as to whether it would not be a good thing to go down and pull sir thomas nose as a preliminary to the proceedings but he put the temptation aside business before pleasure  with a jaunty if somewhat unsteady step he climbed the stairs to the floor above and made his way down the corridor to sir thomass room he switched on the light and went to the dressingtable the drawer was locked but in his present mood spennie like love laughed at locksmiths he grasped the handle and threw his weight into a sudden tug the drawer came out with a report like a pistolshot  there said his lordship wagging his head severely  in the drawer lay the four banknotes the sight of them brought back his grievance with a rush he would teach sir thomas to treat him like a kid he would show him  he was removing the notes frowning fiercely the while when he heard a cry of surprise from behind him  he turned to see molly she was still dressed in the evening gown she had worn at dinner and her eyes were round with wonder a few moments earlier as she was seeking her room in order to change her costume for the theatricals she had almost reached the end of the corridor that led to the landing when she observed his lordship flushed of face and moving like some restive charger come curvetting out of his bedroom in a dazzling suit of tweeds and make his way upstairs ever since their mutual encounter with sir thomas before dinner she had been hoping for a chance of seeing spennie alone she had not failed to notice his depression during the meal and her good little heart had been troubled by the thought that she must have been responsible for it she knew that for some reason what she had said about the letter had brought his lordship into his uncles bad books and she wanted to find him and say she was sorry  accordingly she had followed him his lordship still in the warhorse vein had made the pace upstairs too hot and had disappeared while she was still halfway up she had arrived at the top just in time to see him turn down the passage into sir thomass dressingroom she could not think what his object might be she knew that sir thomas was downstairs so it could not be from the idea of a chat with him that spennie was seeking the dressingroom  faint yet pursuing she followed on his trail and arrived in the doorway just as the pistolreport of the burst lock rang out  she stood looking at him blankly he was holding a drawer in one hand why she could not imagine  lord dreever she exclaimed  the somber determination of his lordships face melted into a twisted but kindly smile  good he said perhaps a trifle thickly good glad youve come were pals you said soon stairsbfore dinner very glad youve come wont you sit down  he waved the drawer benevolently by way of making her free of the room the movement disturbed one of the banknotes which fluttered in mollys direction and fell at her feet  she stooped and picked it up when she saw what it was her bewilderment increased  butbut she said  his lordship beamedupon her with a pebblebeached smile of indescribable goodwill  sit down he urged were palsno quol with you youre good friend quoluncle thomas  but lord dreever what are you doing what was that noise i heard  opening drawer said his lordship affably  but she looked again at what she had in her handbut this is a fivepound note  fivepound note said his lordship quite right three more of them in here  still she could not understand  butwere youstealing them  his lordship drew himself up  no he said no not stealing no  then  like this before dinner old boy friendly as you pleasecouldnt do enough for me touched him for twenty of the best and got away with it so far all well then met you on stairs you let cat out of bag  but why surely  his lordship gave the drawer a dignified wave  not blaming you he said magnanimously not your fault misfortune you didnt know about letter  about the letter said molly yes what was the trouble about the letter i knew something was wrong directly i had said that i wrote it  trouble was said his lordship that old boy thought it was loveletter didnt undeceive him  you didnt tell him why  his lordship raised his eyebrows  wanted touch him twenty of the best he explained simply  for the life of her molly could not help laughing  dont laugh protested his lordship wounded no joke serious honor at stake  he removed the three notes and replaced the drawer  honor of the dreevers he added pocketing the money  molly was horrified  but lord dreever she cried you cant you mustnt you cant be going really to take that money its stealing it isnt yours you must put it back  his lordship wagged a forefinger very solemnly at her  that he said is where you make error mine old boy gave them to me  gave them to you then why did you break open the drawer  old boy took them back againwhen he found out about letter  then they dont belong to you  yes error they do moral right  molly wrinkled her forehead in her agitation men of lord dreevers type appeal to the motherly instinct of women as a man his lordship was a negligible quantity he did not count but as a willful child to be kept out of trouble he had a claim on molly  she spoke soothingly  but lord dreever she began  call me spennie he urged were pals you said soon stairs everybody calls me spennieeven uncle thomas im going to pull his nose he broke off suddenly as one recollecting a forgotten appointment  spennie then said molly you mustnt spennie you mustnt really you  you look rippin in that dress said his lordship irrelevantly  thank you spennie dear but listen molly spoke as if she were humoring a rebellious infant you really mustnt take that money you must put it back see im putting this note back give me the others and ill put them in the drawer too then well shut the drawer and nobody will know  she took the notes from him and replaced them in the drawer he watched her thoughtfully as if he were pondering the merits of her arguments  no he said suddenly no must have them moral right old boy  she pushed him gently away  yes yes i know she said i know its a shame that you cant have them but you mustnt take them dont you see that he would suspect you the moment he found they were gone and then youd get into trouble  something in that admitted his lordship  of course there is spennie dear im so glad you see there they all are safe again in the drawer now we can go downstairs again and  she stopped she had closed the door earlier in the proceedings but her quick ear caught the sound of a footstep in the passage outside  quick she whispered taking his hand and darting to the electriclight switch somebodys coming we mustnt be caught here theyd see the broken drawer and youd get into awful trouble quick  she pushed him behind the curtain where the clothes hung and switched off the light  from behind the curtain came the muffled voice of his lordship  its uncle thomas im coming out pull his nose  be quiet  she sprang to the curtain and slipped noiselessly behind it  but i say began his lordship  hush  she gripped his arm he subsided  the footsteps had halted outside the door then the handle turned softly the door opened and closed again with hardly a sound  the footsteps passed on into the room     chapter xxv  explanations   jimmy like his lordship had been trapped at the beginning of the duologue and had not been able to get away till it was nearly over he had been introduced by lady julia to an elderly and adhesive baronet who had recently spent ten days in new york and escape had not been won without a struggle the baronet on his return to england had published a book entitled modern america and its people and it was with regard to the opinions expressed in this volume that he invited jimmys views he had no wish to see the duologue and it was only after the loss of much precious time that jimmy was enabled to tear himself away on the plea of having to dress he cursed the authority on modern america and its people freely as he ran upstairs while the duologue was in progress there had been no chance of sir thomas taking it into his head to visit his dressingroom he had been as his valetdetective had observed to mr galer too busy jollying along the swells it would be the work of a few moments only to restore the necklace to its place but for the tenacity of the elderly baronet the thing would have been done by this time now however there was no knowing what might not happen anybody might come along the passage and see him he had one point in his favor there was no likelihood of the jewels being required by their owner till the conclusion of the theatricals the part that lady julia had been persuaded by charteris to play mercifully contained no scope for the display of gems  before going down to dinner jimmy had locked the necklace in a drawer it was still there spike having been able apparently to resist the temptation of recapturing it jimmy took it and went into the corridor he looked up and down there was nobody about he shut his door and walked quickly in the direction of the dressingroom  he had provided himself with an electric pockettorch equipped with a reflector which he was in the habit of carrying when on his travels once inside having closed the door he set this aglow and looked about him  spike had given him minute directions as to the position of the jewelbox he found it without difficulty to his untrained eye it seemed tolerably massive and impregnable but spike had evidently known how to open it without much difficulty the lid was shut but it came up without an effort when he tried to raise it and he saw that the lock had been broken  spikes coming on he said  he was dangling the necklace over the box preparatory to dropping it in when there was a quick rustle at the other side of the room the curtain was plucked aside and molly came out  jimmy she cried  jimmys nerves were always in pretty good order but at the sight of this apparition he visibly jumped  great scott he said  the curtain again became agitated by some unseen force violently this time and from its depths a plaintive voice made itself heard  dash it all said the voice ive stuck  there was another upheaval and his lordship emerged his yellow locks ruffled and upstanding his face crimson  caught my head in a coat or something he explained at large hullo pitt  pressed rigidly against the wall molly had listened with growing astonishment to the movements on the other side of the curtain her mystification deepened every moment it seemed to her that the room was still in darkness she could hear the sound of breathing and then the light of the torch caught her eye who could this be and why had he not switched on the regular room lights  she strained her ears to catch a sound for a while she heard nothing except the soft breathing then came a voice that she knew well and abandoning her hidingplace she came out into the room and found jimmy standing with the torch in his hand over some dark object in the corner of the room  it was a full minute after jimmys first exclamation of surprise before either of them spoke again the light of the torch hurt mollys eyes she put up a hand to shade them it seemed to her that they had been standing like this for years  jimmy had not moved there was something in his attitude that filled molly with a vague fear in the shadow behind the torch he looked shapeless and inhuman  youre hurting my eyes she said at last  im sorry said jimmy i didnt think is that better he turned the light from her face something in his voice and the apologetic haste with which he moved the torch seemed to relax the strain of the situation the feeling of stunned surprise began to leave her she found herself thinking coherently again  the relief was but momentary why was jimmy in the room at that time why had he a torch what had he been doing the questions shot from her brain like sparks from an anvil  the darkness began to tear at her nerves she felt along the wall for the switch and flooded the whole room with light  jimmy laid down the torch and stood for a moment undecided he had concealed the necklace behind him now he brought it forward and dangled it silently before the eyes of molly and his lordship excellent as were his motives for being in that room with the necklace in his hand he could not help feeling as he met mollys startled gaze quite as guilty as if his intentions had been altogether different  his lordship having by this time pulled himself together to some extent was the first to speak  i say you know what ho he observed not without emotion what  molly drew back  jimmy you wereoh you cant have been  looks jolly like it said his lordship judicially  i wasnt said jimmy i was putting them back  putting them back  pitt old man said his lordship solemnly that sounds a bit thin  dreever old man said jimmy i know it does but its the truth  his lordships manner became kindly  now look here pitt old son he said theres nothing to worry about were all pals here you can pitch it straight to us we wont give you away we  be quiet cried molly jimmy  her voice was strained she spoke with an effort she was suffering torments the words her father had said to her on the terrace were pouring back into her mind she seemed to hear his voice now cool and confident warning her against jimmy saying that he was crooked there was a curious whirring in her head everything in the room was growing large and misty she heard lord dreever begin to say something that sounded as if someone were speaking at the end of a telephone and then she was aware that jimmy was holding her in his arms and calling to lord dreever to bring water  when a girl goes like that said his lordship with an insufferable air of omniscience you want to cut her  come along said jimmy are you going to be a week getting that water  his lordship proceeded to soak a sponge without further parley but as he carried his dripping burden across the room molly recovered she tried weakly to free herself  jimmy helped her to a chair he had dropped the necklace on the floor and lord dreever nearly trod on it  what ho observed his lordship picking it up go easy with the jewelry  jimmy was bending over molly neither of them seemed to be aware of his lordships presence spennie was the sort of person whose existence is apt to be forgotten jimmy had had a flash of intuition for the first time it had occurred to him that mr mceachern might have hinted to molly something of his own suspicions  molly dear he said it isnt what you think i can explain everything do you feel better now can you listen i can explain everything  pitt old boy protested his lordship you dont understand we arent going to give you away were all  jimmy ignored him  molly listen he said  she sat up  go on jimmy she said  i wasnt stealing the necklace i was putting it back the man who came to the castle with me spike mullins took it this afternoon and brought it to me  spike mullins molly remembered the name  he thinks i am a crook a sort of raffles it was my fault i was a fool it all began that night in new york when we met at your house i had been to the opening performance of a play called love the cracksman one of those burglar plays  jolly good show interpolated his lordship chattily it was at the circle over here i went twice  a friend of mine a man named mifflin had been playing the hero in it and after the show at the club he started in talking about the art of burglaryhed been studying itand i said that anybody could burgle a house and in another minute it somehow happened that i had made a bet that i would do it that night heaven knows whether i ever really meant to but that same night this man mullins broke into my flat and i caught him we got into conversation and i worked off on him a lot of technical stuff id heard from this actor friend of mine and he jumped to the conclusion that i was an expert and then it suddenly occurred to me that it would be a good joke on mifflin if i went out with mullins and did break into a house i wasnt in the mood to think what a fool i was at the time well anyway we went out andwell thats how it all happened and then i met spike in london down and out and brought him here  he looked at her anxiously it did not need his lordships owlish expression of doubt to tell him how weak his story must sound he had felt it even as he was telling it he was bound to admit that if ever a story rang false in every sentence it was this one  pitt old man said his lordship shaking his head more in sorrow than in anger it wont do old top whats the point of putting up any old yarn like that dont you see what i mean is its not as if we minded dont i keep telling you were all pals here ive often thought what a jolly good feller old raffles was regular sportsman i dont blame a chappie for doing the gentleman burglar touch seems to me its a dashed sporting  molly turned on him suddenly cutting short his views on the ethics of gentlemanly theft in a blaze of indignation  what do you mean she cried do you think i dont believe every word jimmy has said  his lordship jumped  well dont you know it seemed to me a bit thin what i mean is he met mollys eye oh well he concluded lamely  molly turned to jimmy  jimmy of course i believe you i believe every word  molly  his lordship looked on marveling the thought crossed his mind that he had lost the ideal wife a girl who would believe any old yarn a feller cared toif it hadnt been for katie for a moment he felt almost sad  jimmy and molly were looking at each other in silence from the expression on their faces his lordship gathered that his existence had once more been forgotten he saw her hold out her hands to jimmy and it seemed to him that the time had come to look away it was embarrassing for a chap he looked away  the next moment the door opened and closed again and she had gone  he looked at jimmy jimmy was still apparently unconscious of his presence  his lordship coughed  pitt old man  hullo said jimmy coming out of his thoughts with a start you still here by the way he eyed lord dreever curiouslyi never thought of asking beforewhat on earth are you doing here why were you behind the curtain were you playing hideandseek  his lordship was not one of those who invent circumstantial stories easily on the spur of the moment he searched rapidly for something that would pass muster then abandoned the hopeless struggle after all why not be frank he still believed jimmy to be of the class of the hero of love the cracksman there would be no harm in confiding in him he was a good fellow a kindred soul and would sympathize  its like this he said and having prefaced his narrative with the sound remark that he had been a bit of an ass he gave jimmy a summary of recent events  what said jimmy you taught hargate picquet why my dear man he was playing picquet like a professor when you were in short frocks hes a wonder at it  his lordship started  hows that he said you dont know him do you  i met him in new york at the strollers club a pal of mine an actor this fellow mifflin i mentioned just now put him up as a guest he coined money at picquet and there were some pretty useful players in the place too i dont wonder you found him a promising pupil  thenthenwhy dash it then hes a bally sharper  youre a genius at crisp description said jimmy youve got him summed up to rights first shot  i shant pay him a bally penny  of course not if he makes any objection refer him to me  his lordships relief was extreme the more overpowering effects of the elixir had passed away and he saw now what he had not seen in his more exuberant frame of mind the cloud of suspicion that must have hung over him when the loss of the banknotes was discovered  he wiped his forehead  by jove he said thats something off my mind by george i feel like a twoyearold i say youre a dashed good sort pitt  you flatter me said jimmy i strive to please  i say pitt that yarn you told us just nowthe bet and all that honestly you dont mean to say that was true was it i meanby jove ive got an idea  we live in stirring times  did you say your actor pals name was mifflin he broke off suddenly before jimmy could answer great scott he whispered whats that good lord somebodys coming  he dived behind the curtain like a rabbit the drapery had only just ceased to shake when the door opened and sir thomas blunt walked in     chapter xxvi  stirring times for sir thomas   for a man whose intentions toward the jewels and their owner were so innocent and even benevolent jimmy was in a singularly compromising position it would have been difficult even under more favorable conditions to have explained to sir thomass satisfaction his presence in the dressingroom as things stood it was even harder for his lordships last action before seeking cover had been to fling the necklace from him like a burning coal for the second time in ten minutes it had fallen to the carpet and it was just as jimmy straightened himself after picking it up that sir thomas got a full view of him  the knight stood in the doorway his face expressing the most lively astonishment his bulging eyes were fixed upon the necklace in jimmys hand jimmy could see him struggling to find words to cope with so special a situation and felt rather sorry for him excitement of this kind was bad for a shortnecked man of sir thomass type  with kindly tact he endeavored to help his host out  goodevening he said pleasantly  sir thomas stammered he was gradually nearing speech  whatwhatwhat he said  out with it said jimmy  what  i knew a man once in south dakota who stammered said jimmy he used to chew dogbiscuit while he was speaking it cured himbesides being nutritious another good way is to count ten while youre thinking what to say and then get it out quick  youyou blackguard  jimmy placed the necklace carefully on the dressingtable then he turned to sir thomas with his hands thrust into his pockets over the knights head he could see the folds of the curtain quivering gently as if stirred by some zephyr evidently the drama of the situation was not lost on hildebrand spencer twelfth earl of dreever  nor was it lost on jimmy this was precisely the sort of situation that appealed to him he had his plan of action clearly mapped out he knew that it would be useless to tell the knight the true facts of the case sir thomas was as deficient in simple faith as in norman blood though a londoner by birth he had one at least of the characteristic traits of the natives of missouri  to all appearances this was a tight corner but jimmy fancied that he saw his way out of it meanwhile the situation appealed to him curiously enough it was almost identical with the big scene in act three of love the cracksman in which arthur mifflin had made such a hit as the debonair burglar  jimmy proceeded to give his own idea of what the rendering of a debonair burglar should be arthur mifflin had lighted a cigarette and had shot out smokerings and repartee alternately a cigarette would have been a great help here but jimmy prepared to do his best without properties  soso its you is it said sir thomas  who told you  thief low thief  come now protested jimmy why low just because you dont know me over here why scorn me how do you know i havent got a big american reputation for all you can tell i may be boston billie or sacramento sam or someone let us preserve the decencies of debate  i had my suspicions of you i had my suspicions from the first when i heard that my idiot of a nephew had made a casual friend in london so this was what you were a thief who  i dont mind personally interrupted jimmy but i hope if ever you mix with cracksmen you wont go calling them thieves they are frightfully sensitive you see theres a world of difference between the two branches of the profession and a good deal of snobbish casteprejudice let us suppose that you were an actormanager how would you enjoy being called a super you see the idea dont you youd hurt their feelings now an ordinary thief would probably use violence in a case like this but violence except in extreme casesi hope this wont be one of themis contrary i understand to cracksmans etiquette on the other hand sir thomas candor compels me to add that i have you covered  there was a pipe in the pocket of his coat he thrust the stem earnestly against the lining sir thomas eyed the protuberance apprehensively and turned a little pale jimmy was scowling ferociously arthur mifflins scowl in act three had been much admired  my gun said jimmy is as you see in my pocket i always shoot from the pocket in spite of the tailors bills the little fellow is loaded and cocked hes pointing straight at your diamond solitaire that fatal spot no one has ever been hit in the diamond solitaire and survived my finger is on the trigger so i should recommend you not to touch that bell you are looking at there are other reasons why you shouldnt but those i will go into presently  sir thomass hand wavered  do if you like of course said jimmy agreeably its your own house but i shouldnt i am a dead shot at a yard and a half you wouldnt believe the number of sitting haystacks ive picked off at that distance i just cant miss on second thoughts i shant fire to kill you let us be humane on this joyful occasion i shall just smash your knees painful but not fatal  he waggled the pipe suggestively sir thomas blenched his hand fell to his side  great said jimmy after all why should you be in a hurry to break up this very pleasant little meeting im sure im not let us chat how are the theatricals going was the duologue a success wait till you see our show three of us knew our lines at the dressrehearsal  sir thomas had backed away from the bell but the retreat was merely for the convenience of the moment he understood that it might be injudicious to press the button just then but he had recovered his composure by this time and he saw that ultimately the game must be his his face resumed its normal hue automatically his hands began to move toward his coattails his feet to spread themselves jimmy noted with a smile these signs of restored complacency he hoped ere long to upset that complacency somewhat  sir thomas addressed himself to making jimmys position clear to him  how may i ask he said do you propose to leave the castle  wont you let me have the automobile said jimmy but i guess i shant be leaving just yet  sir thomas laughed shortly  no he saidno i fancy not i am with you there  great minds said jimmy i shouldnt be surprised if we thought alike on all sorts of subjects just think how you came round to my views on ringing bells but what made you fancy that i intended to leave the castle  i should hardly have supposed that you would be anxious to stay  on the contrary its the one place i have been in in the last two years that i have felt really satisfied with usually i want to move on after a week but i could stop here forever  i am afraid mr pittby the way an alias of course  jimmy shook his head  i fear not he said if i had chosen an alias it would have been tressilyan or trevelyan or something i call pitt a poor thing in names i once knew a man called ronald cheylesmore lucky devil  sir thomas returned to the point on which he had been about to touch  i am afraid mr pitt he said that you hardly realize your position  no said jimmy interested  i find you in the act of stealing my wifes necklace  would there be any use in telling you that i was not stealing it but putting it back  sir thomas raised his eyebrows in silence  no said jimmy i was afraid not you were saying  i find you in the act of stealing my wifes necklace proceeded sir thomas and because for the moment you succeed in postponing arrest by threatening me with a revolver  an agitated look came into jimmys face  great scott he cried he felt hastily in his pocket  yes he said as i had begun to fear i owe you an apology sir thomas he went on with manly dignity producing the briar i am entirely to blame how the mistake arose i cannot imagine but i find it isnt a revolver after all  sir thomas cheeks took on a richer tint of purple he glared dumbly at the pipe  in the excitement of the moment i guess began jimmy  sir thomas interrupted the recollection of his needless panic rankled within him  youyouyou  count ten  youwhat you propose to gain by this buffoonery i am at a loss  how can you say such savage things protested jimmy not buffoonery wit esprit flow of soul such as circulates daily in the best society  sir thomas almost leaped toward the bell with his finger on it he turned to deliver a final speech  i believe youre insane he cried but ill have no more of it i have endured this foolery long enough ill  just one moment said jimmy i said just now that there were reasons besides the revolwell pipewhy you should not ring that bell one of them is that all the servants will be in their places in the audience so that there wont be anyone to answer it but thats not the most convincing reason will you listen to one more before getting busy  i see your game dont imagine for a moment that you can trick me  nothing could be further  you fancy you can gain time by talking and find some way to escape  but i dont want to escape dont you realize that in about ten minutes i am due to play an important part in a great drama on the stage  ill keep you here i tell you youll leave this room said sir thomas grandly over my body  steeplechasing in the home murmured jimmy no more dull evenings but listen do listen i wont keep you a minute and if you want topush that bell after im through you may push it six inches into the wall if you like  well said sir thomas shortly  would you like me to lead gently up to what i want to say gradually preparing you for the reception of the news or shall i  the knight took out his watch  i shall give you one minute he said  heavens i must hustle how many seconds have i got now  if you have anything to say say it  very well then said jimmy its only this that necklace is a fraud the diamonds arent diamonds at all theyre paste     chapter xxvii  a declaration of independence   if jimmy had entertained any doubts concerning the effectiveness of this disclosure they would have vanished at the sight of the others face just as the rich hues of a sunset pale slowly into an almost imperceptible green so did the purple of sir thomass cheeks become in stages first a dull red then pink and finally take on a uniform pallor his mouth hung open his attitude of righteous defiance had crumpled unsuspected creases appeared in his clothes he had the appearance of one who has been caught in the machinery  jimmy was a little puzzled he had expected to check the enemy to bring him to reason but not to demolish him in this way there was something in this which he did not understand when spike had handed him the stones and his trained eye after a moments searching examination had made him suspicious and when finally a simple test had proved his suspicions correct he was comfortably aware that though found with the necklace on his person he had knowledge which communicated to sir thomas would serve him well he knew that lady julia was not the sort of lady who would bear calmly the announcement that her treasured rope of diamonds was a fraud he knew enough of her to know that she would demand another necklace and see that she got it and that sir thomas was not one of those generous and expansive natures which think nothing of an expenditure of twenty thousand pounds  this was the line of thought that had kept him cheerful during what might otherwise have been a trying interview he was aware from the first that sir thomas would not believe in the purity of his motives but he was convinced that the knight would be satisfied to secure his silence on the subject of the paste necklace at any price he had looked forward to baffled rage furious denunciation and a dozen other expressions of emotion but certainly not to collapse of this kind  the other had begun to make strange gurgling noises  mind you said jimmy its a very good imitation ill say that for it i didnt suspect it till i had the thing in my hands looking at iteven quite closei was taken in for a moment  sir thomas swallowed nervously  how did you know he muttered  again jimmy was surprised he had expected indignant denials and demands for proof excited reiteration of the statement that the stones had cost twenty thousand pounds  how did i know he repeated if you mean what first made me suspect i couldnt tell you it might have been one of a score of things a jeweler cant say exactly how he gets on the track of fake stones he can feel them he can almost smell them i worked with a jeweler once thats how i got my knowledge of jewels but if you mean can i prove what i say about this necklace thats easy theres no deception its simple see here these stones are supposed to be diamonds well the diamond is the hardest stone in existence nothing will scratch it now ive got a little ruby out of a college pin which i know is genuine by rights then that ruby ought not to have scratched these stones you follow that but it did it scratched two of them the only two i tried if you like i can continue the experiment but theres no need i can tell you right now what these stones are i said they were paste but that wasnt quite accurate theyre a stuff called white jargoon its a stuff thats very easily faked you work it with the flame of a blowpipe you dont want a full description i suppose anyway what happens is that the blowpipe sets it up like a tonic gives it increased specific gravity and a healthy complexion and all sorts of great things of that kind two minutes in the flame of a blowpipe is like a week at the seashore to a bit of white jargoon are you satisfied if it comes to that i guess you can hardly be expected to be convinced is a better word are you convinced or do you hanker after tests like polarized light and refracting liquids  sir thomas had staggered to a chair  so that was how you knew he said  that was began jimmy when a sudden suspicion flashed across his mind he scrutinized sir thomas pallid face keenly  did you know he asked  he wondered that the possibility had not occurred to him earlier this would account for much that had puzzled him in the others reception of the news he had supposed vaguely without troubling to go far into the probabilities of such a thing that the necklace which spike had brought to him had been substituted for the genuine diamonds by a thief such things happened frequently he knew but remembering what molly had told him of the care which sir thomas took of this particular necklace and the frequency with which lady julia wore it he did not see how such a substitution could have been effected there had been no chance of anybodys obtaining access to these stones for the necessary length of time  by george i believe you did he cried you must have so thats how it happened is it i dont wonder it was a shock when i said i knew about the necklace  mr pitt  well  i have something to say to you  im listening  sir thomas tried to rally there was a touch of the old pomposity in his manner when he spoke  mr pitt i find you in an unpleasant position  jimmy interrupted  dont you worry about my unpleasant position he said fix your attention exclusively upon your own let us be frank with one another youre in the cart what do you propose to do about it  sir thomas rallied again with the desperation of one fighting a lost cause  i do not understand you he began  no said jimmy ill try and make my meaning clear correct me from time to time if i am wrong the way i size the thing up is as follows when you married lady julia i gather that it was so to speak up to you to some extent people knew you were a millionaire and they expected something special in the way of gifts from the bridegroom to the bride now you being of a prudent and economical nature began to wonder if there wasnt some way of getting a reputation for lavishness without actually unbelting to any great extent am i right  sir thomas did not answer  i am said jimmy well it occurred to you naturally enough that a properlyselected gift of jewelry might work the trick it only needed a little nerve when you give a present of diamonds to a lady she is not likely to call for polarized light and refracting liquids and the rest of the circus in ninetynine cases out of a hundred she will take the things on trust very well you trotted off to a jeweler and put the thing to him confidentially i guess you suggested paste but being a wily person he pointed out that paste has a habit of not wearing well it is pretty enough when its new but quite a small amount of ordinary wear and tear destroys the polish of the surface and the sharpness of the cutting it gets scratched easily having heard this and reflecting that lady julia was not likely to keep the necklace under a glass case you rejected paste as too risky the genial jeweler then suggested white jargoon mentioning as i have done that after an application or so of the blowpipe its own mother wouldnt know it if he was a bit of an antiquary he probably added that in the eighteenth century jargoon stones were supposed to be actually an inferior sort of diamond what could be more suitable make it jargoon dear heart you cried joyfully and all was well am i right i notice that you have not corrected me so far  whether or not sir thomas would have replied in the affirmative is uncertain he was opening his mouth to speak when the curtain at the end of the room heaved and lord dreever burst out like a cannonball in tweeds  the apparition effectually checked any speech that sir thomas might have been intending to make lying back in his chair he goggled silently at the new arrival even jimmy though knowing that his lordship had been in hiding was taken aback his attention had become so concentrated on his duel with the knight that he had almost forgotten they had an audience  his lordship broke the silence  great scott he cried  neither jimmy nor sir thomas seemed to consider the observation unsound or inadequate they permitted it to pass without comment  you old scoundrel added his lordship addressing sir thomas and youre the man who called me a welsher there were signs of a flicker of spirit in the knights prominent eyes but they died away he made no reply  great scott moaned his lordship in a fervor of selfpity here have i been all these years letting you give me hades in every shape and form when all the whilemy goodness if id only known earlier  he turned to jimmy  pitt old man he said warmly idash it i dont know what to say if it hadnt been for youi always did like americans i always thought it bally rot that that fuss happened ininwhenever it was if it hadnt been for fellows like you he continued addressing sir thomas once more there wouldnt have been any of that frightful declaration of independence business would there pitt old man  these were deep problems too spacious for casual examination jimmy shrugged his shoulders  well i guess sir thomas might not have got along with george washington anyway he said  of course not wellspennie moved toward the doorim off downstairs to see what aunt julia has to say about it all  a shudder as if from some electric shock shook sir thomas he leaped to his feet  spencer he cried i forbid you to say a word to your aunt  oh said his lordship you do do you  sir thomas shivered  she would never let me hear the last of it  i bet she wouldnt ill go and see  stop  well  sir thomas dabbed at his forehead with his handkerchief he dared not face the vision of lady julia in possession of the truth at one time the fear lest she might discover the harmless little deception he had practised had kept him awake at night but gradually as the days went by and the excellence of the imitation stones had continued to impose upon her and upon everyone else who saw them the fear had diminished but it had always been at the back of his mind even in her calmer moments his wife was a source of mild terror to him his imagination reeled at the thought of what depths of aristocratic scorn and indignation she would plumb in a ease like this  spencer he said i insist that you shall not inform your aunt of this  what you want me to keep my mouth shut you want me to become an accomplice in this beastly lowdown deception i like that  the point said jimmy is well taken noblesse oblige and all that sort of thing the blood of the dreevers boils furiously at the idea listen you can hear it sizzling  lord dreever moved a step nearer the door  stop cried sir thomas again spencer  well  spencer my boy it occurs to me that perhaps i have not always treated you very well  perhaps not always great scott ill have a fiver each way on both those considering youve treated me like a frightful kid practically ever since youve known me i call that pretty rich why what about this very night when i asked you for a few pounds  it was only the thought that you had been gambling  gambling how about palming off faked diamonds on aunt julia for a gamble  a game of skill surely murmured jimmy  i have been thinking the matter over said sir thomas and if you really need thewas it not fifty pounds  it was twenty said his lordship and i dont need it keep it youll want all you can save for a new necklace  his fingers closed on the doorhandle  spencer stop  well  we must talk this over we must not be hasty  sir thomas passed the handkerchief over his forehead  in the past perhaps he resumed our relations have not been quitethe fault was mine i have always endeavored to do my duty it is a difficult task to look after a young man of your age  his lordships sense of his grievance made him eloquent  dash it all he cried thats just what i jolly well complain of who the dickens wanted you to look after me hang it youve kept your eye on me all these years like a frightful policeman you cut off my allowance right in the middle of my time at college just when i needed it most and i had to come and beg for money whenever i wanted to buy a cigarette i looked a fearful ass i can tell you men who knew me used to be dashed funny about it im sick of the whole bally business youve given me a jolly thin time all this while and now im going to get a bit of my own back wouldnt you pitt old man  jimmy thus suddenly appealed to admitted that in his lordships place he might have experienced a momentary temptation to do something of the kind  of course said his lordship any fellow would  but spencer let met  youve soured my life said his lordship frowning a tense byronic frown thats what youve donesoured my whole bally life ive had a rotten time ive had to go about touching my friends for money to keep me going why i owe you a fiver dont i pitt old man  it was a tenner to be finnickingly accurate about details but jimmy did not say so he concluded rightly that the memory of the original five pounds which he had lent lord dreever at the savoy hotel had faded from the others mind  dont mention it he said  but i do mention it protested his lordship shrilly it just proves what i say if i had had a decent allowance it wouldnt have happened and you wouldnt give me enough to set me going in the diplomatic service thats another thing why wouldnt you do that  sir thomas pulled himself together  i hardly thought you qualified my dear boy  his lordship did not actually foam at the mouth but he looked as if he might do so at any moment excitement and the memory of his wrongs lubricated as it were by the champagne he had consumed both at and after dinner had produced in him a frame of mind far removed from the normal his manners no longer had that repose which stamps the caste of vere de vere he waved his hands  i know i know he shouted i know you didnt you thought me a fearful fool i tell you im sick of it and always trying to make me marry money dashed humiliating if she hadnt been a jolly sensible girl youd have spoiled miss mceacherns life as well as mine you came very near it i tell you ive had enough of it im in love im in love with the rippingest girl in england youve seen her pitt old top isnt she a ripper  jimmy stamped the absent lady with the seal of his approval  i tell you if shell have me im going to marry her  the dismay written on every inch of sir thomass countenance became intensified at these terrific words great as had been his contempt for the actual holder of the title considered simply as a young man he had always been filled with a supreme respect for the dreever name  but spencer he almost howled consider your position you cannot  cant i by jove if shell have me and damn my position whats my position got to do with it katies the daughter of a general if it comes to that her brother was at college with me if id had a penny to call my own id have asked her to marry me ages ago dont you worry about my position  sir thomas croaked feebly  now look here said his lordship with determination heres the whole thing in a jolly old nutshell if you want me to forget about this little flutter in fake diamonds of yours youve got to pull up your socks and start in to do things youve got to get me attached to some embassy for a beginning it wont be difficult theres dozens of old boys in london who knew the governor when he was alive who will jump at the chance of doing me a good turn i know im a bit of an ass in some ways but thats expected of you in the diplomatic service they only want you to wear evening clothes as if you were used to them and be a bit of a flyer at dancing and i can fill the bill all right as far as that goes and youve got to give your jolly old blessing to katie and meif shell have me thats about all i can think of for the moment how do we go are you on  its preposterous began sir thomas  lord dreever gave the doorhandle a rattle  its a holdup all right said jimmy soothingly i dont want to butt in on a family conclave but my advice if asked would be to unbelt before the shooting begins youve got something worse than a pipe pointing at you now as regards my position in the business dont worry my silence is presented gratis give me a loving smile and my lips are sealed  sir thomas turned on the speaker  as for you he cried  never mind about pitt said his lordship hes a dashed good fellow pitt i wish there were more like him  and he wasnt pinching the stuff either if you had only listened when he tried to tell you you mightnt be in such a frightful hole he was putting the things back as he said i know all about it well whats the answer  for a moment sir thomas seemed on the point of refusal but just as he was about to speak his lordship opened the door and at the movement he collapsed again  i will he cried i will  good said his lordship with satisfaction thats a bargain coming downstairs pitt old man we shall be wanted on the stage in about half a minute  as an antidote to stage fright said jimmy as they went along the corridor little discussions of that kind may be highly recommended i shouldnt mind betting that you feel fit for anything  i feel like a twoyearold assented his lordship enthusiastically ive forgotten all my part but i dont care ill just go on and talk to them  that said jimmy is the right spirit charteris will get heartdisease but its the right spirit a little more of that sort of thing and amateur theatricals would be worth listening to step lively roscius the stage waits     chapter xxviii  spennies hour of clear vision   mr mceachern sat in the billiardroom smoking he was alone from where he sat he could hear distant strains of music the more rigorous portion of the evenings entertainment the theatricals was over and the nobility and gentry having done their duty by sitting through the performance were now enjoying themselves in the ballroom everybody was happy the play had been quite as successful as the usual amateur performance the prompter had made himself a great favorite from the start his series of duets with spennie having been especially admired and jimmy as became an old professional had played his part with great finish and certainty of touch though like the bloodhounds in uncle toms cabin on the road he had had poor support but the audience bore no malice no collection of individuals is less vindictive than an audience at amateur theatricals it was all over now charteris had literally gibbered in the presence of eyewitnesses at one point in the second act when spennie by giving a wrong cue had jerked the play abruptly into act three where his colleagues dimly suspecting something wrong but not knowing what it was had kept it for two minutes to the mystification of the audience but now charteris had begun to forget as he twostepped down the room the lines of agony on his face were softened he even smiled  as for spennie the brilliance of his happy grin dazzled all beholders  he was still wearing it when he invaded the solitude of mr mceachern in every dance however greatly he may be enjoying it there comes a time when a man needs a meditative cigarette apart from the throng it came to spennie after the seventh item on the program the billiardroom struck him as admirably suitable in every way it was not likely to be used as a sittingout place and it was near enough to the ballroom to enable him to hear when the music of item number nine should begin  mr mceachern welcomed his visitor in the turmoil following the theatricals he had been unable to get a word with any of the persons with whom he most wished to speak he had been surprised that no announcement of the engagement had been made at the end of the performance spennie would be able to supply him with information as to when the announcement might be expected  spennie hesitated for an instant when he saw who was in the room he was not overanxious for a teteatete with mollys father just then but refleeting that after all he was not to blame for any disappointment that might be troubling the other he switched on his grin again and walked in  came in for a smoke he explained by way of opening the conversation not dancing the next  come in my boy come in said mr mceachern i was waiting to see you  spennie regretted his entrance he had supposed that the other had heard the news of the breakingoff of the engagement evidently however mceachern had not this was a nuisance the idea of flight came to spennie but he dismissed it as nominal host that night he had to dance many dutydances this would be his only chance of a smoke for hours and the billiardroom was the best place for it  he sat down and lighted a cigarette casting about the while for an innocuous topic of conversation  like the show he inquired  fine said mr mceachern by the way  spennie groaned inwardly he had forgotten that a determined man can change the conversation to any subject he pleases by means of those three words  by the way said mr mceachern i thought sir thomaswasnt your uncle intending to announce  well yes he was said spennie  going to do it during the dancing maybe  wellerno the fact is hes not going to do it at all dont you know spennie inspected the red end of his cigarette closely as a matter of fact its kind of broken off  the others exclamation jarred on him rotten having to talk about this sort of thing  broken off  spennie nodded  miss mceachern thought it over dont you know he said and came to the conclusion that it wasnt good enough  now that it was said he felt easier it had merely been the awkwardness of having to touch on the thing that had troubled him that his news might be a blow to mceachern did not cross his mind he was a singularly modest youth and though he realized vaguely that his title had a certain value in some persons eyes he could not understand anyone mourning over the loss of him as a soninlaw katies father the old general thought him a fool and once during an attack of gout had said so spennie was wont to accept this as the view which a prospective fatherinlaw might be expected to entertain regarding himself  oblivious therefore to the storm raging a yard away from him he smoked on with great contentment till suddenly it struck him that for a presumably devout lover jilted that very night he was displaying too little emotion he debated swiftly within himself whether or not he should have a dash at manly grief but came to the conclusion that it could not be done melancholy on this maddest merriest day of all the glad new year the day on which he had utterly routed the powers of evil as represented by sir thomas was impossible he decided rather on a letusbereasonable attitude  it wouldnt have done dont you know he said we werent suited what i mean to say is im a bit of a dashed sort of silly ass in some ways if you know what i mean a girl like miss mceachern couldnt have been happy with me she wants one of these capable energetic fellers  this struck him as a good beginningmodest but not groveling he continued tapping quite a respectably deep vein of philosophy as he spoke  you see dear old topi mean sir you see its like this as far as women are concerned fellers are divided into two classes theres the masterful capable johnnies and theerthe other sort now im the other sort my idea of the happy married life is to bewell not exactly downtrodden butyou know what i meankind of second fiddle i want a wife his voice grew soft and dreamywholl pet me a good deal dont you know stroke my hair a lot and all that i havent it in me to do the masterinmyownhouse business for me the silentdevotion touch sleeping on the mat outside her door dont you know when she wasnt feeling well and being found there in the morning and being rather cosseted for my thoughtfulness thats the sort of idea hard to put it quite o k but you know the sort of thing i mean a fellers got to realize his jolly old limitations if he wants to be happy though married what now suppose miss mceachern was to marry me great scott shed be bored to death in a week honest she couldnt help herself she wants a chap with the same amount of go in him that shes got  he lighted another cigarette he was feeling pleased with himself never before had ideas marshaled themselves in his mind in such long and wellordered ranks he felt that he could go on talking like this all night he was getting brainier every minute he remembered reading in some book somewhere of a girl or chappie who had had her or his hour of clear vision this was precisely what had happened now whether it was owing to the excitement of what had taken place that night or because he had been keying up his thinking powers with excellent dry champagne he did not know all he knew was that he felt on top of his subject he wished he had had a larger audience  a girl like miss mceachern doesnt want any of that hairstroking business shed simply laugh at a feller if he asked for it she needs a chappie of the getonorgetout type somebody in the six cylinder class and as a matter of fact between ourselves i rather think shes found him  what  mr mceachern half rose from his chair all his old fears had come surging back  what do you mean  fact said his lordship nodding mind you i dont know for certain as the girl says in the song i dont know but i guess what i mean to say is they seemed jolly friendly and all that calling each other by their first names and so on  who  pitt said his lordship he was leaning back blowing a smokering at the moment so he did not see the look on the others face and the sudden grip of the fingers on the arms of the chair he went on with some enthusiasm  jimmy pitt he said now theres a feller full of oats to the brim and fairly bursting with go and energy a girl wouldnt have a dull moment with a chap like that you know he proceeded confidently theres a lot in this idea of affinities take my word for it dear oldsir theres a girl up in london for instance now she and i hit it off most amazingly theres hardly a thing we dont think alike about for instance the merry widow didnt make a bit of a hit with her nor did it with me yet look at the millions of people who raved about it and neither of us likes oysters were affinitiesthats why you see the same sort of thing all over the place its a jolly queer business sometimes makes me believe in reinwhatsitsname you know what i mean all that in the poem you know how does it go when you were a tiddleyompom and i was a thingummajig dashed brainy bit of work i was reading it only the other day well what i mean to say is its my belief that jimmy pitt and miss mceachern are by way of being something in that line doesnt it strike you that they are just the sort to get on together you can see it with half an eye you cant help liking a feller like jimmy pitt hes a sport i wish i could tell you some of the things hes done but i cant for reasons but you can take it from me hes a sport you ought to cultivate him youd like him  oh dash it theres the music i must be off got to dance this one  he rose from his chair and dropped his cigarette into the ashtray  so long he said with a friendly nod wish i could stop but its no go thats the last letup i shall have tonight  he went out leaving mr mceachern a prey to many and varied emotions     chapter xxix  the last round   he had only been gone a few minutes when mr mceacherns meditations were again interrupted this time the visitor was a stranger to him a darkfaced cleanshaven man he did not wear evening clothes so could not be one of the guests and mr mceachern could not place him immediately then he remembered he had seen him in sir thomas blunts dressingroom this was sir thomass valet  might i have a word with you sir  what is it asked mceachern staring heavily his mind had not recovered from the effect of lord dreevers philosophical remarks there was something of a cloud on his brain to judge from his lordships words things had been happening behind his back and the idea of mollys deceiving him was too strange to be assimilated in an instant he looked at the valet dully  what is it he asked again  i must apologize for intruding but i thought it best to approach you before making my report to sir thomas  your report  i am employed by a private inquiry agency  what  yes sir wragges you may have heard of us in holborn bars very old established divorce a specialty you will have seen the advertisements sir thomas wrote asking for a man and the governor sent me down i have been with the house some years my job i gathered was to keep my eyes open generally sir thomas it seemed had no suspicions of any definite person i was to be on the spot just in case in a manner of speaking and its precious lucky i was or her ladyships jewels would have been gone ive done a fair cop this very night  he paused and eyed the expoliceman keenly mceachern was obviously excited could jimmy have made an attempt on the jewels during the dance or spike  say he said was it a redheaded  the detective was watching him with a curious smile  no he wasnt redheaded you seem interested sir i thought you would be i will tell you all about it i had had my suspicions of this party ever since he arrived and i may say that it struck me at the time that there was something mighty fishy about the way he got into the castle  mceachern started so he had not been the only one to suspect jimmys motives in attaching himself to lord dreever  go on he said  i suspected that there was some game on and it struck me that this would be the day for the attempt the house being upside down in a manner of speaking on account of the theatricals and i was right i kept near those jewels on and off all day and presently just as i had thought along comes this fellow hed hardly got to the door when i was on him  good boy youre no rube  we fought for a while but being a bit to the good in strength and knowing something about the game i had the irons on him pretty quick and took him off and locked him in the cellar thats how it was sir  mr mceacherns relief was overwhelming if lord dreevers statement was correct and jimmy had really succeeded in winning mollys affection this would indeed be a rescue at the eleventh hour it was with a nuncdimittis air that he felt for his cigarcase and extended it toward the detective a cigar from his own private case was with him a mark of supreme favor and goodwill a sort of accolade which he bestowed only upon the really meritorious few  usually it was received with becoming deference but on this occasion there was a somewhat startling deviation from routine for just as he was opening the case something cold and hard pressed against each of his wrists there was a snap and a click and looking up dazed he saw that the detective had sprung back and was contemplating him with a grim smile over the barrel of an uglylooking little revolver  guilty or innocent the first thing a man does when he finds handcuffs on his wrists is to try to get them off the action is automatic mr mceachern strained at the steel chain till the veins stood out on his forehead his great body shook with rage  the detective eyed these efforts with some satisfaction the picture presented by the other as he heaved and tugged was that of a guilty man trapped  its no good my friend he said  the voice brought mceachern back to his senses in the first shock of the thing the primitive man in him had led him beyond the confines of selfrestraint he had simply struggled unthinkingly now he came to himself again  he shook his manacled hands furiously  what does this mean he shouted what the  less noise said the detective sharply get back he snapped as the other took a step forward  do you know who i am thundered mceachern  no said the detective and thats just why youre wearing those bracelets come now dont be a fool the games up cant you see that  mceachern leaned helplessly against the billiardtable he felt weak everything was unreal had he gone mad he wondered  thats right said the detective stay there you cant do any harm there it was a pretty little game ill admit you worked it well meeting your old friend from new york and all and having him invited to the castle very pretty new york indeed seen about as much of new york as i have of timbuctoo i saw through him  some inkling of the truth began to penetrate mceacherns consciousness he had become obsessed with the idea that as the captive was not spike it must be jimmy the possibility of mr galers being the subject of discussion only dawned upon him now  what do you mean he cried who is it that you have arrested  blest if i know you can tell me that i should think seeing hes an old timbuctoo friend of yours galers the name he goes by here  galer  thats the man and do you know what he had the impudence the gall to tell me that he was in my own line of business a detective he said you had sent for him to come here  the detective laughed amusedly at the recollection  and so he is you fool so i did  oh you did did you and what business had you bringing detectives into other peoples houses  mr mceachern started to answer but checked himself never before had he appreciated to the full the depth and truth of the proverb relating to the fryingpan and the fire to clear himself he must mention his suspicions of jimmy and also his reasons for those suspicions and to do that would mean revealing his past it was scylla and charybdis  a drop of perspiration trickled down his temple  whats the good said the detective mighty ingenious idea that only you hadnt allowed for there being a real detective in the house it was that chap pitching me that yarn that made me suspicious of you i put two and two together partners i said to myself id heard all about you scraping acquaintance with sir thomas and all mighty ingenious you become the old family friend and then you let in your pal he gets the stuff and hands it over to you nobody dreams of suspecting you and there you are honestly now wasnt that the game  its all a mistake mceachern was beginning when the doorhandle turned  the detective looked over his shoulder mceachern glared dumbly this was the crowning blow that there should be spectators of his predicament  jimmy strolled into the room  dreever told me you were in here he said to mceachern can you spare me ahullo  the detective had pocketed his revolver at the first sound of the handle to be discreet was one of the chief articles in the creed of the young men from wragges detective agency but handcuffs are not easily concealed jimmy stood staring in amazement at mceacherns wrists  some sort of a round game he enquired with interest  the detective became confidential  its this way mr pitt theres been some pretty deep work going on here theres a regular gang of burglars in the place this chap heres one of them  what mr mceachern  thats what he calls himself  it was all jimmy could do to keep himself from asking mr mceachern whether he attributed his downfall to drink he contented himself with a sorrowful shake of the head at the fermenting captive then he took up the part of the prisoners attorney  i dont believe it he said what makes you think so  why this afternoon i caught this mans pal the fellow that calls himself galer  i know the man said jimmy hes a detective really mr mceachern brought him down here  the sleuths jaw dropped limply as if he had received a blow  what he said in a feeble voice  didnt i tell you began mr mceachern but the sleuth was occupied with jimmy that sickening premonition of disaster was beginning to steal over him dimly he began to perceive that he had blundered  yes said jimmy why i cant say but mr mceachern was afraid someone might try to steal lady julia blunts rope of diamonds so he wrote to london for this man galer it was officious perhaps but not criminal i doubt if legally you could handcuff a man for a thing like that what have you done with good mr galer  ive locked him in the coalcellar said the detective dismally the thought of the interview in prospect with the human bloodhound he had so mishandled was not exhilarating  locked him in the cellar did you said jimmy well well i daresay hes very happy there hes probably busy detecting blackbeetles still perhaps you had better go and let him out possibly if you were to apologize to him eh just as you think i only suggest if you want somebody to vouch for mr mceacherns nonburglariousness i can do it he is a gentleman of private means and we knew each other out in new yorkwe are old acquaintances  i never thought  that said jimmy with sympathetic friendliness if you will allow me to say so is the cardinal mistake you detectives make you never do think  it never occurred to me  the detective looked uneasily at mr mceachern there were indications in the policemans demeanor that the moment following release would be devoted exclusively to a carnival of violence with a certain sleuthhound playing a prominent role  he took the key of the handcuffs from his pocket and toyed with it mr mceachern emitted a low growl it was enough  if you wouldnt mind mr pitt said the sleuth obsequiously he thrust the key into jimmys hands and fled  jimmy unlocked the handcuffs mr mceachern rubbed his wrists  ingenious little things said jimmy  im much obliged to you growled mr mceachern without looking up  not at all a pleasure this circumstantial evidence thing is the devil isnt it i knew a man who broke into a house in new york to win a bet and to this day the owner of that house thinks him a professional burglar  whats that said mr mceachern sharply  why do i say a man  why am i so elusive and mysterious youre quite right it sounds more dramatic but after all what you want is facts very well i broke into your house that night to win a bet thats the limpid truth  mceachern was staring at him jimmy proceeded  you are just about to askwhat was spike mullins doing with me well spike had broken into my flat an hour before and i took him along with me as a sort of guide philosopher and friend  spike mullins said you were a burglar from england  im afraid i rather led him to think so i had been to see the opening performance of a burglarplay called love the cracksman that night and i worked off on spike some severely technical information i had received from a pal of mine who played lead in the show i told you when i came in that i had been talking to lord dreever well what he was saying to me was that he had met this very actor man a fellow called mifflinarthur mifflinin london just before he met me hes in london now rehearsing for a show thats come over from america you see the importance of this item it means that if you doubt my story all you need do is to find mifflini forgot what theater his play is coming on at but you could find out in a secondand ask him to corroborate are you satisfied  mceachern did not answer an hour before he would have fought to the last ditch for his belief in jimmys crookedness but the events of the last ten minutes had shaken him he could not forget that it was jimmy who had extricated him from a very uncomfortable position he saw now that that position was not so bad as it had seemed at the time for the establishing of the innocence of mr galer could have been effected on the morrow by an exchange of telegrams between the castle and dodsons private inquiry agency yet it had certainly been bad enough but for jimmy there would have been several hours of acute embarrassment if nothing worse he felt something of a reaction in jimmys favor  still it is hard to overcome a deeprooted prejudice in an instant he stared doubtfully  see here mr mceachern said jimmy i wish you would listen quietly to me for a minute or two theres really no reason on earth why we should be at one anothers throats in this way we might just as well be friends lets shake and call the fight off i guess you know why i came in here to see you  mceachern did not speak  you know that your daughter has broken off her engagement to lord dreever  then he was right said mceachern half to himself it is you  jimmy nodded mceachern drummed his fingers on the table and gazed thoughtfully at him  is molly he said at length does molly  yes said jimmy  mceachern continued his drumming dont think theres been anything underhand about this said jimmy she absolutely refused to do anything unless you gave your consent she said you had been partners all her life and she was going to do the square thing by you  she did said mceachern eagerly  i think you ought to do the square thing by her im not much but she wants me do the square thing by her  he stretched out his hand but he saw that the other did not notice the movement mceachern was staring straight in front of him there was a look in his eyes that jimmy had never seen there before a frightened hunted look the rugged aggressiveness of his mouth and chin showed up in strange contrast the knuckles of his clenched fists were white  its too late he burst out ill be square with her now but its too late i wont stand in her way when i can make her happy but ill lose her oh my god ill lose her  he gripped the edge of the table  did you think i had never said to myself he went on the things you said to me that day when we met here did you think i didnt know what i was who should know it better than myself but she didnt id kept it from her id sweat for fear she would find out some day when i came over here i thought i was safe and then you came and i saw you together i thought you were a crook you were with mullins in new york i told her you were a crook  you told her that  i said i knew it i couldnt tell her the truthwhy i thought so i said i had made inquiries in new york and found out about you  jimmy saw now the mystery was solved so that was why molly had allowed them to force her into the engagement with dreever for a moment a rush of anger filled him but he looked at mceachern and it died away he could not be vindictive now it would be like hitting a beaten man he saw things suddenly from the others viewpoint and he pitied him  i see he said slowly  mceachern gripped the table in silence  i see said jimmy again you mean shell want an explanation  he thought for a moment  you must tell her he said quickly for your own sake you must tell her go and do it now wake up man he shook him by the shoulder go and do it now shell forgive you dont be afraid of that go and look for her and tell her now  mceachern roused himself  i will he said  its the only way said jimmy  mceachern opened the door then fell back a pace jimmy could hear voices in the passage outside he recognized lord dreevers  mceachern continued to back away from the door  lord dreever entered with molly on his arm  hullo said his lordship looking round hullo pitt here we all are what  lord dreever wanted to smoke said molly  she smiled but there was anxiety in her eyes she looked quickly at her father and at jimmy  molly my dear said mceachern huskily i to speak to you for a moment  jimmy took his lordship by the arm  come along dreever he said you can come and sit out with me well go and smoke on the terrace  they left the room together  what does the old boy want inquired his lordship are you and miss mceachern  we are said jimmy  by jove i say old chap million congratulations and all that sort of rot you know  thanks said jimmy have a cigarette  his lordship had to resume his duties in the ballroom after awhile but jimmy sat on smoking and thinking the night was very still now and then a sparrow would rustle in the ivy on the castle wall and somewhere in the distance a dog was barking the music had begun again in the ballroom it sounded faint and thin where he sat  in the general stillness the opening of the door at the top of the steps came sharply to his ears he looked up two figures were silhouetted for a moment against the light and then the door closed again they began to move slowly down the steps  jimmy had recognized them he got up he was in the shadow they could not see him they began to walk down the terrace they were quite close now neither was speaking but presently when they were but a few feet away they stopped there was the splutter of a match and mceachern lighted a cigar in the yellow light his face was clearly visible jimmy looked and was content  he edged softly toward the shrubbery at the end of the terrace and entering it without a sound began to make his way back to the house     chapter xxx  conclusion   the american liner st louis lay in the empress dock at southampton taking aboard her passengers all sorts and conditions of men flowed in an unceasing stream up the gangway  leaning over the secondclass railing jimmy pitt and spike mullins watched them thoughtfully  jimmy looked up at the blue peter that fluttered from the foremast and then at spike the bowery boys face was stolid and expressionless he was smoking a short wooden pipe with an air of detachment  well spike said jimmy your schooners on the tide now isnt it your vessels at the quay youve got some queerlooking fellowtravelers dont miss the two cingalese sports and the man in the turban and the baggy breeches i wonder if theyre airtight useful if he fell overboard  sure said spike directing a contemplative eye toward the garment in question he knows his business  i wonder what those men on the deck are writing theyve been scribbling away ever since we came here probably society journalists we shall see in next weeks papers among the secondclass passengers we noticed mr spike mullins looking as cheery as ever its a pity youre so set on going spike why not change your mind and stop  for a moment spike looked wistful then his countenance resumed its woodenness dere aint no use for me dis side boss he said new yorks de spot youse dont want none of me now youre married hows miss molly boss  splendid spike thanks were going over to france by tonights boat  its been a queer business jimmy continued after a pause a deucedqueer business still ive come very well out of it at any rate it seems to me that youre the only one of us who doesnt end happily spike im married mceacherns butted into society so deep that it would take an excavating party with dynamite to get him out of it mollywell mollys made a bad bargain but i hope she wont regret it were all going some except you youre going out on the old trail againwhich begins in third avenue and ends in sing sing why tear yourself away spike  spike concentrated his gaze on a weedy young emigrant in a blue jersey who was having his eye examined by the overworked doctor and seemed to be resenting it  deres nuttin doin dis side boss he said at length i want to git busy  ulysses mullins said jimmy looking at him curiously i know the feeling theres only one cure i sketched it out for you once but i guess youll never take it yon dont think a lot of women do you youre the rugged bachelor  goils began spike comprehensively and abandoned the topic without dilating on it further  jimmy lighted his pipe and threw the match overboard  the sun came out from behind a cloud and the water sparkled  dose were great jools boss said spike thoughtfully  i believe youre still brooding over them spike  we could have got away wit dem if youse would have stood fer it dead easy  you are
