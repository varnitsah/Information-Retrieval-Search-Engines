in great britain by william heinemann ltd 1897     1   it was the first saturday afternoon in august it had been broiling hot all day with a cloudless sky and the sun had been beating down on the houses so that the top rooms were like ovens but now with the approach of evening it was cooler and everyone in vere street was out of doors  vere street lambeth is a short straight street leading out of the westminster bridge road it has forty houses on one side and forty houses on the other and these eighty houses are very much more like one another than ever peas are like peas or young ladies like young ladies they are newish threestoried buildings of dingy grey brick with slate roofs and they are perfectly flat without a bowwindow or even a projecting cornice or windowsill to break the straightness of the line from one end of the street to the other  this saturday afternoon the street was full of life no traffic came down vere street and the cemented space between the pavements was given up to children several games of cricket were being played by wildly excited boys using coats for wickets an old tennisball or a bundle of rags tied together for a ball and generally an old broomstick for bat the wicket was so large and the bat so small that the man in was always getting bowled when heated quarrels would arise the batter absolutely refusing to go out and the bowler absolutely insisting on going in the girls were more peaceable they were chiefly employed in skipping and only abused one another mildly when the rope was not properly turned or the skipper did not jump sufficiently high worst off of all were the very young children for there had been no rain for weeks and the street was as dry and clean as a covered court and in the lack of mud to wallow in they sat about the road disconsolate as poets the number of babies was prodigious they sprawled about everywhere on the pavement round the doors and about their mothers skirts the grownups were gathered round the open doors there were usually two women squatting on the doorstep and two or three more seated on either side on chairs they were invariably nursing babies and most of them showed clear signs that the present object of the maternal care would be soon ousted by a new arrival men were less numerous but such as there were leant against the walls smoking or sat on the sills of the groundfloor windows it was the dead season in vere street as much as in belgravia and really if it had not been for babies just come or just about to come and an opportune murder in a neighbouring dosshouse there would have been nothing whatever to talk about as it was the little groups talked quietly discussing the atrocity or the merits of the local midwives comparing the circumstances of their various confinements  youll be avin your little trouble soon eh polly asked one good lady of another  oh i reckon ive got another two months ter go yet answered polly  well said a third i wouldnt ave thought youd go so long by the look of yer  i ope youll have it easier this time my dear said a very stout old person a woman of great importance  she said she wasnt goin to ave no more when the last one come this remark came from pollys husband  ah said the stout old lady who was in the business and boasted vast experience thats wot they all says but lor bless yer they dont mean it  well ive got three and im not goin to ave no more blime if i will taint good enoughthats wot i says  youre abaht right there ole gal said polly my word arry if you ave any more ill git a divorce that i will  at that moment an organgrinder turned the corner and came down the street  good biz eres an organ cried half a dozen people at once  the organman was an italian with a shock of black hair and a ferocious moustache drawing his organ to a favourable spot he stopped released his shoulder from the leather straps by which he dragged it and cocking his large soft hat on the side of his head began turning the handle it was a lively tune and in less than no time a little crowd had gathered round to listen chiefly the young men and the maidens for the married ladies were never in a fit state to dance and therefore disinclined to trouble themselves to stand round the organ there was a moments hesitation at opening the ball then one girl said to another  come on florrie you and me aint shy well begin and bust it  the two girls took hold of one another one acting gentleman the other lady three or four more pairs of girls immediately joined them and they began a waltz they held themselves very upright and with an air of grave dignity which was quite impressive glided slowly about making their steps with the utmost precision bearing themselves with sufficient decorum for a court ball after a while the men began to itch for a turn and two of them taking hold of one another in the most approved fashion waltzed round the circle with the gravity of judges  all at once there was a cry theres liza and several members of the group turned and called out oo look at liza  the dancers stopped to see the sight and the organgrinder having come to the end of his tune ceased turning the handle and looked to see what was the excitement  oo liza they called out look at liza oo i sy  it was a young girl of about eighteen with dark eyes and an enormous fringe puffedout and curled and frizzed covering her whole forehead from side to side and coming down to meet her eyebrows she was dressed in brilliant violet with great lappets of velvet and she had on her head an enormous black hat covered with feathers  i sy aint she got up dossy called out the groups at the doors as she passed  dressed ter death and kill the fashion thats wot i calls it  liza saw what a sensation she was creating she arched her back and lifted her head and walked down the street swaying her body from side to side and swaggering along as though the whole place belonged to her  ave yer bought the street bill shouted one youth and then half a dozen burst forth at once as if by inspiration  knocked em in the old kent road  it was immediately taken up by a dozen more and they all yelled it out  knocked em in the old kent road yah ah knocked em in the old kent road  oo liza they shouted the whole street joined in and they gave long shrill earpiercing shrieks and strange calls that rung down the street and echoed back again  hextra special called out a wag  oh liza oo ooo yells and whistles and then it thundered forth again  knocked em in the old kent road  liza put on the air of a conquering hero and sauntered on enchanted at the uproar she stuck out her elbows and jerked her head on one side and said to herself as she passed through the bellowing crowd  this is jam  knocked em in the old kent road  when she came to the group round the barrelorgan one of the girls cried out to her  is that yer new dress liza  well it dont look like my old one do it said liza  where did yer git it asked another friend rather enviously  picked it up in the street of course scornfully answered liza  i believe its the same one as i saw in the pawnbrokers dahn the road said one of the men to tease her  thets it but wot was you doin in there pledgin yer shirt or was it yer trousers  yah i wouldnt git a secondand dress at a pawnbrokers  garn said liza indignantly ill swipe yer over the snitch if yer talk ter me i got the mayterials in the west hend didnt i and i ad it mide up by my court dressmiker so you jolly well dry up old jellybelly  garn was the reply  liza had been so intent on her new dress and the comment it was exciting that she had not noticed the organ  oo i say lets ave some dancin she said as soon as she saw it come on sally she added to one of the girls you an mell dance togither grind away old cock  the man turned on a new tune and the organ began to play the intermezzo from the cavalleria other couples quickly followed lizas example and they began to waltz round with the same solemnity as before but liza outdid them all if the others were as stately as queens she was as stately as an empress the gravity and dignity with which she waltzed were something appalling you felt that the minuet was a frolic in comparison it would have been a fitting measure to tread round the grave of a premi√®re danseuse or at the funeral of a professional humorist and the graces she put on the languor of the eyes the contemptuous curl of the lips the exquisite turn of the hand the dainty arching of the foot you felt there could be no questioning her right to the tyranny of vere street  suddenly she stopped short and disengaged herself from her companion  oh i sy she said this is too bloomin slow it gives me the sick  that is not precisely what she said but it is impossible always to give the exact unexpurgated words of liza and the other personages of the story the reader is therefore entreated with his thoughts to piece out the necessary imperfections of the dialogue  its too bloomin slow she said again it gives me the sick lets ave somethin a bit more lively than this ere waltz you stand over there sally an well show em ow ter skirt dance  they all stopped waltzing  talk of the ballet at the canterbury and south london you just wite till you see the ballet at vere street lambethwell knock em  she went up to the organgrinder  na then italiano she said to him you buck up give us a tune thats got some guts in it see  she caught hold of his big hat and squashed it down over his eyes the man grinned from ear to ear and touching the little catch at the side began to play a lively tune such as liza had asked for  the men had fallen out but several girls had put themselves in position in couples standing face to face and immediately the music struck up they began they held up their skirts on each side so as to show their feet and proceeded to go through the difficult steps and motions of the dance liza was right they could not have done it better in a trained ballet but the best dancer of them all was liza she threw her whole soul into it forgetting the stiff bearing which she had thought proper to the waltz and casting off its elaborate graces she gave herself up entirely to the present pleasure gradually the other couples stood aside so that liza and sally were left alone they paced it carefully watching each others steps and as if by instinct performing corresponding movements so as to make the whole a thing of symmetry  im abaht done said sally blowing and puffing ive ad enough of it  go on liza cried out a dozen voices when sally stopped  she gave no sign of having heard them other than calmly to continue her dance she glided through the steps and swayed about and manipulated her skirt all with the most charming grace imaginable then the music altering she changed the style of her dancing her feet moved more quickly and did not keep so strictly to the ground she was getting excited at the admiration of the onlookers and her dance grew wilder and more daring she lifted her skirts higher brought in new and more difficult movements into her improvisation kicking up her legs she did the wonderful twist backwards and forwards of which the dancer is proud  look at er legs cried one of the men  look at er stockins shouted another and indeed they were remarkable for liza had chosen them of the same brilliant hue as her dress and was herself most proud of the harmony  her dance became gayer her feet scarcely touched the ground she whirled round madly  take care yer dont split cried out one of the wags at a very audacious kick  the words were hardly out of his mouth when liza with a gigantic effort raised her foot and kicked off his hat the feat was greeted with applause and she went on making turns and twists flourishing her skirts kicking higher and higher and finally among a volley of shouts fell on her hands and turned head over heels in a magnificent catharinewheel then scrambling to her feet again she tumbled into the arms of a young man standing in the front of the ring  thats right liza he said give us a kiss now and promptly tried to take one  git aht said liza pushing him away not too gently  yus give us a kiss cried another running up to her  ill smack yer in the fice said liza elegantly as she dodged him  ketch old on er bill cried out a third an well all kiss her  na you wont shrieked liza beginning to run  come on they cried well ketch er  she dodged in and out between their legs under their arms and then getting clear of the little crowd caught up her skirts so that they might not hinder her and took to her heels along the street a score of men set in chase whistling shouting yelling the people at the doors looked up to see the fun and cried out to her as she dashed past she ran like the wind suddenly a man from the side darted into the middle of the road stood straight in her way and before she knew where she was she had jumped shrieking into his arms and he lifting her up to him had imprinted two sounding kisses on her cheeks  oh you  she said her expression was quite unprintable nor can it be euphemized  there was a shout of laughter from the bystanders and the young men in chase of her and liza looking up saw a big bearded man whom she had never seen before she blushed to the very roots of her hair quickly extricated herself from his arms and amid the jeers and laughter of everyone slid into the door of the nearest house and was lost to view     2   liza and her mother were having supper mrs kemp was an elderly woman short and rather stout with a red face and grey hair brushed tight back over her forehead she had been a widow for many years and since her husbands death had lived with liza in the groundfloor front room in which they were now sitting her husband had been a soldier and from a grateful country she received a pension large enough to keep her from starvation and by charring and doing such odd jobs as she could get she earned a little extra to supply herself with liquor liza was able to make her own living by working at a factory  mrs kemp was rather sulky this evening  wot was yer doin this afternoon liza she asked  i was in the street  youre always in the street when i want yer  i didnt know as ow yer wanted me mother answered liza  well yer might ave come ter see i

givin it me ter sive up an for the matter of thet i wanted a new dress far worse than you did but of course i dont matter  liza did not answer and mrs kemp having nothing more to say continued her supper in silence  it was liza who spoke next  theres some new people moved in the street ave you seen em she asked  no wot are they  i dunno ive seen a chap a big chap with a beard i think e lives up at the other end  she felt herself blushing a little  no one any good you be sure said mrs kemp i cant swaller these new people as are comin in the street aint wot it was when i fust come  when they had done mrs kemp got up and having finished her halfpint of beer said to her daughter  put the things awy liza im just goin round to see mrs clayton shes just ad twins and she ad nine before these come its a pity the lord dont see fit ter tike some on emthets wot i say  after which pious remark mrs kemp went out of the house and turned into another a few doors up  liza did not clear the supper things away as she was told but opened the window and drew her chair to it she leant on the sill looking out into the street the sun had set and it was twilight the sky was growing dark bringing to view the twinkling stars there was no breeze but it was pleasantly and restfully cool the good folk still sat at their doorsteps talking as before on the same inexhaustible subjects but a little subdued with the approach of night the boys were still playing cricket but they were mostly at the other end of the street and their shouts were muffled before they reached lizas ears  she sat leaning her head on her hands breathing in the fresh air and feeling a certain exquisite sense of peacefulness which she was not used to it was saturday evening and she thankfully remembered that there would be no factory on the morrow she was glad to rest somehow she felt a little tired perhaps it was through the excitement of the afternoon and she enjoyed the quietness of the evening it seemed so tranquil and still the silence filled her with a strange delight she felt as if she could sit there all through the night looking out into the cool dark street and up heavenwards at the stars she was very happy but yet at the same time experienced a strange new sensation of melancholy and she almost wished to cry  suddenly a dark form stepped in front of the open window she gave a little shriek  oos thet she asked for it was quite dark and she did not recognize the man standing in front of her  me liza was the answer  tom  yus  it was a young man with light yellow hair and a little fair moustache which made him appear almost boyish he was lightcomplexioned and blueeyed and had a frank and pleasant look mingled with a curious bashfulness that made him blush when people spoke to him  wots up asked liza  come aht for a walk liza will yer  no she answered decisively  you promised ter yesterday liza  yesterday an terdays two different things was her wise reply  yus come on liza  na i tell yer i wont  i want ter talk ter yer liza her hand was resting on the windowsill and he put his upon it she quickly drew it back  well i dont want yer ter talk ter me  but she did for it was she who broke the silence  say tom oo are them new folk as as come into the street its a big chap with a brown beard  dyou mean the bloke as kissed yer this afternoon  liza blushed again  well why

lite  liza he said blushing to the roots of his hair  well  lizahe couldnt go on and stuttered in his shynessliza iii loves yer liza  garn awy  he was quite brave now and took hold of her hand  yer

you  oh i cant tom  there aint no one else  na  then why not  im very sorry tom but i dont love yer so as ter marry yer  oh liza  she could not see the look upon his face but she heard the agony in his voice and moved with sudden pity she bent out threw her arms round his neck and kissed him on both cheeks  never mind old chap she said im not worth troublin abaht  and quickly drawing back she slammed the window to and moved into the further part of the room     3   the following day was sunday liza when she was dressing herself in the morning felt the hardness of fate in the impossibility of eating ones cake and having it she wished she had reserved her new dress and had still before her the sensation of a first appearance in it with a sigh she put on her ordinary everyday working dress and proceeded to get the breakfast ready for her mother had been out late the previous night celebrating the new arrivals in the street and had the rheumatics this morning  oo my ead she was saying as she pressed her hands on each side of her forehead ive got the neuralgy again wot shall i do i dunno ow it is but it always comes on sunday mornings oo an my rheumatics they give me sich a

discreet remark but it set mrs kemp in a whirlwind of passion she raised herself and sat up in the bed flourishing her clenched fist at her daughter  i know wot yer mean you  you her language was emphatic her epithets picturesque but too forcible for reproduction you think id steal it she went on i know yer dyer think id go an tike yer dirty money  well mother said liza when ive told yer

no good ill be bound an ere am i left alone an i might die for all you care  in her sorrow at herself the old lady began to cry and liza slipped out of the room and into the street  leaning against the wall of the opposite house was tom he came towards her  ulloa she said as she saw him wot are you doin ere  i was waitin for you ter come aht liza he answered  she looked at him quickly  i aint

mouth in trumpet form and shouted  i i i sally  a couple of fellows standing by copied her  i i i sally  garn said liza looking round at them  sally did not appear and she repeated her call the men imitated her and half a dozen took it up so that there was enough noise to wake the seven sleepers  i i i sally  a head was put out of a top window and liza taking off her hat waved it crying  come on dahn sally  arright old gal shouted the other im comin  sos christmas was lizas repartee  there was a clatter down the stairs and sally rushing through the passage threw herself on to her friend they began fooling in reminiscence of a melodrama they had lately seen together  oh my darlin duck said liza kissing her and pressing her with affected rapture to her bosom  my sweetest sweet replied sally copying her  an ow does your lidyship terday  ohwith immense languorfust class and is your royal ighness quite well  i deeply regret answered liza but my royal ighness as got the collywobbles  sally was a small thin girl with sandy hair and blue eyes and a very freckled complexion she had an enormous mouth with terrible square teeth set wide apart which looked as if they could masticate an iron bar she was dressed like liza in a shortish black skirt and an oldfashioned bodice green and grey and yellow with age her sleeves were tucked up to the elbow and she wore a singularly dirty apron that had once been white  wot ave you got yer air in them things for asked liza pointing to the curlpapers goin aht with yer young man terday  no im going ter stay ere all day  wot for then  why arrys

with tom and then throw him over  well you are a mug  the two girls had strolled down towards the westminster bridge road and sally meeting her young man had gone to him liza walked back wishing to get home in time to cook the dinner but she went slowly for she knew every dweller in the street and as she passed the groups sitting at their doors as on the previous evening but this time mostly engaged in peeling potatoes or shelling peas she stopped and had a little chat everyone liked her and was glad to have her company good old liza they would say as she left them shes a rare good sort aint she  she asked after the aches and pains of all the old people and delicately inquired after the babies past and future the children hung on to her skirts and asked her to play with them and she would hold one end of the rope while tiny little ragged girls skipped invariably entangling themselves after two jumps  she had nearly reached home when she heard a voice cry  mornin  she looked round and recognized the man whom tom had told her was called jim blakeston he was sitting on a stool at the door of one of the houses playing with two young children to whom he was giving rides on his knee she remembered his heavy brown beard from the day before and she had also an impression of great size she noticed this morning that he was in fact a big man tall and broad and she saw besides that he had large masculine features and pleasant brown eyes she supposed him to be about forty  mornin he said again as she stopped and looked at him  well yer neednt look as if i was goin ter eat yer up cause i aint he said  oo are you im not afeard of yer  wot are yer so bloomin red abaht he asked pointedly  well im ot  you aint shirty cause i kissed yer last night  im not shirty but it was pretty cool considerin like as i didnt know yer  well you run into my arms  thet i didnt you run aht and caught me  an kissed yer before you could say jack robinson he laughed at the thought well liza he went on seein as ow i kissed yer against yer will the best thing you can do ter make it up is to kiss me not against yer will  me said liza looking at him openmouthed well you are a pill  the children began to clamour for the riding which had been discontinued on lizas approach  are them your kids she asked  yus thems two on em  ow many ave yer got  five the eldest gals fifteen and the next one oos a boys twelve and then there are these two and baby  well youve got enough for your money  too many for meand more comin  ah well said liza laughing thets your fault aint it  then she bade him good morning and strolled off  he watched her as she went and saw half a dozen little boys surround her and beg her to join them in their game of cricket they caught hold of her arms and skirts and pulled her to their pitch  no i cant she said trying to disengage herself ive got the dinner ter cook  dinner ter cook shouted one small boy why they always cooks the cats meat at the shop  you little soandso said liza somewhat inelegantly making a dash at him  he dodged her and gave a whoop then turning he caught her round the legs and another boy catching hold of her round the neck they dragged her down and all three struggled on the ground rolling over and over the other boys threw themselves on the top so that there was a great heap of legs and arms and heads waving and bobbing up and down  liza extricated herself with some difficulty and taking off her hat she began cuffing the boys with it using all the time the most lively expressions then having cleared the field she retired victorious into her own house and began cooking the dinner     4   bank holiday was a beautiful day the cloudless sky threatened a stifling heat for noontide but early in the morning when liza got out of bed and threw open the window it was fresh and cool she dressed herself wondering how she should spend her day she thought of sally going off to chingford with her lover and of herself remaining alone in the dull street with half the people away she almost wished it were an ordinary workday and that there were no such things as bank holidays and it seemed to be a little like two sundays running but with the second rather worse than the first her mother was still sleeping and she was in no great hurry about getting the breakfast but stood quietly looking out of the window at the house opposite  in a little while she saw sally coming along she was arrayed in purple and fine linena very smart red dress trimmed with velveteen and a tremendous hat covered with feathers she had reaped the benefit of keeping her hair in curlpapers since saturday and her sandy fringe stretched from ear to ear she was in enormous spirits  ulloa liza she called as soon as she saw her at the window  liza looked at her a little enviously  ulloa she answered quietly  im just goin to the red lion to meet arry  at what time dyer start  the brake leaves at alfpast eight sharp  why its only eight its

lion liza and see us off said sally  no im damned if i do answered liza with some warmth  you might as well praps arry wont be there an you can keep me company till e comes an you can see the orses  liza was really very anxious to see the brake and the horses and the people going but she hesitated a little longer sally asked her once again then she said  arright ill come with yer and wite till the bloomin old thing starts  she did not trouble to put on a hat but just walked out as she was and accompanied sally to the publichouse which was getting up the expedition  although there was still nearly half an hour to wait the brake was drawn up before the main entrance it was large and long with seats arranged crosswise so that four people could sit on each and it was drawn by two powerful horses whose harness the coachman was now examining sally was not the first on the scene for already half a dozen people had taken their places but harry had not yet arrived the two girls stood by the publicdoor looking at the preparations huge baskets full of food were brought out and stowed away cases of beer were hoisted up and put in every possible placeunder the seats under the drivers legs and even beneath the brake as more people came up sally began to get excited about harrys nonappearance  i say i wish ed come she said e is lite  then she looked up and down the westminster bridge road to see if he was in view  suppose e dont turn up i will give it im when e comes for keepin me witin like this  why theres a quarter of an hour yet said liza who saw nothing at all to get excited about  at last sally saw her lover and rushed off to meet him liza was left alone rather disconsolate at all this bustle and preparation she was not sorry that she had refused toms invitation but she did wish that she had conscientiously been able to accept it sally and her friend came up attired in his sunday best he was a fit match for his ladylovehe wore a shirt and collar unusual luxuriesand be carried under his arm a concertina to make things merry on the way  aint you goin liza he asked in surprise at seeing her without a hat and with her apron on  na said sally aint she a soft tom said ed tike er an she wouldnt  well im dashed  then they climbed the ladder and took their seats so that liza was left alone again more people had come along and the brake was nearly full liza knew them all but they were too busy taking their places to talk to her at last tom came he saw her standing there and went up to her  wont yer change yer mind liza an come along with us  na tom i told yer i wouldntits not right like she felt she must repeat that to herself often  i shant enjoy it a bit without you he said  well i cant elp it she answered somewhat sullenly  at that moment a man came out of the publichouse with a horn in his hand her heart gave a great jump for if there was anything she adored it was to drive along to the tootling of a horn she really felt it was very hard lines that she must stay at home when all these people were going to have such a fine time and they were all so merry and she could picture to herself so well the delights of the drive and the picnic she felt very much inclined to cry but she mustnt go and she wouldnt go she repeated that to herself twice as the trumpeter gave a preliminary tootle  two more people hurried along and when they came near liza saw that they were jim blakeston and a woman whom she supposed to be his wife  are you comin liza jim said to her  no she answered i didnt know you was goin  i wish you was comin he replied we shall ave a game  she could only just keep back the sobs she so wished she were going it did seem hard that she must remain behind and all because she wasnt going to marry tom after all she didnt see why that should prevent her there really was no need to refuse for that she began to think she had acted foolishly it didnt do anyone any good that she refused to go out with tom and no one thought it anything specially fine that she should renounce her pleasure sally merely thought her a fool  tom was standing by her side silent and looking disappointed and rather unhappy jim said to her in a low voice  i am sorry youre not comin  it was too much she did want to go so badly and she really couldnt resist any longer if tom would only ask her once more and if she could only change her mind reasonably and decently she would accept but he stood silent and she had to speak herself it was very undignified  yer know tom she said i dont want ter spoil your day  well i dont think i shall go alone it ud be so precious slow  supposing he didnt ask her again what should she do she looked up at the clock on the front of the pub and noticed that it only wanted five minutes to the halfhour how terrible it would be if the brake started and he didnt ask her her heart beat violently against her chest and in her agitation she fumbled with the corner of her apron  well what can i do tom dear  why come with me of course oh liza do say yes  she had got the offer again and it only wanted a little seemly hesitation and the thing was done  i should like ter tom she said but dyou think it ud be arright  yus of course it would come on liza in his eagerness he clasped her hand  well she remarked looking down if itd spoil your oliday  i wont go if you dontswop me bob i wont he answered  well if i come it wont mean that im keepin company with you  na it wont mean anythin you dont like  arright she said  youll come he could hardly believe her  yus she answered smiling all over her face  youre a good sort liza i say arry lizas comin he shouted  liza oorray shouted harry  sat right liza called sally  and liza feeling quite joyful and light of heart called back  yus  oorray shouted sally in answer  thets right liza called jim and he smiled pleasantly as she looked at him  theres just room for you two ere said harry pointing to the vacant places by his side  arright said tom  i must jest go an get a at an tell mother said liza  theres just three minutes be quick answered tom and as she scampered off as hard as she could go he shouted to the coachman old ard there another passenger comin in a minute  arright old cock answered the coachman no urry  liza rushed into the room and called to her mother who was still asleep  mother mother im going to chingford  then tearing off her old dress she slipped into her gorgeous violet one she kicked off her old ragged shoes and put on her new boots she brushed her hair down and rapidly gave her fringe a twirl and a twistit was luckily still moderately in curl from the previous saturdayand putting on her black hat with all the feathers she rushed along the street and scrambling up the brake steps fell panting on toms lap  the coachman cracked his whip the trumpeter tootled his horn and with a cry and a cheer from the occupants the brake clattered down the road     5   as soon as liza had recovered herself she started examining the people on the brake and first of all she took stock of the woman whom jim blakeston had with him  this is my missus said jim pointing to her with his thumb  you aint been dahn in the street much ave yer said liza by way of making the acquaintance  na answered mrs blakeston my youngsters been dahn with the measles an ive ad my work cut out lookin after im  oh an is e all right now  yus es gettin on fine an jim wanted ter go ter chingford terday an e says ter me well e says you come along ter chingford too itll do you good an e says you can leave pollyshes my eldest yer knowyou can leave polly says e ter look after the kids so i says well i dont mind if i do says i  meanwhile liza was looking at her first she noticed her dress she wore a black cloak and a funny oldfashioned black bonnet then examining the woman herself she saw a middlesized stout person anywhere between thirty and forty years old she had a large fat face with a big mouth and her hair was curiously done parted in the middle and plastered down on each side of the head in little plaits one could see that she was a woman of great strength notwithstanding evident traces of hard work and much childbearing  liza knew all the other passengers and now that everyone was settled down and had got over the excitement of departure they had time to greet one another they were delighted to have liza among them for where she was there was no dullness her attention was first of all taken up by a young coster who had arrayed himself in the traditional costumegrey suit tight trousers and shiny buttons in profusion  wot cheer bill she cried to him  wot cheer liza he answered  you are got up dossy youll knock em  na then liza kemp said his companion turning round with mock indignation you let my johnny alone if you come gettin round im ill give you wot for  arright clary sharp i dont want im answered liza ive got one of my own an thets a good andfulaint it tom  tom was delighted and unable to find a repartee in his pleasure gave liza a great nudge with his elbow  oo i say said liza putting her hand to her side tike care of my ribs youll brike em  thems not yer ribs shouted a candid friendthems yer whalebones yer afraid of breakin  garn  ave yer got whalebones said tom with affected simplicity putting his arm round her waist to feel  na then she said keep off the grass  well i only wanted ter know if youd got any  garn yer dont git round me like thet  he still kept as he was  na then she repeated tike yer and away if yer touch me there youll ave ter marry me  thets just wot i wants ter do liza  shut it she answered cruelly and drew his arm away from her waist  the horses scampered on and the man behind blew his horn with vigour  dont bust yerself guvnor said one of the passengers to him when he made a particularly discordant sound they drove along eastwards and as the hour grew later the streets became more filled and the traffic greater at last they got on the road to chingford and caught up numbers of other vehicles going in the same directiondonkeyshays ponycarts tradesmens carts dogcarts drags brakes every conceivable kind of wheel thing all filled with people the wretched donkey dragging along four solid ratepayers to the pair of stout horses easily managing a couple of score they exchanged cheers and greetings as they passed the red lion brake being noticeable above all for its uproariousness as the day wore on the sun became hotter and the road seemed more dusty and threw up a greater heat  i am getting ot was the common cry and everyone began to puff and sweat  the ladies removed their cloaks and capes and the men following their example took off their coats and sat in their shirtsleeves whereupon ensued much banter of a not particularly edifying kind respecting the garments which each person would like to removewhich showed that the innuendo of french farce is not so unknown to the upright honest englishman as might be supposed  at last came in sight the halfway house where the horses were to have a rest and a sponge down they had been talking of it for the last quarter of a mile and when at length it was observed on the top of a hill a cheer broke out and some thirsty wag began to sing rule britannia whilst others burst forth with a different national ditty beer glorious beer they drew up before the pub entrance and all climbed down as quickly as they could the bar was besieged and potmen and barmaids were quickly busy drawing beer and handing it over to the eager folk outside  the idyll of corydon and phyllis  gallantry ordered that the faithful swain and the amorous shepherdess should drink out of one and the same pot  urry up an ave your whack said corydon politely handing the foaming bowl for his fair one to drink from  phyllis without replying raised it to her lips and drank deep the swain watched anxiously  ere give us a chanst he said as the pot was raised higher and higher and its contents appeared to be getting less and less  at this the amorous shepherdess stopped and handed the pot to her lover  well im dashed said corydon looking into it and added i guess you know a thing or two then with courtly grace putting his own lips to the place where had been those of his beloved finished the pint  go lumme remarked the shepherdess smacking her lips that was somethin like and she put out her tongue and licked her lips and then breathed deeply  the faithful swain having finished gave a long sigh and said  well i could do with some more  for the matter of thet i could do with a gargle  thus encouraged the gallant returned to the bar and soon brought out a second pint  you ave fust pop amorously remarked phyllis and he took a long drink and handed the pot to her  she with maiden modesty turned it so as to have a different part to drink from but he remarked as he saw her  you are bloomin particular  then unwilling to grieve him she turned it back again and applied her ruby lips to the place where his had been  now we shant be long she remarked as she handed him back the pot  the faithful swain took out of his pocket a short clay pipe blew through it filled it and began to smoke while phyllis sighed at the thought of the cool liquid gliding down her throat and with the pleasing recollection gently stroked her stomach then corydon spat and immediately his love said  i can spit farther than thet  i bet yer yer cant  she tried and did he collected himself and spat again further than before she followed him and in this idyllic contest they remained till the tootling horn warned them to take their places                                       at last they reached chingford and here the horses were taken out and the drag on which they were to lunch drawn up in a sheltered spot they were all rather hungry but as it was not yet feedingtime they scattered to have drinks meanwhile liza and tom with sally and her young man went off together to the nearest publichouse and as they drank beer harry who was a great sportsman gave them a graphic account of a prizefight he had seen on the previous saturday evening which had been rendered specially memorable by one man being so hurt that he had died from the effects it had evidently been a very fine affair and harry said that several swells from the west end had been present and he related their ludicrous efforts to get in without being seen by anyone and their terror when someone to frighten them called out copper then tom and he entered into a discussion on the subject of boxing in which tom being a shy and undogmatic sort of person was entirely worsted after this they strolled back to the brake and found things being prepared for luncheon the hampers were brought out and emptied and the bottles of beer in great profusion made many a thirsty mouth thirstier  come along lidies an gentlemenif you are gentlemen shouted the coachman the animals is now goin ter be fed  garn awy answered somebody were not hanimals we dont drink water  youre too clever remarked the coachman i can see youve just come from the board school  as the former speaker was a lady of quite mature appearance the remark was not without its little irony the other man blew his horn by way of grace at which liza called out to him  dont do thet youll bust i know you will an if you bust youll quite spoil my dinner  then they all set to porkpies saveloys sausages cold potatoes hardboiled eggs cold bacon veal ham crabs and shrimps cheese butter cold suetpuddings and treacle gooseberrytarts cherrytarts butter bread more sausages and yet again porkpies they devoured the provisions like ravening beasts stolidly silently earnestly in large mouthfuls which they shoved down their throats unmasticated the intelligent foreigner seeing them thus dispose of their food would have understood why england is a great nation he would have understood why britons never never will be slaves they never stopped except to drink and then at each gulp they emptied their glass no heeltaps and still they ate and still they drankbut as all things must cease they stopped at last and a long sigh of content broke from their twoandthirty throats  then the gathering broke up and the good folk paired themselves and separated harry and his lady strolled off to secluded byways in the forest so that they might discourse of their loves and digest their dinner tom had all the morning been waiting for this happy moment he had counted on the expansive effect of a full stomach to thaw his lizas coldness and he had pictured himself sitting on the grass with his back against the trunk of a spreading chestnuttree with his arm round his lizas waist and her head resting affectionately on his manly bosom liza too had foreseen the separation into couples after dinner and had been racking her brains to find a means of getting out of it  i dont want im slobberin abaht me she said it gives me the sick all this kissin an cuddlin  she scarcely knew why she objected to his caresses but they bored her and made her cross but luckily the blessed institution of marriage came to her rescue for jim and his wife naturally had no particular desire to spend the afternoon together and liza seeing a little embarrassment on their part proposed that they should go for a walk together in the forest  jim agreed at once and with pleasure but tom was dreadfully disappointed he hadnt the courage to say anything but he glared at blakeston jim smiled benignly at him and tom began to sulk then they began a funny walk through the woods jim tried to go on with liza and liza was not at all disinclined to this for she had come to the conclusion that jim notwithstanding his cheek was not alf a bad sort but tom kept walking alongside of them and as jim slightly quickened his pace so as to get liza on in front tom quickened his and mrs blakeston who didnt want to be left behind had to break into a little trot to keep up with them jim tried also to get liza all to himself in the conversation and let tom see that he was out in the cold but tom would break in with cross sulky remarks just to make the others uncomfortable liza at last got rather vexed with him  strikes me you got aht of bed the wrong way this mornin she said to him  yer didnt think thet when yer said youd come aht with me he emphasized the me  liza shrugged her shoulders  you give me the ump she said if yer wants ter mike a fool of yerself you can go elsewhere an do it  i suppose yer want me ter go awy now he said angrily  i didnt say i did  arright liza i wont stay where im not wanted and turning on his heel he marched off striking through the underwood into the midst of the forest  he felt extremely unhappy as he wandered on and there was a choky feeling in his throat as he thought of liza she was very unkind and ungrateful and he wished he had never come to chingford she might so easily have come for a walk with him instead of going with that beast of a blakeston she wouldnt ever do anything for him and he hated herbut all the same he was a poor foolish thing in love and he began to feel that perhaps he had been a little exacting and a little forward to take offence and then he wished he had never said anything and he wanted so much to see her and make it up he made his way back to chingford hoping she would not make him wait too long  liza was a little surprised when tom turned and left them  wot as e got the needle abaht she said  why es jealous answered jim with a laugh  tom jealous  yus es jealous of me  well e aint got no cause ter be jealous of anyonethat e aint said liza and continued by telling him all about tom how he had wanted to marry her and she wouldnt have him and how she had only agreed to come to chingford with him on the understanding that she should preserve her entire freedom jim listened sympathetically but his wife paid no attention she was doubtless engaged in thought respecting her household or her family  when they got back to chingford they saw tom standing in solitude looking at them liza was struck by the woebegone expression on his face she felt she had been cruel to him and leaving the blakestons went up to him  i say tom she said dont tike on so i didnt mean it  he was bursting to apologize for his behaviour  yer know tom she went on im rather asty an im sorry i said wot i did  oh liza you are good you aint cross with me  me na its you thet oughter be cross  you are a good sort liza  you aint vexed with me  give me liza every time thats wot i say he answered as his face lit up come along an ave tea an then well go for a donkeyride  the donkeyride was a great success liza was a little afraid at first so tom walked by her side to take care of her she screamed the moment the beast began to trot and clutched hold of tom to save herself from falling and as he felt her hand on his shoulder and heard her appealing cry oh do old me im fallin he felt that he had never in his life been so deliciously happy the whole party joined in and it was proposed that they should have races but in the first heat when the donkeys broke into a canter liza fell off into toms arms and the donkeys scampered on without her  i know wot ill do she said when the runaway had been recovered ill ride im straddlewyse  garn said sally yer cant with petticoats  yus i can an i will too  so another donkey was procured this time with a mans saddle and putting her foot in the stirrup she cocked her leg over and took her seat triumphantly neither modesty nor bashfulness was to be reckoned among lizas faults and in this position she felt quite at ease  ill git along arright now tom she said you garn and git yerself a moke and come an jine in  the next race was perfectly uproarious liza kicked and beat her donkey with all her might shrieking and laughing the white and finally came in winner by a length after that they felt rather warm and dry and repaired to the publichouse to restore themselves and talk over the excitements of the racecourse  when they had drunk several pints of beer liza and sally with their respective adorers and the blakestons walked round to find other means of amusing themselves they were arrested by a coconutshy  oh lets ave a shy said liza excitedly at which the unlucky men had to pull out their coppers while sally and liza made ludicrously bad shots at the coconuts  it looks so bloomin easy said liza brushing up her hair but i cant it the blasted thing you ave a shot tom  he and harry were equally unskilful but jim got three coconuts running and the proprietors of the show began to look on him with some concern  you are a dab at it said liza in admiration  they tried to induce mrs blakeston to try her luck but she stoutly refused  i dont old with such foolishness its wiste of money ter me she said  na then dont crack on old tart remarked her husband lets go an eat the coconuts  there was one for each couple and after the ladies had sucked the juice they divided them and added their respective shares to their dinners and teas supper came next again they fell to sausagerolls boiled eggs and saveloys and countless bottles of beer were added to those already drunk  i dunno ow many bottles of beer ive drunkive lost count said liza whereat there was a general laugh  they still had an hour before the brake was to start back and it was then the concertinas came in useful they sat down on the grass and the concert was begun by harry who played a solo then there was a call for a song and jim stood up and sang that ancient ditty o dem golden kippers o there was no shyness in the company and liza almost without being asked gave another popular comic song then there was more concertina playing and another demand for a song liza turned to tom who was sitting quietly by her side  give us a song old cock she said  i cant he answered im not a singin sort at which blakeston got up and offered to sing again  tom is rather a soft said liza to herself not like that cove blakeston  they repaired to the publichouse to have a few last drinks before the brake started and when the horn blew to warn them rather unsteadily they proceeded to take their places  liza as she scrambled up the steps said well i believe im boozed  the coachman had arrived at the melancholy stage of intoxication and was sitting on his box holding his reins with his head bent on his chest he was thinking sadly of the longlost days of his youth and wishing he had been a better man  liza had no respect for such holy emotions and she brought down her fist on the crown of his hat and bashed it over his eyes  na then old jellybelly she said wots the good of avin a fice as long as a kite  he turned round and smote her  jellybelly yerself said he  puddin fice she cried  kite fice  boss eye  she was tremendously excited laughing and singing keeping the whole company in an uproar in her jollity she had changed hats with tom and he in her big feathers made her shriek with laughter when they started they began to sing for es a jolly good feller making the night resound with their noisy voices  liza and tom and the blakestons had got a seat together liza being between the two men tom was perfectly happy and only wished that they might go on so for ever gradually as they drove along they became quieter their singing ceased and they talked in undertones some of them slept sally and her young man were leaning up against one another slumbering quite peacefully the night was beautiful the sky still blue very dark scattered over with countless brilliant stars and liza as she looked up at the heavens felt a certain emotion as if she wished to be taken in someones arms or feel some strong mans caress and there was in her heart a strange sensation as though it were growing big she stopped speaking and all four were silent then slowly she felt toms arm steal round her waist cautiously as though it were afraid of being there this time both she and tom were happy but suddenly there was a movement on the other side of her a hand was advanced along her leg and her hand was grasped and gently pressed it was jim blakeston she started a little and began trembling so that tom noticed it and whispered  youre cold liza  na im not tom its only a sort of shiver thet went through me  his arm gave her waist a squeeze and at the same time the big rough hand pressed her little one and so she sat between them till they reached the red lion in the westminster bridge road and tom said to himself i believe she does care for me after all  when they got down they all said good night and sally and liza with their respective slaves and the blakestons marched off homewards at the corner of vere street harry said to tom and blakeston  i say you blokes lets go an ave another drink before closin time  i dont mind said tom after weve took the gals ome  then we shant ave time its just on closin time now answered harry  well we cant leave em ere  yus you can said sally no onell run awy with us  tom did not want to part from liza but she broke in with  yus go on tom sally an mell git along arright an you aint got too much time  yus good night arry said sally to settle the matter  good night old gal he answered give us another slobber  and she not at all unwilling surrendered herself to him while he imprinted two sounding kisses on her cheeks  good night tom said liza holding out her hand  good night liza he answered taking it but looking very wistfully at her  she understood and with a kindly smile lifted up her face to him he bent down and taking her in his arms kissed her passionately  you do kiss nice liza he said making the others laugh  thanks for tikin me aht old man she said as they parted  arright liza he answered and added almost to himself god bless yer  ulloa blakeston aint you comin said harry seeing that jim was walking off with his wife instead of joining him and tom  na he answered im goin ome ive got ter be up at five termorrer  you are a chap said harry disgustedly strolling off with tom to the pub while the others made their way down the sleeping street  the house where sally lived came first and she left them then walking a few yards more they came to the blakestons and after a little talk at the door liza bade the couple good night and was left to walk the rest of the way home the street was perfectly silent and the lampposts far apart threw a dim light which only served to make lisa realize her solitude there was such a difference between the street at midday with its swarms of people and now when there was neither sound nor soul besides herself that even she was struck by it the regular line of houses on either side with the even pavements and straight cemented road seemed to her like some desert place as if everyone were dead or a fire had raged and left it all desolate suddenly she heard a footstep she started and looked back it was a man hurrying behind her and in a moment she had recognized jim he beckoned to her and in a low voice called  liza  she stopped till he had come up to her  wot ave yer come aht again for she said  ive come aht ter say good night to you liza he answered  but yer said good night a moment ago  i wanted to say it againproperly  wheres yer missus  oh shes gone in i said i was dry and was goin ter ave a drink after all  but shell know yer didnt go ter the pub  na she wont shes gone straight upstairs to see after the kid i wanted ter see yer alone liza  why  he didnt answer but tried to take hold of her hand she drew it away quickly they walked in silence till they came to lizas house  good night said liza  wont you come for a little walk liza  tike care no one ears you she added in a whisper though why she whispered she did not know  will yer he asked again  nayouve got to get up at five  oh i only said thet not ter go inter the pub with them  so as yer might come ere with me asked liza  yus  no im not comin good night  well say good night nicely  wot dyer mean  tom said you did kiss nice  she looked at him without speaking and in a moment he had clasped his arms round her almost lifting her off her feet and kissed her she turned her face away  give us yer lips liza he whisperedgive us yer lips  he turned her face without resistance and kissed her on the mouth  at last she tore herself from him and opening the door slid away into the house     6   next morning on her way to the factory liza came up with sally they were both of them rather stale and bedraggled after the days outing their fringes were ragged and untidily straying over their foreheads their back hair carelessly tied in a loose knot fell over their necks and threatened completely to come down liza had not had time to put her hat on and was holding it in her hand sallys was pinned on sideways and she had to bash it down on her head every now and then to prevent its coming off cinderella herself was not more transformed than they were but cinderella even in her rags was virtuously tidy and patched up while sally had a great tear in her shabby dress and lizas stockings were falling over her boots  wot cheer sal said liza when she caught her up  oh i ave got sich a ead on me this mornin she remarked turning round a pale face heavily lined under the eyes  i dont feel too chirpy neither said liza sympathetically  i wish i adnt drunk so much beer added sally as a pang shot through her head  oh youll be arright in a bit said liza just then they heard the clock strike eight and they began to run so that they might not miss getting their tokens and thereby their days pay they turned into the street at the end of which was the factory and saw half a hundred women running like themselves to get in before it was too late  all the morning liza worked in a deadandalive sort of fashion her head like a piece of lead with electric shocks going through it when she moved and her tongue and mouth hot and dry at last lunchtime came  come on sal said liza im goin to ave a glass o bitter i cant stand this no longer  so they entered the publichouse opposite and in one draught finished their pots liza gave a long sigh of relief  that bucks you up dont it  i was dry i aint told yer yet liza ave i e got it aht last night  who dyer mean  why arry e spit it aht at last  arst yer ter nime the day said liza smiling  thets it  and did yer  didnt i jest answered sally with some emphasis i always told yer id git off before you  yus said liza thinking

never said yer did replied liza  oh youve got the ump you ave finished sally rather angrily  the beer had restored liza she went back to work without a headache and except for a slight languor feeling no worse for the previous days debauch as she worked on she began going over in her mind the events of the preceding day and she found entwined in all her thoughts the burly person of jim blakeston she saw him walking by her side in the forest presiding over the meals playing the concertina singing joking and finally on the drive back she felt the heavy form by her side and the big rough hand holding hers while toms arm was round her waist tom that was the first time he had entered her mind and he sank into a shadow beside the other last of all she remembered the walk home from the pub the good nights and the rapid footsteps as jim caught her up and the kiss she blushed and looked up quickly to see whether any of the girls were looking at her she could not help thinking of that moment when he took her in his arms she still felt the roughness of his beard pressing on her mouth her heart seemed to grow larger in her breast and she caught for breath as she threw back her head as if to receive his lips again a shudder ran through her from the vividness of the thought  wot are you shiverin for liza asked one of the girls you aint cold  not much answered liza blushing awkwardly on her meditations being broken into why im sweatin soim drippin wet  i expect yer caught cold in the faurest yesterday  i see your mash as i was comin along this mornin  liza stared a little  i aint got one oo dyer mean ay  yer only tom of course e did look washed aht wot was yer doin with im yesterday  e aint got nothin ter do with me e aint  garn dont you tell me  the bell rang and throwing over their work the girls trooped off and after chattering in groups outside the factory gates for a while made their way in different directions to their respective homes liza and sally went along together  i sy we are comin aht cried sally seeing the advertisement of a play being acted at the neighbouring theatre  i should like ter see thet said liza as they stood arminarm in front of the flaring poster it represented two rooms and a passage in between in one room a dead man was lying on the floor while two others were standing horrorstricken listening to a youth who was in the passage knocking at the door  you see theyve killed im said sally excitedly  yus any fool can see thet an the one ahtside wots e doin of  aint e beautiful ill git my arry ter tike me i will i should like ter see it e said ed tike me to the ply  they strolled on again and liza leaving sally made her way to her mothers she knew she must pass jims house and wondered whether she would see him but as she walked along the street she saw tom coming the opposite way with a sudden impulse she turned back so as not to meet him and began walking the way she had come then thinking herself a fool for what she had done she turned again and walked towards him she wondered if she had seen her or noticed her movement but when she looked down the street he was nowhere to be seen he had not caught sight of her and had evidently gone in to see a mate in one or other of the houses she quickened her step and passing the house where lived jim could not help looking up he was standing at the door watching her with a smile on his lips  i didnt see yer mr blakeston she said as he came up to her  didnt yer well i knew yer would an i was witin for yer ter look up i see yer before terday  na when  i passed beind yer

and slammed the door behind her  her mother had not come in from her days charing and liza set about getting her tea she thought it would be rather lonely eating it alone so pouring out a cup of tea and putting a little condensed milk into it she cut a huge piece of breadandbutter and sat herself down outside on the doorstep another woman came downstairs and seeing liza sat down by her side and began to talk  why mrs stanley wot ave yer done to your ead asked liza noticing a bandage round her forehead  i ad an accident last night answered the woman blushing uneasily  oh i am sorry wot did

liza  e was thet different ter this one e was a man as ad seen better days e was a gentleman she mouthed the word and emphasized it with an expressive nod  e was a gentleman and a christian ed been in good circumstances in is time an e was a man of education and a teetotaller for twentytwo years  at that moment lizas mother appeared on the scene  good evenin mrs stanley she said politely  the sime ter you mrs kemp replied that lady with equal courtesy  an ow is your poor ead asked lizas mother with sympathy  oh its been achin cruel ive hardly known wot ter do with myself  im sure e ought ter be

rheumatism been troublin yer litely asked mrs stanley  oh cruel liza rubs me with embrocation every night but it torments me cruel  mrs kemp then went into the house and liza remained talking to mrs stanley she too had to go in and liza was left alone some while she spent thinking of nothing staring vacantly in front of her enjoying the cool and quiet of the evening but liza could not be left alone long several boys came along with a bat and a ball and fixed upon the road just in front of her for their pitch taking off their coats they piled them up at the two ends and were ready to begin  i say old gal said one of them to liza come an have a gime of cricket will yer  na bob im tired  come on  na i tell you i wont  she was on the booze yesterday an she aint got over it cried another boy  ill swipe yer over the snitch replied liza to him and then on being asked again said  leave me alone wont yer  lizas got the needle ternight thets flat commented a third member of the team  i wouldnt drink if i was you liza added another with mock gravity its a bad abit ter git into and he began rolling and swaying about like a drunken man  if liza had been in form she would have gone straight away and given the whole lot of them a sample of her strength but she was only rather bored and vexed that they should disturb her quietness so she let them talk they saw she was not to be drawn and leaving her set to their game she watched them for some time but her thoughts gradually lost themselves and insensibly her mind was filled with a burly form and she was again thinking of jim  e is a good sort ter want ter tike me ter the ply she said to herself tom never arst me  jim had said he would come out in the evening he ought to be here soon she thought of course she wasnt going to the theatre with him but she didnt mind talking to him she rather enjoyed being asked to do a thing and refusing and she would have liked another opportunity of doing so but he didnt come and he had said he would  i say bill she said at last to one of the boys who was fielding close beside her that there blakestondyou know im  yes rather why he works at the sime plice as me  wots e do with isself in the evening i never see im abaht  i dunno i see im this evenin go into the red lion i suppose es there but i dunno  then he wasnt coming of course she had told him she was going to stay indoors but he might have come all the samejust to see  i know tom ud ave come she said to herself rather sulkily  liza liza she heard her mothers voice calling her  arright im comin said liza  ive been witin for

did yer yer dont mind if i dies with rheumatics do yer i know  liza did not answer but took the bottle and pouring some of the liniment on her hand began to rub it into mrs kemps rheumatic joints while the invalid kept complaining and grumbling at everything liza did  dont rub so ard liza youll rub all the skin off  then when liza did it as gently as she could she grumbled again  if yer do it like thet it wont do no good at all you want ter sive yerself troublei know yer when i was young girls didnt mind a little bit of ard workbut law bless yer you dont care abaht my rheumatics do yer  at last she finished and liza went to bed by her mothers side     7   two days passed and it was friday morning liza had got up early and strolled off to her work in good time but she did not meet her faithful sally on the way nor find her at the factory when she herself arrived the bell rang and all the girls trooped in but still sally did not come liza could not make it out and was thinking she would be shut out when just as the man who gave out the tokens for the days work was pulling down the shutter in front of his window sally arrived breathless and perspiring  whew go lumme i am ot she said wiping her face with her apron  i thought you wasnt comin said liza  well i only just did it i overslep myself i was aht lite last night  were yer  me an arry went ter see the ply oh liza its simply spiffin ive never see sich a good ply in my life lor why it mikes yer blood run cold they ang a man on the stige oh it mide me creep all over  and then she began telling liza all about itthe blood and thunder the shooting the railway train the murder the bomb the hero the funny manjumbling everything up in her excitement repeating little scraps of dialogueall wronggesticulating getting excited and red in the face at the recollection liza listened rather crossly feeling bored at the detail into which sally was going the piece really didnt much interest her  one ud think yerd never been to a theatre in your life before she said  i never seen anything so good i can tell yer you tike my tip and git tom ter tike yer  i dont want ter go an if i did id py for myself an go alone

explaining to liza all about the scene represented  oh you give me the sick with your fital card you do im goin ome and she left sally in the midst of her explanation  i dunno wots up with liza remarked sally to a mutual friend shes always got the needle someow  oh shes barmy answered the friend  well i do think shes a bit dotty sometimesi do really rejoined sally  liza walked homewards thinking of the play at length she tossed her head impatiently  i dont want ter see the blasted thing an if i see that there jim ill tell im so swop me bob i will  she did see him he was leaning with his back against the wall of his house smoking liza knew he had seen her and as she walked by pretended not to have noticed him to her disgust he let her pass and she was thinking he hadnt seen her after all when she heard him call her name  liza  she turned round and started with surprise very well imitated i didnt see you was there she said  why did yer pretend not ter notice me as yer went pasteh liza  why i didnt see yer  garn but you aint shirty with me  wot ave i got to be shirty abaht  he tried to take her hand but she drew it away quickly she was getting used to the movement they went on talking but jim did not mention the theatre liza was surprised and wondered whether he had forgotten  ersally went to the ply last night she said at last  oh he said and that was all  she got impatient  well im off she said  na dont go yet i want ter talk ter yer he replied  wot abaht anythin in partickler she would drag it out of him if she possibly could  not thet i knows on he said smiling  good night she said abruptly turning away from him  well im damned if e aint forgotten she said to herself sulkily as she marched home  the following evening about six oclock it suddenly struck her that it was the last night of the new and sensational drama  i do like thet jim blakeston she said to herself fancy treatin me like thet you wouldnt catch tom doin sich a thing blime if i speak to im again the  now i shant see it at all ive a good mind ter go on my own ook fancy is forgettin all abaht it like thet  she was really quite indignant though as she had distinctly refused jims offer it was rather hard to see why  e said ed wite for me ahtside the doors i wonder if es there ill go an see if e is see if i dontan then if es there ill go in on my own ook jist ter spite im  she dressed herself in her best and so that the neighbours shouldnt see her went up a passage between some model lodginghouse buildings and in this roundabout way got into the westminster bridge road and soon found herself in front of the theatre  ive been witin for yer this alfhour  she turned round and saw jim standing just behind her  oo are you talkin to im not goin to the ply with you wot dyer tike me for eh  oo are yer goin with then  im goin alone  garn dont be a bloomin jackass  liza was feeling very injured  thets ow you treat me i shall go ome why didnt you come aht the other night  yer told me not ter  she snorted at the ridiculous ineptitude of the reply  why didnt you say nothin abaht it yesterday  why i thought youd come if i didnt talk on it  well i think youre a  brute she felt very much inclined to cry  come on liza dont tike on i didnt mean no offence and he put his arm round her waist and led her to take their places at the gallery door two tears escaped from the corners of her eyes and ran down her nose but she felt very relieved and happy and let him lead her where he would  there was a long string of people waiting at the door and liza was delighted to see a couple of niggers who were helping them to while away the time of waiting the niggers sang and danced and made faces while the people looked on with appreciative gravity like royalty listening to de resk√© and they were very generous of applause and halfpence at the end of the performance then when the niggers moved to the pit doors paper boys came along offering titbits and extra specials after that three little girls came round and sang sentimental songs and collected more halfpence at last a movement ran through the serpentlike string of people sounds were heard behind the door everyone closed up the men told the women to keep close and hold tight there was a great unbarring and unbolting the doors were thrown open and like a bursting river the people surged in  half an hour more and the curtain went up the play was indeed thrilling liza quite forgot her companion and was intent on the scene she watched the incidents breathlessly trembling with excitement almost beside herself at the celebrated hanging incident when the curtain fell on the first act she sighed and mopped her face  see ow ot i am she said to jim giving him her hand  yus you are he remarked taking it  leave go she said trying to withdraw it from him  not much he answered quite boldly  garn leave go but he didnt and she really did not struggle very violently  the second act came and she shrieked over the comic man and her laughter rang higher than anyone elses so that people turned to look at her and said  she is enjoyin erself  then when the murder came she bit her nails and the sweat stood on her forehead in great drops in her excitement she even called out as loud as she could to the victim look aht it caused a laugh and slackened the tension for the whole house was holding its breath as it looked at the villains listening at the door creeping silently forward crawling like tigers to their prey  liza trembling all over and in her terror threw herself against jim who put both his arms round her and said  dont be afride liza its all right  at last the men sprang there was a scuffle and the wretch was killed then came the scene depicted on the postersthe victims son knocking at the door on the inside of which were the murderers and the murdered man at last the curtain came down and the house in relief burst forth into cheers and cheers the handsome hero in his top hat was greeted thunderously the murdered man with his clothes still all disarranged was hailed with sympathy and the villainsthe house yelled and hissed and booed while the poor brutes bowed and tried to look as if they liked it  i am enjoyin myself said liza pressing herself quite close to jim you are a good sort ter tike mejim  he gave her a little hug and it struck her that she was sitting just as sally had done and like sally she found it jam  the entractes were short and the curtain was soon up again and the comic man raised customary laughter by undressing and exposing his nether garments to the public view then more tragedy and the final act with its darkened room its casting lots and its explosion  when it was all over and they had got outside jim smacked his lips and said  i could do with a gargle lets go onto thet pub there  im as dry as bone said liza and so they went  when they got in they discovered they were hungry and seeing some appetising sausagerolls ate of them and washed them down with a couple of pots of beer then jim lit his pipe and they strolled off they had got quite near the westminster bridge road when jim suggested that they should go and have one more drink before closing time  i shall be tight said liza  thet dont matter answered jim laughing you aint got ter go ter work in the mornin an you can sleep it aht  arright i dont mind if i do then in for a penny in for a pound  at the pub door she drew back  i say guvner she said therell be some of the coves from dahn our street and theyll see us  na there wont be nobody there dont yer ave no fear  i dont like ter go in for fear of it  well we aint doin no arm if they does see us an we can go into the private bar an you bet your boots there wont be no one there  she yielded and they went in  two pints of bitter please miss ordered jim  i say old ard i cant drink more than alf a pint said liza  cheese it answered jim you can do with all you can get i know  at closing time they left and walked down the broad road which led homewards  lets ave a little sit dahn said jim pointing to an empty bench between two trees  na its gettin lite i want ter be ome  its such a fine night its a pity ter go in already and he drew her unresisting towards the seat he put his arm round her waist  unand me villin she said in apt misquotation of the melodrama but jim only laughed and she made no effort to disengage herself  they sat there for a long while in silence the beer had got to lizas head and the warm night air filled her with a double intoxication she felt the arm round her waist and the big heavy form pressing against her side she experienced again the curious sensation as if her heart were about to burst and it choked hera feeling so oppressive and painful it almost made her feel sick her hands began to tremble and her breathing grew rapid as though she were suffocating almost fainting she swayed over towards the man and a cold shiver ran through her from top to toe jim bent over her and taking her in both arms he pressed his lips to hers in a long passionate kiss at last panting for breath she turned her head away and groaned  then they again sat for a long while in silence liza full of a strange happiness feeling as if she could laugh aloud hysterically but restrained by the calm and silence of the night close behind struck a church clockone  bless my soul said liza starting theres one oclock i must get ome  its so nice out ere do sty liza he pressed her closer to him yer know liza i love yerfit ter kill  na i cant stay come on she got up from the seat and pulled him up too come on she said  without speaking they went along and there was no one to be seen either in front or behind them he had not got his arm round her now and they were walking side by side slightly separated it was liza who spoke first  youd better go dahn the road and by the church an git into vere street the other end an ill go through the passage so thet no one shouldnt see us comin together she spoke almost in a whisper  arright liza he answered ill do just as you tell me  they came to the passage of which liza spoke it was a narrow way between blank walls the backs of factories and it led into the upper end of vere street the entrance to it was guarded by two iron posts in the middle so that horses or barrows should not be taken through  they had just got to it when a man came out into the open road liza quickly turned her head away  i wonder if e see us she said when he had passed out of earshot es lookin back she added  why oo is it asked jim  its a man aht of our street she answered i dunno im but i know where e lodges dyer think e sees us  na e wouldnt know oo it was in the dark  but he looked round all the streetll know it if he see us  well we aint doin no arm  she stretched out her hand to say good night  ill come a wy with yer along the passage said jim  na you mustnt you go straight round  but its so dark praps summatll appen to yer  not it you go on ome an leave me she replied and entering the passage stood facing him with one of the iron pillars between them  good night old cock she said stretching out her hand he took it and said  i wish yer wasnt goin ter leave me liza  garn i must she tried to get her hand away from his but he held it firm resting it on the top of the pillar  leave go my and she said he made no movement but looked into her eyes steadily so that it made her uneasy she repented having come out with him leave go my and and she beat down on his with her closed fist  liza he said at last  well wot is it she answered still thumping down on his hand with her fist  liza he said a whisper will yer  will i wot she said looking down  you know liza sy will yer  na she said  he bent over her and repeated  will yer  she did not speak but kept beating down on his hand  liza he said again his voice growing hoarse and thickliza will yer  she still kept silence looking away and continually bringing down her fist he looked at her a moment and she ceasing to thump his hand looked up at him with halfopened mouth suddenly he shook himself and closing his fist gave her a violent swinging blow in the belly  come on he said  and together they slid down into the darkness of the passage     8   mrs kemp was in the habit of slumbering somewhat heavily on sunday mornings or liza would not have been allowed to go on sleeping as she did when she woke she rubbed her eyes to gather her senses together and gradually she remembered having gone to the theatre on the previous evening then suddenly everything came back to her she stretched out her legs and gave a long sigh of delight her heart was full she thought of jim and the delicious sensation of love came over her closing her eyes she imagined his warm kisses and she lifted up her arms as if to put them round his neck and draw him down to her she almost felt the rough beard on her face and the strong heavy arms round her body she smiled to herself and took a long breath then slipping back the sleeves of her nightdress she looked at her own thin arms just two pieces of bone with not a muscle on them but very white and showing distinctly the interlacement of blue veins she did not notice that her hands were rough and red and dirty with the nails broken and bitten to the quick she got out of bed and looked at herself in the glass over the mantelpiece with one hand she brushed back her hair and smiled at herself her face was very small and thin but the complexion was nice clear and white with a delicate tint of red on the cheeks and her eyes were big and dark like her hair she felt very happy  she did not want to dress yet but rather to sit down and think so she twisted up her hair into a little knot slipped a skirt over her nightdress and sat on a chair near the window and began looking around the decorations of the room had been centred on the mantelpiece the chief ornament consisted of a pear and an apple a pineapple a bunch of grapes and several fat plums all very beautifully done in wax as was the fashion about the middle of this most glorious reign they were appropriately colouredthe apple blushing red the grapes an inky black emerald green leaves were scattered here and there to lend finish and the whole was mounted on an ebonised stand covered with black velvet and protected from dust and dirt by a beautiful glass cover bordered with red plush lizas eyes rested on this with approbation and the pineapple quite made her mouth water at either end of the mantelpiece were pink jars with blue flowers on the front round the top in gothic letters of gold was inscribed a present from a friendthese were products of a later but not less artistic age the intervening spaces were taken up with little jars and cups and saucersgold inside with a view of a town outside and surrounding them a present from clactononsea or alliteratively a memento of margate of these many were broken but they had been mended with glue and it is well known that pottery in the eyes of the connoisseur loses none of its value by a crack or two then there were portraits innumerablelittle yellow cartesdevisite in velvet frames some of which were decorated with shells they showed strange people with oldfashioned clothes the women with bodices and sleeves fitting close to the figure sternfeatured females with hair carefully parted in the middle and plastered down on each side firm chins and mouths with small piglike eyes and wrinkled faces and the men were uncomfortably clad in sunday garments very stiff and uneasy in their awkward postures with large whiskers and shaved chins and upper lips and a general air of hornyhanded toil then there were one or two daguerreotypes little fulllength figures framed in gold paper there was one of mrs kemps father and one of her mother and there were several photographs of betrothed or newlymarried couples the lady sitting down and the man standing behind her with his hand on the chair or the man sitting and the woman with her hand on his shoulder and from all sides of the room standing on the mantelpiece hanging above it on the wall and over the bed they stared fullface into the room selfconsciously fixed for ever in their stiff discomfort  the walls were covered with dingy antiquated paper and ornamented with coloured supplements from christmas numbersthere was a very patriotic picture of a soldier shaking the hand of a fallen comrade and waving his arm in defiance of a band of advancing arabs there was a cherry ripe almost black with age and dirt there were two almanacks several years old one with a coloured portrait of the marquess of lorne very handsome and elegantly dressed the object of mrs kemps adoration since her husbands demise the other a jubilee portrait of the queen somewhat losing in dignity by a moustache which liza in an irreverent moment had smeared on with charcoal  the furniture consisted of a washhand stand and a little deal chest of drawers which acted as sideboard to such pots and pans and crockery as could not find room in the grate and besides the bed there was nothing but two kitchen chairs and a lamp liza looked at it all and felt perfectly satisfied she put a pin into one corner of the noble marquess to prevent him from falling fiddled about with the ornaments a little and then started washing herself after putting on her clothes she ate some breadandbutter swallowed a dishful of cold tea and went out into the street  she saw some boys playing cricket and went up to them  let me ply she said  arright liza cried half a dozen of them in delight and the captain added you go an scout over by the lamppost  go an scout my eye said liza indignantly when i ply cricket i does the battin  na youre not goin ter bat all the time oo are you gettin at replied the captain who had taken advantage of his position to put himself in first and was still at the wicket  well then i shant ply answered liza  garn ernie let er go in shouted two or three members of the team  well im busted remarked the captain as she took his bat you wont sty in long i lay he said as he sent the old bowler fielding and took the ball himself he was a young gentleman who did not suffer from excessive backwardness  aht shouted a dozen voices as the ball went past lizas bat and landed in the pile of coats which formed the wicket the captain came forward to resume his innings but liza held the bat away from him  garn she said thet was only a trial  you never said trial answered the captain indignantly  yus i did said liza i said it just as the ball was cominunder my breath  well i am busted repeated the captain  just then liza saw tom among the lookerson and as she felt very kindly disposed to the world in general that morning she called out to him  ulloa tom she said come an give us a ball this chap cant bowl  well i got yer aht anyow said that person  ah yer wouldnt ave got me aht plyin square but a trial ballwell one dont ever know wot a trial balls goin ter do  tom began bowling very slowly and easily so that liza could swing her bat round and hit mightily she ran well too and pantingly brought up her score to twenty then the fielders interposed  i sy look ere es only givin er lobs es not tryin ter git er aht  youre spoilin our gime  i dont care ive got twenty runsthets more than you could do ill go aht now of my own accord so there come on tom  tom joined her and as the captain at last resumed his bat and the game went on they commenced talking liza leaning against the wall of a house while tom stood in front of her smiling with pleasure  where ave you been idin yerself tom i aint seen yer for i dunno ow long  ive been abaht as usual an ive seen you when you didnt see me  well yer might ave come up and said good mornin when you see me  i didnt want ter force myself on yer liza  garn you are a bloomin cuckoo im blowed  i thought yer didnt like me angin round yer so i kep awy  why yer talks as if i didnt like yer yer dont think id ave come aht beanfeastin with yer if i adnt liked yer  liza was really very dishonest but she felt so happy this morning that she loved the whole world and of course tom came in with the others she looked very kindly at him and he was so affected that a great lump came in his throat and he could not speak  lizas eyes turned to jims house and she saw coming out of the door a girl of about her own age she fancied she saw in her some likeness to jim  say tom she asked thet aint blakestons daughter is it  yus thets it  ill go an speak to er said liza leaving tom and going over the road  youre polly blakeston aint yer she said  thets me said the girl  i thought you was your dad e says ter me you dunno my daughter polly do yer says e na says i i

last night e says and ed stand the lot of us icecream for dinner terday  ill come with yer if yer like  come on and already friends they walked arminarm to the westminster bridge road then they went along till they came to a stall where an italian was selling the required commodity and having had a taste apiece to see if they liked it polly planked down sixpence and had her basin filled with a poisonouslooking mixture of red and white icecream  on the way back looking up the street polly cried  theres father  lizas heart beat rapidly and she turned red but suddenly a sense of shame came over her and casting down her head so that she might not see him she said  i think ill be off ome an see ow mothers gettin on and before polly could say anything she had slipped away and entered her own house  mother was not getting on at all well  youve come in at last you  you snarled mrs kemp as liza entered the room  wots the matter mother  matter i like thetmatter indeed go an matter yerself

burn to death here she began to cry and the rest of her utterances was lost in sobs                                       the dusk had darkened into night and mrs kemp had retired to rest with the dickybirds liza was thinking of many things she wondered why she had been unwilling to meet jim in the morning  i was a bally fool she said to herself  it really seemed an age since the previous night and all that had happened seemed very long ago she had not spoken to jim all day and she had so much to say to him then wondering whether he was about she went to the window and looked out but there was nobody there she closed the window again and sat just beside it the time went on and she wondered whether he would come asking herself whether he had been thinking of her as she of him gradually her thoughts grew vague and a kind of mist came over them she nodded suddenly she roused herself with a start fancying she had heard something she listened again and in a moment the sound was repeated three or four gentle taps on the window she opened it quickly and whispered  jim  thets me he answered come aht  closing the window she went into the passage and opened the street door it was hardly unlocked before jim had pushed his way in partly shutting it behind him he took her in his arms and hugged her to his breast she kissed him passionately  i thought yerd come ternight jim summat in my eart told me so but you ave been long  i wouldnt come before cause i thought thered be people abaht kiss us and again he pressed his lips to hers and liza nearly fainted with the delight of it  lets go for a walk shall we he said  arright they were speaking in whispers you go into the road through the passage an ill go by the street  yus thets right and kissing her once more he slid out and she closed the door behind him  then going back to get her hat she came again into the passage waiting behind the door till it might be safe for her to venture she had not made up her mind to risk it when she heard a key put in the lock and she hardly had time to spring back to prevent herself from being hit by the opening door it was a man one of the upstairs lodgers  ulloa he said oos there  mr odges strikes me you did give me a turn i was just goin aht she blushed to her hair but in the darkness he could see nothing  good night she said and went out  she walked close along the sides of the houses like a thief and the policeman as she passed him turned round and looked at her wondering whether she was meditating some illegal deed she breathed freely on coming into the open road and seeing jim skulking behind a tree ran up to him and in the shadows they kissed again     9   thus began a time of love and joy as soon as her work was over and she had finished tea liza would slip out and at some appointed spot meet jim usually it would be at the church where the westminster bridge road bends down to get to the river and they would go off arminarm till they came to some place where they could sit down and rest sometimes they would walk along the albert embankment to battersea park and here sit on the benches watching the children play the female cyclist had almost abandoned battersea for the parks on the other side of the river but often enough one went by and liza with the oldfashioned prejudice of her class would look after the rider and make some remark about her not seldom more forcible than ladylike both jim and she liked children and tiny ragged urchins would gather round to have rides on the mans knees or mock fights with liza  they thought themselves far away from anyone in vere street but twice as they were walking along they were met by people they knew once it was two workmen coming home from a job at vauxhall liza did not see them till they were quite near she immediately dropped jims arm and they both cast their eyes to the ground as the men passed like ostriches expecting that if they did not look they would not be seen  dyou see em jim asked liza in a whisper when they had gone by i wonder if they see us almost instinctively she turned round and at the same moment one of the men turned too then there was no doubt about it  thet did give me a turn she said  so it did me answered jim i simply went ot all over  we was bally fools said liza we oughter ave spoken to em dyou think theyll let aht  they heard nothing of it when jim afterwards met one of the men in a publichouse he did not mention a meeting and they thought that perhaps they had not been recognized but the second time was worse  it was on the albert embankment again they were met by a party of four all of whom lived in the street lizas heart sank within her for there was no chance of escape she thought of turning quickly and walking in the opposite direction but there was not time for the men had already seen them she whispered to jim  back us up and as they met she said to one of the men  ulloa there where are you off to  the men stopped and one of them asked the question back  where are you off to  me oh ive just been to the orspital one of the gals at our place is queer an so i says ter myself ill go an see er she faltered a little as she began but quickly gathered herself together lying fluently and without hesitation  an when i come aht she went on oo should i see just passin the orspital but this ere cove an e says to me wot cheer says e im goin ter vauxall come an walk a bit of the wy with us arright says i i dont mind if i do  one man winked and another said go it liza  she fired up with the dignity of outraged innocence  wot dyer mean by thet she said dyer think im kiddin  kiddin no youve only just come up from the country aint yer  think im kidding what dyer think i want ter kid for liars never believe anyone thets fact  na then liza dont be saucy  saucy ill smack yer in the eye if yer sy much ter me come on she said to jim who had been standing sheepishly by and they walked away  the men shouted now we shant be long and went off laughing  after that they decided to go where there was no chance at all of their being seen they did not meet till they got over westminster bridge and thence they made their way into the park they would lie down on the grass in one anothers arms and thus spend the long summer evenings after the heat of the day there would be a gentle breeze in the park and they would take in long breaths of the air it seemed far away from london it was so quiet and cool and liza as she lay by jims side felt her love for him overflowing to the rest of the world and enveloping mankind itself in a kind of grateful happiness if it could only have lasted they would stay and see the stars shine out dimly one by one from the blue sky till it grew late and the blue darkened into black and the stars glittered in thousands all above them but as the nights grew cooler they found it cold on the grass and the time they had there seemed too short for the long journey they had to make so crossing the bridge as before they strolled along the embankment till they came to a vacant bench and there they would sit with liza nestling close up to her lover and his great arms around her the rain of september made no difference to them they went as usual to their seat beneath the trees and jim would take liza on his knee and opening his coat shelter her with it while she with her arms round his neck pressed very close to him and occasionally gave a little laugh of pleasure and delight they hardly spoke at all through these evenings for what had they to say to one another often without exchanging a word they would sit for an hour with their faces touching the one feeling on his cheek the hot breath from the others mouth while at the end of the time the only motion was an upraising of lizas lips a bending down of jims so that they might meet and kiss sometimes liza fell into a light doze and jim would sit very still for fear of waking her and when she roused herself she would smile while he bent down again and kissed her they were very happy but the hours passed by so quickly that big ben striking twelve came upon them as a surprise and unwillingly they got up and made their way homewards their partings were never endingeach evening jim refused to let her go from his arms and tears stood in his eyes at the thought of the separation  id give somethin he would say if we could be togither always  never mind old chap liza would answer herself half crying it cant be elped so we must jolly well lump it  but notwithstanding all their precautions people in vere street appeared to know first of all liza noticed that the women did not seem quite so cordial as before and she often fancied they were talking of her when she passed by they appeared to look at her then say something or other and perhaps burst out laughing but when she approached they would immediately stop speaking and keep silence in a rather awkward constrained manner for a long time she was unwilling to believe that there was any change in them and jim who had observed nothing persuaded her that it was all fancy but gradually it became clearer and jim had to agree with her that somehow or other people had found out once when liza had been talking to polly jims daughter mrs blakeston had called her and when the girl had come to her mother liza saw that she spoke angrily and they both looked across at her when liza caught mrs blakestons eye she saw in her face a surly scowl which almost frightened her she wanted to brave it out and stepped forward a little to go and speak with the woman but mrs blakeston standing still looked so angrily at her that she was afraid to when she told jim his face grew dark and he said blast the woman ill give er wot for if she says anythin ter you  dont strike er wotever appens will yer jim said liza  shed better tike care then he answered and he told her that lately his wife had been sulking and not speaking to him the previous night on coming home after the days work and bidding her good evenin she had turned her back on him without answering  cant you answer when youre spoke to he had said  good evenin she had replied sulkily with her back still turned  after that liza noticed that polly avoided her  wots up polly she said to her one day you never speaks now ave you ad yer tongue cut aht  me i aint got nothin ter speak abaht thet i knows of answered polly abruptly walking off liza grew very red and quickly looked to see if anyone had noticed the incident a couple of youths sitting on the pavement had seen it and she saw them nudge one another and wink  then the fellows about the street began to chaff her  you look pale said one of a group to her one day  youre overworkin yerself you are said another  married life dont agree with liza thets wot it is added a third  oo dyer think yer gettin at i aint married an never like ter be she answered  liza as all the pleasures of a usband an none of the trouble  blime if i know wot yer mean said liza  na of course not you dont know nothin do yer  innocent as a bibe our father which art in eaven  avent been in london long ave yer  they spoke in chorus and liza stood in front of them bewildered not knowing what to answer  dont you mike no mistake abaht it liza knows a thing or two  o me darlin i love yer fit to kill but tike care your missus aint round the corner this was particularly bold and they all laughed  liza felt very uncomfortable and fiddled about with her apron wondering how she should get away  tike care yer dont git into trouble thets all said one of the men with burlesque gravity  yer might give us a chanst liza you come aht with me one evenin you oughter give us all a turn just ter show theres no illfeelin  blime if i know wot yer all talkin abaht youre all barmy on the crumpet said liza indignantly and turning her back on them made for home  among other things that had happened was sallys marriage one saturday a little procession had started from vere street consisting of sally in a state of giggling excitement her fringe magnificent after a whole week of curlingpapers clad in a perfectly new velveteen dress of the colour known as electric blue and harry rather nervous and ill at ease in the unaccustomed restraint of a collar these two walked arminarm and were followed by sallys mother and uncle also arminarm and the procession was brought up by harrys brother and a friend they started with a flourish of trumpets and an old boot and walked down the middle of vere street accompanied by the neighbours good wishes but as they got into the westminster bridge road and nearer to the church the happy couple grew silent and harry began to perspire freely so that his collar gave him perfect torture there was a publichouse just opposite the church and it was suggested that they should have a drink before going in as it was a solemn occasion they went into the private bar and there sallys uncle who was a man of means ordered six pots of beer  feel a bit nervous arry asked his friend  na said harry as if he had been used to getting married every day of his life bit warm thets all  your very good ealth sally said her mother lifting her mug this is the last time as i shall ever address you as miss  an may she be as good a wife as you was added sallys uncle  well i dont think my old man ever ad no complaint ter mike abaht me i did my duty by im although its me as says it answered the good lady  well mates said harrys brother i reckon its abaht time to go in so eres to the ealth of mr enry atkins an is future missus  an god bless em said sallys mother  then they went into the church and as they solemnly walked up the aisle a palefaced young curate came out of the vestry and down to the bottom of the chancel the beer had had a calming effect on their troubled minds and both harry and sally began to think it rather a good joke they smiled on each other and at those parts of the service which they thought suggestive violently nudged one another in the ribs when the ring had to be produced harry fumbled about in different pockets and his brother whispered  swop me bob es gone and lorst it  however all went right and sally having carefully pocketed the certificate they went out and had another drink to celebrate the happy event  in the evening liza and several friends came into the couples room which they had taken in the same house as sally had lived in before and drank the health of the bride and bridegroom till they thought fit to retire     10   it was november the fine weather had quite gone now and with it much of the sweet pleasure of jim and lizas love when they came out at night on the embankment they found it cold and dreary sometimes a light fog covered the riverbanks and made the lamps glow out dim and large a light rain would be falling which sent a chill into their very souls foot passengers came along at rare intervals holding up umbrellas and staring straight in front of them as they hurried along in the damp and cold a cab would pass rapidly by splashing up the mud on each side the benches were deserted except perhaps for some poor homeless wretch who could afford no shelter and huddled up in a corner with his head buried in his breast was sleeping heavily like a dead man the wet mud made lizas skirts cling about her feet and the damp would come in and chill her legs and creep up her body till she shivered and for warmth pressed herself close against jim sometimes they would go into the thirdclass waitingrooms at waterloo or charing cross and sit there but it was not like the park or the embankment on summer nights they had warmth but the heat made their wet clothes steam and smell and the gas flared in their eyes and they hated the people perpetually coming in and out opening the doors and letting in a blast of cold air they hated the noise of the guards and porters shouting out the departure of the trains the shrill whistling of the steamengine the hurry and bustle and confusion about eleven oclock when the trains grew less frequent they got some quietness but then their minds were troubled and they felt heavy sad and miserable  one evening they had been sitting at waterloo station it was foggy outsidea thick yellow november fog which filled the waitingroom entering the lungs and making the mouth taste nasty and the eyes smart it was about halfpast eleven and the station was unusually quiet a few passengers in wraps and overcoats were walking to and fro waiting for the last train and one or two porters were standing about yawning liza and jim had remained for an hour in perfect silence filled with a gloomy unhappiness as of a great weight on their brains liza was sitting forward with her elbows on her knees resting her face on her hands  i wish i was straight she said at last not looking up  well why wont yer come along of me altogether an youll be arright then he answered  na thats no go i cant do thet he had often asked her to live with him entirely but she had always refused  you can come along of me an ill tike a room in a lodgin ouse in olloway an we can live there as if we was married  wot abaht yer work  i can get

liza smiled sadly  so yer see jim were in a bloomin ole an there aint no way aht of it thet i can see  he took her on his knees and pressing her to him kissed her very long and very lovingly  well we must trust ter luck she said again praps somethin ll appen soon an everythin ll come right in the endwhen we gets four balls of worsted for a penny  it was past twelve and separating they went by different ways along the dreary wet deserted roads till they came to vere street  the street seemed quite different to liza from what it had been three months before tom the humble adorer had quite disappeared from her life one day three or four weeks after the august bank holiday she saw him dawdling along the pavement and it suddenly struck her that she had not seen him for a long time but she had been so full of her happiness that she had been unable to think of anyone but jim she wondered at his absence since before wherever she had been there was he certain to be also she passed him but to her astonishment he did not speak to her she thought by some wonder he had not seen her but she felt his gaze resting upon her she turned back and suddenly he dropped his eyes and looked down walking on as if he had not seen her but blushing furiously  tom she said why dont yer speak ter me  he started and blushed more than ever  i didnt know yer was there he stuttered  dont tell me she said wots up  nothin as i knows of he answered uneasily  i aint offended yer ave i tom  na not as i knows of he replied looking very unhappy  you dont ever come my way now she said  i didnt know as yer wanted ter see me  garn yer knows i likes you as well as anybody  yer likes so many people liza he said flushing  what dyer mean said liza indignantly but very red she was afraid he knew now and it was from him especially she would have been so glad to hide it  nothin he answered  one doesnt say things like thet without any meanin unless ones a blimed fool  youre right there liza he answered i am a blimed fool he looked at her a little reproachfully she thought and then he said goodbye and turned away  at first she was horrified that he should know of her love for jim but then she did not care after all it was nobodys business and what did anything matter as long as she loved jim and jim loved her then she grew angry that tom should suspect her he could know nothing but that some of the men had seen her with jim near vauxhall and it seemed mean that he should condemn her for that thenceforward when she ran against tom she cut him he never tried to speak to her but as she passed him pretending to look in front of her she could see that he always blushed and she fancied his eyes were very sorrowful then several weeks went by and as she began to feel more and more lonely in the street she regretted the quarrel she cried a little as she thought that she had lost his faithful gentle love and she would have much liked to be friends with him again if he had only made some advance she would have welcomed him so cordially but she was too proud to go to him herself and beg him to forgive herand then how could he forgive her  she had lost sally too for on her marriage harry had made her give up the factory he was a young man with principles worthy of a member of parliament and he had said  a womans plice is er ome an if er old man cant afford ter keep er without er workin in a factorywell all i can say is thet ed better go an git single  quite right too agreed his motherinlaw an wots more shell ave a baby ter look after soon an thetll tike er all er time an theres no one as knows thet better than me for ive ad twelve ter sy nothin of two stills an one miss  liza quite envied sally her happiness for the bride was brimming over with song and laughter her happiness overwhelmed her  i am appy she said to liza one day a few weeks after her marriage you dunno wot a good sort arry is es just a darlin an theres no mistikin it i dont care wot other people sy but wot i says is theres nothin like marriage never a cross word passes his lips an mother as all er meals with us an e says all the better well im thet appy i simply dunno if im standin on my ead or on my eels  but alas it did not last too long sally was not so full of joy when next liza met her and one day her eyes looked very much as if she had been crying  wots the matter asked liza looking at her wot ave yer been blubberin abaht  me said sally getting very red oh ive got a bit of a toothache anwell im rather a fool like an it urt so much that i couldnt elp cryin  liza was not satisfied but could get nothing further out of her then one day it came out it was a saturday night the time when women in vere street weep liza went up into sallys room for a few minutes on her way to the westminster bridge road where she was to meet jim harry had taken the top back room and liza climbing up the second flight of stairs called out as usual  wot ho sally  the door remained shut although liza could see that there was a light in the room but on getting to the door she stood still for she heard the sound of sobbing she listened for a minute and then knocked there was a little flurry inside and someone called out  oos there  only me said liza opening the door as she did so she saw sally rapidly wipe her eyes and put her handkerchief away her mother was sitting by her side evidently comforting her  wots up sal asked liza  nothin answered sally with a brave little gasp to stop the crying turning her face downwards so that liza should not see the tears in her eyes but they were too strong for her and quickly taking out her handkerchief she hid her face in it and began to sob brokenheartedly liza looked at the mother in interrogation  oh its thet man again said the lady snorting and tossing her head  not arry asked liza in surprise  not arryoo is it if it aint arry the villin  wots e been doin then asked liza again  beatin er thats wot es been doin oh the villin e oughter be ashimed of isself e ought  i didnt know e was like that said liza  didnt yer i thought the ole street knew it by now said mrs cooper indignantly oh es a wrong un e is  it wasnt is fault put in sally amidst her sobs its only because es ad a little drop too much es arright when es sober  a little drop too much i should just think ed ad the beast id give it im if i was a man theyre all

now when they aint been married three months an the first child not born yet i think its disgraceful  liza stayed a little while longer helping to comfort sally who kept pathetically taking to herself all the blame of the dispute and then bidding her good night and better luck she slid off to meet jim  when she reached the appointed spot he was not to be found she waited for some time and at last saw him come out of the neighbouring pub  good night jim she said as she came up to him  so youve turned up ave yer he answered roughly turning round  wots the matter jim she asked in a frightened way for he had never spoken to her in that manner  nice thing ter keep me witin all night for yer to come aht  she saw that he had been drinking and answered humbly  im very sorry jim but i went in to sally an er bloke ad been knockin er abaht an so i sat with er a bit  knockin er abaht ad e and serve er damn well right too an theres many more as could do with a good idin  liza did not answer he looked at her and then suddenly said  come in an ave a drink  na im not thirsty i dont want a drink she answered  come on he said angrily  na jim youve had quite enough already  oo are you talkin ter he said dont come if yer dont want ter ill go an ave one by myself  na jim dont she caught hold of his arm  yus i shall he said going towards the pub while she held him back let me go cant yer let me go he roughly pulled his arm away from her as she tried to catch hold of it again he pushed her back and in the little scuffle caught her a blow over the face  oh she cried you did urt  he was sobered at once  liza he said i aint urt yer she didnt answer and he took her in his arms liza i aint urt you ave i say i aint urt yer im so sorry i beg your pardon liza  arright old chap she said smiling charmingly on him it wasnt the blow that urt me much it was the wy you was talkin  i didnt mean it liza he was so contrite he could not humble himself enough i ad another bloomin row with the missus ternight an then when i didnt find you ere an i kept witin an witinwell i fair downright lost my air an i ad two or three pints of four alf anwell i dunno  never mind old cock i can stand more than thet as long as yer loves me  he kissed her and they were quite friends again but the little quarrel had another effect which was worse for liza when she woke up next morning she noticed a slight soreness over the ridge of bone under the left eye and on looking in the glass saw that it was black and blue and green she bathed it but it remained and seemed to get more marked she was terrified lest people should see it and kept indoors all day but next morning it was blacker than ever she went to the factory with her hat over her eyes and her head bent down she escaped observation but on the way home she was not so lucky the sharp eyes of some girls noticed it first  wots the matter with yer eye asked one of them  me answered liza putting her hand up as if in ignorance nothin thet i knows of  two or three young men were standing by and hearing the girl looked up  why yerve got a black eye liza  me i aint got no black eye  yus you ave ow dyer get it  i dunno said liza i didnt know i ad one  garn tell us another was the answer one doesnt git a black eye without knowin ow they got it  well i did fall against the chest of drawers yesterday i suppose i must ave got it then  oh yes we believe thet dont we  i didnt know e was so andy with is dukes did you ted asked one man of another  liza felt herself grow red to the tips of her toes  who she asked  never you mind nobody you know  at that moment jims wife passed and looked at her with a scowl liza wished herself a hundred miles away and blushed more violently than ever  wot are yer blushin abaht ingenuously asked one of the girls  and they all looked from her to mrs blakeston and back again someone said ow abaht our sunday boots on now and a titter went through them lizas nerve deserted her she could think of nothing to say and a sob burst from her to hide the tears which were coming from her eyes she turned away and walked homewards immediately a great shout of laughter broke from the group and she heard them positively screaming till she got into her own house     11   a few days afterwards liza was talking with sally who did not seem very much happier than when liza had last seen her  e aint wot i thought e wos she said i dont mind sayin thet but e as a lot ter put up with i expect im rather tryin sometimes an e means well praps ell be kinder like when the bibys born  cheer up old gal answered liza who had seen something of the lives of many married couples it wont seem so bad after yer gets used to it its a bit disappointin at fust but yer gits not ter mind it  after a little sally said she must go and see about her husbands tea she said goodbye and then rather awkwardly  say liza tike care of yerself  tike care of meselfwhy asked liza in surprise  yer know wot i mean  na im darned if i do  thet there mrs blakeston shes lookin aht for you  mrs blakeston liza was startled  yus she says shes goin ter give you somethin if she can git old on yer i should advise yer ter tike care  me said liza  sally looked away so as not to see the others face  she says as ow yerve been messin abaht with er old man  liza didnt say anything and sally repeating her goodbye slid off  liza felt a chill run through her she had several times noticed a scowl and a look of anger on mrs blakestons face and she had avoided her as much as possible but she had no idea that the woman meant to do anything to her she was very frightened a cold sweat broke out over her face if mrs blakeston got hold of her she would be helpless she was so small and weak while the other was strong and muscular liza wondered what she would do if she did catch her  that night she told jim and tried to make a joke of it  i say jim your missusshe says shes goin ter give me socks if she catches me  my missus ow dyer know  shes been tellin people in the street  go lumme said jim furious if she dares ter touch a air of your ead swop me dicky ill give er sich a idin as she never ad before by god give me the chanst an i would let er ave it im bloomin well sick of er sulks he clenched his fist as he spoke  liza was a coward she could not help thinking of her enemys threat it got on her nerves and she hardly dared go out for fear of meeting her she would look nervously in front of her quickly turning round if she saw in the distance anyone resembling mrs blakeston she dreamed of her at night she saw the big powerful form the heavy frowning face and the curiously braided brown hair and she would wake up with a cry and find herself bathed in sweat  it was the saturday afternoon following this a chill november day with the roads sloshy and a grey comfortless sky that made ones spirits sink it was about three oclock and liza was coming home from work she got into vere street and was walking quickly towards her house when she saw mrs blakeston coming towards her her heart gave a great jump turning she walked rapidly in the direction she had come with a screw round of her eyes she saw that she was being followed and therefore went straight out of vere street she went right round meaning to get into the street from the other end and unobserved slip into her house which was then quite close but she dared not risk it immediately for fear mrs blakeston should still be there so she waited about for half an hour it seemed an age finally taking her courage in both hands she turned the corner and entered vere street she nearly ran into the arms of mrs blakeston who was standing close to the publichouse door  liza gave a little cry and the woman said with a sneer  yer didnt expect ter see me did yer  liza did not answer but tried to walk past her mrs blakeston stepped forward and blocked her way  yer seem ter be in a mighty fine urry she said  yus ive got ter git ome said liza again trying to pass  but supposin i dont let yer remarked mrs blakeston preventing her from moving  why dont yer leave me alone liza said i aint interferin with you  not interferin with me arent yer

for help at the beginning of the altercation the loafers about the publichouse had looked up with interest and gradually gathered round in a little circle passersby had joined in and a number of other people in the street seeing the crowd added themselves to it to see what was going on liza saw that all eyes were fixed on her the men amused and excited the women unsympathetic rather virtuously indignant liza wanted to ask for help but there were so many people and they all seemed so much against her that she had not the courage to so having surveyed the crowd she turned her eyes to mrs blakeston and stood in front of her trembling a little and very white  na e aint there said mrs blakeston sneeringly so yer neednt look for im  i dunno wot yer mean answered liza an i want ter go awy

proceeded mrs blakeston getting more hot and excited brandishing her fist and speaking in a loud voice hoarse with rage oh ive been tryin ter git old on yer this four weeks why youre a prostitutethats

thet shows what e thinks of yer an serve yer bloomin well right if ed give yer one in both eyes  mrs blakeston stood close in front of her her heavy jaw protruded and the frown of her eyebrows dark and stern for a moment she stood silent contemplating liza while the surrounders looked on in breathless interest  yer dirty little bitch you she said at last tike that and with her open hand she gave her a sharp smack on the cheek  liza started back with a cry and put her hand up to her face  an tike thet added mrs blakeston repeating the blow then gathering up the spittle in her mouth she spat in lizas face  liza sprang on her and with her hands spread out like claws buried her nails in the womans face and drew them down her cheeks mrs blakeston caught hold of her hair with both hands and tugged at it as hard as she could but they were immediately separated  ere old ard said some of the men fight it aht fair and square dont go scratchin and maulin like thet  ill fight er i dont mind shouted mrs blakeston tucking up her sleeves and savagely glaring at her opponent  liza stood in front of her pale and trembling as she looked at her enemy and saw the long red marks of her nails with blood coming from one or two of them she shrank back  i dont want ter fight she said hoarsely  na i dont suppose yer do hissed the other but yerll damn well ave ter  shes ever so much bigger than me ive got no chanst added liza tearfully  you should ave thought of thet before come on and with these words mrs blakeston rushed upon her she hit her with both fists one after the other liza did not try to guard herself but imitating the womans motion hit out with her own fists and for a minute or two they continued thus raining blows on one another with the same windmill motion of the arms but liza could not stand against the other womans weight the blows came down heavy and rapid all over her face and head she put up her hands to cover her face and turned her head away while mrs blakeston kept on hitting mercilessly  time shouted some of the mentime and mrs blakeston stopped to rest herself  it dont seem ardly fair to set them two on tergether lizas got no chanst against a big woman like thet said a man among the crowd  well its er own fault answered a woman she didnt oughter mess about with er usbind  well i dont think its right added another man shes gettin it too much  an

ouse ill soon give er wot for  meanwhile liza was standing at one corner of the ring trembling all over and crying bitterly one of her eyes was bunged up and her hair all dishevelled was hanging down over her face two young fellows who had constituted themselves her seconds were standing in front of her offering rather ironical comfort one of them had taken the bottom corners of her apron and was fanning her with it while the other was showing her how to stand and hold her arms  you stand up to er liza he was saying there aint no good funkin it youll simply get it all the worse you it er back give er one on the boko like thissee yer must show a bit of pluck yer know  liza tried to check her sobs  yus it er ard thats wot yerve got ter do said the other an if yer find shes gettin the better on yer you close on er and catch old of er air and scratch er  youve marked er with yer nails liza by gosh you did fly on her when she spat at yer thets the way ter do the job  then turning to his fellow he said  dyer remember thet fight as old mother cregg ad with another woman in the street last year  na he answered i never saw thet  it was a cawker an the cops come in and took em both off ter quod  liza wished the policemen would come and take her off she would willingly have gone to prison to escape the fiend in front of her but no help came  times up shouted the referee fire away  tike care of the cops shouted a man  theres no fear abaht them answered somebody else they always keeps out of the way when theres anythin goin on  fire away  mrs blakeston attacked liza madly but the girl stood up bravely and as well as she could gave back the blows she received the spectators grew tremendously excited  got im again they shouted give it er liza thets a good unit er ard  two ter one on the old un shouted a sporting gentleman but liza found no backers  aint she standin up well now shes roused cried someone  oh shes got some pluck in er she as  thets a knockaht they shouted as mrs blakeston brought her fist down on to lizas nose the girl staggered back and blood began to flow then losing all fear mad with rage she made a rush on her enemy and rained down blows all over her nose and eyes and mouth the woman recoiled at the sudden violence of the onslaught and the men cried  by god the little uns gettin the best of it  but quickly recovering herself the woman closed with liza and dug her nails into her flesh liza caught hold of her hair and pulled with all her might and turning her teeth on mrs blakeston tried to bite her and thus for a minute they swayed about scratching tearing biting sweat and blood pouring down their faces and their eyes fixed on one another bloodshot and full of rage the audience shouted and cheered and clapped their hands  wot the ells up ere  i sy look there said some of the women in a whisper its the usbind  he stood on tiptoe and looked over the crowd  my gawd he said its liza  then roughly pushing the people aside he made his way through the crowd into the centre and thrusting himself between the two women tore them apart he turned furiously on his wife  by gawd ill give yer somethin for this  and for a moment they all three stood silently looking at one another  another man had been attracted by the crowd and he too pushed his way through  come ome liza he said  tom  he took hold of her arm and led her through the people who gave way to let her pass they walked silently through the street tom very grave liza weeping bitterly  oh tom she sobbed after a while i couldnt elp it then when her tears permitted i did love im so  when they got to the door she plaintively said come in and he followed her to her room here she sank on to a chair and gave herself up to her tears  tom wetted the end of a towel and began wiping her face grimy with blood and tears she let him do it just moaning amid her sobs  you are good ter me tom  cheer up old gal he said kindly its all over now  after a while the excess of crying brought its cessation she drank some water and then taking up a broken handglass she looked at herself saying  i am a sight and proceeded to wind up her hair you ave been good ter me tom she repeated her voice still broken with sobs and as he sat down beside her she took his hand  na i aint he answered its only wot anybody ud ave done  yer know tom she said after a little silence im so sorry i

ill do it if itll mike you appy  he did not understand but only said  youre a good gal liza and bending down he kissed her gravely on the forehead  then with a sigh he lifted her down and getting up left her alone for a while she sat where he left her but as she thought of all she had gone through her loneliness and misery overcame her the tears welled forth and throwing herself on the bed she buried her face in the pillows                                       jim stood looking at liza as she went off with tom and his wife watched him jealously  its er youre thinkin abaht of course youd

the end of the room and grappled with her for a moment they swayed about from side to side then with an effort he lifted her off her feet and threw her to the ground but she caught hold of him and he came down on the top of her she screamed as her head thumped down on the floor and the children who were standing huddled up in a corner terrified screamed too  jim caught hold of his wifes head and

but i feel as if i wanted to laugh till i fairly split my sides  and she began to sing for es a jolly good fellerfor es a jolly good feller  her dress was all disarranged her face covered with the scars of scratches and clots of blood had fixed under her nose her eye had swollen up so that it was nearly closed and red her hair was hanging over her face and shoulders and she laughed stupidly and leered with heavy sodden ugliness      disy disy i cant afford a kerridge      but youll look neat on the seat        of a bicycle mide for two  she shouted out the tunes beating time on the table and her mother grinning with her thin grey hair hanging dishevelled over her head joined in with her weak cracked voice      oh dem golden kippers oh  then liza grew more melancholy and broke into auld lang syne      should old acquaintance be forgot        and never brought to mind                                                  for old lang syne  finally they both grew silent and in a little while there came a snore from mrs kemp her head fell forward to her chest liza tumbled from her chair on to the bed and sprawling across it fell asleep      although i am drunk and bad be you kind     cast a glance at this heart which is bewildered and distressed     o god take away from my mind my cry and my complaint     offer wine and take sorrow from my remembrance     offer wine     12   about the middle of the night liza woke her mouth was hot and dry and a sharp cutting pain passed through her head as she moved her mother had evidently roused herself for she was lying in bed by her side partially undressed with all the bedclothes rolled round her liza shivered in the cold night and taking off some of her thingsher boots her skirt and jacketgot right into bed she tried to get some of the blanket from her mother but as she pulled mrs kemp gave a growl in her sleep and drew the clothes more tightly round her so liza put over herself her skirt and a shawl which was lying over the end of the bed and tried to go to sleep  but she could not her head and hands were broiling hot and she was terribly thirsty when she lifted herself up to get a drink of water such a pang went through her head that she fell back on the bed groaning and lay there with beating heart and strange pains that she did not know went through her then a cold shiver seemed to rise in the very marrow of her bones and run down every artery and vein freezing the blood her skin puckered up and drawing up her legs she lay huddled together in a heap the shawl wrapped tightly round her and her teeth chattering shivering she whispered  oh im so cold so cold mother give me some clothes i shall die of the cold oh im freezing  but after awhile the cold seemed to give way and a sudden heat seized her flushing her face making her break out into perspiration so that she threw everything off and loosened the things about her neck  give us a drink she said oh id give anythin for a little drop of water  there was no one to hear mrs kemp continued to sleep heavily occasionally breaking out into a little snore  liza remained there now shivering with cold now panting for breath listening to the regular heavy breathing by her side and in her pain she sobbed she pulled at her pillow and said  why cant i go to sleep why cant i sleep like er  and the darkness was awful it was a heavy ghastly blackness that seemed palpable so that it frightened her and she looked for relief at the faint light glimmering through the window from a distant streetlamp she thought the night would never endthe minutes seemed like hours and she wondered how she should live through till morning and strange pains that she did not know went through her  still the night went on the darkness continued cold and horrible and her mother breathed loudly and steadily by her side  at last with the morning sleep came but the sleep was almost worse than the wakefulness for it was accompanied by ugly disturbing dreams liza thought she was going through the fight with her enemy and mrs blakeston grew enormous in size and multiplied so that every way she turned the figure confronted her and she began running away and she ran and ran till she found herself reckoning up an account she had puzzled over in the morning and she did it backwards and forwards upwards and downwards starting here starting there and the figures got mixed up with other things and she had to begin over again and everything jumbled up and her head whirled till finally with a start she woke  the darkness had given way to a cold grey dawn her uncovered legs were chilled to the bone and by her side she heard again the regular nasal breathing of the drunkard  for a long while she lay where she was feeling very sick and ill but better than in the night at last her mother woke  liza she called  yus mother she answered feebly  git us a cup of tea will yer  i cant mother im ill  garn said mrs kemp in surprise then looking at her swop me bob wots up with yer why yer cheeks is flushed an yer foreheadit is ot wots the matter with yer gal  i dunno said liza ive been thet bad all night i thought i was goin ter die  i know wot it is said mrs kemp shaking her head the fact is you aint used ter drinkin an of course its upset yer now me why im as fresh as a disy tike my word there aint no good in teetotalism it finds yer aht in the end an its found you aht  mrs kemp considered it a judgment of providence she got up and mixed some whisky and water  ere drink this she said when ones ad a drop too much at night theres nothin like havin a drop more in the mornin ter put one right it just acts like magic  tike it awy said liza turning from it in disgust the smell of it gives me the sick ill never touch spirits again  ah thets wot we all says sometime in our lives but we does an wots more we cant do withaht it why me the ard life ive ad it is unnecessary to repeat mrs kemps repetitions  liza did not get up all day tom came to inquire after her and was told she was very ill liza plaintively asked whether anyone else had been and sighed a little when her mother answered no but she felt too ill to think much or trouble much about anything the fever came again as the day wore on and the pains in her head grew worse her mother came to bed and quickly went off to sleep leaving liza to bear her agony alone she began to have frightful pains all over her and she held her breath to prevent herself from crying out and waking her mother she clutched the sheets in her agony and at last about six oclock in the morning she could bear it no longer and in the anguish of labour screamed out and woke her mother  mrs kemp was frightened out of her wits going upstairs she woke the woman who lived on the floor above her without hesitating the good lady put on a skirt and came down  shes ad a miss she said after looking at liza is there anyone you could send to the orspital  na i dunno oo i could get at this hour  well ill git my old man ter go  she called her husband and sent him off she was a stout middleaged woman roughvisaged and strongarmed her name was mrs hodges  its lucky you came ter me she said when she had

now youll be able ter find aht all abaht it when she gits better  for a while the two women sat still waiting the doctors coming and liza lay gazing vacantly at the wall panting for breath sometimes jim crossed her mind and she opened her mouth to call for him but in her despair she restrained herself  the doctor came  dyou think shes bad doctor asked mrs hodges  im afraid she is rather he answered ill come in again this evening  oh doctor said mrs kemp as he was going could yer give me somethin for my rheumatics im a martyr to rheumatism an these cold days i ardly knows wot ter do with

beads of sweat stood on her forehead  ow are yer ducky asked mrs hodges but liza did not answer  its my belief shes unconscious said mrs kemp ive been askin er oo it was as done it but she dont seem

complaint im in the abit of askin five shillings an i will say this i dont think its too much for wot i do  the news of lizas illness had quickly spread and more than once in the course of the day a neighbour had come to ask after her there was a knock at the door now and mrs hodges opened it tom stood on the threshold asking to come in  yus you can come said mrs kemp  he advanced on tiptoe so as to make no noise and for a while stood silently looking at liza mrs hodges was by his side  can i speak to er he whispered  she cant ear you  he groaned  dyer think shell get arright he asked  mrs hodges shrugged her shoulders  i shouldnt like ter give an opinion she said cautiously  tom bent over liza and blushing kissed her then without speaking further went out of the room  thets the young man as was courtin er said mrs kemp pointing over her shoulder with her thumb  soon after the doctor came  wot do yer think of er doctor said mrs hodges bustling forwards authoritatively in her position of midwife and sicknurse  im afraid shes very bad  dyer think shes goin ter die she asked dropping her voice to a whisper  im afraid so  as the doctor sat down by lizas side mrs hodges turned round and significantly nodded to mrs kemp who put her handkerchief to her eyes then she went outside to the little group waiting at the door  wot does the doctor sy they asked among them tom  e says just wot ive been sayin all along i knew she wouldnt live  and tom burst out oh liza  as she retired a woman remarked  mrs odges is very clever i think  yus remarked another she got me through my last confinement simply wonderful if it come to choosin between em id back mrs odges against forty doctors  ter tell yer the truth so would i ive never known er wrong yet  mrs hodges sat down beside mrs kemp and proceeded to comfort her  why dont yer tike a little drop of brandy ter calm yer nerves mrs kemp she said you want it  i was just feelin rather faint an i couldnt elp thinkin as ow twopenneth

lidies in my line cant say  they sipped their brandy for a while  its a great trial ter me that this should ave appened said mrs kemp coming to the subject that had been disturbing her for some time mines always been a very respectable family an such a thing as this as never appened before no mrs odges i was lawfully married in church an ive got my marriage lines now ter show i was an thet one of my daughters should ave gone wrong in this waywell i cant understand it i give er a good education an she ad all the comforts of a ome she never wanted for nothin i worked myself to the bone ter keep

thisive done my duty by the girl an shes never learnt anythin but good from me of course i aint always been in wot yer might call flourishing circumstances but ive always set her a good example as she could tell yer so erself if she wasnt speechless  mrs kemp paused for a moments reflection  as they sy in the bible she finished its enough ter mike ones grey airs go dahn into the ground in sorrer i can show yer my marriage certificate of course one doesnt like ter say much because of course shes very bad but if she got well i should ave given er a talkin ter  there was another knock  do go an see oo thet is i cant on account of my rheumatics  mrs hodges opened the door it was jim  he was very white and the blackness of his hair and beard contrasting with the deathly pallor of his face made him look ghastly mrs hodges stepped back  oos e she said turning to mrs kemp  jim pushed her aside and went up to the bed  doctor is she very bad he asked  the doctor looked at him questioningly  jim whispered it was me as done it she aint goin ter die is she  the doctor nodded  o god wot shall i do it was my fault i wish i was dead  jim took the girls head in his hands and the tears burst from his eyes  she aint dead yet is she  shes just living said the doctor  jim bent down  liza liza speak ter me liza say you forgive me oh speak ter me  his voice was full of agony the doctor spoke  she cant hear you  oh she must hear me liza liza  he sank on his knees by the bedside  they all remained silent liza lying stiller than ever her breast unmoved by the feeble respiration jim looking at her very mournfully the doctor grave with his fingers on the pulse the two women looked at jim  fancy it bein im said mrs kemp strike me lucky aint e a sight  you ave got er insured mrs kemp asked the midwife she could bear the silence no longer  trust me fur thet replied the good lady ive ad er insured ever since she was born why only the other dy i was sayin ter myself thet all thet money ad been

footley thinks a deal of me e does why only the other dy as i was goin inter is shop e says good mornin mrs odges good mornin mr footley says i youve jest come in the nick of time says e this

all jumped an at last we got it to an screwed it but lor we did ave a job i shall never forget it  then all was silence and a heaviness seemed to fill the air like a grey blight cold and suffocating and the heaviness was death they felt the presence in the room and they dared not move they dared not draw their breath the silence was terrifying  suddenly a sound was hearda loud rattle it was from the bed and rang through the room piercing the stillness  the doctor opened one of lizas eyes and touched it then he laid on her breast the hand he had been holding and drew the sheet over her head  jim turned away with a look of intense weariness on his face and the two women began weeping silently the darkness was sinking before the day and a dim grey light came through the window the lamp spluttered out
