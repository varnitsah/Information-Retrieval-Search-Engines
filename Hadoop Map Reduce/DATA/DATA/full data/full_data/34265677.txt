34265677	a tale which holdeth children from play  old men from the chimney corner             sir philip sidney   the fortunes of nigel  by sir walter scott bart     introduction    but why should lordlings all our praise engross   rise honest man and sing the man of ross                                          pope  having in the tale of the heart of midlothian succeeded in some degree in awakening an interest in behalf of one devoid of those accomplishments which belong to a heroine almost by right i was next tempted to choose a hero upon the same unpromising plan and as worth of character goodness of heart and rectitude of principle were necessary to one who laid no claim to high birth romantic sensibility or any of the usual accomplishments of those who strut through the pages of this sort of composition i made free with the name of a person who has left the most magnificent proofs of his benevolence and charity that the capital of scotland has to display  to the scottish reader little more need be said than that the man alluded to is george heriot but for those south of the tweed it may be necessary to add that the person so named was a wealthy citizen of edinburgh and the kings goldsmith who followed james to the english capital and was so successful in his profession as to die in 1624 extremely wealthy for that period he had no children and after making a full provision for such relations as might have claims upon him he left the residue of his fortune to establish an hospital in which the sons of edinburgh freemen are gratuitously brought up and educated for the station to which their talents may recommend them and are finally enabled to enter life under respectable auspices the hospital in which this charity is maintained is a noble quadrangle of the gothic order and as ornamental to the city as a building as the manner in which the youths are provided for and educated renders it useful to the community as an institution to the honour of those who have the management the magistrates and clergy of edinburgh the funds of the hospital have increased so much under their care that it now supports and educates one hundred and thirty youths annually many of whom have done honour to their country in different situations  the founder of such a charity as this may be reasonably supposed to have walked through life with a steady pace and an observant eye neglecting no opportunity of assisting those who were not possessed of the experience necessary for their own guidance in supposing his efforts directed to the benefit of a young nobleman misguided by the aristocratic haughtiness of his own time and the prevailing tone of selfish luxury which seems more peculiar to ours as well as the seductions of pleasure which are predominant in all some amusement or even some advantage might i thought be derived from the manner in which i might bring the exertions of this civic mentor to bear in his pupils behalf i am i own no great believer in the moral utility to be derived from fictitious compositions yet if in any case a word spoken in season may be of advantage to a young person it must surely be when it calls upon him to attend to the voice of principle and selfdenial instead of that of precipitate passion i could not indeed hope or expect to represent my prudent and benevolent citizen in a point of view so interesting as that of the peasant girl who nobly sacrificed her family affections to the integrity of her moral character still however something i hoped might be done not altogether unworthy the fame which george heriot has secured by the lasting benefits he has bestowed on his country  it appeared likely that out of this simple plot i might weave something attractive because the reign of james i in which george heriot flourished gave unbounded scope to invention in the fable while at the same time it afforded greater variety and discrimination of character than could with historical consistency have been introduced if the scene had been laid a century earlier lady mary wortley montague has said with equal truth and taste that the most romantic region of every country is that where the mountains unite themselves with the plains or lowlands for similiar reasons it may be in like manner said that the most picturesque period of history is that when the ancient rough and wild manners of a barbarous age are just becoming innovated upon and contrasted by the illumination of increased or revived learning and the instructions of renewed or reformed religion the strong contrast produced by the opposition of ancient manners to those which are gradually subduing them affords the lights and shadows necessary to give effect to a fictitious narrative and while such a period entitles the author to introduce incidents of a marvellous and improbable character as arising out of the turbulent independence and ferocity belonging to old habits of violence still influencing the manners of a people who had been so lately in a barbarous state yet on the other hand the characters and sentiments of many of the actors may with the utmost probability be described with great variety of shading and delineation which belongs to the newer and more improved period of which the world has but lately received the light  the reign of james i of england possessed this advantage in a peculiar degree some beams of chivalry although its planet had been for some time set continued to animate and gild the horizon and although probably no one acted precisely on its quixotic dictates men and women still talked the chivalrous language of sir philip sydneys arcadia and the ceremonial of the tiltyard was yet exhibited though it now only flourished as a place de carrousel here and there a high spirited knight of the bath witness the too scrupulous lord herbert of cherbury was found devoted enough to the vows he had taken to imagine himself obliged to compel by the swordspoint a fellow knight or squire to restore the topknot of ribbon which he had stolen from a fair damselfootnote see lord herbert of cherburys memoirs but yet while men were taking each others lives on such punctilios of honour the hour was already arrived when bacon was about to teach the world that they were no longer to reason from authority to fact but to establish truth by advancing from fact to fact till they fixed an indisputable authority not from hypothesis but from experiment  the state of society in the reign of james i was also strangely disturbed and the license of a part of the community was perpetually giving rise to acts of blood and violence the bravo of the queens day of whom shakspeare has given us so many varieties as bardolph nym pistol peto and the other companions of falstaff men who had their humours or their particular turn of extravaganza had since the commencement of the low country wars given way to a race of sworders who used the rapier and dagger instead of the far less dangerous sword and buckler so that a historian says on this subject that private quarrels were nourished but especially between the scots and english and duels in every street maintained divers sects and peculiar titles passed unpunished and unregarded as the sect of the roaring boys bonaventors bravadors quarterors and such like being persons prodigal and of great expense who having run themselves into debt were constrained to run next into factions to defend themselves from danger of the law these received countenance from divers of the nobility and the citizens through lasciviousness consuming their estates it was like that the number of these desperadoes would rather increase than diminish and under these pretences they entered into many desperate enterprizes and scarce any durst walk in the street after nine at nightfootnote history of the first fourteen years of king jamess reign see somerss tracts edited by scott vol ii p266  the same authority assures us farther that ancient gentlemen who had left their inheritance whole and well furnished with goods and chattels having thereupon kept good houses unto their sons lived to see part consumed in riot and excess and the rest in possibility to be utterly lost the holy state of matrimony made but a maygame by which divers families had been subverted brothel houses much frequented and even great persons prostituting their bodies to the intent to satisfy their lusts consumed their substance in lascivious appetites and of all sorts such knights and gentlemen as either through pride or prodigalityhad consumed their substance repairing to the city and to the intent to consume their virtue also lived dissolute lives many of their ladies and daughters to the intent to maintain themselves according to their dignity prostituting their bodies in shameful manner alehouses dicinghouses taverns and places of iniquity beyond manner abounding in most places  nor is it only in the pages of a puritanical perhaps a satirical writer that we find so shocking and disgusting a picture of the coarseness of the beginning of the seventeenth century on the contrary in all the comedies of the age the principal character for gaiety and wit is a young heir who has totally altered the establishment of the father to whom he has succeeded and to use the old simile who resembles a fountain which plays off in idleness and extravagance the wealth which its careful parents painfully had assembled in hidden reservoirs  and yet while that spirit of general extravagance seemed at work over a whole kingdom another and very different sort of men were gradually forming the staid and resolved characters which afterwards displayed themselves during the civil wars and powerfully regulated and affected the character of the whole english nation until rushing from one extreme to another they sunk in a gloomy fanaticism the splendid traces of the reviving fine arts  from the quotations which i have produced the selfish and disgusting conduct of lord dalgarno will not perhaps appear overstrained nor will the scenes in whitefriars and places of similar resort seem too highly coloured this indeed is far from being the case it was in james is reign that vice first appeared affecting the better classes in its gross and undisguised depravity the entertainments and amusements of elizabeths time had an air of that decent restraint which became the court of a maiden sovereign and in that earlier period to use the words of burke vice lost half its evil by being deprived of all its grossness in jamess reign on the contrary the coarsest pleasures were publicly and unlimitedly indulged since according to sir john harrington the men wallowed in beastly delights and even ladies abandoned their delicacy and rolled about in intoxication after a ludicrous account of a mask in which the actors had got drunk and behaved themselves accordingly he adds i have much marvelled at these strange pageantries and they do bring to my recollection what passed of this sort in our queens days in which i was sometimes an assistant and partaker but never did i see such lack of good order and sobriety as i have now done the gunpowder fright is got out of all our heads and we are going on hereabout as if the devil was contriving every man should blow up himself by wild riot excess and devastation of time and temperance the great ladies do go well masqued and indeed it be the only show of their modesty to conceal their countenance but alack they meet with such countenance to uphold their strange doings that i marvel not at aught that happensfootnote harringtons nugae antique vol ii p 352 for the gross debauchery of the period too much encouraged by the example of the monarch who was in other respects neither without talent nor a goodnatured disposition see winwoods memorials howells letters and other memorials of the time but particularly consult the private letters and correspondence of steenie alias buckingham with his reverend dad and gossip king james which abound with the grossest as well as the most childish language the learned mr disraeli in an attempt to vindicate the character of james has only succeeded in obtaining for himself the character of a skilful and ingenious advocate without much advantage to his royal client  such being the state of the court coarse sensuality brought along with it its ordinary companion a brutal degree of undisguised selfishness destructive alike of philanthropy and good breeding both of which in their several spheres depend upon the regard paid by each individual to the interest as well as the feelings of others it is in such a time that the heartless and shameless man of wealth and power may like the supposed lord dalgarno brazen out the shame of his villainies and affect to triumph in their consequences so long as they were personally advantageous to his own pleasures or profit  alsatia is elsewhere explained as a cant name for whitefriars which possessing certain privileges of sanctuary became for that reason a nest of those mischievous characters who were generally obnoxious to the law these privileges were derived from its having been an establishment of the carmelites or white friars founded says stow in his survey of london by sir patrick grey in 1241 edward i gave them a plot of ground in fleet street to build their church upon the edifice then erected was rebuilt by courtney earl of devonshire in the reign of edward in the time of the reformation the place retained its immunities as a sanctuary and james i confirmed and added to them by a charter in 1608 shadwell was the first author who made some literary use of whitefriars in his play of the squire of alsatia

rigour and indulgence the elder of the subjects of this experiment who has been very rigidly brought up falls at once into all the vices of the town is debauched by the cheats and bullies of

third day of this play and vast numbers went away that could not be admitted footnote dedication to the squire of alsatia shadwells works vol iv from the squire of alsatia the author derived some few hints and learned the footing on which the bullies and thieves of the sanctuary stood with their neighbours the fiery young students of the temple of which some intimation is given in the dramatic piece  such are the materials to which the author stands indebted for the composition of the fortunes of nigel a novel which may be perhaps one of those that are more amusing on a second perusal than when read a first time for the sake of the story the incidents of which are few and meagre  the introductory epistle is written in lucios phrase according to the trick and would never have appeared had the writer meditated making his avowal of the work as it is the privilege of a masque or incognito to speak in a feigned voice and assumed character the author attempted while in disguise some liberties of the same sort and while he continues to plead upon the various excuses which the introduction contains the present acknowledgment must serve as an apology for a species of hoity toity whisky frisky pertness of manner which in his avowed character the author should have considered as a departure from the rules of civility and good taste   abbotsford 1st july 1831     introductory epistle  captain clutterbuck to the reverend dr dryasdust  dear sir  i readily accept of and reply to the civilities with which you have been pleased to honour me in your obliging letter and entirely agree with your quotation of quam bonum et quam jucundum we may indeed esteem ourselves as come of the same family or according to our country proverb as being all one mans bairns and there needed no apology on your part reverend and dear sir for demanding of me any information which i may be able to supply respecting the subject of your curiosity the interview which you allude to took place in the course of last winter and is so deeply imprinted on my recollection that it requires no effort to collect all its most minute details  you are aware that the share which i had in introducing the romance called the monastery to public notice has given me a sort of character in the literature of our scottish metropolis i no longer stand in the outer shop of our bibliopolists bargaining for the objects of my curiosity with an unrespective shoplad hustled among boys who come to buy corderies and copybooks and servant girls cheapening a pennyworth of paper but am cordially welcomed by the bibliopolist himself with pray walk into the backshop captain boy get a chair for captain clutterbuck there is the newspaper captaintodays paper or here is the last new workthere is a folder make free with the leaves or put it in your pocket and carry it home or we will make a bookseller of you sir and you shall have it at trade price or perhaps if it is the worthy traders own publication his liberality may even extend itself to never mind booking such a trifle to you sirit is an overcopy pray mention the work to your reading friends i say nothing of the snug wellselected literary party arranged round a turbot leg of fiveyearold mutton or some such gear or of the circulation of a quiet bottle of robert cockburns choicest blacknay perhaps of his new ones all these are comforts reserved to such as are freemen of the corporation of letters and i have the advantage of enjoying them in perfection but all things change under the sun and it is with no ordinary feelings of regret that in my annual visits to the metropolis i now miss the social and warmhearted welcome of the quickwitted and kindly friend who first introduced me to the public who had more original wit than would have set up a dozen of professed sayers of good things and more racy humour than would have made the fortune of as many more to this great deprivation has been added i trust for a time only the loss of another bibliopolical friend whose vigorous intellect and liberal ideas have not only rendered his native country the mart of her own literature but established there a court of letters which must command respect even from those most inclined to dissent from many of its canons the effect of these changes operated in a great measure by the strong sense and sagacious calculations of an individual who knew how to avail himself to an unhopedfor extent of the various kinds of talent which his country produced will probably appear more clearly to the generation which shall follow the present  i entered the shop at the cross to enquire after the health of my worthy friend and learned with satisfaction that his residence in the south had abated the rigour of the symptoms of his disorder availing myself then of the privileges to which i have alluded i strolled onward in that labyrinth of small dark rooms or crypts to speak our own antiquarian language which form the extensive back settlements of that celebrated publishinghouse yet as i proceeded from one obscure recess to another filled some of them with old volumes some with such as from the equality of their rank on the shelves i suspected to be the less saleable modern books of the concern i could not help feeling a holy horror creep upon me when i thought of the risk of intruding on some ecstatic bard giving vent to his poetical fury or it might be on the yet more formidable privacy of a band of critics in the act of worrying the game which they had just run down in such a supposed case i felt by anticipation the horrors of the highland seers whom their gift of deuteroscopy compels to witness things unmeet for mortal eye and who to use the expression of collins       heartless oft like moody madness stare      to see the phantom train their secret work prepare  still however the irresistible impulse of an undefined curiosity drove me on through this succession of darksome chambers till like the jeweller of delhi in the house of the magician bennaskar i at length reached a vaulted room dedicated to secrecy and silence and beheld seated by a lamp and employed in reading a blotted revise footnote the uninitiated must be informed that a second proofsheet is so called the person or perhaps i should rather say the eidolon or representative vision of the author of waverley you will not be surprised at the filial instinct which enabled me at once to acknowledge the features borne by this venerable apparition and that i at once bended the knee with the classical salutation of salve magne parens the vision however cut me short by pointing to a seat intimating at the same time that my presence was not expected and that he had something to say to me  i sat down with humble obedience and endeavoured to note the features of him with whom i now found myself so unexpectedly in society but on this point i can give your reverence no satisfaction for besides the obscurity of the apartment and the fluttered state of my own nerves i seemed to myself overwhelmed by a sense of filial awe which prevented my noting and recording what it is probable the personage before me might most desire to have concealed indeed his figure was so closely veiled and wimpled either with a mantle morninggown or some such loose garb that the verses of spenser might well have been applied      yet certes by her face and physnomy      whether she man or woman only were      that could not any creature well descry  i must however go on as i have begun to apply the masculine gender for notwithstanding very ingenious reasons and indeed something like positive evidence have been offered to prove the author of waverley to be two ladies of talent i must abide by the general opinion that he is of the rougher sex there are in his writings too many things      quae maribus sola tribuuntur  to permit me to entertain any doubt on that subject i will proceed in the manner of dialogue to repeat as nearly as i can what passed betwixt us only observing that in the course of the conversation my timidity imperceptibly gave way under the familiarity of his address and that in the concluding part of our dialogue i perhaps argued with fully as much confidence as was beseeming  author of waverley i was willing to see you captain clutterbuck being the person of my family whom i have most regard for since the death of jedediah cleishbotham and i am afraid i may have done you some wrong in assigning to you the monastery as a portion of my effects i have some thoughts of making it up to you by naming you godfather to this yet unborn babehe indicated the proofsheet with his fingerbut first touching the monasteryhow says the world you are abroad and can learn  captain clutterbuck hem hemthe enquiry is delicatei have not heard any complaints from the publishers  author that is the principal matter but yet an indifferent work is sometimes towed on by those which have left harbour before it with the breeze in their poopwhat say the critics  captain there is a generalfeelingthat the white lady is no favourite  author i think she is a failure myself but rather in execution than conception could i have evoked an esprit follet at the same time fantastic and interesting capricious and kind a sort of wildfire of the elements bound by no fixed laws or motives of action faithful and fond yet teazing and uncertain  captain if you will pardon the interruption sir i think you are describing a pretty woman  author on my word i believe i am i must invest my elementary spirits with a little human flesh and bloodthey are too finedrawn for the present taste of the public  captain they object too that the object of your nixie ought to have been more uniformly nobleher ducking the priest was no naiad like amusement  author ah they ought to allow for the capriccios of what is after all but a better sort of goblin the bath into which ariel the most delicate creation of shakspeares imagination seduces our jolly friend trinculo was not of amber or rosewater but no one shall find me rowing against the stream i care not who knows iti write for general amusement and though i never will aim at popularity by what i think unworthy means i will not on the other hand be pertinacious in the defence of my own errors against the voice of the public  captain you abandon then in the present worklooking in my turn towards the proofsheetthe mystic and the magical and the whole system of signs wonders and omens there are no dreams or presages or obscure allusions to future events  author not a cocklane scratch my sonnot one bounce on the drum of tedworthnot so much as the poor tick of a solitary deathwatch in the wainscot all is clear and above boarda scots metaphysician might believe every word of it  captain and the story is i hope natural and probable commencing strikingly proceeding naturally ending happilylike the course of a famed river which gushes from the mouth of some obscure and romantic grottothen gliding on never pausing never precipitating its course visiting as it were by natural instinct whatever worthy subjects of interest are presented by the country through which it passeswidening and deepening in interest as it flows on and at length arriving at the final catastrophe as at some mighty haven where ships of all kinds strike sail and yard  author hey hey what the deuce is all this whytis ercles vein and it would require some one much more like hercules than i to produce a story which should gush and glide and never pause and visit and widen and deepen and all the rest ont i should be chin deep in the grave man before i had done with my task and in the meanwhile all the quirks and quiddities which i might have devised for my readers amusement would lie rotting in my gizzard like sanchos suppressed witticisms when he was under his masters displeasurethere never was a novel written on this plan while the world stood  captain pardon metom jones  author true and perhaps amelia also fielding had high notions of the dignity of an art which he may be considered as having founded he challenges a comparison between the novel and the epic smollett le sage and others emancipating themselves from the strictness of the rules he has laid down have written rather a history of the miscellaneous adventures which befall an individual in the course of life than the plot of a regular and connected epopeia where every step brings us a point nearer to the final catastrophe these great masters have been satisfied if they amused the reader upon the road though the conclusion only arrived because the tale must have an end just as the traveller alights at the inn because it is evening  captain a very commodious mode of travelling for the author at least in short sir you are of opinion with bayeswhat the devil does the plot signify except to bring in fine things  author grant that i were so and that i should write with sense and spirit a few scenes unlaboured and loosely put together but which had sufficient interest in them to amuse in one corner the pain of body in another to relieve anxiety of mind in a third place to unwrinkle a brow bent with the furrows of daily toil in another to fill the place of bad thoughts or to suggest better in yet another to induce an idler to study the history of his country in all save where the perusal interrupted the discharge of serious duties to furnish harmless amusementmight not the author of such a work however inartificially executed plead for his errors and negligences the excuse of the slave who about to be punished for having spread the false report of a victory saved himself by exclaimingam i to blame o athenians who have given you one happy day  captain will your goodness permit me to mention an anecdote of my excellent grandmother  author i see little she can have to do with the subject captain clutterbuck  captain it may come into our dialogue on bayess planthe sagacious old ladyrest her soulwas a good friend to the church and could never hear a minister maligned by evil tongues without taking his part warmly there was one fixed point however at which she always abandoned the cause of her reverend protegeit was so soon as she learned he had preached a regular sermon against slanderers and backbiters  author and what is that to the purpose  captain only that i have heard engineers say that one may betray the weak point to the enemy by too much ostentation of fortifying it  author and once more i pray what is that to the purpose  captain nay then without farther metaphor i am afraid this new production in which your generosity seems willing to give me some concern will stand much in need of apology since you think proper to begin your defence before the case is on trialthe story is hastily huddled up i will venture a pint of claret  author a pint of port i suppose you mean  captain i say of claretgood claret of the monastery ah sir would you but take the advice of your friends and try to deserve at least onehalf of the public favour you have met with we might all drink tokay  author i care not what i drink so the liquor be wholesome  captain care for your reputation thenfor your fame  author my famei will answer you as a very ingenious able and experienced friend being counsel for the notorious jem maccoul replied to the opposite side of the bar when they laid weight on his clients refusing to answer certain queries which they said any man who had a regard for his reputation would not hesitate to reply to my client said heby the way jem was standing behind him at the time and a rich scene it wasis so unfortunate as to have no regard for his reputation and i should deal very uncandidly with the court should i say he had any that was worth his attentioni am though from very different reasons in jems happy state of indifference let fame follow those who have a substantial shape a shadowand an impersonal author is nothing bettercan cast no shade  captain you are not now perhaps so impersonal as heretofore these letters to the member for the university of oxfordauthor show the wit genius and delicacy of the author which i heartily wish to see engaged on a subject of more importance and show besides that the preservation of my character of incongnito has engaged early talent in the discussion of a curious question of evidence but a cause however ingeniously pleaded is not therefore gained you may remember the neatlywrought chain of circumstantial evidence so artificially brought forward to prove sir philip franciss title to the letters of junius seemed at first irrefragable yet the influence of the reasoning has passed away and junius in the general opinion is as much unknown as ever but on this subject i will not be soothed or provoked into saying one word more to say who i am not would be one step towards saying who i am and as i desire not any more than a certain justice of peace mentioned by shenstone the noise or report such things make in the world i shall continue to be silent on a subject which in my opinion is very undeserving the noise that has been made about it and still more unworthy of the serious employment of such ingenuity as has been displayed by the young letterwriter  captain but allowing my dear sir that you care not for your personal reputation or for that of any literary person upon whose shoulders your faults may be visited allow me to say that common gratitude to the public which has received you so kindly and to the critics who have treated you so leniently ought to induce you to bestow more pains on your story  author i do entreat you my son as dr johnson would have said free your mind from cant for the critics they have their business and i mine as the nursery proverb goes  the children in holland take pleasure in making what the children in england take pleasure in breaking  i am their humble jackal too busy in providing food for them to have time for considering whether they swallow or reject itto the public i stand pretty nearly in the relation of the postman who leaves a packet at the door of an individual if it contains pleasing intelligence a billet from a mistress a letter from an absent son a remittance from a correspondent supposed to be bankruptthe letter is acceptably welcome and read and reread folded up filed and safely deposited in the bureau if the contents are disagreeable if it comes from a dun or from a bore the correspondent is cursed the letter is thrown into the fire and the expense of postage is heartily regretted while all the time the bearer of the dispatches is in either case as little thought on as the snow of last christmas the utmost extent of kindness between the author and the public which can really exist is that the world are disposed to be somewhat indulgent to the succeeding works of an original favourite were it but on account of the habit which the public mind has acquired while the author very naturally thinks well of their taste who have so liberally applauded his productions but i deny there is any call for gratitude properly so called either on one side or the other  captain respect to yourself then ought to teach caution  author ay if caution could augment the chance of my success but to confess to you the truth the works and passages in which i have succeeded have uniformly been written with the greatest rapidity and when i have seen some of these placed in opposition with others and commended as more highly finished i could appeal to pen and standish that the parts in which i have come feebly off were by much the more laboured besides i doubt the beneficial effect of too much delay both on account of the author and the public a man should strike while the iron is hot and hoist sail while the wind is fair if a successful author keep not the stage another instantly takes his ground if a writer lie by for ten years ere he produces a second work he is superseded by others or if the age is so poor of genius that this does not happen his own reputation becomes his greatest obstacle the public will expect the new work to be ten times better than its predecessor the author will expect it should be ten times more popular and tis a hundred to ten that both are disappointed  captain this may justify a certain degree of rapidity in publication but not that which is proverbially said to be no speed you should take time at least to arrange your story  author that is a sore point with me my son believe me i have not been fool enough to neglect ordinary precautions i have repeatedly laid down my future work to scale divided it into volumes and chapters and endeavoured to construct a story which i meant should evolve itself gradually and strikingly maintain suspense and stimulate curiosity and which finally should terminate in a striking catastrophe but i think there is a demon who seats himself on the feather of my pen when i begin to write and leads it astray from the purpose characters expand under my hand incidents are multiplied the story lingers while the materials increase my regular mansion turns out a gothic anomaly and the work is closed long before i have attained the point i proposed  captain resolution and determined forbearance might remedy that evil  author alas my dear sir you do not know the force of paternal affection when i light on such a character as bailie jarvie or dalgetty my imagination brightens and my conception becomes clearer at every step which i take in his company although it leads me many a weary mile away from the regular road and forces me leap hedge and ditch to get back into the route again if i resist the temptation as you advise me my thoughts become prosy flat and dull i write painfully to myself and under a consciousness of flagging which makes me flag still more the sunshine with which fancy had invested the incidents departs from them and leaves every thing dull and gloomy i am no more the same author i was in my better mood than the dog in a wheel condemned to go round and round for hours is like the same dog merrily chasing his own tail and gambolling in all the frolic of unrestrained freedom in short sir on such occasions i think i am bewitched  captain nay sir if you plead sorcery there is no more to be saidhe must needs go whom the devil drives and this i suppose sir is the reason why you do not make the theatrical attempt to which you have been so often urged  author it may pass for one good reason for not writing a play that i cannot form a plot but the truth is that the idea adopted by too favourable judges of my having some aptitude for that department of poetry has been much founded on those scraps of old plays which being taken from a source inaccessible to collectors they have hastily considered the offspring of my motherwit now the manner in which i became possessed of these fragments is so extraordinary that i cannot help telling it to you  you must know that some twenty years since i went down to visit an old friend in worcestershire who had served with me in the dragoons  captain then you have served sir  author i haveor i have not which signifies the same thing captain is a good travelling namei found my friends house unexpectedly crowded with guests and as usual was condemnedthe mansion being an old oneto the haunted apartment i have as a great modern said seen too many ghosts to believe in them so betook myself seriously to my repose lulled by the wind rustling among the limetrees the branches of which chequered the moonlight which fell on the floor through the diamonded casement when behold a darker shadow interposed itself and i beheld visibly on the floor of the apartment  captain the white lady of avenel i supposeyou have told the very story before  author noi beheld a female form with mobcap bib and apron sleeves tucked up to the elbow a dredgingbox in the one hand and in the other a sauceladle i concluded of course that it was my friends cookmaid walking in her sleep and as i knew he had a value for sally who could toss a pancake with any girl in the country i got up to conduct her safely to the door but as i approached her she saidhold sir i am not what you take me forwords which seemed so opposite to the circumstances that i should not have much minded them had it not been for the peculiarly hollow sound in which they were utteredknow then she said in the same unearthly accents that i am the spirit of betty barneswho hanged herself for love of the stagecoachman thought i this is a proper spot of work of that unhappy elizabeth or betty barnes long cookmaid to mr warburton the painful collector but ah the too careless custodier of the largest collection of ancient plays ever knownof most of which the titles only are left to gladden the prolegomena of the variorum shakspeare yes stranger it was these illfated hands that consigned to grease and conflagration the scores of small quartos which did they now exist would drive the whole roxburghe club out of their sensesit was these unhappy pickers and stealers that singed fat fowls and wiped dirty trenchers with the lost works of beaumont and fletcher massinger jonson websterwhat shall i sayeven of shakspeare himself  like every dramatic antiquary my ardent curiosity after some play named in the book of the master of revels had often been checked by finding the object of my research numbered amongst the holocaust of victims which this unhappy woman had sacrificed to the god of good cheer it is no wonder then that like the hermit of parnell        i broke the bands of fear and madly cried        you careless jadebut scarce the words began        when betty brandishd high her saucingpan  beware she said you do not by your illtimed anger cut off the opportunity i yet have to indemnify the world for the errors of my ignorance in yonder coalhole not used for many a year repose the few greasy and blackened fragments of the elder drama which were not totally destroyed do thou thenwhy what do you stare at captain by my soul it is true as my friend major longbow says what should i tell you a lie for  captain lie sir nay heaven forbid i should apply the word to a person so veracious you are only inclined to chase your tail a little this morning thats all had you not better reserve this legend to form an introduction to three recovered dramas or so  author you are quite righthabits a strange thing my son i had forgot whom i was speaking to yes plays for the closet not for the stage  captain right and so you are sure to be acted for the managers while thousands of volunteers are desirous of serving them are wonderfully partial to pressed men  author i am a living witness having been like a second laberius made a dramatist whether i would or not i believe my muse would be terryfied into treading the stage even if i should write a sermon  captain truly if you did i am afraid folks might make a farce of it and therefore should you change your style i still advise a volume of dramas like lord byrons  author no his lordship is a cut above mei wont run my horse against his if i can help myself but there is my friend allan has written just such a play as i might write myself in a very sunny day and with one of bramahs extrapatent pens i cannot make neat work without such appurtenances  captain do you mean allan ramsay  author no nor barbara allan either i mean allan cunningham who has just published his tragedy of sir marmaduke maxwell full of merrymaking and murdering kissing and cutting of throats and passages which lead to nothing and which are very pretty passages for all that not a glimpse of probability is there about the plot but so much animation in particular passages and such a vein of poetry through the whole as i dearly wish i could infuse into my culinary remains should i ever be tempted to publish them with a popular impress people would read and admire the beauties of allanas it is they may perhaps only note his defectsor what is worse not note him at allbut never mind them honest allan you are a credit to caledonia for all thatthere are some lyrical effusions of his too which you would do well to read captain its hame and its hame is equal to burns  captain i will take the hint the club at kennaquhair are turned fastidious since catalan visited the abbey my poortith cauld has been received both poorly and coldly and the banks of bonnie doon have been positively coughed downtempora mutantur  author they cannot stand still they will change with all of us what then                   a mans a man for a that  but the hour of parting approaches  captain you are determined to proceed then in your own system are you aware that an unworthy motive may be assigned for this rapid succession of publication you will be supposed to work merely for the lucre of gain  author supposing that i did permit the great advantages which must be derived from success in literature to join with other motives in inducing me to come more frequently before the publicthat emolument is the voluntary tax which the public pays for a certain species of literary amusementit is extorted from no one and paid i presume by those only who can afford it and who receive gratification in proportion to the expense if the capital sum which these volumes have put into circulation be a very large one has it contributed to my indulgences only or can i not say to hundreds from honest duncan the papermanufacturer to the most snivelling of the printers devils didst thou not share hadst thou not fifteen pence i profess i think our modern athens much obliged to me for having established such an extensive manufacture and when universal suffrage comes in fashion i intend to stand for a seat in the house on the interest of all the unwashed artificers connected with literature  captain this would be called the language of a calicomanufacturer  author cant again my dear sonthere is lime in this sack too nothing but sophistication in this world i do say it in spite of adam smith and his followers that a successful author is a productive labourer and that his works constitute as effectual a part of the public wealth as that which is created by any other manufacture if a new commodity having an actually intrinsic and commercial value be the result of the operation why are the authors bales of books to be esteemed a less profitable part of the public stock than the goods of any other manufacturer i speak with reference to the diffusion of the wealth arising to the public and the degree of industry which even such a trifling work as the present must stimulate and reward before the volumes leave the publishers shop without me it could not exist and to this extent i am a benefactor to the country as for my own emolument it is won by my toil and i account myself answerable to heaven only for the mode in which i expend it the candid may hope it is not all dedicated to selfish purposes and without much pretensions to merit in him who disburses it a part may wander heavendirected to the poor  captain yet it is generally held base to write from the mere motives of gain  author it would be base to do so exclusively or even to make it a principal motive for literary exertion nay i will venture to say that no work of imagination proceeding from the mere consideration of a certain sum of copymoney ever did or ever will succeed so the lawyer who pleads the soldier who fights the physician who prescribes the clergymanif such there bewho preaches without any zeal for his profession or without any sense of its dignity and merely on account of the fee pay or stipend degrade themselves to the rank of sordid mechanics accordingly in the case of two of the learned faculties at least their services are considered as unappreciable and are acknowledged not by any exact estimate of the services rendered but by a honorarium or voluntary acknowledgment but let a client or patient make the experiment of omitting this little ceremony of the honorarium which is cense to be a thing entirely out of consideration between them and mark how the learned gentleman will look upon his case cant set apart it is the same thing with literary emolument no man of sense in any rank of life is or ought to be above accepting a just recompense for his time and a reasonable share of the capital which owes its very existence to his exertions when czar peter wrought in the trenches he took the pay of a common soldier and nobles statesmen and divines the most distinguished of their time have not scorned to square accounts with their bookseller  captain sings      o if it were a mean thing        the gentles would not use it      and if it were ungodly        the clergy would refuse it  author you say well but no man of honour genius or spirit would make the mere love of gain the chief far less the only purpose of his labours for myself i am not displeased to find the game a winning one yet while i pleased the public i should probably continue it merely for the pleasure of playing for i have felt as strongly as most folks that love of composition which is perhaps the strongest of all instincts driving the author to the pen the painter to the pallet often without either the chance of fame or the prospect of reward perhaps i have said too much of this i might perhaps with as much truth as most people exculpate myself from the charge of being either of a greedy or mercenary disposition but i am not therefore hypocrite enough to disclaim the ordinary motives on account of which the whole world around me is toiling unremittingly to the sacrifice of ease comfort health and life i do not affect the disinterestedness of that ingenious association of gentlemen mentioned by goldsmith who sold their magazine for sixpence apiece merely for their own amusement  captain i have but one thing more to hintthe world say you will run yourself out  author the world say true and what then when they dance no longer i will no longer pipe and i shall not want flappers enough to remind me of the apoplexy  captain and what will become of us then your poor family we shall fall into contempt and oblivion  author like many a poor fellow already overwhelmed with the number of his family i cannot help going on to increase ittis my vocation halsuch of you as deserve oblivionperhaps the whole of youmay be consigned to it at any rate you have been read in your day which is more than can be said of some of your contemporaries of less fortune and more merit they cannot say but that you had the crown it is always something to have engaged the public attention for seven years had i only written waverley i should have long since been according to the established phrase the ingenious author of a novel much admired at the time i believe on my soul that the reputation of waverley is sustained very much by the praises of those who may be inclined to prefer that tale to its successors  captain you are willing then to barter future reputation for present popularity  author meliora spero horace himself expected not to survive in all his worksi may hope to live in some of minenon omnis moriar it is some consolation to reflect that the best authors in all countries have been the most voluminous and it has often happened that those who have been best received in their own time have also continued to be acceptable to posterity i do not think so ill of the present generation as to suppose that its present favour necessarily infers future condemnation  captain were all to act on such principles the public would be inundated  author once more my dear son beware of cant you speak as if the public were obliged to read books merely because they are printed your friends the booksellers would thank you to make the proposition good the most serious grievance attending such inundations as you talk of is that they make rags dear the multiplicity of publications does the present age no harm and may greatly advantage that which is to succeed us  captain i do not see how that is to happen  author the complaints in the time of elizabeth and james of the alarming fertility of the press were as loud as they are at present yet look at the shore over which the inundation of that age flowed and it resembles now the rich strand of the faery queen       besrrewd all with rich array      of pearl and precious stones of great assay      and all the gravel mixd with golden ore  believe me that even in the most neglected works of the present age the next may discover treasures  captain some books will defy all alchemy  author they will be but few in number since as for the writers who are possessed of no merit at all unless indeed they publish their works at their own expense like sir richard blackmore their power of annoying the public will be soon limited by the difficulty of finding undertaking booksellers  captain you are incorrigible are there no bounds to your audacity  author there are the sacred and eternal boundaries of honour and virtue my course is like the enchanted chamber of britomart      where as she lookd about she did behold      how over that same door was likewise writ      be boldbe bold and everywhere be bold      whereat she mused and could not construe it      at last she spied at that rooms upper end      another iron door on which was writ      be not too bold  captain well you must take the risk of proceeding on your own principles  author do you act on yours and take care you do not stay idling here till the dinner hour is overi will add this work to your patrimony valeat quantum  here our dialogue terminated for a little sootyfaced apollyon from the canongate came to demand the proofsheet on the part of mr mcorkindale and i heard mr c rebuking mr f in another compartment of the same labyrinth i have described for suffering any one to penetrate so far into the penetralia of their temple  i leave it to you to form your own opinion concerning the import of this dialogue and i cannot but believe i shall meet the wishes of our common parent in prefixing this letter to the work which it concerns       i am reverend and dear sir            very sincerely and affectionately                  yours       the fortunes of nigel  knifegrinder story lord bless you i have none to tell sir                                poetry of the antijacobin     the fortunes of nigel   chapter i     now scot and english are agreed   and saunders hastes to cross the tweed   where such the splendours that attend him   his very mother scarce had kend him   his metamorphosis behold   from glasgow frieze to cloth of gold   his backsword with the iron hilt   to rapier fairly hatchd and gilt   was ever seen a gallant braver   his very bonnets grown a beaver                   the reformation  the longcontinued hostilities which had for centuries separated the south and the north divisions of the island of britain had been happily terminated by the succession of the pacific james i to the english crown but although the united crown of england and scotland was worn by the same individual it required a long lapse of time and the succession of more than one generation ere the inveterate national prejudices which had so long existed betwixt the sister kingdoms were removed and the subjects of either side of the tweed brought to regard those upon the opposite bank as friends and as brethren  these prejudices were of course most inveterate during the reign of king james the english subjects accused him of partiality to those of his ancient kingdom while the scots with equal injustice charged him with having forgotten the land of his nativity and with neglecting those early friends to whose allegiance he had been so much indebted  the temper of the king peaceable even to timidity inclined him perpetually to interfere as mediator between the contending factions whose brawls disturbed the court but notwithstanding all his precautions historians have recorded many instances where the mutual hatred of two nations who after being enemies for a thousand years had been so very recently united broke forth with a fury which menaced a general convulsion and spreading from the highest to the lowest classes as it occasioned debates in council and parliament factions in the court and duels among the gentry was no less productive of riots and brawls amongst the lower orders  while these heartburnings were at the highest there flourished in the city of london an ingenious but whimsical and self opinioned mechanic much devoted to abstract studies david ramsay by name who whether recommended by his great skill in his profession as the courtiers alleged or as was murmured among the neighbours by his birthplace in the good town of dalkeith near edinburgh held in jamess household the post of maker of watches and horologes to his majesty he scorned not however to keep open shop within temple bar a few yards to the eastward of saint dunstans church  the shop of a london tradesman at that time as it may be supposed was something very different from those we now see in the same locality the goods were exposed to sale in cases only defended from the weather by a covering of canvass and the whole resembled the stalls and booths now erected for the temporary accommodation of dealers at a country fair rather than the established emporium of a respectable citizen but most of the shopkeepers of note and david ramsay amongst others had their booth connected with a small apartment which opened backward from it and bore the same resemblance to the front shop that robinson crusoes cavern did to the tent which he erected before it  to this master ramsay was often accustomed to retreat to the labour of his abstruse calculations for he aimed at improvements and discoveries in his own art and sometimes pushed his researches like napier and other mathematicians of the period into abstract science when thus engaged he left the outer posts of his commercial establishment to be maintained by two stoutbodied and strongvoiced apprentices who kept up the cry of what dye lack what dye lack accompanied with the appropriate recommendations of the articles in which they dealt  this direct and personal application for custom to those who chanced to pass by is now we believe limited to monmouth street if it still exists even in that repository of ancient garments under the guardianship of the scattered remnant of israel but at the time we are speaking of it was practised alike by jew and gentile and served instead of all our present newspaper puffs and advertisements to solicit the attention of the public in general and of friends in particular to the unrivalled excellence of the goods which they offered to sale upon such easy terms that it might fairly appear that the venders had rather a view to the general service of the public than to their own particular advantage  the verbal proclaimers of the excellence of their commodities had this advantage over those who in the present day use the public papers for the same purpose that they could in many cases adapt their address to the peculiar appearance and apparent taste of the passengers this as we have said was also the case in monmouth street in our remembrance we have ourselves been reminded of the deficiencies of our femoral habiliments and exhorted upon that score to fit ourselves more beseemingly but this is a digression this direct and personal mode of invitation to customers became however a dangerous temptation to the young wags who were employed in the task of solicitation during the absence of the principal person interested in the traffic and confiding in their numbers and civic union the prentices of london were often seduced into taking liberties with the passengers and exercising their wit at the expense of those whom they had no hopes of converting into customers by their eloquence if this were resented by any act of violence the inmates of each shop were ready to pour forth in succour and in the words of an old song which dr johnson was used to hum      up then rose the prentices all      living in london both proper and tall  desperate riots often arose on such occasions especially when the templars or other youths connected with the aristocracy were insulted or conceived themselves to be so upon such occasions bare steel was frequently opposed to the clubs of the citizens and death sometimes ensued on both sides the tardy and inefficient police of the time had no other resource than by the alderman of the ward calling out the householders and putting a stop to the strife by overpowering numbers as the capulets and montagues are separated upon the stage  at the period when such was the universal custom of the most respectable as well as the most inconsiderable shopkeepers in london david ramsay on the evening to which we solicit the attention of the reader retiring to more abstruse and private labours left the administration of his outer shop or booth to the aforesaid sharp witted active ablebodied and wellvoiced apprentices namely jenkin vincent and frank tunstall  vincent had been educated at the excellent foundation of christs church hospital and was bred therefore as well as born a londoner with all the acuteness address and audacity which belong peculiarly to the youth of a metropolis he was now about twenty years old short in stature but remarkably strong made eminent for his feats upon holidays at football and other gymnastic exercises scarce rivalled in the broadsword play though hitherto only exercised in the form of singlestick he knew every lane blind alley and sequestered court of the ward better than his catechism was alike active in his masters affairs and in his own adventures of fun and mischief and so managed matters that the credit he acquired by the former bore him out or at least served for his apology when the latter propensity led him into scrapes of which however it is but fair to state that they had hitherto inferred nothing mean or discreditable some aberrations there were which david ramsay his master endeavoured to reduce to regular order when he discovered them and others which he winked atsupposing them to answer the purpose of the escapement of a watch which disposes of a certain quantity of the extra power of that mechanical impulse which puts the whole in motion  the physiognomy of jin vinby which abbreviation he was familiarly known through the wardcorresponded with the sketch we have given of his character his head upon which his prentices flat cap was generally flung in a careless and oblique fashion was closely covered with thick hair of raven black which curled naturally and closely and would have grown to great length but for the modest custom enjoined by his state in life and strictly enforced by his master which compelled him to keep it shortcroppednot unreluctantly as he looked with envy on the flowing ringlets in which the courtiers and aristocratic students of the neighbouring temple began to indulge themselves as marks of superiority and of gentility  vincents eyes were deep set in his head of a strong vivid black full of fire roguery and intelligence and conveying a humorous expression even while he was uttering the usual smalltalk of his trade as if he ridiculed those who were disposed to give any weight to his commonplaces he had address enough however to add little touches of his own which gave a turn of drollery even to this ordinary routine of the booth and the alacrity of his mannerhis ready and obvious wish to obligehis intelligence and civility when he thought civility necessary made him a universal favourite with his masters customers  his features were far from regular for his nose was flattish his mouth tending to the larger size and his complexion inclining to be more dark than was then thought consistent with masculine beauty but in despite of his having always breathed the air of a crowded city his complexion had the ruddy and manly expression of redundant health his turnedup nose gave an air of spirit and raillery to what he said and seconded the laugh of his eyes and his wide mouth was garnished with a pair of wellformed and wellcoloured lips which when he laughed disclosed a range of teeth strong and well set and as white as the very pearl such was the elder apprentice of david ramsay memorys monitor watchmaker and constructor of horologes to his most sacred majesty james i  jenkins companion was the younger apprentice though perhaps he might be the elder of the two in years at any rate he was of a much more staid and composed temper francis tunstall was of that ancient and proud descent who claimed the style of the unstained because amid the various chances of the long and bloody wars of the roses they had with undeviating faith followed the house of lancaster to which they had originally attached themselves the meanest sprig of such a tree attached importance to the root from which it derived itself and tunstall was supposed to nourish in secret a proportion of that family pride which had exhorted tears from his widowed and almost indigent mother when she saw herself obliged to consign him to a line of life inferior as her prejudices suggested to the course held by his progenitors yet with all this aristocratic prejudice his master found the wellborn youth more docile regular and strictly attentive to his duty than his far more active and alert comrade tunstall also gratified his master by the particular attention which he seemed disposed to bestow on the abstract principles of science connected with the trade which he was bound to study the limits of which were daily enlarged with the increase of mathematical science  vincent beat his companion beyond the distancepost in every thing like the practical adaptation of thorough practice in the dexterity of hand necessary to execute the mechanical branches of the art and doubleddistanced him in all respecting the commercial affairs of the shop still david ramsay was wont to say that if vincent knew how to do a thing the better of the two tunstall was much better acquainted with the principles on which it ought to be done and he sometimes objected to the latter that he knew critical excellence too well ever to be satisfied with practical mediocrity  the disposition of tunstall was shy as well as studious and though perfectly civil and obliging he never seemed to feel himself in his place while he went through the duties of the shop he was tall and handsome with fair hair and wellformed limbs good features well opened lightblue eyes a straight grecian nose and a countenance which expressed both goodhumour and intelligence but qualified by a gravity unsuitable to his years and which almost amounted to dejection he lived on the best of terms with his companion and readily stood by him whenever he was engaged in any of the frequent skirmishes which as we have already observed often disturbed the city of london about this period but though tunstall was allowed to understand quarterstaff the weapon of the north country in a superior degree and though he was naturally both strong and active his interference in such affrays seemed always matter of necessity and as he never voluntarily joined either their brawls or their sports he held a far lower place in the opinion of the youth of the ward than his hearty and active friend jin vin nay had it not been for the interest made for his comrade by the intercession of vincent tunstall would have stood some chance of being altogether excluded from the society of his contemporaries of the same condition who called him in scorn the cavaliero cuddy and the gentle tunstall  on the other hand the lad himself deprived of the fresh air in which he had been brought up and foregoing the exercise to which he had formerly been accustomed while the inhabitant of his native mansion lost gradually the freshness of his complexion and without showing any formal symptoms of disease grew more thin and pale as he grew older and at length exhibited the appearance of indifferent health without any thing of the habits and complaints of an invalid excepting a disposition to avoid society and to spend his leisure time in private study rather than mingle in the sports of his companions or even resort to the theatres then the general rendezvous of his class where according to high authority they fought for halfbitten apples cracked nuts and filled the upper gallery with their clamours  such were the two youths who called david ramsay master and with both of whom he used to fret from morning till night as their peculiarities interfered with his own or with the quiet and beneficial course of his traffic  upon the whole however the youths were attached to their master and he a goodnatured though an absent and whimsical man was scarce less so to them and when a little warmed with wine at an occasional junketing he used to boast in his northern dialect of his twa bonnie lads and the looks that the court ladies threw at them when visiting his shop in their caroches when on a frolic into the city but david ramsay never failed at the same time to draw up his own tall thin lathy skeleton extend his lean jaws into an alarming grin and indicate by a nod of his yardlong visage and a twinkle of his little grey eye that there might be more faces in fleet street worth looking at than those of frank and jenkin his old neighbour widow simmons the sempstress who had served in her day the very tiptop revellers of the temple with ruffs cuffs and bands distinguished more deeply the sort of attention paid by the females of quality who so regularly visited david ramsays shop to its inmates the boy frank she admitted used to attract the attention of the young ladies as having something gentle and downcast in his looks but then he could not better himself for the poor youth had not a word to throw at a dog now jin vin was so full of his jibes and jeers and so willing and so ready and so serviceable and so mannerly all the while with a step that sprung like a bucks in epping forest and his eye that twinkled as black as a gipsys that no woman who knew the world would make a comparison betwixt the lads as for poor neighbour ramsay himself the man she said was a civil neighbour and a learned man doubtless and might be a rich man if he had common sense to back his learning and doubtless for a scot neighbour ramsay was nothing of a bad man but he was so constantly grimed with smoke gilded with brass filings and smeared with lamp black and oil that dame simmons judged it would require his whole shopful of watches to induce any feasible woman to touch the said neighbour ramsay with any thing save a pair of tongs  a still higher authority dame ursula wife to benjamin suddlechop the barber was of exactly the same opinion  such were in natural qualities and public estimation the two youths who in a fine april day having first rendered their dutiful service and attendance on the table of their master and his daughter at their dinner at one oclocksuch o ye lads of london was the severe discipline undergone by your predecessorsand having regaled themselves upon the fragments in company with two female domestics one a cook and maid of all work the other called mistress margarets maid now relieved their master in the duty of the outward shop and agreeably to the established custom were soliciting by their entreaties and recommendations of their masters manufacture the attention and encouragement of the passengers  in this species of service it may be easily supposed that jenkin vincent left his more reserved and bashful comrade far in the background the latter could only articulate with difficulty and as an act of duty which he was rather ashamed of discharging the established words of formwhat dye lackwhat dye lackclocks watchesbarnacleswhat dye lackwatchesclocksbarnacles what dye lack sir what dye lack madambarnacleswatches clocks  but this dull and dry iteration however varied by diversity of verbal arrangement

pair of spectacles which he touched with an air of great deference and respect which his most blessed majesty placed this day three weeks on his own blessed nose and would have kept them for his own sacred use but that the setting being as your reverence sees of the purest jet was as his sacred majesty was pleased to say fitter for a bishop than for a secular prince  his sacred majesty the king said the worthy divine was ever a very daniel in his judgment give me the barnacles my good youth and who can say what nose they may bestride in two years henceour reverend brother of gloucester waxes in years he then pulled out his purse paid for the spectacles and left the shop with even a more important step than that which had paused to enter it  for shame said tunstall to his companion these glasses will never suit one of his years  you are a fool frank said vincent in reply had the good doctor wished glasses to read with he would have tried them before buying he does not want to look through them himself and these will serve the purpose of being looked at by other folks as well as the best magnifiers in the shopwhat dye lack he cried resuming his solicitations mirrors for your

butyro quant suff  to be taken after a gentle rubbingdown with an english oaken towel said vincent  the bonny scot had given full scope to the play of this small artillery of city wit by halting his stately pace and viewing grimly first the one assailant and then the other as if menacing either repartee or more violent revenge but phlegm or prudence got the better of his indignation and tossing his head as one who valued not the raillery to which he had been exposed he walked down fleet street pursued by the horselaugh of his tormentors  the scot will not fight till he see his own blood said tunstall whom his north of england extraction had made familiar with all manner of proverbs against those who lay yet farther north than himself  faith i know not said jenkin he looks dangerous that fellowhe will hit some one over the noddle before he goes farharkhark they are rising  accordingly the wellknown cry of prenticesprenticesclubs clubs now rang along fleet street and jenkin snatching up his weapon which lay beneath the counter ready at the slightest notice and calling to tunstall to take his bat and follow leaped over the hatchdoor which protected the outershop and ran as fast as he could towards the affray echoing the cry as he ran and elbowing or shoving aside whoever stood in his way his comrade first calling to his master to give an eye to the shop followed jenkins example and ran after him as fast as he could but with more attention to the safety and convenience of others while old david ramsay with hands and eyes uplifted a green apron before him and a glass which he had been polishing thrust into his bosom came forth to look after the safety of his goods and chattels knowing by old experience that when the cry of clubs once arose he would have little aid on the part of his apprentices      chapter ii     this sir is one among the seignory   has wealth at will and will to use his wealth   and wit to increase it marry his worst folly   lies in a thriftless sort of charity   that goes agadding sometimes after objects   which wise men will not see when thrust upon them                              the old couple  the ancient gentleman bustled about his shop in pettish displeasure at being summoned hither so hastily to the interruption of his more abstract studies and unwilling to renounce the train of calculation which he had put in progress he mingled whimsically with the fragments of the arithmetical operation his oratory to the passengers and angry reflections on his idle apprentices what dye lack sir madam what dye lackclocks for hall or

was interrupted by the entrance of a grave citizen of a most respectable appearance who saluting him familiarly by the name of davie my old acquaintance demanded what had put him so much out of sorts and gave him at the same time a cordial grasp of his hand  the strangers dress was though grave rather richer than usual his paned hose were of black velvet lined with purple silk which garniture appeared at the slashes his doublet was of purple cloth and his short cloak of black velvet to correspond with his hose and both were adorned with a great number of small silver buttons richly wrought in filigree a triple chain of gold hung round his neck and in place of a sword or dagger he wore at his belt an ordinary knife for the purpose of the table with a small silver case which appeared to contain writing materials he might have seemed some secretary or clerk engaged in the service of the public only that his low flat and unadorned cap and his wellblacked shining shoes indicated that he belonged to the city he was a wellmade man about the middle size and seemed in firm health though advanced in years his looks expressed sagacity and goodhumour and the air of respectability which his dress announced was well supported by his clear eye ruddy cheek and grey hair he used the scottish idiom in his first address but in such a manner that it could hardly be distinguished whether he was passing upon his friend a sort of jocose mockery or whether it was his own native dialect for his ordinary discourse had little provincialism  in answer to the queries of his respectable friend ramsay groaned heavily answering by echoing back the question what ails me master george why every thing ails me i profess to you that a man may as well live in fairyland as in the ward of farringdonwithout my apprentices are turned into mere goblinsthey appear and disappear like spunkies and have no more regularity in them than a watch without a scapement if there is a ball to be tossed up or a bullock to be driven mad or a quean to be ducked for scolding or a head to be broken jenkin is sure to be at the one end or the other of it and then away skips francis tunstall for company i think the prize fighters bearleaders and mountebanks are in a league against me my dear friend and that they pass my house ten times for any other in the city heres an italian fellow come over too that they call punchinello and altogether  well interrupted master george but what is all this to the present case  why replied ramsay here has been a cry of thieves or murder i hope that will prove the least of it amongst these english pock pudding swine and i have been interrupted in the deepest calculation ever mortal man plunged into master george  what man replied master george you must take patienceyou are a man that deals in time and can make it go fast and slow at pleasure you of all the world have least reason to complain if a little of it be lost now and thenbut here come your boys and bringing in a slain man betwixt them i thinkhere has been serious mischief i am afraid  the more mischief the better sport said the crabbed old watchmaker i am blithe though that its neither of the twa loons themselves what are ye bringing a corpse here for ye fause villains he added addressing the two apprentices who at the head of a considerable mob of their own class some of whom bore evident marks of a recent fray were carrying the body betwixt them  he is not dead yet sir answered tunstall  carry him into the apothecarys then replied his master dye think i can set a mans life in motion again as if he were a clock or a timepiece  for godsake old friend said his acquaintance let us have him here at the nearesthe seems only in a swoon  a swoon said ramsay and what business had he to swoon in the streets only if it will oblige my friend master george i would take in all the dead men in st dunstans parish call sam porter to look after the shop so saying the stunned man being the identical scotsman who had passed a short time before amidst the jeers of the apprentices was carried into the back shop of the artist and there placed in an armed chair till the apothecary from over the way came to his assistance this gentleman as sometimes happens to those of the learned professions had rather more lore than knowledge and began to talk of the sinciput and occiput and cerebrum and cerebellum until he exhausted david ramsays brief stock of patience  bellum bellellum he repeated with great indignation what signify all the bells in london if you do not put a plaster on the childs crown  master george with betterdirected zeal asked the apothecary whether bleeding might not be useful when after humming and hawing for a moment and being unable upon the spur of the occasion to suggest any thing else the man of pharmacy observed that it would at all events relieve the brain or cerebrum in case there was a tendency to the depositation of any extravasated blood to operate as a pressure upon that delicate organ  fortunately he was adequate to performing this operation and being powerfully aided by jenkin vincent who was learned in all cases of broken heads with plenty of cold water and a little vinegar applied according to the scientific method practised by the bottleholders in a modern ring the man began to raise himself on his chair draw his cloak tightly around him and look about like one who struggles to recover sense and recollection  he had better lie down on the bed in the little back closet said mr ramsays visitor who seemed perfectly familiar with the accommodations which the house afforded  he is welcome to my share of the truckle said jenkinfor in the said back closet were the two apprentices accommodated in one truckle bedi can sleep under the counter  so can i said tunstall and the poor fellow can have the bed all night  sleep said the apothecary is in the opinion of galen a restorative and febrifuge and is most naturally taken in a truckle bed  where a better cannot be come bysaid master george but these are two honest lads to give up their beds so willingly come off with his cloak and let us bear him to his couchi will send for dr irving the kings chirurgeonhe does not live far off and that shall be my share of the samaritans duty neighbour ramsay  well sir said the apothecary it is at your pleasure to send for other advice and i shall not object to consult with dr irving or any other medical person of skill neither to continue to furnish such drugs as may be needful from my pharmacopeia however whatever dr irving who i think hath had his degrees in edinburgh or dr any onebeside be he scottish or english may say to the contrary sleep taken timeously is a febrifuge or sedative and also a restorative  he muttered a few more learned words and concluded by informing ramsays friend in english far more intelligible than his latin that he would look to him as his paymaster for medicines care and attendance furnished or to be furnished to this party unknown  master george only replied by desiring him to send his bill for what he had already to charge and to give himself no farther trouble unless he heard from him the pharmacopolist who from discoveries made by the cloak falling a little aside had no great opinion of the faculty of this chance patient to make reimbursement had no sooner seen his case espoused by a substantial citizen than he showed some reluctance to quit possession of it and it needed a short and stern hint from master george which with all his goodhumour he was capable of expressing when occasion required to send to his own dwelling this esculapius of temple bar  when they were rid of mr raredrench the charitable efforts of jenkin and francis to divest the patient of his long grey cloak were firmly resisted on his own partmy life sunermy life suner he muttered in indistinct murmurs in these efforts to retain his upper garment which was too tender to resist much handling it gave way at length with a loud rent which almost threw the patient into a second syncope and he sat before them in his under garments the looped and repaired wretchedness of which moved at once pity and laughter and had certainly been the cause of his unwillingness to resign the mantle which like the virtue of charity served to cover so many imperfections  the man himself cast his eyes on his povertystruck garb and seemed so much ashamed of the disclosure that muttering between his teeth that he would be too late for his appointment he made an effort to rise and leave the shop which was easily prevented by jenkin vincent and his comrade who at the nod of master george laid hold of and detained him in his chair  the patient next looked round him for a moment and then said faintly in his broad northern languagewhat sort of usage ca ye this gentlemen to a stranger a sojourner in your town ye hae broken my headye hae riven my cloak and now ye are for restraining my personal liberty they were wiser than me he said after a moments pause that counselled me to wear my warst claithing in the streets of london and if i could have got ony things warse than these mean garmentswhich would have been very difficult said jin vin in a whisper to his companionthey would have been een ower gude for the grips o men sae little acquented with the laws of honest civility  to say the truth said jenkin unable to forbear any longer although the discipline of the times prescribed to those in his situation a degree of respectful distance and humility in the presence of parents masters or seniors of which the present age has no idea to say the truth the good gentlemans clothes look as if they would not brook much handling  hold your peace young man said master george with a tone of authority never mock the stranger or the poorthe black ox has not trod on your foot yetyou know not what lands you may travel in or what clothes you may wear before you die  vincent held down his head and stood rebuked but the stranger did not accept the apology which was made for him  i am a stranger sir said he that is certain though methinks that being such i have been somewhat familiarly treated in this town of yours but as for my being poor i think i need not be charged with poverty till i seek siller of somebody  the dear country all over said master george in a whisper to david ramsay pride and poverty  but david had taken out his tablets and silver pen and deeply immersed in calculations in which he rambled over all the terms of arithmetic from the simple unit to millions billions and trillions neither heard nor answered the observation of his friend who seeing his abstraction turned again to the scot  i fancy now jockey if a stranger were to offer you a noble you would chuck it back at his head  not if i could do him honest service for it sir said the scot i am willing to do what i may to be useful though i come of an honourable house and may be said to be in a sort indifferently weel provided for  ay said the interrogator and what house may claim the honour of your descent  an ancient coat belongs to it as the play says whispered vincent to his companion  come jockey out with it continued master george observing that the scot as usual with his countrymen when asked a blunt straightforward question took a little time before answering it  i am no more jockey sir than you are john said the stranger as if offended at being addressed by a name which at that time was used as sawney now is for a general appellative of the scottish nation my name if you must know it is richie moniplies and i come of the old and honourable house of castle collop weel kend at the westport of edinburgh  what is that you call the westport proceeded the interrogator  why an it like your honour said richie who now having recovered his senses sufficiently to observe the respectable exterior of master george threw more civility into his manner than at first the west port is a gate of our city as yonder brick arches at whitehall form the entrance of the kings palace here only that the westport is of stonern work and mair decorated with architecture and the policy of bigging  nouns man the whitehall gateways were planned by the great holbein answered master george i suspect your accident has jumbled your brains my good friend i suppose you will tell me next you have at edinburgh as fine a navigable river as the thames with all its shipping the thames exclaimed richie in a tone of ineffable contemptgod bless your honours judgment we have at edinburgh the waterofleith and the norloch  and the powburn and the quarryholes and the gusedub ye fause loon answered master george speaking scotch with a strong and natural emphasis it is such landloupers as you that with your falset and fair fashions bring reproach on our whole country  god forgie me sir said richie much surprised at finding the supposed southron converted into a native scot i took your honour for an englisher but i hope there was naething wrang in standing up for anes ain countrys credit in a strange land where all men cry her down  do you call it for your countrys credit to show that she has a lying puffing rascal for one of her children said master george but come man never look grave on itas you have found a countryman so you have found a friend if you deserve oneand especially if you answer me truly  i see nae gude it wad do me to speak ought else but truth said the worthy north briton  well thento begin said master george i suspect you are a son of old mungo moniplies the flesher at the westport  your honour is a witch i think said richie grinning  and how dared you sir to uphold him for a noble  i dinna ken sir said richie scratching his head i hear muckle of an earl of warwick in these southern partsguy i think his name wasand he has great reputation here for slaying dun cows and boars and such like and i am sure my father has killed more cows and boars not to mention bulls calves sheep ewes lambs and pigs than the haill baronage of england  go to you are a shrewd knave said master george charm your tongue and take care of saucy answers your father was an honest burgher and the deacon of his craft i am sorry to see his son in so poor a coat  indifferent sir said richie moniplies looking down on his garmentsvery indifferent but it is the wonted livery of poor burghers sons in our countryone of luckie wants bestowing upon us rest us patient the kings leaving scotland has taken all custom frae edinburgh and there is hay made at the cross and a dainty crop of fouats in the grassmarket there is as much grass grows where my fathers stall stood as might have been a good bite for the beasts he was used to kill  it is even too true said master george and while we make fortunes here our old neighbours and their families are starving at home this should be thought upon oftenerand how came you by that broken head richietell me honestly  troth sir ise no lee about the matter answered moniplies i was coming along the street here and ilk ane was at me with their jests and roguery so i thought to mysell ye are ower mony for me to mell with but let me catch ye in barfords park or at the fit of the vennel i could gar some of ye sing another sang sae ae auld hirpling deevil of a potter behoved just to step in my way and offer me a pig as he said just to put my scotch ointment in and i gave him a push as but natural and the tottering deevil coupit ower amang his ain pigs and damaged a score of them and then the reird raise and hadna these twa gentlemen helped me out of it murdered i suld hae been without remeid and as it was just when they got haud of my arm to have me out of the fray i got the lick that donnerit me from a left handed lighterman  master george looked to the apprentices as if to demand the truth of this story  it is just as he says sir replied jenkin only i heard nothing about pigsthe people said he had broke some crockery and thati beg pardon sirnobody could thrive within the kenning of a scot  well no matter what they said you were an honest fellow to help the weaker sideand you sirrah continued master george addressing his countryman will call at my house tomorrow morning agreeable to this direction  i will wait upon your honour said the scot bowing very low that is if my honourable master will permit me  thy master said georgehast thou any other master save want whose livery you say you wear  troth in one sense if it please your honour i serve twa masters said richie for both my master and me are slaves to that same beldam whom we thought to show our heels to by coming off from scotland so that you see sir i hold in a sort of black ward tenure as we call it in our country being the servant of a servant  and what is your masters name said master george and observing that richie hesitated he added nay do not tell me if it is a secret  a secret that there is little use in keeping said richie only ye ken that our northern stomachs are ower proud to call in witnesses to our distress no that my master is in mair than present pinch sir he added looking towards the two english apprentices having a large sum in the royal treasurythat is he continued in a whisper to master georgethe king is owing him a lot of siller but its ill getting at it its likemy master is the young lord glenvarloch  master george testified surprise at the nameyou one of the young lord glenvarlochs followers and in such a condition  troth and i am all the followers he has for the present that is and blithe wad i be if he were muckle better aff than i am though i were to bide as i am  i have seen his father with four gentlemen and ten lackeys at his heels said master george rustling in their laces and velvets well this is a changeful world but there is a better beyond itthe good old house of glenvarloch that stood by king and country five hundred years  your honour may say a thousand said the follower  i will say what i know to be true friend said the citizen and not a word moreyou seem well recovered nowcan you walk  bravely sir said richie it was but a bit dover i was bred at the westport and my cantle will stand a clour wad bring a stot down  where does your master lodge  we pit up an it like your honour replied the scot in a sma house at the fit of ane of the wynds that gang down to the waterside with a decent man john christie a shipchandler as they cat his father came from dundee i wotna the name of the wynd but its right anent the mickle kirk yonder and your honour will mind that we pass only by our familyname of simple mr nigel olifaunt as keeping ourselves retired for the present though in scotland we be called the lord nigel  it is wisely done of your master said the citizen i will find out your lodgings though your direction be none of the clearest so saying and slipping a piece of money at the same time into richie monipliess hand he bade him hasten home and get into no more affrays  i will take care of that now sir said richie with a look of importance having a charge about me and so wussing ye a weel with special thanks to these twa young gentlemen  i am no gentleman said jenkin flinging his cap on his head i am a tight london prentice and hope to be a freeman one day frank may write himself gentleman if he will  i was a gentleman once said tunstall and i hope i have done nothing to lose the name of one  weel weel as ye list said richie moniplies but i am mickle beholden to ye baithand i am not a hair the less like to bear it in mind that i say but little about it just nowgudenight to you my kind countryman so saying he thrust out of the sleeve of his ragged doublet a long bony hand and arm on which the muscles rose like whip cord master george shook it heartily while jenkin and frank exchanged sly looks with each other  richie moniplies would next have addressed his thanks to the master of the shop but seeing him as he afterwards said scribbling on his bit bookie as if he were demented he contented his politeness with giving him a hat touching that is his bonnet in token of salutation and so left the shop  now there goes scotch jockey with all his bad and good about him said master george to master david who suspended though unwillingly the calculations with which he was engaged and keeping his pen within an inch of the tablets gazed on his friend with great lacklustre eyes which expressed any thing rather than intelligence or interest in the discourse addressed to himthat fellow proceeded master george without heeding his friends state of abstraction shows with great liveliness of colouring how our scotch pride and poverty make liars and braggarts of us and yet the knave whose every third word to an englishman is a boastful lie will i warrant you be a true and tender friend and follower to his master and has perhaps parted with his mantle to him in the cold blast although he himself walked in cuerpo as the don saysstrange that courage and fidelityfor i will warrant that the knave is stoutshould have no better companion than this swaggering braggadocio humourbut you mark me not friend davie  i doi do most heedfully said daviefor as the sun goeth round the dialplate in twentyfour hours add for the moon fifty minutes and a half  you are in the seventh heavens man said his companion  i crave your pardon replied davielet the wheel a go round in twentyfour hoursi have itand the wheel b in twentyfour hours fifty minutes and a halffiftyseven being to fiftyfour as fifty nine to twentyfour hours fifty minutes and a half or very nearly i crave your forgiveness master george and heartily wish you good even  goodeven said master george why you have not wished me goodday yet come old friend lay by these tablets or you will crack the inner machinery of your skull as our friend yonder has got the outercase of his damagedgoodnight quotha i mean not to part with you so easily i came to get my four hours nunchion from you man besides a tune on the lute from my goddaughter mrs marget  good faith i was abstracted master georgebut you know me whenever i get amongst the wheels said mr ramsay why tis  lucky that you deal in small ones said his friend as awakened from his reveries and calculations ramsay led the way up a little backstair to the first storey occupied by his daughter and his little household  the apprentices resumed their places in the frontshop and relieved sam porter when jenkin said to tunstalldidst see frank how the old goldsmith cottoned in with his beggarly countryman when would one of his wealth have shaken hands so courteously with a poor englishmanwell ill say that for the best of the scots that they will go over head and ears to serve a countryman when they will not wet a nail of their finger to save a southron as they call us from drowning and yet master george is but halfbred scot neither in that respect for i have known him do many a kind thing to the english too  but hark ye jenkin said tunstall i think you are but halfbred english yourself how came you to strike on the scotsmans side after all  why you did so too answered vincent  ay because i saw you begin and besides it is no cumberland fashion to fall fifty upon one replied tunstall  and no christ church fashion neither said jenkin fair play and old england for everbesides to tell you a secret his voice had a twang in itin the dialect i meanreminded me of a little tongue which i think sweetersweeter than the last toll of st dunstans will sound on the day that i am shot of my indentureshayou guess who i mean frank  not i indeed answered tunstallscotch janet i suppose the laundress   off with janet in her own buckingbasketno no noyou blind buzzarddo you not know i mean pretty mrs marget  umph answered tunstall dryly  a flash of anger not unmingled with suspicion shot from jenkins keen black eyes  umphand what signifies umph i am not the first prentice has married his masters daughter i suppose  they kept their own secret i fancy said tunstall at least till they were out of their time  i tell you what it is frank answered jenkin sharply that may be the fashion of you gentlefolks that are taught from your biggin to carry two faces under the same hood but it shall never be mine  there are the stairs then said tunstall coolly go up and ask mrs marget of our master just now and see what sort of a face he will wear under his hood  no i wonnot answered jenkin i am not such a fool as that neither but i will take my own time and all the counts in cumberland shall not cut my comb and this is that which you may depend upon  francis made no reply and they resumed their usual attention to the business of the shop and their usual solicitations to the passengers     chapter iii   bobadil i pray you possess no gallant of your acquaintance with a knowledge of my lodging master matthew who i sirlord sir                                     ben jonson  the next morning found nigel olifaunt the young lord of glenvarloch seated sad and solitary in his little apartment in the mansion of john christie the shipchandler which that honest tradesman in gratitude perhaps to the profession from which he derived his chief support appeared to have constructed as nearly as possible upon the plan of a ships cabin  it was situated near to pauls wharf at the end of one of those intricate and narrow lanes which until that part of the city was swept away by the great fire in 1666 constituted an extraordinary labyrinth of small dark damp and unwholesome streets and alleys in one corner or other of which the plague was then as surely found lurking as in the obscure corners of constantinople in our own time but john christies house looked out upon the river and had the advantage therefore of free air impregnated however with the odoriferous fumes of the articles in which the shipchandler dealt with the odour of pitch and the natural scent of the ooze and sludge left by the reflux of the tide  upon the whole except that his dwelling did not float with the flood tide and become stranded with the ebb the young lord was nearly as comfortably accommodated as he was while on board the little trading brig from the long town of kirkaldy in fife by which he had come a passenger to london he received however every attention which could be paid him by his honest landlord john christie for richie moniplies had not thought it necessary to preserve his masters incognito so completely but that the honest shipchandler could form a guess that his guests quality was superior to his appearance  as for dame nelly his wife a round buxom laughterloving dame with black eyes a tight welllaced bodice a green apron and a red petticoat edged with a slight silver lace and judiciously shortened so as to show that a short heel and a tight clean ankle rested upon her wellburnished shoeshe of course felt interest in a young man who besides being very handsome goodhumoured and easily satisfied with the accommodations her house afforded was evidently of a rank as well as manners highly superior to the skippers or captains as they called themselves of merchant vessels who were the usual tenants of the apartments which she let to hire and at whose departure she was sure to find her wellscrubbed floor soiled with the relics of tobacco which spite of king jamess counterblast was then forcing itself into use and her best curtains impregnated with the odour of geneva and strong waters to dame nellys great indignation for as she truly said the smell of the shop and warehouse was bad enough without these additions  but all mr olifaunts habits were regular and cleanly and his address though frank and simple showed so much of the courtier and gentleman as formed a strong contrast with the loud halloo coarse jests and boisterous impatience of her maritime inmates dame nelly saw that her guest was melancholy also notwithstanding his efforts to seem contented and cheerful and in short she took that sort of interest in him without being herself aware of the extent which an unscrupulous gallant might have been tempted to improve to the prejudice of honest john who was at least a score of years older than his helpmate olifaunt however had not only other matters to think of but would have regarded such an intrigue had the idea ever occurred to him as an abominable and ungrateful encroachment upon the laws of hospitality his religion having been by his late father formed upon the strict principles of the national faith and his morality upon those of the nicest honour he had not escaped the predominant weakness of his country an overweening sense of the pride of birth and a disposition to value the worth and consequence of others according to the number and the fame of their deceased ancestors but this pride of family was well subdued and in general almost entirely concealed by his good sense and general courtesy  such as we have described him nigel olifaunt or rather the young lord glenvarloch was when our narrative takes him up under great perplexity respecting the fate of his trusty and only follower richard moniplies who had been dispatched by his young master early the preceding morning as far as the court at westminster but had not yet returned his evening adventures the reader is already acquainted with and so far knows more of richie than did his master who had not heard of him for twentyfour hours  dame nelly christie in the meantime regarded her guest with some anxiety and a great desire to comfort him if possible she placed on the breakfasttable a noble piece of cold powdered beef with its usual guards of turnip and carrot recommended her mustard as coming direct from her cousin at tewkesbury and spiced the toast with her own handsand with her own hands also drew a jug of stout and nappy ale all of which were elements of the substantial breakfast of the period  when she saw that her guests anxiety prevented him from doing justice to the good cheer which she set before him she commenced her career of verbal consolation with the usual volubility of those women in her station who conscious of good looks good intentions and good lungs entertain no fear either of wearying themselves or of fatiguing their auditors  now what the good year are we to send you down to scotland as thin as you came upi am sure it would be contrary to the course of nature there was my goodmans father old sandie christie i have heard he was an atomy when he came up from the north and i am sure he died saint barnaby was ten years at twenty stone weight i was a bareheaded girl at the time and lived in the neighbourhood though i had little thought of marrying john then who had a score of years the better of mebut he is a thriving man and a kind husbandand his father as i was saying died as fat as a churchwarden well sir but i hope i have not offended you for my little jokeand i hope the ale is to your honours likingand the beefand the mustard  all excellentall too good answered olifaunt you have every thing so clean and tidy dame that i shall not know how to live when i go back to my own countryif ever i go back there  this was added as it seemed involuntarily and with a deep sigh  i warrant your honour go back again if you like it said the dame unless you think rather of taking a pretty welldowered english lady as some of your countryfolk have done i assure you some of the best of the city have married scotsmen there was lady trebleplumb sir thomas trebleplumb the great turkey merchants widow married sir awley macauley whom your honour knows doubtless and pretty mistress doublefee old sergeant doublefees daughter jumped out of window and was married at mayfair to a scotsman with a hard name and old pitchpost the timber merchants daughters did little better for they married two irishmen and when folks jeer me about having a scotsman for lodger meaning your honour i tell them they are afraid of their daughters and their mistresses and sure i have a right to stand up for the scots since john christie is half a scotsman and a thriving man and a good husband though there is a score of years between us and so i would have your honour cast care away and mend your breakfast with a morsel and a draught  at a word my kind hostess i cannot said olifaunt i am anxious about this knave of mine who has been so long absent in this dangerous town of yours  it may be noticed in passing that dame nellys ordinary mode of consolation was to disprove the existence of any cause for distress and she is said to have carried this so far as to comfort a neighbour who had lost her husband with the assurance that the dear defunct would be better tomorrow which perhaps might not have proved an appropriate even if it had been a possible mode of relief  on this occasion she denied stoutly that richie had been absent altogether twenty hours and as for people being killed in the streets of london to be sure two men had been found in towerditch last week but that was far to the east and the other poor man that had his throat cut in the fields had met his mishap near by islington and he that was stabbed by the young templar in a drunken frolic by saint clements in the strand was an irishman all which evidence she produced to show that none of these casualties had occurred in a case exactly parallel with that of richie a scotsman and on his return from westminster  my better comfort is my good dame answered olifaunt that the lad is no brawler or quarreller unless strongly urged and that he has nothing valuable about him to any one but me  your honour speaks very well retorted the inexhaustible hostess who protracted her task of taking away and putting to rights in order that she might prolong her gossip ill uphold master moniplies to be neither reveller nor brawler for if he liked such things he might be visiting and junketing with the young folks about here in the neighbourhood and he never dreams of it and when i asked the young man to go as far as my gossips dame drinkwater to taste a glass of aniseed and a bit of the groaning cheesefor dame drinkwater has had twins as i told your honour sirand i meant it quite civilly to the young man but he chose to sit and keep house with john christie and i dare say there is a score of years between them for your honours servant looks scarce much older than i am i wonder what they could have to say to each other i asked john christie but he bid me go to sleep  if he comes not soon said his master i will thank you to tell me what magistrate i can address myself to for besides my anxiety for the poor fellows safety he has papers of importance about him  o your honour may be assured he will be back in a quarter of an hour said dame nelly he is not the lad to stay out twentyfour hours at a stretch and for the papers i am sure your honour will pardon him for just giving me a peep at the corner as i was giving him a small cup not so large as my thimble of distilled waters to fortify his stomach against the damps and it was directed to the kings most excellent majesty and so doubtless his majesty has kept richie out of civility to consider of your honours letter and send back a fitting reply  dame nelly here hit by chance on a more available topic of consolation than those she had hitherto touched upon for the youthful lord had himself some vague hopes that his messenger might have been delayed at court until a fitting and favourable answer should be dispatched back to him inexperienced however in public affairs as he certainly was it required only a moments consideration to convince him of the improbability of an expectation so contrary to all he had heard of etiquette as well as the dilatory proceedings in a  court suit and he answered the goodnatured hostess with a sigh that he doubted whether the king would even look on the paper addressed to him far less take it into his immediate consideration  now out upon you for a fainthearted gentleman said the good dame and why should he not do as much for us as our gracious queen elizabeth many people say this and that about a queen and a king but i think a king comes more natural to us english folks and this good gentleman goes as often down by water to greenwich and employs as many of the bargemen and watermen of all kinds and maintains in his royal grace john taylor the waterpoet who keeps both a sculler and a pair of oars and he has made a comely court at whitehall just by the river and since the king is so good a friend to the thames i cannot see if it please your honour why all his subjects and your honour in specialty should not have satisfaction by his hands  true dametruelet us hope for the best but i must take my cloak and rapier and pray your husband in courtesy to teach me the way to a magistrate  sure sir said the prompt dame i can do that as well as he who has been a slow man of his tongue all his life though i will give him his due for being a loving husband and a man as well to pass in the world as any betwixt us and the top of the lane and so there is the sitting alderman that is always at the guildhall which is close by pauls and so i warrant you he puts all to rights in the city that wisdom can mend and for the rest there is no help but patience but i wish i were as sure of forty pounds as i am that the young man will come back safe and sound  olifaunt in great and anxious doubt of what the good dame so strongly averred flung his cloak on one shoulder and was about to belt on his rapier when first the voice of richie moniplies on the stair and then that faithful emissarys appearance in the chamber put the matter beyond question dame nelly after congratulating moniplies on his return and paying several compliments to her own sagacity for having foretold it was at length pleased to leave the apartment the truth was that besides some instinctive feelings of good breeding which combated her curiosity she saw there was no chance of richies proceeding in his narrative while she was in the room and she therefore retreated trusting that her own address would get the secret out of one or other of the young men when she should have either by himself  now in heavens name what is the matter said nigel olifaunt where have you been or what have you been about you look as pale as death there is blood on your hand and your clothes are torn what barnsbreaking have you been at you have been drunk richard and fighting  fighting i have been said richard in a small way but for being drunk thats a job ill to manage in this town without money to come by liquor and as for barnsbreaking the deil a things broken but my head its not made of iron i wot nor my claithes of chenziemail so a club smashed the tane and a claught damaged the tither some misleard rascals abused my country but i think i cleared the causey of them however the haill hive was ower mony for me at last and i got this eclipse on the crown and then i was carried beyond my kenning to a sma booth at the temple port whare they sell the whirligigs and monygorounds that measure out time as a man wad measure a tartan web and then they bled me wold i nold i and were reasonably civil especially an auld countryman of ours of whom more hereafter  and at what oclock might this be said nigel  the twa iron carles yonder at the kirk beside the port were just banging out sax o the clock  and why came you not home as soon as you recovered said nigel  in troth my lord every why has its wherefore and this has a gude ane answered his follower to come hame i behoved to ken whare hame was now i had clean tint the name of the wynd and the mair i asked the mair the folk leugh and the farther they sent me wrang sae i gave it up till god should send daylight to help me and as i saw mysell near a kirk at the lang run i een crap in to take up my nights quarters in the kirkyard  in the churchyard said nigelbut i need not ask what drove you to such a pinch  it wasna sae much the want o siller my lord nigel said richie with an air of mysterious importance for i was no sae absolute without means of whilk mair anon but i thought i wad never ware a saxpence sterling on ane of their saucy chamberlains at a hostelry sae lang as i could sleep fresh and fine in a fair dry spring night mony a time when i hae come hame ower late and faund the westport steekit and the waiter illwilly i have garrd the sexton of saint cuthberts calfward serve me for my quarters but then there are dainty green graffs in saint cuthberts kirkyard whare ane may sleep as if they were in a downbed till they hear the lavrock singing up in the air as high as the castle whereas and behold these london kirkyards are causeyed with throughstanes panged hard and fast thegither and my cloak being something threadbare made but a thin mattress so i was fain to give up my bed before every limb about me was crippled dead folks may sleep yonder sound enow but deil haet else  and what became of you next said his master  i just took to a canny bulkhead as they ca them here that is the boards on the tap of their bits of outshots of stalls and booths and there i sleepit as sound as if i was in a castle not but i was disturbed with some of the nightwalking queans and swaggering billies but when they found there was nothing to be got by me but a slash of my andrew ferrara they bid me goodnight for a beggarly scot and i was een weel pleased to be sae cheap rid of them and in the morning i cam daikering here but sad wark i had to find the way for i had been east as far as the place they ca mileend though it is mair like saxmileend  well richie answered nigel i am glad all this has ended so well go get something to eat i am sure you need it  in troth do i sir replied moniplies but with your lordships leave  forget the lordship for the present richie as i have often told you before  faith replied richie i could weel forget that your honour was a lord but then i behoved to forget that i am a lords man and thats not so easy but however he added assisting his description with the thumb and the two forefingers of his right hand thrust out after the fashion of a birds claw while the little finger and ringfinger were closed upon the palm to the court i went and my friend that promised me a sight of his majestys most gracious presence was as gude as his word and carried me into the back offices where i got the best breakfast i have had since we came here and it did me gude for the rest of the day for as to what i have eaten in this accursed town it is aye sauced with the disquieting thought that it maun be paid for after a there was but beef banes and fat brose but kings cauff your honour kens is better than ither folks corn at ony rate it was a in free awmousbut i see he added stopping short that your honour waxes impatient  by no means richie said the young nobleman with an air of resignation for he well knew his domestic would not mend his pace for goading you have suffered enough in the embassy to have a right to tell the story in your own way only let me pray for the name of the friend who was to introduce you into the kings presence you were very mysterious on the subject when you undertook through his means to have the supplication put into his majestys own hands since those sent heretofore i have every reason to think went no farther than his secretarys  weel my lord said richie i did not tell you his name and quality at first because i thought you would be affronted at the like of him having to do in your lordships affairs but mony a man climbs up in court by waur help it was just laurie linklater one of the yeomen of the kitchen that was my fathers apprentice lang syne  a yeoman in the kitchena scullion exclaimed lord nigel pacing the room in displeasure  but consider sir said richie composedly that a your great friends hung back and shunned to own you or to advocate your petition and then though i am sure i wish laurie a higher office for your lordships sake and for mine and specially for his ain sake being a friendly lad yet your lordship must consider that a scullion if a yeoman of the kings most royal kitchen may be called a scullion may weel rank with a mastercook elsewhere being that kings cauff as i said before is better than  you are right and i was wrong said the young nobleman i have no choice of means of making my case known so that they be honest  laurie is as honest a lad as ever lifted a ladle said richie not but what i dare to say he can lick his fingers like other folk and reason good but in fine for i see your honour is waxing impatient he brought me to the palace where a was astir for the king going out to hunt or hawk on blackheath i think they cad it and there was a horse stood with all the quarries about it a bonny grey as ever was foaled and the saddle and the stirrups and the curb and bit o burning gowd or silver gilded at least and down sir came the king with all his nobles dressed out in his huntingsuit of green doubly laced and laid down with gowd i minded the very face o him though it was lang since i saw him but my certie lad thought i times are changed since ye came fleeing down the back stairs of auld holyrood house in grit fear having your breeks in your hand without time to put them on and frank stewart the wild earl of bothwell hard at your haunches and if auld lord glenvarloch hadna cast his mantle about his arm and taken bluidy wounds mair than ane in your behalf you wald not have crawd sae crouse this day and so saying i could not but think your lordships sifflication could not be less than most acceptable and so i banged in among the crowd of lords laurie thought me mad and held me by the cloaklap till the cloth rave in his hand and so i banged in right before the king just as he mounted and crammed the sifflication into his hand and he opened it like in amaze and just as he saw the first line i was minded to make a reverence and i had the ill luck to hit his jaud o a beast on the nose with my hat and scaur the creature and she swarved aside and the king that sits na mickle better than a draffpock on the saddle was like to have gotten a clean coup and that might have cost my craig a raxingand he flung down the paper amang the beasts feet and cried away wi the fause loon that brought it and they grippit me and cried treason and i thought of the ruthvens that were dirked in their ain house for it may be as small a forfeit however they spak only of scourging me and had me away to the porters lodge to try the tawse on my back and i was crying mercy as loud as i could and the king when he had righted himself on the saddle and gathered his breath cried to do me nae harm for said he he is ane of our ain norland stots i ken by the rowt of himand they a laughed and rowted loud eneugh and then he said gie him a copy of the proclamation and let him go down to the north by the next light collier before waur come ot so they let me go and rode out a sniggering laughing and rounding in ilk ithers lugs a sair life i had wi laurie linklater for he said it wad be the ruin of him and then when i told him it was in your matter he said if he had known before he would have risked a scauding for you because he minded the brave old lord your father and then he showed how i suld have done and that i suld have held up my hand to my brow as if the grandeur of the king and his horsegraith thegither had casten the glaiks in my een and mair jackanape tricks i suld hae played instead of offering the sifflication he said as if i had been bringing guts to a bear footnote i am certain this prudential advice is not original on mr linklaters part but i am not at present able to produce my authority i think it amounted to this that james flung down a petition presented by some supplicant who paid no compliments to his horse and expressed no admiration at the splendour of his furniture saying shall a king cumber himself about the petition of a beggar while the beggar disregards the kings splendour it is i think sir john harrington who recommends as a sure mode to the kings favour to praise the paces of the royal palfrey  for said he richie the king is a weelnatured and just man of his ain kindly nature but he has a wheen maggots that maun be cannily guided and then richie says he in a very laigh tone i would tell it to nane but a wise man like yoursell but the king has them about him wad corrupt an angel from heaven but i could have gien you avisement how to have guided him but now its like after meat mustardaweel aweel laurie said i it may be as you say but since i am clear of the tawse and the porters lodge sifflicate wha like deil hae richie moniplies if he come sifflicating here again and so away i came and i wasna far by the temple port or bar or whatever they ca it when i met with the misadventure that i tauld you of before  well my honest richie said lord nigel your attempt was well meant and not so ill conducted i think as to have deserved so bad an issue but go to your beef and mustard and well talk of the rest afterwards  there is nae mair to be spoken sir said his follower except that i met ane very honest fairspoken weelputon gentleman or rather burgher as i think that was in the whigmaleery mans backshop and when he learned wha i was behold he was a kindly scot himsell and what is more a townsbairn o the gude town and he behoved to compel me to take this portugal piece to drink forsoothmy certie thought i we ken better for we will eat itand he spoke of paying your lordship a visit  you did not tell him where i lived you knave said the lord nigel angrily sdeath i shall have every clownish burgher from edinburgh come to gaze on my distress and pay a shilling for having seen the motion of the poor noble  tell him where you lived said richie evading the question how could i tell him what i kendna mysell if i had minded the name of the wynd i need not have slept in the kirkyard yestreen  see then that you give no one notice of our lodging said the young nobleman those with whom i have business i can meet at pauls or in the court of requests  this is steeking the stabledoor when the steed is stolen thought richie to himself but i must put him on another pin  so thinking he asked the young lord what was in the proclamation which he still held folded in his hand for having little time to spell at it said he your lordship well knows i ken nought about it but the grand blazon at the tapthe lion has gotten a claught of our auld scottish shield now but it was as weel upheld when it had a unicorn on ilk side of it  lord nigel read the proclamation and he coloured deep with shame and indignation as he read for the purport was to his injured feelings like the pouring of ardent spirits upon a recent wound  what deils in the paper my lord said richie unable to suppress his curiosity as he observed his master change colour i wadna ask such a thing only the proclamation is not a private thing but is meant for a mens hearing  it is indeed meant for all mens hearing replied lord nigel and it proclaims the shame of our country and the ingratitude of our prince  now the lord preserve us and to publish it in london too ejaculated moniplies  hark ye richard said nigel olifaunt in this paper the lords of the council set forth that in consideration of the resort of idle persons of low condition forth from his majestys kingdom of scotland to his english courtfilling the same with their suits and supplications and dishonouring the royal presence with their base poor and beggarly persons to the disgrace of their country in the estimation of the english these are to prohibit the skippers masters of vessels and others in every part of scotland from bringing such miserable creatures up to court under pain of fine and impisonment  i marle the skipper took us on board said richie  then you need not marvel how you are to get back again said lord nigel for here is a clause which says that such idle suitors are to be transported back to scotland at his majestys expense and punished for their audacity with stripes stocking or incarceration according to their demeritsthat is to say i suppose according to the degree of their poverty for i see no other demerit specified  this will scarcely said richie square with our old proverb       a kings face      should give grace  but what says the paper farther my lord  o only a small clause which especially concerns us making some still heavier denunciations against those suitors who shall be so bold as to approach the court under pretext of seeking payment of old debts due to them by the king which the paper states is of all species of importunity that which is most odious to his majesty  the king has neighbours in that matter said richie but it is not every one that can shift off that sort of cattle so easily as he does  their conversation was here interrupted by a knocking at the door olifaunt looked out at the window and saw an elderly respectable person whom he knew not richie also peeped and recognised but recognising chose not to acknowledge his friend of the preceding evening afraid that his share in the visit might be detected he made his escape out of the apartment under pretext of going to his breakfast and left their landlady the task of ushering master george into lord nigels apartment which she performed with much courtesy     chapter iv     ay sir the clouted shoe hath oft times craft int   as says the rustic proverb and your citizen   ins grogram suit gold chain and wellblackd shoes   bears under his flat cap ofttimes a brain   wiser than burns beneath the cap and feather   or seethes within the statesmans velvet nightcap                                read me my riddle  the young scottish nobleman received the citizen with distant politeness expressing that sort of reserve by which those of the higher ranks are sometimes willing to make a plebeian sensible that he is an intruder but master george seemed neither displeased nor disconcerted he assumed the chair which in deference to his respectable appearance lord nigel offered to him and said after a moments pause during which he had looked attentively at the young man with respect not unmingled with emotionyou will forgive me for this rudeness my lord but i was endeavouring to trace in your youthful countenance the features of my good old lord your excellent father  there was a moments pause ere young glenvarloch replied still with a reserved manneri have been reckoned like my father sir and am happy to see any one that respects his memory but the business which calls me to this city is of a hasty as well as a private nature and  i understand the hint my lord said master george and would not be guilty of long detaining you from business or more agreeable conversation my errand is almost done when i have said that my name is george heriot warmly befriended and introduced into the employment of the royal family of scotland more than twenty years since by your excellent father and that learning from a follower of yours that your lordship was in this city in prosecution of some business of importance it is my dutyit is my pleasureto wait on the son of my respected patron and as i am somewhat known both at the court and in the city to offer him such aid in the furthering of his affairs as my credit and experience may be able to afford  i have no doubt of either master heriot said lord nigel and i thank you heartily for the goodwill with which you have placed them at a strangers disposal but my business at court is done and ended and i intend to leave london and indeed the island for foreign travel and military service i may add that the suddenness of my departure occasions my having little time at my disposal  master heriot did not take the hint but sat fast with an embarrassed countenance however like one who had something to say that he knew not exactly how to make effectual at length he said with a dubious smile you are fortunate my lord in having so soon dispatched your business at court your talking landlady informs me you have been but a fortnight in this city it is usually months and years ere the court and a suitor shake hands and part  my business said lord nigel with a brevity which was intended to stop further discussion was summarily dispatched  still master heriot remained seated and there was a cordial good humour added to the reverence of his appearance which rendered it impossible for lord nigel to be more explicit in requesting his absence  your lordship has not yet had time said the citizen still attempting to sustain the conversation to visit the places of amusementthe playhouses and other places to which youth resort but i see in your lordships hand one of the newinvented plots of the piece footnote meaning probably playbills which they hand about of latemay i ask what play  oh a wellknown piece said lord nigel impatiently throwing down the proclamation which he had hitherto been twisting to and fro in his handan excellent and wellapproved piecea new way to pay old debts  master heriot stooped down saying ah my old acquaintance philip massinger but having opened the paper and seen the purport he looked at lord nigel with surprise saying i trust your lordship does not think this prohibition can extend either to your person or your claims i should scarce have thought so myself said the young nobleman but so it proves his majesty to close this discourse at once has been pleased to send me this proclamation in answer to a respectful supplication for the repayment of large loans advanced by my father for the service of the state in the kings utmost emergencies  it is impossible said the citizenit is absolutely impossible if the king could forget what was due to your fathers memory still he would not have wishedwould not i may say have daredto be so flagrantly unjust to the memory of such a man as your father who dead in the body will long live in the memory of the scottish people i should have been of your opinion answered lord  nigel in the same tone as before but there is no fighting with facts  what was the tenor of this supplication said heriot or by whom was it presented something strange there must have been in the contents or else  you may see my original draught said the young lord taking it out of a small travelling strongbox the technical part is by my lawyer in scotland a skilful and sensible man the rest is my own drawn i hope with due deference and modesty  master heriot hastly cast his eye over the draught nothing he said can be more welltempered and respectful is it possible the king can have treated this petition with contempt  he threw it down on the pavement said the lord of glenvarloch and sent me for answer that proclamation in which he classes me with the paupers and mendicants from scotland who disgrace his court in the eyes of the proud englishthat is all had not my father stood by him with heart sword and fortune he might never have seen the court of england himself  but by whom was this supplication presented my lord said heriot for the distaste taken at the messenger will sometimes extend itself to the message  by my servant said the lord nigel by the man you saw and i think were kind to  by your servant my lord said the citizen he seems a shrewd fellow and doubtless a faithful but surely  you would say said lord nigel he is no fit messenger to a kings presencesurely he is not but what could i do every attempt i had made to lay my case before the king had miscarried and my petitions got no farther than the budgets of clerks and secretaries this fellow pretended he had a friend in the household that would bring him to the kings presenceand so  i understand said heriot but my lord why should you not in right of your rank and birth have appeared at court and required an audience which could not have been denied to you  the young lord blushed a little and looked at his dress which was very plain and though in perfect good order had the appearance of having seen service  i know not why i should be ashamed of speaking the truth he said after a momentary hesitationi had no dress suitable for appearing at court i am determined to incur no expenses which i cannot discharge and i think you sir would not advise me to stand at the palacedoor in person and deliver my petition along with those who are in very deed pleading their necessity and begging an alms  that had been indeed unseemly said the citizen but yet my lord my mind runs strangely that there must be some mistakecan i speak with your domestic  i see little good it can do answered the young lord but the interest you take in my misfortunes seems sincere and therefore he stamped on the floor and in a few seconds afterwards moniplies appeared wiping from his beard and mustaches the crumbs of bread and the froth of the alepot which plainly showed how he had been employedwill your lordship grant permission said heriot that i ask your groom a few questions his lordships page master george answered moniplies with a nod of acknowledgment if you are minded to speak according to the letter  hold your saucy tongue said his master and reply distinctly to the questions you are to be asked  and truly if it like your pageship said the citizen for you may remember i have a gift to discover falset  weel weel weel replied the domestic somewhat embarrassed in spite of his effronterythough i think that the sort of truth that serves my master may weel serve ony ane else  pages lie to their masters by right of custom said the citizen and you write yourself in that band though i think you be among the oldest of such springalds but to me you must speak truth if you would not have it end in the whippingpost  and thats een a bad restingplace said the wellgrown page so come away with your questions master george  well then demanded the citizen i am given to understand that you yesterday presented to his majestys hand a supplication or petition from this honourable lord your master  troth theres nae gainsaying that sir replied moniplies there were enow to see it besides me  and you pretend that his majesty flung it from him with contempt said the citizen take heed for i have means of knowing the truth and you were better up to the neck in the norloch which you like so well than tell a leasing where his majestys name is concerned  there is nae occasion for leasingmaking about the matter answered moniplies firmly his majesty een flung it frae him as if it had dirtied his fingers  you hear sir said olifaunt addressing heriot  hush said the sagacious citizen this fellow is not ill namedhe has more plies than one in his cloak stay fellow for moniplies muttering somewhat about finishing his breakfast was beginning to shamble towards the door answer me this farther questionwhen you gave your masters petition to his majesty gave you nothing with it  ou what should i give wi it ye ken master george  that is what i desire and insist to know replied his interrogator  weel theni am not free to say that maybe i might not just slip into the kings hand a wee bit sifflication of mine ain along with my lordsjust to save his majesty troubleand that he might consider them baith at ance  a supplication of your own you varlet said his master  ou dear ay my lord said richiepuir bodies hae their bits of sifflications as weel as their betters  and pray what might your worshipful petition import said master heriotnay for heavens sake my lord keep your patience or we shall never learn the truth of this strange matterspeak out sirrah and i will stand your friend with my lord  its a lang story to tellbut the upshot is that its a scrape of an auld accompt due to my fathers yestate by her majesty the kings maist gracious mother when she lived in the castle and had sundry providings and furnishings forth of our booth whilk nae doubt was an honour to my father to supply and whilk doubtless it will be a credit to his majesty to satisfy as it will be grit convenience to me to receive the saam  what string of impertinence is this said his master  every word as true as eer john knox spoke said richie heres the bit double of the sifflication  master george took a crumpled paper from the fellows hand and said muttering betwixt his teethhumbly showethumumhis majestys maist gracious motherumumjustly addebted and owing the sum of fifteen merksthe compt whereof followethtwelve nowtes feet for jelliesane lamb being christmasane roasted capin in grease for the privy chalmer when my lord of bothwell suppit with her gracei think my lord you can hardly be surprised that the king gave this petition a brisk reception and i conclude master page that you took care to present your own supplication before your masters  troth did i not answered moniplies i thought to have given my lords first as was reason gude and besides that it wad have redd the gate for my ain little bill but what wi the dirdum an confusion an the loupin here and there of the skeigh brute of a horse i believe i crammed them baith into his hand cheekbyjowl and maybe my ain was bunemost and say there was aught wrang i am sure i had a the fright and a the risk  and shall have all the beating you rascal knave said nigel am i to be insulted and dishonoured by your pragmatical insolence in blending your base concerns with mine  nay nay nay my lord said the goodhumoured citizen interposing i have been the means of bringing the fellows blunder to light allow me interest enough with your lordship to be bail for his bones you have cause to be angry but still i think the knave mistook more out of conceit than of purpose and i judge you will have the better service of him another time if you overlook this faultget you gone sirrahill make your peace  na na said moniplies keeping his ground firmly if he likes to strike a lad that has followed him for pure love for i think there has been little servants fee between us a the way frae scotland just let my lord be doing and see the credit he will get by itand i would rather mony thanks to you though master george stand by a lick of his baton than it suld eer be said a stranger came between us  go then said his master and get out of my sight  aweel i wot that is sune done said moniplies retiring slowly i did not come without i had been cad forand i wad have been away half an hour since with my gude will only maister george keepit me to answer his interrogation forsooth and that has made a this stir  and so he made his grumbling exit with the tone much rather of one who has sustained an injury than who has done wrong  there never was a man so plagued as i am with a malapert knavethe fellow is shrewd and i have found him faithfuli believe he loves me too and he has given proofs of itbut then he is so uplifted in his own conceit so selfwilled and so selfopinioned that he seems to become the master and i the man and whatever blunder he commits he is sure to make as loud complaints as if the whole error lay with me and in no degree with himself  cherish him and maintain him nevertheless said the citizen for believe my grey hairs that affection and fidelity are now rarer qualities in a servitor than when the world was younger yet trust him my good lord with no commission above his birth or breeding for you see yourself how it may chance to fall  it is but too evident master heriot said the young nobleman and i am sorry i have done injustice to my sovereign and your master but i am like a true scotsman wise behind handthe mistake has happenedmy supplication has been refused and my only resource is to employ the rest of my means to carry moniplies and myself to some counterscarp and die in the battlefront like my ancestors  it were better to live and serve your country like your noble father my lord replied master george nay nay never look down or shake your headthe king has not refused your supplication for he has not seen ityou ask but justice and that his place obliges him to give to his subjectsay my lord and i will say that his natural temper doth in this hold bias with his duty  i were well pleased to think so and yet said nigel olifaunt i speak not of my own wrongs but my country hath many that are unredressed  my lord said master heriot i speak of my royal master not only with the respect due from a subjectthe gratitude to be paid by a favoured servant but also with the frankness of a free and loyal scotsman the king is himself well disposed to hold the scales of justice even but there are those around him who can throw without detection their own selfish wishes and base interests into the scale you are already a sufferer by this and without your knowing it  i am surprised master heriot said the young lord to hear you upon so short an acquaintance talk as if you were familiarly acquainted with my affairs  my lord replied the goldsmith the nature of my employment affords me direct access to the interior of the palace i am well known to be no meddler in intrigues or party affairs so that no favourite has as yet endeavoured to shut against me the door of the royal closet on the contrary i have stood well with each while he was in power and i have not shared the fall of any but i cannot be thus connected with the court without hearing even against my will what wheels are in motion and how they are checked or forwarded of course when i choose to seek such intelligence i know the sources in which it is to be traced i have told you why i was interested in your lordships fortunes it was last night only that i knew you were in this city yet i have been able in coming hither this morning to gain for you some information respecting the impediments to your suit  sir i am obliged by your zeal however little it may be merited answered nigel still with some reserve yet i hardly know how i have deserved this interest  first let me satisfy you that it is real said the citizen i blame you not for being unwilling to credit the fair professions of a stranger in my inferior class of society when you have met so little friendship from relations and those of your own rank bound to have assisted you by so many ties but mark the cause there is a mortgage over your fathers extensive estate to the amount of 40000 merks due ostensibly to peregrine peterson the conservator of scottish privileges at campvere  i know nothing of a mortgage said the young lord but there is a wadset for such a sum which if unredeemed will occasion the forfeiture of my whole paternal estate for a sum not above a fourth of its valueand it is for that very reason that i press the kings government for a settlement of the debts due to my father that i may be able to redeem my land from this rapacious creditor  a wadset in scotland said heriot is the same with a mortgage on this side of the tweed but you are not acquainted with your real creditor the conservator peterson only lends his name to shroud no less a man than the lord chancellor of scotland who hopes under cover of this debt to gain possession of the estate himself or perhaps to gratify a yet more powerful third party he will probably suffer his creature peterson to take possession and when the odium of the transaction shall be forgotten the property and lordship of glenvarloch will be conveyed to the great man by his obsequious instrument under cover of a sale or some similar device  can this be possible said lord nigel the chancellor wept when i took leave of himcalled me his cousineven his sonfurnished me with letters and though i asked him for no pecuniary assistance excused himself unnecessarily for not pressing it on me alleging the expenses of his rank and his large family no i cannot believe a nobleman would carry deceit so far  i am not it is true of noble blood said the citizen but once more i bid you look on my grey hairs and think what can be my interest in dishonouring them with falsehood in affairs in which i have no interest save as they regard the son of my benefactor reflect also have you had any advantage from the lord chancellors letters  none said nigel olifaunt except cold deeds and fair words i have thought for some time their only object was to get rid of meone yesterday pressed money on me when i talked of going abroad in order that i might not want the means of exiling myself  right said heriot rather than you fled not they would themselves furnish wings for you to fly withal  i will to him this instant said the incensed youth and tell him my mind of his baseness  under your favour said heriot detaining him you shall not do so by a quarrel you would become the ruin of me your informer and though i would venture half my shop to do your lordship a service i think you would hardly wish me to come by damage when it can be of no service to you  the word shop sounded harshly in the ear of the young nobleman who replied hastilydamage sirso far am i from wishing you to incur damage that i would to heaven you would cease your fruitless offers of serving one whom there is no chance of ultimately assisting  leave me alone for that said the citizen you have now erred as far on the bowhand permit me to take this supplicationi will have it suitably engrossed and take my own time and it shall be an early one for placing it with more prudence i trust than that used by your follower in the kings handi will almost answer for his taking up the matter as you would have himbut should he fail to do so even then i will not give up the good cause  sir said the young nobleman your speech is so friendly and my own state so helpless that i know not how to refuse your kind proffer even while i blush to accept it at the hands of a stranger  we are i trust no longer such said the goldsmith and for my guerdon when my mediation proves successful and your fortunes are reestablished you shall order your first cupboard of plate from george heriot  you would have a bad paymaster master heriot said lord nigel  i do not fear that replied the goldsmith and i am glad to see you smile my lordmethinks it makes you look still more like the good old lord your father and it emboldens me besides to bring out a small requestthat you would take a homely dinner with me tomorrow i lodge hard by in lombard street for the cheer my lord a mess of white broth a fat capon well larded a dish of beef collops for auld scotlands sake and it may be a cup of right old wine that was barrelled before scotland and england were one nationthen for company one or two of our own loving countrymenand maybe my housewife may find out a bonny scots lass or so  i would accept your courtesy master heriot said nigel but i hear the city ladies of london like to see a man gallanti would not like to let down a scottish nobleman in their ideas as doubtless you have said the best of our poor country and i rather lack the means of bravery for the present  my lord your frankness leads me a step farther said master george ii owed your father some monies andnay if your lordship looks at me so fixedly i shall never tell my storyand to speak plainly for i never could carry a lie well through in my lifeit is most fitting that to solicit this matter properly your lordship should go to court in a manner beseeming your quality i am a goldsmith and live by lending money as well as by selling plate i am ambitious to put an hundred pounds to be at interest in your hands till your affairs are settled  and if they are never favourably settled said nigel  then my lord returned the citizen the miscarriage of such a sum will be of little consequence to me compared with other subjects of regret  master heriot said the lord nigel your favour is generously offered and shall be frankly accepted i must presume that you see your way through this business though i hardly do for i think you would be grieved to add any fresh burden to me by persuading me to incur debts which i am not likely to discharge i will therefore take your money under the hope and trust that you will enable me to repay you punctually  i will convince you my lord said the goldsmith that i mean to deal with you as a creditor from whom i expect payment and therefore you shall with your own good pleasure sign an acknowledgment for these monies and an obligation to content and repay me  he then took from his girdle his writing materials and writing a few lines to the purport he expressed pulled out a small bag of gold from a sidepouch under his cloak and observing that it should contain an hundred pounds proceeded to tell out the contents very methodically upon the table nigel olifaunt could not help intimating that this was an unnecessary ceremonial and that he would take the bag of gold on the word of his obliging creditor but this was repugnant to the old mans forms of transacting business  bear with me he said my good lordwe citizens are a wary and thrifty generation and i should lose my good name for ever within the toll of pauls were i to grant quittance or take acknowledgment without bringing the money to actual tale i think it be right now and body of me he said looking out at the window yonder come my boys with my mule for i must westward hoe put your monies aside my lord it is not well to be seen with such goldfinches chirping about one in the lodgings of london i think the lock of your casket be indifferent good if not i can serve you at an easy rate with one that has held thousandsit was the good old sir faithful frugals his spendthrift son sold the shell when he had eaten the kerneland there is the end of a cityfortune  i hope yours will make a better termination master heriot said the lord nigel  i hope it will my lord said the old man with a smile but to use honest john bunyans phrasetherewithal the water stood in his eyes it has pleased god to try me with the loss of two children and for one adopted shild who ivesah woe is me and welladay but i am patient and thankful and for the wealth god has sent me it shall not want inheritors while there are orphan lads in auld reekiei wish you goodmorrow my lord  one orphan has cause to thank you already said nigel as he attended him to the door of his chamber where resisting further escort the old citizen made his escape  as in going downstairs he passed the shop where dame christie stood becking he made civil inquiries after her husband the dame of course regretted his absence but he was down she said at deptford to settle with a dutch shipmaster  our way of business sir she said takes him much from home and my husband must be the slave of every tarry jacket that wants but a pound of oakum  all business must be minded dame said the goldsmith make my remembrancesgeorge heriot of lombard streets remembrancesto your goodman i have dealt with himhe is just and punctualtrue to time and engagementsbe kind to your noble guest and see he wants nothing though it be his pleasure at present to lie private and retired there be those that care for him and i have a charge to see him supplied so that you may let me know by your husband my good dame how my lord is and whether he wants aught  and so he is a real lord after all said the good dame i am sure i always thought he looked like one but why does he not go to parliament then  he will dame answered heriot to the parliament of scotland which is his own country  oh he is but a scots lord then said the good dame and thats the thing makes him ashamed to take the title as they say  let him not hear you say so dame replied the citizen  who i sir answered she no such matter in my thought sir scot or english he is at any rate a likely man and a civil man and rather than he should want any thing i would wait upon him myself and come as far as lombard street to wait upon your worship too  let your husband come to me good dame said the goldsmith who with all his experience and worth was somewhat of a formalist and disciplinarian the proverb says house goes mad when women gad and let his lordships own man wait upon his master in his chamberit is more seemly god give ye goodmorrow  goodmorrow to your worship said the dame somewhat coldly and so soon as the adviser was out of hearing was ungracious enough to mutter in contempt of his council marry quep of your advice for an old scotch tinsmith as you are my husband is as wise and very near as old as yourself and if i please him it is well enough and though he is not just so rich just now as some folks yet i hope to see him ride upon his moyle with a footcloth and have his two bluecoats after him as well as they do     chapter v   wherefore come ye not to court certain tis the rarest sport there are silks and jewels glistening prattling fools and wise men listening bullies among brave men justling beggars amongst nobles bustling lowbreathd talkers minion lispers cutting honest throats by whispers wherefore come ye not to court skelton swears tis glorious sport                  skelton skeltonizeth  it was not entirely out of parade that the benevolent citizen was mounted and attended in that manner which as the reader has been informed excited a gentle degree of spleen on the part of dame christie which to do her justice vanished in the little soliloquy which we have recorded the good man besides the natural desire to maintain the exterior of a man of worship was at present bound to whitehall in order to exhibit a piece of valuable workmanship to king james which he deemed his majesty might be pleased to view or even to purchase he himself was therefore mounted upon his caparisoned mule that he might the better make his way through the narrow dirty and crowded streets and while one of his attendants carried under his arm the piece of plate wrapped up in red baize the other two gave an eye to its safety for such was then the state of the police of the metropolis that men were often assaulted in the public street for the sake of revenge or of plunder and those who apprehended being beset usually endeavoured if their estate admitted such expense to secure themselves by the attendance of armed followers and this custom which was at first limited to the nobility and gentry extended by degrees to those citizens of consideration who being understood to travel with a charge as it was called might otherwise have been selected as safe subjects of plunder by the streetrobber  as master george heriot paced forth westward with this gallant attendance he paused at the shop door of his countryman and friend the ancient horologer and having caused tunstall who was in attendance to adjust his watch by the real time he desired to speak with his master in consequence of which summons the old timemeter came forth from his den his face like a bronze bust darkened with dust and glistening here and there with copper filings and his senses so bemused in the intensity of calculation that he gazed on his friend the goldsmith for a minute before he seemed perfectly to comprehend who he was and heard him express his invitation to david ramsay and pretty mistress margaret his daughter to dine with him next day at noon to meet with a noble young countrymen without returning any answer  ill make thee speak with a murrain to thee muttered heriot to himself and suddenly changing his tone he said aloudi pray you neighbour david when are you and i to have a settlement for the bullion wherewith i supplied you to mount yonder hallclock at theobalds and that other whirligig that you made for the duke of buckingham i have had the spanish house to satisfy for the ingots and i must needs put you in mind that you have been eight months behindhand  there is something so sharp and aigre in the demand of a peremptory dun that no human tympanum however inaccessible to other tones can resist the application david ramsay started at once from his reverie and answered in a pettish tone wow george man what needs aw this din about sax score o pounds aw the world kens i can answer aw claims on me and you proffered yourself fair time till his maist gracious majesty and the noble duke suld make settled accompts wi me and ye may ken by your ain experience that i canna gang rowting like an unmannered highland stot to their doors as ye come to mine  heriot laughed and replied well david i see a demand of money is like a bucket of water about your ears and makes you a man of the world at once and now friend will you tell me like a christian man if you will dine with me tomorrow at noon and bring pretty mistress margaret my goddaughter with you to meet with our noble young countryman the lord  of glenvarloch  the young lord of glenvarloch said the old mechanist wi aw my heart and blithe i will be to see him again we have not met these forty yearshe was twa years before me at the humanity classeshe is a sweet youth  that was his fatherhis fatherhis fatheryou old dotard dotand carryone that you are answered the goldsmith a sweet youth he would have been by this time had he lived worthy nobleman this is his son the lord nigel  his son said ramsay maybe he will want something of a chronometer or watchfew gallants care to be without them nowa days  he may buy half your stockintrade if ever he comes to his own for what i know said his friend but david remember your bond and use me not as you did when my housewife had the sheepshead and the cockaleeky boiling for you as late as two of the clock afternoon  she had the more credit by her cookery answered david now fully awake a sheepshead overboiled were poison according to our saying  well answered master george but as there will be no sheepshead tomorrow it may chance you to spoil a dinner which a proverb cannot mend it may be you may forgather with your friend sir mungo malagrowther for i purpose to ask his worship so be sure and bide tryste davie  that will ii will be true as a chronometer said ramsay  i will not trust you though replied heriothear you jenkin boy tell scots janet to tell pretty mistress margaret my godchild she must put her father in remembrance to put on his best doublet to morrow and to bring him to lombard street at noon tell her they are to meet a brave young scots lord  jenkin coughed that sort of dry short cough uttered by those who are either charged with errands which they do not like or hear opinions to which they must not enter a dissent  umph repeated master georgewho as we have already noticed was something of a martinet in domestic disciplinewhat does umph mean will you do mine errand or not sirrah  sure master george heriot said the apprentice touching his cap i only meant that mistress margaret was not likely to forget such an invitation  why no said master george she is a dutiful girl to her god father though i sometimes call her a jillflirtand hark ye jenkin you and your comrade had best come with your clubs to see your master and her safely home but first shut shop and loose the bulldog and let the porter stay in the foreshop till your return i will send two of my knaves with you for i hear these wild youngsters of the temple are broken out worse and lighter than ever  we can keep their steel in order with good handbats said jenkin and never trouble your servants for the matter  or if need be said tunstall we have swords as well as the templars  fie upon itfie upon it young man said the citizenan apprentice with a swordmarry heaven forefend i would as soon see him in a hat and feather  well sir said jenkinwe will find arms fitting to our station and will defend our master and his daughter if we should tear up the very stones of the pavement  there spoke a london prentice bold said the citizen and for your comfort my lads you shall crush a cup of wine to the health of the fathers of the city i have my eye on both of youyou are thriving lads each in his own waygod be wi you davie forget not tomorrow at noon and so saying he again turned his mules head westward and crossed temple bar at that slow and decent amble which at once became his rank and civic importance and put his pedestrian followers to no inconvenience to keep up with him  at the temple gate he again paused dismounted and sought his way into one of the small booths occupied by scriveners in the neighbourhood a young man with lank smooth hair combed straight to his ears and then cropped short rose with a cringing reverence pulled off a slouched hat which he would upon no signal replace on his head and answered with much demonstration of reverence to the goldsmiths question of how goes business andrewaw the better for your worships kind countenance and maintenance  get a large sheet of paper man and make a new pen with a sharp neb and fine hairstroke do not slit the quill up too high its a wastrife course in your trade andrewthey that do not mind corn pickles never come to forpits i have known a learned man write a thousand pages with one quill footnote a biblical commentary by gill which if the authors memory serves him occupies between five and six hundred printed quarto pages and must therefore have filled more pages of manuscript than the number mentioned in the text has this quatrain at the end of the volume     with one good pen i wrote this book        made of a grey goose quill      a pen it was when it i took        and a pen i leave it still  ah sir said the lad who listened to the goldsmith though instructing him in his own trade with an air of veneration and acquiescence how sune ony puir creature like mysell may rise in the world wi the instruction of such a man as your worship  my instructions are few andrew soon told and not hard to practise be honestbe industriousbe frugaland you will soon win wealth and worshiphere copy me this supplication in your best and most formal hand i will wait by you till it is done  the youth lifted not his eye from the paper and laid not the pen from his hand until the task was finished to his employers satisfaction the citizen then gave the young scrivener an angel and bidding him on his life be secret in all business intrusted to him again mounted his mule and rode on westward along the strand  it may be worth while to remind our readers that the temple bar which heriot passed was not the arched screen or gateway of the present day but an open railing or palisade which at night and in times of alarm was closed with a barricade of posts and chains the strand also along which he rode was not as now a continued street although it was beginning already to assume that character it still might be considered as an open road along the south side of which stood various houses and hotels belonging to the nobility having gardens behind them down to the waterside with stairs to the river for the convenience of taking boat which mansions have bequeathed the names of their lordly owners to many of the streets leading from the strand to the thames the north side of the strand was also a long line of houses behind which as in saint martins lane and other points buildings were rapidly arising but covent garden was still a garden in the literal sense of the word or at least but beginning to be studded with irregular buildings all that was passing around however marked the rapid increase of a capital which had long enjoyed peace wealth and a regular government houses were rising in every direction and the shrewd eye of our citizen already saw the period not distant which should convert the nearly open highway on which he travelled into a connected and regular street uniting the court and the town with the city of london  he next passed charing cross which was no longer the pleasant solitary village at which the judges were wont to breakfast on their way to westminster hall but began to resemble the artery through which to use johnsons expression pours the full tide of london population the buildings were rapidly increasing yet certainly gave not even a faint idea of its present appearance  at last whitehall received our traveller who passed under one of the beautiful gates designed by holbein and composed of tesselated brick work being the same to which moniplies had profanely likened the westport of edinburgh and entered the ample precincts of the palace of whitehall now full of all the confusion attending improvement it was just at the time when jameslittle suspecting that he was employed in constructing a palace from the window of which his only son was to pass in order that he might die upon a scaffold before it was busied in removing the ancient and ruinous buildings of de burgh henry viii and queen elizabeth to make way for the superb architecture on which inigo jones exerted all his genius the king ignorant of futurity was now engaged in pressing on his work and for that purpose still maintained his royal apartments at whitehall amidst the rubbish of old buildings and the various confusion attending the erection of the new pile which formed at present a labyrinth not easily traversed  the goldsmith to the royal household and who if fame spoke true oftentimes acted as their bankerfor these professions were not as yet separated from each otherwas a person of too much importance to receive the slightest interruption from sentinel or porter and leaving his mule and two of his followers in the outercourt he gently knocked at a posterngate of the building and was presently admitted while the most trusty of his attendants followed him closely with the piece of plate under his arm this man also he left behind him in an anteroomwhere three or four pages in the royal livery but untrussed unbuttoned and dressed more carelessly than the place and nearness to a kings person seemed to admit were playing at dice and draughts or stretched upon benches and slumbering with halfshut eyes a corresponding gallery which opened from the anteroom was occupied by two gentlemenushers of the chamber who gave each a smile of recognition as the wealthy goldsmith entered  no word was spoken on either side but one of the ushers looked first to heriot and then to a little door halfcovered by the tapestry which seemed to say as plain as a look could lies your business that way the citizen nodded and the courtattendant moving on tiptoe and with as much caution as if the floor had been paved with eggs advanced to the door opened it gently and spoke a few words in a low tone the broad scottish accent of king james was heard in replyadmit him instanter maxwell have you hairboured sae lang at the court and not learned that gold and silver are ever welcome  the usher signed to heriot to advance and the honest citizen was presently introduced into the cabinet of the sovereign  the scene of confusion amid which he found the king seated was no bad picture of the state and quality of jamess own mind there was much that was rich and costly in cabinet pictures and valuable ornaments but they were arranged in a slovenly manner covered with dust and lost half their value or at least their effect from the manner in which they were presented to the eye the table was loaded with huge folios amongst which lay light books of jest and ribaldry and amongst notes of unmercifully long orations and essays on kingcraft were mingled miserable roundels and ballads by the royal prentice as he styled himself in the art of poetry and schemes for the general pacification of europe with a list of the names of the kings hounds and remedies against canine madness  the kings dress was of green velvet quilted so full as to be dagger proofwhich gave him the appearance of clumsy and ungainly protuberance while its being buttoned awry communicated to his figure an air of distortion over his green doublet he wore a sad coloured nightgown out of the pocket of which peeped his hunting horn his highcrowned grey hat lay on the floor covered with dust but encircled by a carcanet of large balas rubies and he wore a blue velvet nightcap in the front of which was placed the plume of a heron which had been struck down by a favourite hawk in some critical moment of the flight in remembrance of which the king wore this highly honoured feather  but such inconsistencies in dress and appointments were mere outward types of those which existed in the royal character rendering it a subject of doubt amongst his contemporaries and bequeathing it as a problem to future historians he was deeply learned without possessing useful knowledge sagacious in many individual cases without having real wisdom fond of his power and desirous to maintain and augment it yet willing to resign the direction of that and of himself to the most unworthy favourites a big and bold asserter of his rights in words yet one who tamely saw them trampled on in deeds a lover of negotiations in which he was always outwitted and one who feared war where conquest might have been easy he was fond of his dignity while he was perpetually degrading it by undue familiarity capable of much public labour yet often neglecting it for the meanest amusement a wit though a pedant and a scholar though fond of the conversation of the ignorant and uneducated even his timidity of temper was not uniform and there were moments of his life and those critical in which he showed the spirit of his ancestors he was laborious in trifles and a trifler where serious labour was required devout in his sentiments and yet too often profane in his language just and beneficent by nature he yet gave way to the iniquities and oppression of others he was penurious respecting money which he had to give from his own hand yet inconsiderately and unboundedly profuse of that which he did not see in a word those good qualities which displayed themselves in particular cases and occasions were not of a nature sufficiently firm and comprehensive to regulate his general conduct and showing themselves as they occasionally did only entitled james to the character bestowed on him by sullythat he was the wisest fool in christendom  that the fortunes of this monarch might be as little of apiece as his character he certainly the least able of the stewarts succeeded peaceably to that kingdom against the power of which his predecessors had with so much difficulty defended his native throne and lastly although his reign appeared calculated to ensure to great britain that lasting tranquillity and internal peace which so much suited the kings disposition yet during that very reign were sown those seeds of dissension which like the teeth of the fabulous dragon had their harvest in a bloody and universal civil war  such was the monarch who saluting heriot by the name of jingling geordie for it was his wellknown custom to give nicknames to all those with whom he was on terms of familiarity inquired what new clattertraps he had brought with him to cheat his lawful and native prince out of his siller  god forbid my liege said the citizen that i should have any such disloyal purpose i did but bring a piece of plate to show to your most gracious majesty which both for the subject and for the workmanship i were loath to put into the hands of any subject until i knew your majestys pleasure anent it  body o me man lets see it heriot though by my saul steenies service o plate was sae dear a bargain i had maist pawned my word as a royal king to keep my ain gold and silver in future and let you geordie keep yours  respecting the duke of buckinghams plate said the goldsmith your majesty was pleased to direct that no expense should be spared and  what signifies what i desired man when a wise man is with fules and bairns he maun een play at the chucks but you should have had mair sense and consideration than to gie babie charles and steenie their ain gate they wad hae floored the very rooms wi silver and i wonder they didna  george heriot bowed and said no more he knew his master too well to vindicate himself otherwise than by a distant allusion to his order and james with whom economy was only a transient and momentary twinge of conscience became immediately afterwards desirous to see the piece of plate which the goldsmith proposed to exhibit and dispatched maxwell to bring it to his presence in the meantime he demanded of the citizen whence he had procured it  from italy may it please your majesty replied heriot  it has naething in it tending to papistrie said the king looking graver than his wont  surely not please your majesty said heriot i were not wise to bring any thing to your presence that had the mark of the beast  you would be the mair beast yourself to do so said the king it is weel kend that i wrestled wi dagon in my youth and smote him on the groundsill of his own temple a gude evidence that i should be in time called however unworthy the defender of the faithbut here comes maxwell bending under his burden like the golden ass of apuleius  heriot hastened to relieve the usher and to place the embossed salver for such it was and of extraordinary dimensions in a light favourable for his majestys viewing the sculpture  saul of my body man said the king it is a curious piece and as i think fit for a kings chalmer and the subject as you say master george vera adequate and beseemingbeing as i see the judgment of solomona prince in whose paths it weel becomes a leeving monarchs to walk with emulation  but whose footsteps said maxwell only one of themif a subject may say so muchhath ever overtaken  haud your tongue for a fause fleeching loon said the king but with a smile on his face that showed the flattery had done its part look at the bonny piece of workmanship and haud your clavering tongue and whase handiwork may it be geordie  it was wrought sir replied the goldsmith by the famous florentine benvenuto cellini and designed for francis the first of france but i hope it will find a fitter master  francis of france said the king send solomon king of the jews to francis of francebody of me man it would have kythed cellini mad had he never done ony thing else out of the gate franciswhy he was a fighting fule mana mere fighting fulegot himsell taen at pavia like our ain david at durham lang syneif they could hae sent him solomons wit and love of peace and godliness they wad hae dune him a better turn but solomon should sit in other gate company than francis of france  i trust that such will be his good fortune said heriot  it is a curious and very artificial sculpture said the king in continuation but yet methinks the carnifex or executioner there is brandishing his gully ower near the kings face seeing he is within reach of his weapon i think less wisdom than solomons wad have taught him that there was danger in edgetools and that he wad have bidden the smaik either sheath his shabble or stand farther back  george heriot endeavoured to alleviate this objection by assuring the king that the vicinity betwixt solomon and the executioner was nearer in appearance than in reality and that the perspective should be allowed for  gang to the deil wi your prospective man said the king there canna be a waur prospective for a lawful king wha wishes to reign in luve and die in peace and honour than to have naked swords flashing in his een i am accounted as brave as maist folks and yet i profess to ye i could never look on a bare blade without blinking and winking but athegither it is a brave pieceand what is the price of it man  the goldsmith replied by observing that it was not his own property but that of a distressed countryman  whilk you mean to mak your excuse for asking the double of its worth i warrant answered the king i ken the tricks of you burrowstown merchants man  i have no hopes of baffling your majestys sagacity said heriot the piece is really what i say and the price a hundred and fifty pounds sterling if it pleases your majesty to make present payment  a hundred and fifty punds man and as mony witches and warlocks to raise them said the irritated monarch my saul jingling geordie ye are minded that your purse shall jingle to a bonny tunehow am i to tell you down a hundred and fifty punds for what will not weigh as many merks and ye ken that my very household servitors and the officers of my mouth are sax months in arrear  the goldsmith stood his ground against all this objurgation being what he was well accustomed to and only answered that if his majesty liked the piece and desired to possess it the price could be easily settled it was true that the party required the money but he george heriot would advance it on his majestys account if such were his pleasure and wait his royal conveniency for payment for that and other matters the money meanwhile lying at the ordinary usage  by my honour said james and that is speaking like an honest and reasonable tradesman we maun get another subsidy frae the commons and that will make ae compting of it awa wi it maxwellawa wi it and let it be set where steenie and babie charles shall see it as they return from richmondand now that we are secret my good auld friend geordie i do truly opine that speaking of solomon and ourselves the haill wisdom in the country left scotland when we took our travels to the southland here  george heriot was courtier enough to say that the wise naturally follow the wisest as stags follow their leader troth i think there is something in what thou sayest said james for we ourselves and those of our court and household as thou thyself for example are allowed by the english for as selfopinioned as they are to pass for reasonable good wits but the brains of those we have left behind are all astir and run clean hirdiegirdie like sae mony warlocks and witches on the devils sabbath een  i am sorry to hear this my liege said heriot may it please your grace to say what our countrymen have done to deserve such a character  they are become frantic manclean braincrazed answered the king i cannot keep them out of the court by all the proclamations that the heralds roar themselves hoarse with yesterday nae farther gane just as we were mounted and about to ride forth in rushed a thorough edinburgh gutterblooda ragged rascal every dud upon whose back was bidding goodday to the other with a coat and hat that would have served a peasebogle and without havings or reverence thrusts into our hands like a sturdy beggar some supplication about debts owing by our gracious mother and siclike trash whereat the horse spangs on end and but for our admirable sitting wherein we have been thought to excel maist sovereign princes as well as subjects in europe i promise you we would have been laid endlang on the causeway  your majesty said heriot is their common father and therefore they are the bolder to press into your gracious presence  i ken i am pater patriae well enough said james but one would think they had a mind to squeeze my puddings out that they may divide the inheritance uds death geordie there is not a loon among them can deliver a supplication as it suld be done in the face of majesty  i would i knew the most fitting and beseeming mode to do so said heriot were it but to instruct our poor countrymen in better fashions  by my halidome said the king ye are a ceevileezed fellow geordie and i carena if i fling awa as much time as may teach ye and first see you sirye shall approach the presence of majesty thusshadowing your eyes with your hand to testify that you are in the presence of the vicegerent of heavenvera weel george that is done in a comely mannerthen sir ye sail kneel and

were fain to send sax of the bluebanders to harry the lady of loganhouses dowcot and poultryyard and what an awfu plaint the poor dame made against jock of milch and the thieves of annandale wha were as sackless of the deed as i am of the sin of murder  it was the better for jock said heriot for if i remember weel it saved him from a strapping up at dumfries which he had weel deserved for other misdeeds  ay man mind ye that said the king but he had other virtues for he was a tight huntsman moreover that jock of milch and could hollow to a hound till all the woods rang again but he came to an annandale end at the last for lord torthorwald run his lance out through himcocksnails man when i think of those wild passages in my conscience i am not sure but we lived merrier in auld holyrood in those shifting days than now when we are dwelling at heck and manger cantabit vacuuswe had but little to care for  and if your majesty please to remember said the goldsmith the awful task we had to gather silvervessail and goldwork enough to make some show before the spanish ambassador  vera true said the king now in a full tide of gossip and i mind not the name of the right leal lord that

your majesty your own pacific government and your doing of equal justice to all men has made main force a kittle line to walk by unless just within the bounds of the highlands  wellweelweel man said the perplexed monarch whose ideas of justice expedience and convenience became on such occasions strangely embroiled just it is we should pay our debts that the young man may pay his and he must be

wherefore comes not the young lord to court heriotis he comelyis he presentable in the presence  no one can be more so said george heriot but  ay i understand ye said his majestyi understand yeres

majesty to give me such directions in writing said the cautious citizen  the deil is in your nicety george said the king ye are as preceese as a puritan in form and a mere nullifidian in the marrow of the matter may not a kings word serve ye for advancing your pitiful twa hundred pounds  but not for detaining the crown jewels said george heriot  and the king who from long experience was inured to dealing with suspicious creditors wrote an order upon george heriot his well beloved goldsmith and jeweller for the sum of two hundred pounds to be paid presently to nigel olifaunt lord of glenvarloch to be imputed as so much debts due to him by the crown and authorizing the retention of a carcanet of balas rubies with a great diamond as described in a catalogue of his majestys jewels to remain in possession of the said george heriot advancer of the said sum and so forth until he was lawfully contented and paid thereof by another rescript his majesty gave the said george heriot directions to deal with some of the monied men upon equitable terms for a sum of money for his majestys present use not to be under 50000 merks but as much more as could conveniently be procured  and has he ony lair this lord nigel of ours said the king  george heriot could not exactly answer this question but believed the young lord had studied abroad  he shall have our own advice said the king how to carry

gentle king jamie and his benevolent jeweller and goldsmith     chapter vi     o i do know himtis the mouldy lemon   which our court wits will wet their lips withal   when they would sauce their honied conversation   with somewhat sharper flavourmarry sir   that virtues wellnigh left himall the juice   that was so sharp and poignant is squeezed out   while the poor rind although as sour as ever   must season soon the draff we give our grunters   for two leggd things are weary ont                      the chamberlaina comedy  the good company invited by the hospitable citizen assembled at his house in lombard street at the hollow and hungry hour of noon to partake of that meal which divides the day being about the time when modern persons of fashion turning themselves upon their pillow begin to think not without a great many doubts and much hesitation that they will by and by commence it thither came the young nigel arrayed plainly but in a dress nevertheless more suitable to his age and quality than he had formerly worn accompanied by his servant moniplies whose outside also was considerably improved his solemn and stern features glared forth from under a blue velvet bonnet fantastically placed sideways on his headhe had a sound and tough coat of english blue broadcloth which unlike his former vestment would have stood the tug of all the apprentices in fleet street the buckler and broadsword he wore as the arms of his condition and a neat silver badge bearing his lords arms announced that he was an appendage of aristocracy he sat down in the good citizens buttery not a little pleased to find his attendance upon the table in the hall was likely to be rewarded with his share of a meal such as he had seldom partaken of  mr david ramsay that profound and ingenious mechanic was safely conducted to lombard street according to promise well washed brushed and cleaned from the soot of the furnace and the forge his daughter who came with him was about twenty years old very pretty very demure yet with lively black eyes that ever and anon contradicted the expression of sobriety to which silence reserve a plain velvet hood and a cambric ruff had condemned mistress marget as the daughter of a quiet citizen  there were also two citizens and merchants of london men ample in cloak and manylinked golden chain well to pass in the world and experienced in their craft of merchandise but who require no particular description there was an elderly clergyman also in his gown and cassock a decent venerable man partaking in his manners of the plainness of the citizens amongst whom he had his cure  these may be dismissed with brief notice but not so sir mungo malagrowther of girnigo castle who claims a little more attention as an original character of the time in which he flourished  that good knight knocked at master heriots door just as the clock began to strike twelve and was seated in his chair ere the last stroke had chimed this gave the knight an excellent opportunity of making sarcastic observations on all who came later than himself not to mention a few rubs at the expense of those who had been so superfluous as to appear earlier  having little or no property save his bare designation sir mungo had been early attached to court in the capacity of whippingboy as the office was then called to king james the sixth and with his majesty trained to all polite learning by his celebrated preceptor george buchanan the office of whippingboy doomed its unfortunate occupant to undergo all the corporeal punishment which the lords anointed whose proper person was of course sacred might chance to incur in the course of travelling through his grammar and prosody under the stern rule indeed of george buchanan who did not approve of the vicarious mode of punishment james bore the penance of his own faults and mungo malagrowther enjoyed a sinecure but jamess other pedagogue master patrick young went more ceremoniously to work and appalled the very soul of the youthful king by the floggings which he bestowed on the whippingboy when the royal task was not suitably performed and be it told to sir mungos praise that there were points about him in the highest respect suited to his official situation he had even in youth a naturally irregular and grotesque set of features which when distorted by fear pain and anger looked like one of the whimsical faces which present themselves in a gothic cornice his voice also was highpitched and querulous so that when smarting under master peter youngs unsparing inflictions the expression of his grotesque physiognomy and the superhuman yells which he uttered were well suited to produce all the effects on the monarch who deserved the lash that could possibly be produced by seeing another and an innocent individual suffering for his delict  sir mungo malagrowther for such he became thus got an early footing at court which another would have improved and maintained but when he grew too big to be whipped he had no other means of rendering himself acceptable a bitter caustic and backbiting humour a malicious wit and an envy of others more prosperous than the possessor of such amiable qualities have not indeed always been found obstacles to a courtiers rise but then they must be amalgamated with a degree of selfish cunning and prudence of which sir mungo had no share his satire ran riot his envy could not conceal itself and it was not long after his majority till he had as many quarrels upon his hands as would have required a cats nine lives to answer in one of these rencontres he received perhaps we should say fortunately a wound which served him as an excuse for answering no invitations of the kind in future sir rullion rattray of ranagullion cut off in mortal combat three of the fingers of his right hand so that sir mungo never could hold sword again at a later period having written some satirical verses upon the lady cockpen he received so severe a chastisement from some persons employed for the purpose that he was found half dead on the spot where they had thus dealt with him and one of his thighs having been broken and ill set gave him a hitch in his gait with which he hobbled to his grave the lameness of his leg and hand besides that they added considerably to the grotesque appearance of this original procured him in future a personal immunity from the more dangerous consequences of his own humour and he gradually grew old in the service of the court in safety of life and limb though without either making friends or attaining preferment sometimes indeed the king was amused with his caustic sallies but he had never art enough to improve the favourable opportunity and his enemies who were for that matter the whole court always found means to throw him out of favour again the celebrated archie armstrong offered sir mungo in his generosity a skirt of his own fools coat proposing thereby to communicate to him the privileges and immunities of a professed jesterfor said the man of motley sir mungo as he goes on just now gets no more for a good jest than just the kings pardon for having made it  even in london the golden shower which fell around him did not moisten the blighted fortunes of sir mungo malagrowther he grew old deaf and peevishlost even the spirit which had formerly animated his stricturesand was barely endured by james who though himself nearly as far stricken in years retained to an unusual and even an absurd degree the desire to be surrounded by young people  sir mungo thus fallen into the yellow leaf of years and fortune showed his emaciated form and faded embroidery at court as seldom as his duty permitted and spent his time in indulging his food for satire in the public walks and in the aisles of saint pauls which were then the general resort of newsmongers and characters of all descriptions associating himself chiefly with such of his countrymen as he accounted of inferior birth and rank to himself in this manner hating and contemning commerce and those who pursued it he nevertheless lived a good deal among the scottish artists and merchants who had followed the court to london to these he could show his cynicism without much offence for some submitted to his jeers and illhumour in deference to his birth and knighthood which in those days conferred high privilegesand others of more sense pitied and endured the old man unhappy alike in his fortunes and his temper  amongst the latter was george heriot who though his habits and education induced him to carry aristocratical feelings to a degree which would now be thought extravagant had too much spirit and good sense to permit himself to be intruded upon to an unauthorized excess or used with the slightest improper freedom by such a person as sir mungo to whom he was nevertheless not only respectfully civil but essentially kind and even generous  accordingly this appeared from the manner in which sir mungo malagrowther conducted himself upon entering the apartment he paid his respects to master heriot and a decent elderly somewhat severe looking female in a coif who by the name of aunt judith did the honours of his house and table with little or no portion of the supercilious acidity which his singular physiognomy assumed when he made his bow successively to david ramsay and the two sober citizens he thrust himself into the conversation of the latter to observe he had heard in pauls that the bankrupt concern of pindivide a great merchantwho as he expressed it had given the crows a pudding and on whom he knew from the same authority each of the honest citizens has some unsettled claimwas like to prove a total lossstock and block ship and cargo keel and rigging all lost now and for ever  the two citizens grinned at each other but too prudent to make their private affairs the subject of public discussion drew their heads together and evaded farther conversation by speaking in a whisper  the old scots knight next attacked the watchmaker with the same disrespectful familiaritydavie he saiddavie ye donnard auld idiot have ye no gane mad yet with applying your mathematical science as ye call it to the book of apocalypse i expected to have heard ye make out the sign of the beast as clear as a tout on a bawbee whistle  why sir mungo said the mechanist after making an effort to recall to his recollection what had been said to him and by whom it may be that ye are nearer the mark than ye are yoursell aware of for taking the ten horns o the beast ye may easily estimate by your digitals  my digits you dd auld rusty goodfornothing timepiece exclaimed sir mungo while betwixt jest and earnest he laid on his hilt his hand or rather his claw for sir rullions broadsword has abridged it into that formdye mean to upbraid me with my mutilation  master heriot interfered i cannot persuade our friend david he said that scriptural prophecies are intended to remain in obscurity until their unexpected accomplishment shall make as in former days that fulfilled which was written but you must not exert your knightly valour on him for all that  by my saul and it would be throwing it away said sir mungo laughing i would as soon set out with hound and horn to hunt a sturdied sheep for he is in a doze again and up to the chin in numerals quotients and dividendsmistress margaret my pretty honey for the beauty of the young citizen made even sir mungo malagrowthers grim features relax themselves a little is your father always as entertaining as he seems just now  mistress margaret simpered bridled looked to either side then straight before her and having assumed all the airs of bashful embarrassment and timidity which were necessary as she thought to cover a certain shrewd readiness which really belonged to her character at length replied that indeed her father was very thoughtful but she had heard that he took the habit of mind from her grandfather  your grandfather said sir mungoafter doubting if he had heard her arightsaid she her grandfather the lassie is distraughti ken nae wench on this side of temple bar that is derived from so distant a relation  she has got a godfather however sir mungo said george heriot again interfering and i hope you will allow him interest enough with you to request you will not put his pretty godchild to so deep a blush  the betterthe better said sir mungo it is a credit to her that bred and born within the sound of bowbell she can blush for any thing and by my saul master george he continued chucking the irritated and reluctant damsel under the chin she is bonny enough to make amends for her lack of ancestryat least in such a region as cheapside where dye mind me the kettle cannot call the porridge pot  the damsel blushed but not so angrily as before master george heriot hastened to interrupt the conclusion of sir mungos homely proverb by introducing him personally to lord nigel  sir mungo could not at first understand what his host saidbread of heaven wha say ye man  upon the name of nigel olifaunt lord glenvarloch being again hollowed into his ear he drew up and regarding his entertainer with some austerity rebuked him for not making persons of quality acquainted with each other that they might exchange courtesies before they mingled with other folks he then made as handsome and courtly a congee to his new acquaintance as a man maimed in foot and hand could do and observing he had known my lord his father bid him welcome to london and hoped he should see him at court  nigel in an instant comprehended as well from sir mungos manner as from a strict compression of their entertainers lips which intimated the suppression of a desire to laugh that he was dealing with an original of no ordinary description and accordingly returned his courtesy with suitable punctiliousness sir mungo in the meanwhile gazed on him with much earnestness and as the contemplation of natural advantages was as odious to him as that of wealth or other adventitious benefits he had no sooner completely perused the handsome form and good features of the young lord than like one of the comforters of the man of uz he drew close up to him to enlarge on the former grandeur of the lords of glenvarloch and the regret with which he had heard that their representative was not likely to possess the domains of his ancestry anon he enlarged upon the beauties of the principal mansion of glenvarlochthe commanding site of the old castlethe noble expanse of the lake stocked with wildfowl for hawkingthe commanding screen of forest terminating in a mountainridge abounding with deerand all the other advantages of that fine and ancient barony till nigel in spite of every effort to the contrary was unwillingly obliged to sigh  sir mungo skilful in discerning when the withers of those he conversed with were wrung observed that his new acquaintance winced and would willingly have pressed the discussion but the cooks impatient knock upon the dresser with the haft of his dudgeonknife now gave a signal loud enough to be heard from the top of the house to the bottom summoning at the same time the servingmen to place the dinner upon the table and the guests to partake of it  sir mungo who was an admirer of good cheera taste which by the way might have some weight in reconciling his dignity to these city visitswas tolled off by the sound and left nigel and the other guests in peace until his anxiety to arrange himself in his due place of preeminence at the genial board was duly gratified here seated on the left hand of aunt judith he beheld nigel occupy the station of yet higher honour on the right dividing that matron from pretty mistress margaret but he saw this with the more patience that there stood betwixt him and the young lord a superb larded capon  the dinner proceeded according to the form of the times all was excellent of the kind and besides the scottish cheer promised the board displayed beef and pudding the statutory dainties of old england a small cupboard of plate very choicely and beautifully wrought did not escape the compliments of some of the company and an oblique sneer from sir mungo as intimating the owners excellence in his own mechanical craft  i am not ashamed of the workmanship sir mungo said the honest citizen they say a good cook knows how to lick his own fingers and methinks it were unseemly that i who have furnished half the cupboards in broad britain should have my own covered with paltry pewter  the blessing of the clergyman now left the guests at liberty to attack what was placed before them and the meal went forward with great decorum until aunt judith in farther recommendation of the capon assured her company that it was of a celebrated breed of poultry which she had herself brought from scotland  then like some of his countrymen madam said the pitiless sir mungo not without a glance towards his landlord he has been well larded in england  there are some others of his countrymen answered master heriot to whom all the lard in england has not been able to render that good office  sir mungo sneered and reddened the rest of the company laughed and the satirist who had his reasons for not coming to extremity with master george was silent for the rest of the dinner  the dishes were exchanged for confections and wine of the highest quality and flavour and nigel saw the entertainments of the wealthiest burgomasters which he had witnessed abroad fairly outshone by the hospitality of a london citizen yet there was nothing ostentatious or which seemed inconsistent with the degree of an opulent burgher  while the collation proceeded nigel according to the goodbreeding of the time addressed his discourse principally to mrs judith whom he found to be a woman of a strong scottish understanding more inclined towards the puritans than was her brother george for in that relation she stood to him though he always called her aunt attached to him in the strongest degree and sedulously attentive to all his comforts as the conversation of this good dame was neither lively nor fascinating the young lord naturally addressed himself next to the old horologers very pretty daughter who sat upon his left hand from her however there was no extracting any reply beyond the measure of a monosyllable and when the young gallant had said the best and most complaisant things which his courtesy supplied the smile that mantled upon her pretty mouth was so slight and evanescent as scarce to be discernible  nigel was beginning to tire of his company for the old citizens were speaking with his host of commercial matters in language to him totally unintelligible when sir mungo malagrowther suddenly summoned their attention  that amiable personage had for some time withdrawn from the company into the recess of a projecting window so formed and placed as to command a view of the door of the house and of the street this situation was probably preferred by sir mungo on account of the number of objects which the streets of a metropolis usually offer of a kind congenial to the thoughts of a splenetic man what he had hitherto seen passing there was probably of little consequence but now a trampling of horse was heard without and the knight suddenly exclaimedby my faith master george you had better go look to shop for here comes knighton the duke of buckinghams groom and two fellows after him as if he were my lord duke himself  my cashkeeper is below said heriot without disturbing himself and he will let me know if his graces commands require my immediate attention  umphcashkeeper muttered sir mungo to himself he would have had an easy office when i first kend yebut said he speaking aloud will you not come to the window at least for knighton has trundled a piece of silverplate into your househa ha ha trundled it upon its edge as a callan would drive a hoop i cannot help laughingha ha haat the fellows impudence  i believe you could not help laughing said george heriot rising up and leaving the room if your best friend lay dying  bitter that my lordha said sir mungo addressing nigel our friend is not a goldsmith for nothinghe hath no leaden wit but i will go down and see what comes ont  heriot as he descended the stairs met his cashkeeper coming up with some concern in his facewhy how now roberts said the goldsmith what means all this man  it is knighton master heriot from the courtknighton the dukes man he brought back the salver you carried to whitehall flung it into the entrance as if it had been an old pewter platter and bade me tell you the king would have none of your trumpery  ay indeed said george heriotnone of my trumperycome hither into the comptingroom robertssir mungo he added bowing to the knight who had joined and was preparing to follow them i pray your forgiveness for an instant  in virtue of this prohibition sir mungo who as well as the rest of the company had overheard what passed betwixt george heriot and his cashkeeper saw himself condemned to wait in the outer businessroom where he would have endeavoured to slake his eager curiosity by questioning knighton but that emissary of greatness after having added to the uncivil message of his master some rudeness of his own had again scampered westward with his satellites at his heels  in the meanwhile the name of the duke of buckingham the omnipotent favourite both of the king and the prince of wales had struck some anxiety into the party which remained in the great parlour he was more feared than beloved and if not absolutely of a tyrannical disposition was accounted haughty violent and vindictive it pressed on nigels heart that he himself though he could not conceive how nor why might be the original cause of the resentment of the duke against his benefactor the others made their comments in whispers until the sounds reached ramsay who had not heard a word of what had previously passed but plunged in those studies with which he connected every other incident and event took up only the catchword and repliedthe dukethe duke of buckinghamgeorge villiersayi have spoke with lambe about him  our lord and our lady now how can you say so father said his daughter who had shrewdness enough to see that her father was touching upon dangerous ground  why ay child answered ramsay the stars do but incline they cannot compel but well you wot it is commonly said of his grace by those who have the skill to cast nativities that there was a notable conjunction of mars and saturnthe apparent or true time of which reducing the calculations of eichstadius made for the latitude of oranienburgh to that of london gives seven hours fiftyfive minutes and fortyone seconds  hold your peace old soothsayer said heriot who at that instant entered the room with a calm and steady countenance your calculations are true and undeniable when they regard brass and wire and mechanical force but future events are at the pleasure of him who bears the hearts of kings in his hands  ay but george answered the watchmaker there was a concurrence of signs at this gentlemans birth which showed his course would be a strange one long has it been said of him he was born at the very meeting of night and day and under crossing and contending influences that may affect both us and him      full moon and high sea      great man shalt thou be      red dawning stormy sky      bloody death shalt thou die  it is not good to speak of such things said heriot especially of the great stone walls have ears and a bird of the air shall carry the matter  several of the guests seemed to be of their hosts opinion the two merchants took brief leave as if under consciousness that something was wrong mistress margaret her bodyguard of prentices being in readiness plucked her father by the sleeve and rescuing him from a brown study whether referring to the wheels of time or to that of fortune is uncertain wished goodnight to her friend mrs judith and received her godfathers blessing who at the same time put upon her slender finger a ring of much taste and some value for he seldom suffered her to leave him without some token of his affection thus honourably dismissed and accompanied by her escort she set forth on her return to fleet street  sir mungo had bid adieu to master heriot as he came out from the back comptingroom but such was the interest which he took in the affairs of his friend that when master george went upstairs he could not help walking into that sanctum sanctorum to see how master roberts was employed the knight found the cashkeeper busy in making extracts from those huge brassclasped leathernbound manuscript folios which are the pride and trust of dealers and the dread of customers whose year of grace is out the good knight leant his elbows on the desk and said to the functionary in a condoling tone of voicewhat you have lost a good customer i fear master roberts and are busied in making out his bill of charges  now it chanced that roberts like sir mungo himself was a little deaf and like sir mungo knew also how to make the most of it so that he answered at cross purposesi humbly crave your pardon sir mungo for not having sent in your bill of charge sooner but my master bade me not disturb you i will bring the items together in a moment so saying he began to turn over the leaves of his book of fate murmuring repairing ane silver sealnew clasp to his chain of officeane overgilt brooch to his hat being a saint andrews cross with thistlesa copper gilt pair of spursthis to daniel driver we not dealing in the article  he would have proceeded but sir mungo not prepared to endure the recital of the catalogue of his own petty debts and still less willing to satisfy them on the spot wished the bookkeeper cavalierly goodnight and left the house without farther ceremony the clerk looked after him with a civil city sneer and immediately resumed the more serious labours which sir mungos intrusion had interrupted     chapter vii     things needful we have thought on but the thing   of all most needfulthat which scripture terms   as if alone it merited regard   the one thing needfulthats yet unconsiderd                        the chamberlain  when the rest of the company had taken their departure from master heriots house the young lord of glenvarloch also offered to take leave but his host detained him for a few minutes until all were gone excepting the clergyman  my lord then said the worthy citizen we have had our permitted hour of honest and hospitable pastime and now i would fain delay you for another and graver purpose as it is our custom when we have the benefit of good mr windsors company that he reads the prayers of the church for the evening before we separate your excellent father my lord would not have departed before family worshipi hope the same from your lordship  with pleasure sir answered nigel and you add in the invitation an additional obligation to those with which you have loaded me when young men forget what is their duty they owe deep thanks to the friend who will remind them of it  while they talked together in this manner the servingmen had removed the foldingtables brought forward a portable readingdesk and placed chairs and hassocks for their master their mistress and the noble stranger another low chair or rather a sort of stool was placed close beside that of master heriot and though the circumstance was trivial nigel was induced to notice it because when about to occupy that seat he was prevented by a sign from the old gentleman and motioned to another of somewhat more elevation the clergyman took his station behind the readingdesk the domestics a numerous family both of clerks and servants including moniplies attended with great gravity and were accommodated with benches  the household were all seated and externally at least composed to devout attention when a low knock was heard at the door of the apartment mrs judith looked anxiously at her brother as if desiring to know his pleasure he nodded his head gravely and looked to the door mrs judith immediately crossed the chamber opened the door and led into the apartment a beautiful creature whose sudden and singular appearance might have made her almost pass for an apparition she was deadly palethere was not the least shade of vital red to enliven features which were exquisitely formed and might but for that circumstance have been termed transcendently beautiful her long black hair fell down over her shoulders and down her back combed smoothly and regularly but without the least appearance of decoration or ornament which looked very singular at a period when headgear as it was called of one sort or other was generally used by all ranks her dress was of white of the simplest fashion and hiding all her person excepting the throat face and hands her form was rather beneath than above the middle size but so justly proportioned and elegantly made that the spectators attention was entirely withdrawn from her size in contradiction of the extreme plainness of all the rest of her attire she wore a necklace which a duchess might have envied so large and lustrous were the brilliants of which it was composed and around her waist a zone of rubies of scarce inferior value  when this singular figure entered the apartment she cast her eyes on nigel and paused as if uncertain whether to advance or retreat the glance which she took of him seemed to be one rather of uncertainty and hesitation than of bashfulness or timidity aunt judith took her by the hand and led her slowly forwardher dark eyes however continued to be fixed on nigel with an expression of melancholy by which he felt strangely affected even when she was seated on the vacant stool which was placed there probably for her accommodation she again looked on him more than once with the same pensive lingering and anxious expression but without either shyness or embarrassment not even so much as to call the slightest degree of complexion into her cheek  so soon as this singular female had taken up the prayerbook which was laid upon her cushion she seemed immersed in devotional duty and although nigels attention to the service was so much disturbed by this extraordinary apparition that he looked towards her repeatedly in the course of the service he could never observe that her eyes or her thoughts strayed so much as a single moment from the task in which she was engaged nigel himself was less attentive for the appearance of this lady seemed so extraordinary that strictly as he had been bred up by his father to pay the most reverential attention during performance of divine service his thoughts in spite of himself were disturbed by her presence and he earnestly wished the prayers were ended that his curiosity might obtain some gratification when the service was concluded and each had remained according to the decent and edifying practice of the church concentrated in mental devotion for a short space the mysterious visitant arose ere any other person stirred and nigel remarked that none of the domestics left their places oreven moved until she had first kneeled on one knee to heriot who seemed to bless her with his hand laid on her head and a melancholy solemnity of look and action she then bended her body but without kneeling to mrs judith and having performed these two acts of reverence she left the room yet just in the act of her departure she once more turned her penetrating eyes on nigel with a fixed look which compelled him to turn his own aside when he looked towards her again he saw only the skirt of her white mantle as she left the apartment  the domestics then rose and dispersed themselveswine and fruit and spices were offered to lord nigel and to the clergyman and the latter took his leave the young lord would fain have accompanied him in hope to get some explanation of the apparition which he had beheld but he was stopped by his host who requested to speak with him in his comptingroom  i hope my lord said the citizen that your preparations for attending court are in such forwardness that you can go thither the day after tomorrow it is perhaps the last day for some time that his majesty will hold open court for all who have pretensions by birth rank or office to attend upon him on the subsequent day he goes to theobalds where he is so much occupied with hunting and other pleasures that he cares not to be intruded on  i shall be in all outward readiness to pay my duty said the young nobleman yet i have little heart to do it the friends from whom i ought to have found encouragement and protection have proved cold and falsei certainly will not trouble them for their countenance on this occasionand yet i must confess my childish unwillingness to enter quite alone upon so new a scene  it is bold of a mechanic like me to make such an offer to a nobleman said heriot but i must attend at court tomorrow i can accompany you as far as the presencechamber from my privilege as being of the household i can facilitate your entrance should you find difficulty and i can point out the proper manner and time of approaching the king but i do not know he added smiling whether these little advantages will not be overbalanced by the incongruity of a nobleman receiving them from the hands of an old smith  from the hands rather of the only friend i have found in london said nigel offering his hand  nay if you think of the matter in that way replied the honest citizen there is no more to be saidi will come for you tomorrow with a barge proper to the occasionbut remember my good young lord that i do not like some men of my degree wish to take opportunity to step beyond it and associate with my superiors in rank and therefore do not fear to mortify my presumption by suffering me to keep my distance in the presence and where it is fitting for both of us to separate and for what remains most truly happy shall i be in proving of service to the son of my ancient patron  the style of conversation led so far from the point which had interested the young noblemans curiosity that there was no returning to it that night he therefore exchanged thanks and greetings with george heriot and took his leave promising to be equipped and in readiness to embark with him on the second successive morning at ten oclock  the generation of linkboys celebrated by count anthony hamilton as peculiar to london had already in the reign of james i begun their functions and the service of one of them with his smoky torch had been secured to light the young scottish lord and his follower to their lodgings which though better acquainted than formerly with the city they might in the dark have run some danger of missing this gave the ingenious mr moniplies an opportunity of gathering close up to his master after he had gone through the form of slipping his left arm into the handles of his buckler and loosening his broadsword in the sheath that he might be ready for whatever should befall  if it were not for the wine and the good cheer which we have had in yonder old mans house my lord said this sapient follower and that i ken him by report to be a just living man in many respects and a real edinburgh gutterblood i should have been well pleased to have seen how his feet were shaped and whether he had not a cloven cloot under the braw roses and cordovan shoon of his  why you rascal answered nigel you have been too kindly treated and now that you have filled your ravenous stomach you are railing on the good gentleman that relieved you  under favour no my lord said monipliesi would only like to see something mair about him i have eaten his meat it is truemore shame that the like of him should have meat to give when your lordship and me could scarce have gotten on our own account brose and a bear bannocki have drunk his wine too  i see you have replied his master a great deal more than you should have done  under your patience my lord said moniplies you are pleased to say that because i crushed a quart with that jolly boy jenkin as they call the prentice boy and that was out of mere acknowledgment for his former kindnessi own that i moreover sung the good old song of elsie marley so as they never heard it chanted in their lives  and withal as john bunyan says as they went on their way he sung      o do ye ken elsie marley honey      the wife that sells the barley honey      for elsie marleys grown sae fine      she winna get up to feed the swine          o do ye ken  here in mid career was the songster interrupted by the stern gripe of his master who threatened to baton him to death if he brought the citywatch upon them by his illtimed melody  i crave pardon my lordi humbly crave pardononly when i think of that jen win as they call him i can hardly help hummingo do ye kenbut i crave your honours pardon and will be totally dumb if you command me so  no sirrah said nigel talk on for i well know you would say and suffer more under pretence of holding your peace than when you get an unbridled license how is it then what have you to say against master heriot  it seems more than probable that in permitting this license the young lord hoped his attendant would stumble upon the subject of the young lady who had appeared at prayers in a manner so mysterious but whether this was the case or whether he merely desired that moniplies should utter in a subdued and under tone of voice those spirits which might otherwise have vented themselves in obstreperous song it is certain he permitted his attendant to proceed with his story in his own way  and therefore said the orator availing himself of his immunity i would like to ken what sort of carle this maister heriot is he hath supplied your lordship with wealth of gold as i can understand and if he has i make it for certain he hath had his ain end in it according to the fashion of the world now had your lordship your own good lands at your guiding doubtless this person with most of his craftgoldsmiths they call themselvesi say usurerswad be glad to exchange so many pounds of african dust by whilk i understand gold against so many fair acres and hundreds of acres of broad scottish land  but you know i have no land said the young lord at least none that can be affected by any debt which i can at present become obliged fori think you need not have reminded me of that  true my lord most true and as your lordship says open to the meanest capacity without any unnecessary expositions now therefore my lord unless maister george heriot has something mair to allege as a motive for his liberality vera different from the possession of your estateand moreover as he could gain little by the capture of your body wherefore should it not be your soul that he is in pursuit of  my soul you rascal said the young lord what good should my soul do him  what do i ken about that said moniplies they go about roaring and seeking whom they may devourdoubtless they like the food that they rage so much aboutand my lord they say added moniplies drawing up still closer to his masters side they say that master heriot has one spirit in his house already  how or what do you mean said nigel i will break your head you drunken knave if you palter with me any longer  drunken answered his trusty adherent and is this the storywhy how could i but drink your lordships health on my bare knees when master jenkin began it to mehang them that would noti would have cut the impudent knaves hams with my broadsword that should make scruple of it and so have made him kneel when he should have found it difficult to rise again but touching the spirit he proceeded finding that his master made no answer to his valorous tirade your lordship has seen her with your own eyes  i saw no spirit said glenvarloch but yet breathing thick as one who expects some singular disclosure what mean you by a spirit  you saw a young lady come in to prayers that spoke not a word to any one only made becks and bows to the old gentleman and lady of the houseken ye wha she is  no indeed answered nigel some relation of the family i suppose  deil a bitdeil a bit answered moniplies hastily not a blood drops kin to them if she had a drop of blood in her bodyi tell you but what all human beings allege to be truth that swell within hue and cry of lombard streetthat lady or quean or whatever you choose to call her has been dead in the body these many a year though she haunts them as we have seen even at their very devotions  you will allow her to be a good spirit at least said nigel olifaunt since she chooses such a time to visit her friends  for that i kenna my lord answered the superstitious follower i ken no spirit that would have faced the right down hammerblow of mess john knox whom my father stood by in his very warst days bating a chance time when the court which my father supplied with butcher meat was against him but yon divine has another airt from powerful master rollock and mess david black of north leith and sic like alackaday wha can ken if it please your lordship whether sic prayers as the southron read out of their auld blethering black mess book there may not be as powerful to invite fiends as a right red het prayer warm fraw the heart may be powerful to drive them away even as the evil spirit was driven by he smell of the fishs liver from the bridalchamber of sara the daughter of raguel as to whilk story nevertheless i make scruple to say whether it be truth or not better men than i am having doubted on that matter  well well well said his master impatiently we are now near home and i have permitted you to speak of this matter for once that we may have an end to your prying folly and your idiotical superstitions for ever for whom do you or your absurd authors or informers take this lady  i can sae naething preceesely as to that answered moniplies certain it is her body died and was laid in the grave many a day since notwithstanding she still wanders on earth and chiefly amongst maister heriots family though she hath been seen in other places by them that well knew her but who she is i will not warrant to say or how she becomes attached like a highland brownie to some peculiar family they say she has a row of apartments of her own anteroom parlour and bedroom but deil a bed she sleeps in but her own coffin and the walls doors and windows are so chinked up as to prevent the least blink of daylight from entering and then she dwells by torchlight  to what purpose if she be a spirit said nigel olifaunt  how can i tell your lordship answered his attendant i thank god i know nothing of her likings or mislikingsonly her coffin is there and i leave your lordship to guess what a live person has to do with a coffin as little as a ghost with a lantern i trow  what reason repeated nigel can a creature so young and so beautiful have already habitually to contemplate her bed of lastlong rest  in troth i kenna my lord answered moniplies but there is the coffin as they told me who have seen it it is made of hebenwood with silver nails and lined all through with threepiled damask might serve a princess to rest in  singular said nigel whose brain like that of most active young spirits was easily caught by the singular and the romantic does she not eat with the family  whosheexclaimed moniplies as if surprised at the question they would need a lang spoon would sup with her i trow always there is something put for her into the tower as they call it whilk is a whigmaleery of a whirlingbox that turns round half on the tae side o the wa half on the tother  i have seen the contrivance in foreign nunneries said the lord of glenvarloch and is it thus she receives her food  they tell me something is put in ilka day for fashions sake replied the attendant but its no to be supposed she would consume it ony mair than the images of bel and the dragon consumed the dainty vivers that were placed before them there are stout yeomen and chamberqueans in the house enow to play the part of lickitupa as well as the threescore and ten priests of bel besides their wives and children  and she is never seen in the family but when the hour of prayer arrives said the master  never that i hear of replied the servant  it is singular said nigel olifaunt musing were it not for the ornaments which she wears and still more for her attendance upon the service of the protestant church i should know what to think and should believe her either a catholic votaress who for some cogent reason was allowed to make her cell here in london or some unhappy popish devotee who was in the course of undergoing a dreadful penance as it is i know not what to deem of it  his reverie was interrupted by the linkboy knocking at the door of honest john christie whose wife came forth with quips and becks and wreathed smiles to welcome her honoured guest on his return to his apartment     chapter viii     ay mark the matron welland laugh not harry   at her old steeplehat and velvet guard   ive calld her like the ear of dionysius   i mean that earformd vault built oer his dungeon   to catch the groans and discontented murmurs   of his poor bondsmeneven so doth martha   drink up for her own purpose all that passes   or is supposed to pass in this wide city   she can retail it too if that her profit   shall call on her to do so and retail it   for your advantage so that you can make   your profit jump with hers                             the conspiracy  we must now introduce to the readers acquaintance another character busy and important far beyond her ostensible situation in societyin a word dame ursula suddlechop wife of benjamin suddlechop the most renowned barber in all fleet street this dame had her own particular merits the principal part of which was if her own report could be trusted an infinite desire to be of service to her fellowcreatures leaving to her thin halfstarved partner the boast of having the most dexterous snap with his fingers of any shaver in london and the care of a shop where starved apprentices flayed the faces of those who were boobies enough to trust them the dame drove a separate and more lucrative trade which yet had so many odd turns and windings that it seemed in many respects to contradict itself  its highest and most important duties were of a very secret and confidential nature and dame ursula suddlechop was never known to betray any transaction intrusted to her unless she had either been indifferently paid for her service or that some one found it convenient to give her a double douceur to make her disgorge the secret and these contingencies happened in so few cases that her character for trustiness remained as unimpeached as that for honesty and benevolence  in fact she was a most admirable matron and could be useful to the impassioned and the frail in the rise progress and consequences of their passion she could contrive an interview for lovers who could show proper reasons for meeting privately she could relieve the frail fair one of the burden of a guilty passion and perhaps establish the hopeful offspring of unlicensed love as the heir of some family whose love was lawful but where an heir had not followed the union more than this she could do and had been concerned in deeper and dearer secrets she had been a pupil of mrs turner and learned from her the secret of making the yellow starch and it may be two or three other secrets of more consequence though perhaps none that went to the criminal extent of those whereof her mistress was accused but all that was deep and dark in her real character was covered by the show of outward mirth and goodhumour the hearty laugh and buxom jest with which the dame knew well how to conciliate the elder part of her neighbours and the many petty arts by which she could recommend herself to the younger those especially of her own sex  dame ursula was in appearance scarce past forty and her full but not overgrown form and still comely features although her person was plumped out and her face somewhat coloured by good cheer had a joyous expression of gaiety and goodhumour which set off the remains of beauty in the wane marriages births and christenings were seldom thought to be performed with sufficient ceremony for a considerable distance round her abode unless dame ursley as they called her was present she could contrive all sorts of pastimes games and jests which might amuse the large companies which the hospitality of our ancestors assembled together on such occasions so that her presence was literally considered as indispensable in the families of all citizens of ordinary rank at such joyous periods so much also was she supposed to know of life and its labyrinths that she was the willing confidant of half the loving couples in the vicinity most of whom used to communicate their secrets to and receive their counsel from dame ursley the rich rewarded her services with rings owches or gold pieces which she liked still better and she very generously gave her assistance to the poor on the same mixed principles as young practitioners in medicine assist them partly from compassion and partly to keep her hand in use  dame ursleys reputation in the city was the greater that her practice had extended beyond temple bar and that she had acquaintances nay patrons and patronesses among the quality whose rank as their members were much fewer and the prospect of approaching the courtly sphere much more difficult bore a degree of consequence unknown to the present day when the toe of the citizen presses so close on the courtiers heel dame ursley maintained her intercourse with this superior rank of customers partly by driving a small trade in perfumes essences pomades headgears from france dishes or ornaments from china then already beginning to be fashionable not to mention drugs of various descriptions chiefly for the use of the ladies and partly by other services more or less connected with the esoteric branches of her profession heretofore alluded to  possessing such and so many various modes of thriving dame ursley was nevertheless so poor that she might probably have mended her own circumstances as well as her husbands if she had renounced them all and set herself quietly down to the care of her own household and to assist benjamin in the concerns of his trade but ursula was luxurious and genial in her habits and could no more have endured the stinted economy of benjamins board than she could have reconciled herself to the bald chat of his conversation  it was on the evening of the day on which lord nigel olifaunt dined with the wealthy goldsmith that we must introduce ursula suddlechop upon the stage she had that morning made a long tour to westminster was fatigued and had assumed a certain large elbowchair rendered smooth by frequent use placed on one side of her chimney in which there was lit a small but bright fire here she observed betwixt sleeping and waking the simmering of a pot of wellspiced ale on the brown surface of which bobbed a small crabapple sufficiently roasted while a little mulatto girl watched still more attentively the process of dressing a veal sweetbread in a silver stewpan which occupied the other side of the chimney with these viands doubtless dame ursula proposed concluding the well spent day of which she reckoned the labour over and the rest at her own command she was deceived however for just as the ale or to speak technically the lambswool was fitted for drinking and the little dingy maiden intimated that the sweetbread was ready to be eaten the thin cracked voice of benjamin was heard from the bottom of the stairs  why dame ursleywhy wife i saywhy damewhy love you are wanted more than a strop for a blunt razorwhy dame  i would some one would draw a razor across thy windpipe thou bawling ass said the dame to herself in the first moment of irritation against her clamorous helpmate and then called aloudwhy what is the matter master suddlechop i am just going to slip into bed i have been daggled to and fro the whole day  nay sweetheart it is not me said the patient benjamin but the scots laundrymaid from neighbour ramsays who must speak with you incontinent  at the word sweetheart dame ursley cast a wistful look at the mess which was stewed to a second in the stewpan and then replied with a sighbid scots jenny come up master suddlechop i shall be very happy to hear what she has to say then added in a lower tone and i hope she will go to the devil in the flame of a tarbarrel like many a scots witch before her  the scots laundress entered accordingly and having heard nothing of the last kind wish of dame suddlechop made her reverence with considerable respect and said her young mistress had returned home unwell and wished to see her neighbour dame ursley directly  and why will it not do tomorrow jenny my good woman said dame ursley for i have been as far as whitehall today already and i am wellnigh worn off my feet my good woman  aweel answered jenny with great composure and if that sae be sae i maun take the langer tramp mysell and maun gae down the waterside for auld mother redcap at the hungerford stairs that deals in comforting young creatures een as you do yoursell hinny for ane o ye the bairn maun see before she sleeps and thats a that i ken ont  so saying the old emissary without farther entreaty turned on her heel and was about to retreat when dame ursley exclaimedno no if the sweet child your mistress has any necessary occasion for good advice and kind tendance you need not go to mother redcap janet she may do very well for skippers wives chandlers daughters and such like but nobody shall wait on pretty mistress margaret the daughter of his most sacred majestys horologer excepting and saving myself and so i will but take my chopins and my cloak and put on my muffler and cross the street to neighbour ramsays in an instant but tell me yourself good jenny are you not something tired of your young ladys frolics and change of mind twenty times aday  in troth not i said the patient drudge unless it may be when she is a wee fashious about washing her laces but i have been her keeper since she was a bairn neighbour suddlechop and that makes a difference  ay said dame ursley still busied putting on additional defences against the night air and you know for certain that she has two hundred pounds ayear in good land at her own free disposal  left by her grandmother heaven rest her soul said the scotswoman and to a daintier lassie she could not have bequeathed it  very true very true mistress for with all her little whims i have always said mistress margaret ramsay was the prettiest girl in the ward and jenny i warrant the poor child has had no supper  jenny could not say but it was the case for her master being out the twa prentice lads had gone out after shutting shop to fetch them home and she and the other maid had gone out to sandy macgivans to see a friend frae scotland  as was very natural mrs janet said dame ursley who found her interest in assenting to all sorts of propositions from all sorts of persons  and so the fire went out toosaid jenny  which was the most natural of the whole said dame suddlechop and so to cut the matter short jenny ill carry over the little bit of supper that i was going to eat for dinner i have tasted none and it may be my young pretty mistress marget will eat a morsel with me for it is mere emptiness mistress jenny that often puts these fancies of illness into young folks heads so saying she put the silver possetcup with the ale into jennys hands and assuming her mantle with the alacrity of one determined to sacrifice inclination to duty she hid the stewpan under its folds and commanded wilsa the little mulatto girl to light them across the street  whither away so late said the barber whom they passed seated with his starveling boys round a mess of stockfish and parsnips in the shop below  if i were to tell you gaffer said the dame with most contemptuous coolness i do not think you could do my errand so i will een keep it to myself benjamin was too much accustomed to his wifes independent mode of conduct to pursue his inquiry farther nor did the dame tarry for farther question but marched out at the door telling the eldest of the boys to sit up till her return and look to the house the whilst  the night was dark and rainy and although the distance betwixt the two shops was short it allowed dame ursley leisure enough while she strode along with hightucked petticoats to embitter it by the following grumbling reflectionsi wonder what i have done that i must needs trudge at every old beldams bidding and every young minxs maggot i have been marched from temple bar to whitechapel on the matter of a pinmakers wife having pricked her fingersmarry her husband that made the weapon might have salved the woundand here is this fantastic ape pretty mistress marget forsoothsuch a beauty as i could make of a dutch doll and as fantastic and humorous and conceited as if she were a duchess i have seen her in the same day as changeful as a marmozet and as stubborn as a mule i should like to know whether her little conceited noddle or her fathers old crazy calculating jolterpate breeds most whimsies but then theres that two hundred pounds ayear in dirty land and the father is held a close chuff though a fancifulhe is our landlord besides and she has begged a late day from him for our rent so god help me i must be comfortablebesides the little capricious devil is my only key to get at master george heriots secret and it concerns my character to find that out and so andiamos as the lingua franca hath it  thus pondering she moved forward with hasty strides until she arrived at the watchmakers habitation the attendant admitted them by means of a passkey onward glided dame ursula now in glimmer and now in gloom not like the lovely lady cristabelle through gothic sculpture and ancient armour but creeping and stumbling amongst relics of old machines and models of new inventions in various branches of mechanics with which wrecks of useless ingenuity either in a broken or halffinished shape the apartment of the fanciful though ingenious mechanist was continually lumbered  at length they attained by a very narrow staircase pretty mistress margarets apartment where she the cynosure of the eyes of every bold young bachelor in fleet street sat in a posture which hovered between the discontented and the disconsolate for her pretty back and shoulders were rounded into a curve her round and dimpled chin reposed in the hollow of her little palm while the fingers were folded over her mouth her elbow rested on a table and her eyes seemed fixed upon the dying charcoal which was expiring in a small grate she scarce turned her head when dame ursula entered and when the presence of that estimable matron was more precisely announced in words by the old scotswoman mistress margaret without changing her posture muttered some sort of answer that was wholly unintelligible  go your ways down to the kitchen with wilsa good mistress jenny said dame ursula who was used to all sorts of freaks on the part of her patients or clients whichever they might be termed put the stewpan and the porringer by the fireside and go down belowi must speak to my pretty love mistress margaret by myselfand there is not a bachelor betwixt this and bow but will envy me the privilege  the attendants retired as directed and dame ursula having availed herself of the embers of charcoal to place her stewpan to the best advantage drew herself as close as she could to her patient and began in a low soothing and confidential tone of voice to inquire what ailed her pretty flower of neighbours  nothing dame said margaret somewhat pettishly and changing her posture so as rather to turn her back upon the kind inquirer  nothing ladybird answered dame suddlechop and do you use to send for your friends out of bed at this hour for nothing  it was not i who sent for you dame replied the malecontent maiden  and who was it then said ursula for if i had not been sent for i had not been here at this time of night i promise you  it was the old scotch fool jenny who did it out of her own head i suppose said margaret for she has been stunning me these two hours about you and mother redcap  me and mother redcap said dame ursula an old fool indeed that couples folk up sobut come come my sweet little neighbour jenny is no such fool after all she knows young folks want more and better advice than her own and she knows too where to find it for them so you must take heart of grace my pretty maiden and tell me what you are moping about and then let dame ursula alone for finding out a cure  nay an ye be so wise mother ursula replied the girl you may guess what i ail without my telling you  ay ay child answered the complaisant matron no one can play better than i at the good old game of what is my thought like now ill warrant that little head of yours is running on a new headtire a foot higher than those our city dames wearor you are all for a trip to islington or ware and your father is cross and will not consentor  or you are an old fool dame suddlechop said margaret peevishly and must needs trouble yourself about matters you know nothing of  fool as much as you will mistress said dame ursula offended in her turn but not so very many years older than yourself mistress  oh we are angry are we said the beauty and pray madam ursula how come you that are not so many years older than me to talk about such nonsense to me who am so many years younger and who yet have too much sense to care about headgears and islington  well well young mistress said the sage counsellor rising i perceive i can be of no use here and methinks since you know your own matters so much better than other people do you might dispense with disturbing folks at midnight to ask their advice  why now you are angry mother said margaret detaining her this comes of your coming out at eventide without eating your supperi never heard you utter a cross word after you had finished your little morselhere janet a trencher and salt for dame ursulaand what have you in that porringer damefilthy clammy ale as i would live let janet fling it out of the window or keep it for my fathers morning draught and she shall bring you the pottle of sack that was set ready for himgood man he will never find out the difference for ale will wash down his dusty calculations quite as well as wine  truly sweetheart i am of your opinion said dame ursula whose temporary displeasure vanished at once before these preparations for good cheer and so settling herself on the great easychair with a threelegged table before her she began to dispatch with good appetite the little delicate dish which she had prepared for herself she did not however fail in the duties of civility and earnestly but in vain pressed mistress margaret to partake her dainties the damsel declined the invitation  at least pledge me in a glass of sack said dame ursula i have heard my grandame say that before the gospellers came in the old catholic father confessors and their penitents always had a cup of sack together before confession and you are my penitent  i shall drink no sack i am sure said margaret and i told you before that if you cannot find out what ails me i shall never have the heart to tell it  so saying she turned away from dame ursula once more and resumed her musing posture with her hand on her elbow and her back at least one shoulder turned towards her confidant  nay then said dame ursula i must exert my skill in good earnestyou must give me this pretty hand and i will tell you by palmistry as well as any gipsy of them all what foot it is you halt upon  as if i halted on any foot at all said margaret something scornfully but yielding her left hand to ursula and continuing at the same time her averted position  i see brave lines here said ursula and not ill to read neither pleasure and wealth and merry nights and late mornings to my beauty and such an equipage as shall shake whitehall o have i touched you thereand smile you now my pretty onefor why should not he be lord mayor and go to court in his gilded caroch as others have done before him  lord mayor pshaw replied margaret  and why pshaw at my lord mayor sweetheart or perhaps you pshaw at my prophecy but there is a cross in every ones line of life as well as in yours darling and what though i see a prentices flat cap in this pretty palm yet there is a sparking black eye under it hath not its match in the ward of farringdonwithout  whom do you mean dame said margaret coldly  whom should i mean said dame ursula but the prince of prentices and king of good company jenkin vincent  out womanjenkin vincenta clowna cockney exclaimed the indignant damsel  ay sets the wind in that quarter beauty quoth the dame why it has changed something since we spoke together last for then i would have sworn it blew fairer for poor jin vin and the poor lad dotes on you too and would rather see your eyes than the first glimpse of the sun on the great holiday on mayday  i would my eyes had the power of the sun to blind his then said margaret to teach the drudge his place  nay said dame ursula there be some who say that frank tunstall is as proper a lad as jin vin and of surety he is third cousin to a knighthood and come of a good house and so mayhap you may be for northward ho  maybe i mayanswered margaret but not with my fathers prentice i thank you dame ursula  nay then the devil may guess your thoughts for me said dame ursula this comes of trying to shoe a filly that is eternally wincing and shifting ground  hear me then said margaret and mind what

distance indeed from the great earls of dalwolsey footnote the head of the ancient and distinguished house of ramsay and to whom as their chief the individuals of that name look as their origin and source of gentry allan ramsay the pastoral poet in the same manner makes      dalhousie of an auld descent      my chief my stoup my ornament  ay ay said dame ursula even soi never knew a scot of you

toss your pretty head so scornfully but tell me the name of this lordly northern gallant and we will try what can be done in the matter  it is lord glenvarloch whom they call lord nigel olifaunt said margaret in a low voice and turning away to hide her blushes  marry heaven forefend exclaimed dame suddlechop this is the very devil and something worse  how mean you said the damsel surprised at the vivacity of her exclamation  why know ye not said the dame what powerful enemies he has at court know ye notbut blisters on my tongue it runs too fast for my witenough to say that you had better make your bridalbed under a falling house than think of young glenvarloch  he is unfortunate then said margaret i knew iti divined it there was sorrow in his voice when he said even what was gaythere was a touch of misfortune in his melancholy smilehe had not thus clung to my thoughts had i seen him in all the midday glare of prosperity  romances have cracked her brain said dame ursula she is a castaway

reflection and i would serve you in any thing in my condition but to meddle with such high mattersi shall never forget poor mistress turner my honoured patroness peace be with hershe had the illluck to meddle in the matter of somerset and overbury and so the great earl and his lady slipt their necks out of the collar and left her and some halfdozen others to suffer in their stead i shall never forget the sight of her standing on the scaffold with the ruff round her pretty neck all done up with the yellow starch which i had so often helped her to make and that was so soon to give place to a rough hempen cord such a sight sweetheart will make one loath to meddle with matters that are too hot or heavy for their handling  out you fool answered mistress margaret am i one to speak to you about such criminal practices as that wretch died for all i desire of you is to get me precise knowledge of what affair brings this young nobleman to court  and when you have his secret said ursula

godfathers secretsno ursulathat i will never pry into which he desires to keep hidden but thou knowest that i have a fortune of my own which must at no distant day come under my own managementthink of some other recompense  ay that i well know said the counsellorit is that two hundred per year with your fathers indulgence that makes you so wilful sweetheart  it may be sosaid margaret ramsay meanwhile do you serve me truly and here is a ring of value in pledge that when my fortune is in my own hand i will redeem the token with fifty broad pieces of gold  fifty broad pieces of gold repeated the dame and this ring which is a right fair one in token you fail not of your wordwell sweetheart if i must put my throat in peril i am sure i cannot risk it for a friend more generous than you and i would not think of more than the pleasure of serving you only benjamin gets more idle every day and our family  say no more of it said margaret we understand each other and now tell me what you know of this young mans affairs which made you so unwilling to meddle with them  of that i can say no great matter as yet answered dame ursula only i know the most powerful among his own countrymen are against him and also the most powerful at the court here but i will learn more of it for it will be a dim print that i will not read for your sake pretty mistress margaret know you where this gallant dwells  i heard by accident said margaret as if ashamed of the minute particularity of her memory upon such an occasionhe lodges i thinkat one christiesif i mistake notat pauls

out a butterflyso i drink goodnight and sweet dreams to you in another parting cup of sack and you shall hear tidings of me within fourand twenty hours and once more i commend you to your pillow my pearl of pearls and marguerite of marguerites  so saying she kissed the reluctant cheek of her young friend or patroness and took her departure with the light and stealthy pace of one accustomed to accommodate her footsteps to the purposes of dispatch and secrecy  margaret ramsay looked after her for some time in anxious silence i did ill she at length murmured to let her wring this out of me but she is artful bold and serviceableand i think faithfulor if not she will be true at least to her interest and that i can command i would i had not spoken howeveri have begun a hopeless work for what has he said to me to warrant my meddling in his fortunesnothing but words of the most ordinary importmere table talk and terms of course yet who knowsshe said and then broke off looking at the glass the while which as it reflected back a face of great beauty probably suggested to her mind a more favourable conclusion of the sentence than she cared to trust her tongue withal     chapter ix     so pitiful a thing is suitors state   most miserable man whom wicked fate   hath brought to court to sue for had i wist   that few have found and many a one hath missd   full little knowest thou that hast not tried   what hell it is in sueing long to bide   to lose good days that might be better spent   to waste long nights in pensive discontent   to speed today to be put back tomorrow   to

through comfortless despairs   to fawn to crouch to wait to ride to run   to spend to give to want to be undone                           mother hubbards tale  on the morning of the day on which george heriot had prepared to escort the young lord of glenvarloch to the court at whitehall it may be reasonably supposed that the young man whose fortunes were likely to depend on this cast felt himself more than usually anxious he rose early made his toilette with uncommon care and being enabled by the generosity of his more plebeian countryman to set out a very handsome person to the best advantage he obtained a momentary approbation from himself as he glanced at the mirror and a loud and distinct plaudit from his landlady who declared at once that in her judgment he would take the wind out of the sail of every gallant in the presenceso much had she been able to enrich her discourse with the metaphors of those with whom her husband dealt  at the appointed hour the barge of master george heriot arrived handsomely manned and appointed having a tilt with his own cipher and the arms of his company painted thereupon  the young lord of glenvarloch received the friend who had evinced such disinterested attachment with the kind courtesy which well became him  master heriot then made him acquainted with the bounty of his sovereign which he paid over to his young friend declining what he had himself formerly advanced to him nigel felt all the gratitude which the citizens disinterested friendship had deserved and was not wanting in expressing it suitably  yet as the young and highborn nobleman embarked to go to the presence of his prince under the patronage of one whose best or most distinguished qualification was his being an eminent member of the goldsmiths incorporation he felt a little surprised if not abashed at his own situation and richie moniplies as he stepped over the gangway to take his place forward in the boat could not help mutteringit was a changed day betwixt master heriot and his honest father in the kraemesbut doubtless there was a difference between clinking on gold and silver and clattering upon pewter  on they glided by the assistance of the oars of four stout watermen along the thames which then served for the principal highroad betwixt london and westminster for few ventured on horseback through the narrow and crowded streets of the city and coaches were then a luxury reserved only for the higher nobility and to which no citizen whatever was his wealth presumed to aspire the beauty of the banks especially on the northern side where the gardens of the nobility descended from their hotels in many places down to the waters edge was pointed out to nigel by his kind conductor and was pointed out in vain the mind of the young lord of glenvarloch was filled with anticipations not the most pleasant concerning the manner in which he was likely to be received by that monarch in whose behalf his family had been nearly reduced to ruin and he was with the usual mental anxiety of those in such a situation framing imaginary questions from the king and overtoiling his spirit in devising answers to them  his conductor saw the labour of nigels mind and avoided increasing it by farther conversation so that when he had explained to him briefly the ceremonies observed at court on such occasions of presentation the rest of their voyage was performed in silence  they landed at whitehall stairs and entered the palace after announcing their namesthe guards paying to lord glenvarloch the respect and honours due to his rank  the young mans heart beat high and thick within him as he came into the royal apartments his education abroad conducted as it had been on a narrow and limited scale had given him but imperfect ideas of the grandeur of a court and the philosophical reflections which taught him to set ceremonial and exterior splendour at defiance proved like other maxims of mere philosophy ineffectual at the moment they were weighed against the impression naturally made on the mind of an inexperienced youth by the unusual magnificence of the scene the splendid apartments through which they passed  the rich apparel of the grooms guards and domestics in waiting and the ceremonial attending their passage through the long suite of apartments had something in it trifling and commonplace as it might appear to practised courtiers embarrassing and even alarming to one who went through these forms for the first time and who was doubtful what sort of reception was to accompany his first appearance before his sovereign  heriot in anxious attention to save his young friend from any momentary awkwardness had taken care to give the necessary password to the warders grooms of the chambers ushers or by whatever name they were designated so they passed on without interruption  in this manner they passed several anterooms filled chiefly with guards attendants of the court and their acquaintances male and female who dressed in their best apparel and with eyes rounded by eager curiosity to make the most of their opportunity stood with beseeming modesty ranked against the wall in a manner which indicated that they were spectators not performers in the courtly exhibition  through these exterior apartments lord glenvarloch and his city friend advanced into a large and splendid withdrawingroom communicating with the presencechamber into which anteroom were admitted those only who from birth their posts in the state or household or by the particular grant of the kings had right to attend the court as men entitled to pay their respects to their sovereign  amid this favoured and selected company nigel observed sir mungo malagrowther who avoided and discountenanced by those who knew how low he stood in court interest and favour was but too happy in the opportunity of hooking himself upon a person of lord glenvarlochs rank who was as yet so inexperienced as to feel it difficult to shake off an intruder  the knight forthwith framed his grim features to a ghastly smile and after a preliminary and patronising nod to george heriot accompanied with an aristocratic wave of the hand which intimated at once superiority and protection he laid aside altogether the honest citizen to whom he owed many a dinner to attach himself exclusively to the young lord although he suspected he might be occasionally in the predicament of needing one as much as himself and even the notice of this original singular and unamiable as he was was not entirely indifferent to lord glenvarloch since the absolute and somewhat constrained silence of his good friend heriot which left him at liberty to retire painfully to his own agitating reflections was now relieved while on the other hand he could not help feeling interest in the sharp and sarcastic information poured upon him by an observant though discontented courtier to whom a patient auditor and he a man of title and rank was as much a prize as his acute and communicative disposition rendered him an entertaining companion to nigel olifaunt heriot in the meantime neglected by sir mungo and avoiding every attempt by which the grateful politeness of lord glenvarloch strove to bring him into the conversation stood by with a kind of half smile on his countenance but whether excited by sir mungos wit or arising at his expense did not exactly appear  in the meantime the trio occupied a nook of the anteroom next to the door of the presencechamber which was not yet thrown open when maxwell with his rod of office came bustling into the apartment where most men excepting those of high rank made way for him he stopped beside the party in which we are interested looked for a moment at the young scots nobleman then made a slight obeisance to heriot and lastly addressing sir mungo malagrowther began a hurried complaint to him of the misbehaviour of the gentlemenpensioners and warders who suffered all sort of citizens suitors and scriveners to sneak into the outer apartments without either respect or decencythe english he said were scandalised for such a thing durst not be attempted in the queens days in her time there was then the courtyard for the mobility and the apartments for the nobility and it reflects on your place sir mungo he added belonging to the household as you do that such things should not be better ordered  here sir mungo afflicted as was frequently the case on such occasions with one of his usual fits of deafness answered it was no wonder the mobility used freedoms when those whom they saw in office were so little better in blood and havings than themselves  you are right sirquite right said maxwell putting his hand on the tarnished embroidery on the old knights sleevewhen such fellows see men in office dressed in castoff suits like paltry stageplayers it is no wonder the court is thronged with intruders  were you lauding the taste of my embroidery maister maxwell answered the knight who apparently interpreted the deputy chamberlains meaning rather from his action than his wordsit is of an ancient and liberal pattern having been made by your mothers father auld james stitchell a masterfashioner of honest repute in merlins wynd whom i made a point to employ as i am now happy to remember seeing your father thought fit to intermarry with sic a persons daughter  maxwell looked stern but conscious there was nothing to be got of sir mungo in the way of amends and that prosecuting the quarrel with such an adversary would only render him ridiculous and make public a misalliance of which he had no reason to be proud he covered his resentment with a sneer and expressing his regret that sir mungo was become too deaf to understand or attend to what was said to him walked on and planted himself beside the foldingdoors of the presencechamber at which he was to perform the duty of deputy chamberlain or usher so soon as they should be opened  the door of the presence is about to open said the goldsmith in a whisper to his young friend my condition permits me to go no farther with you fail not to present yourself boldly according to your birth and offer your supplication which the king will not refuse to accept and as i hope to consider favourably  as he spoke the door of the presencechamber opened accordingly and as is usual on such occasions the courtiers began to advance towards it and to enter in a slow but continuous and uninterrupted stream  as nigel presented himself in his turn at the entrance and mentioned his name and title maxwell seemed to hesitate you are not known to any one he said it is my duty to suffer no one to pass to the presence my lord whose face is unknown to me unless upon the word of a responsible person  i came with master george heriot said nigel in some embarrassment at this unexpected interruption  master heriots name will pass current for much gold and silver my lord replied maxwell with a civil sneer but not for birth and rank i am compelled by my office to be peremptorythe entrance is impededi am much concerned to say ityour lordship must stand back  what is the matter said an old scottish nobleman who had been speaking with george heriot after he had separated from nigel and who now came forward observing the altercation betwixt the latter and maxwell  it is only master deputychamberlain maxwell said sir mungo malagrowther expressing his joy to see lord glenvarloch at court whose father gave him his officeat least i think he is speaking to that purportfor your lordship kens my imperfection a subdued laugh such as the situation permitted passed round amongst those who heard this specimen of sir mungos sarcastic temper but the old nobleman stepped still more forward sayingwhatthe son of my gallant old opponent ochtred olifaunti will introduce him to the presence myself  so saying he took nigel by the arm without farther ceremony and was about to lead him forward when maxwell still keeping his rod across the door said but with hesitation and embarrassmentmy lord this gentleman is not known and i have orders to be scrupulous  tuttitaiti man said the old lord i will be answerable he is his fathers son from the cut of his eyebrowand thou maxwell knewest his father well enough to have spared thy scruples let us pass man so saying he put aside the deputychamberlains rod and entered the presenceroom still holding the young nobleman by the arm  why i must know you man he said i must know you i knew your father well man and i have broke a lance and crossed a blade with him and it is to my credit that i am living to brag of it he was kingsman and i was queensman during the douglas warsyoung fellows both that feared neither fire nor steel and we had some old feudal quarrels besides that had come down from father to son with our sealrings twoharided broadswords and platecoats and the crests on our burgonets  too loud my lord of huntinglen whispered a gentleman of the chamberthe kingthe king  the old earl for such he proved took the hint and was silent and james advancing from a sidedoor received in succession the compliments of strangers while a little group of favourite courtiers or officers of the household stood around him to whom he addressed himself from time to time some more pains had been bestowed on his toilette than upon the occasion when we first presented the monarch to our readers but there was a natural awkwardness about his figure which prevented his clothes from sitting handsomely and the prudence or timidity of his disposition had made him adopt the custom already noticed of wearing a dress so thickly quilted as might withstand the stroke of a dagger which added an ungainly stiffness to his whole appearance contrasting oddly with the frivolous ungraceful and fidgeting motions with which he accompanied his conversation and yet though the kings deportment was very undignified he had a manner so kind familiar and goodhumoured was so little apt to veil over or conceal his own foibles and had so much indulgence and sympathy for those of others that his address joined to his learning and a certain proportion of shrewd motherwit failed not to make a favourable impression on those who approached his person  when the earl of huntinglen had presented nigel to his sovereign a ceremony which the good peer took upon himself the king received the young lord very graciously and observed to his introducer that he was fain to see them twa stand side by side for i trow my lord huntinglen continued he your ancestors ay and een your lordships self and this lads father have stood front to front at the swords point and that is a worse posture  until your majesty said lord huntinglen made lord ochtred and me cross palms upon the memorable day when your majesty feasted all the nobles that were at feud together and made them join hands in your presence  i mind it weel said the king i mind it weelit was a blessed day being the nineteen of september of all days in the yearand it was a blithe sport to see how some of the carles girned as they clapped loofs together by my saul i thought some of them mair special the hieland chiels wad have broken out in our own presence but we caused them to march hand in hand to the cross ourselves leading the way and there drink a blithe cup of kindness with ilk other to the stanching of feud and perpetuation of amity auld john anderson was provost that yearthe carle grat for joy and the bailies and councillors danced bareheaded in our presence like five yearauld colts for very triumph  it was indeed a happy day said lord huntinglen and will not be forgotten in the history of your majestys reign  i would not that it were my lord replied the monarchi would not that it were pretermitted in our annals ay aybeati pacifici my english lieges here may weel make much of me for i would have them to know they have gotten the only peaceable man that ever came of my family if james with the fiery face had come amongst you he said looking round him or my great grandsire of flodden memory  we should have sent him back to the north again whispered one english nobleman  at least said another in the same inaudible tone we should have had a man to our sovereign though he were but a scotsman  and now my young springald said the king to lord glenvarloch where have you been spending your calftime  at leyden of late may it please your majesty answered lord nigel  aha a scholar said the king and by my saul a modest and ingenuous youth that hath not forgotten how to blush like most of our travelled monsieurs we will treat him conformably  then drawing himself up coughing slightly and looking around him with the conscious importance of superior learning while all the courtiers who understood or understood not latin pressed eagerly forward to listen the sapient monarch prosecuted his inquiries as follows  hem hem salve bis quaterque salve glenvarlochides noster nuperumne ab lugduno batavorum britanniam rediisti  the young nobleman replied bowing low  imo rex augustissimebiennium fere apud lugdunenses moratus sum  james proceeded  biennium dicis bene bene optume factum estnon uno die quod dicuntintelligisti domine glenvarlochiensis aha  nigel replied by a reverent bow and the king turning to those behind him said  adolescens quidem ingenui vultus ingenuique pudoris then resumed his learned queries et quid hodie lugdunenses loquunturvossius vester nihilne novi scripsitnihil certe quod doleo typis recenter editit  valet quidem vossius rex benevole replied nigel ast senex veneratissimus annum agit ni fallor septuagesimum  virum mehercle vix tam grandaevum crediderim replied the monarch et vorstius istearminii improbi successor aeque ac sectatorherosne adhuc ut cum homero loquar zoos esti kai epi thoni derkov text in greek  nigel by good fortune remembered that vorstius the divine last mentioned in his majestys queries about the state of dutch literature had been engaged in a personal controversy with james in which the king had taken so deep an interest as at length to hint in his public correspondence with the united states that they would do well to apply the secular arm to stop the progress of heresy by violent measures against the professors persona demand which their mighty mightinesses principles of universal toleration induced them to elude though with some difficulty knowing all this lord glenvarloch though a courtier of only five minutes standing had address enough to reply  vivum quidem haud diu est hominem videbamvigere autem quis dicat qui sub fulminibus eloquentiae tuae rex magne jamdudum pronus jacet et prostratus  footnote lest any lady or gentleman should suspect there is aught of mystery concealed under the sentences printed in italics they will be pleased to understand that they contain only a few commonplace latin phrases relating to the state of letters in holland which neither deserve nor would endure a literal translation  this last tribute to his polemical powers completed jamess happiness which the triumph of exhibiting his erudition had already raised to a considerable height  he rubbed his hands snapped his fingers fidgeted chuckled exclaimedeuge belle optime and turning to the bishops of exeter and oxford who stood behind him he saidye see my lords no bad specimen of our scottish latinity with which language we would all our subjects of england were as well embued as this and other youths of honourable birth in our auld kingdom also we keep the genuine and roman pronunciation like other learned nations on the continent sae that we hold communing with any scholar in the universe who can but speak the latin tongue whereas ye our learned subjects of england have introduced into your universities otherwise most learned a fashion of pronouncing like unto the nippit foot and clippit foot of the bride in the fairy tale whilk manner of speech take it not amiss that i be round with you can be understood by no nation on earth saving yourselves whereby latin quoad anglos ceaseth to be communis lingua the general dragoman or interpreter between all the wise men of the earth  the bishop of exeter bowed as in acquiescence to the royal censure but he of oxford stood upright as mindful over what subjects his see extended and as being equally willing to become food for fagots in defence of the latinity of the university as for any article of his religious creed  the king without awaiting an answer from either prelate proceeded to question lord nigel but in the vernacular tongueweel my likely alumnus of the muses and what make you so far from the north  to pay my homage to your majesty said the young nobleman kneeling on one knee and to lay before you he added this my humble and dutiful supplication  the presenting of a pistol would certainly have startled king james more but could setting apart the fright hardly have been more unpleasing to his indolent disposition  and is it even so man said he and can no single man were it but for the rarity of the case ever come up frae scotland excepting ex propositoon set purpose to see what he can make out of his loving sovereign it is but three days syne that we had weel nigh lost our life and put three kingdoms into duleweeds from the over haste of a clumsyhanded peasant to thrust a packet into our hand and now we are beset by the like impediment in our very court to our secretary with that gear my lordto our secretary with that gear  i have already offered my humble supplication to your majestys secretary of state said lord glenvarlochbut it seems  that he would not receive it i warrant said the king interrupting him bu my saul our secretary kens that point of kingcraft called refusing better than we do and will look at nothing but what he likes himselli think i wad make a better secretary to him than he to meweel my lord you are welcome to london and as ye seem an acute and learned youth i advise ye to turn your neb northward as soon as ye like and settle yoursell for a while at saint andrews and we will be right glad to hear that you prosper in your studies incumbite remis fortiter  while the king spoke thus he held the petition of the young lord carelessly like one who only delayed till the supplicants back was turned to throw it away or at least lay it aside to be no more looked at the petitioner who read this in his cold and indifferent looks and in the manner in which he twisted and crumpled together the paper arose with a bitter sense of anger and disappointment made a profound obeisance and was about to retire hastily but lord huntinglen who stood by him checked his intention by an almost imperceptible touch upon the skirt of his cloak and nigel taking the hint retreated only a few steps from the royal presence and then made a pause in the meantime lord huntinglen kneeled before james in his turn and saidmay it please your majesty to remember that upon one certain occasion you did promise to grant me a boon every year of your sacred life  i mind it weel man answered james i mind it weel and good reason whyit was when you unclasped the fause traitor ruthvens fangs from about our royal throat and drove your dirk into him like a true subject we did then as you remind us whilk was unnecessary being partly beside ourselves with joy at our liberation promise we would grant you a free boon every year whilk promise on our coming to menseful possession of our royal faculties we did confirm restrictive always and conditionaliter that your lordships demand should be such as we in our royal discretion should think reasonable  even so gracious sovereign said the old earl and may i yet farther crave to know if i have ever exceeded the bounds of your royal benevolence  by my word man no said the king i cannot remember you have asked much for yourself if it be not a dog or a hawk or a buck out of our park at theobalds or such like but to what serves this preface  to the boon to which i am now to ask of your grace said lord huntinglen which is that your majesty would be pleased on the instant to look at the placet of lord glenvarloch and do upon it what your own just and royal nature shall think meet and just without reference to your secretary or any other of your council  by my saul my lord this is strange said the king ye are pleading for the son of your enemy  of one who was my enemy till your majesty made him my friend answered lord huntinglen  weel spoken my lord said the king and with a true christian spirit and respecting the supplication of this young man i partly guess where the matter lies and in plain troth i had promised to george heriot to be good to the ladbut then here the shoe pinches steenie and babie charles cannot abide himneither can your own son my lord and so methinks he had better go down to scotland before he comes toill luck by them  my son an it please your majesty so far as he is concerned shall not direct my doings said the earl nor any wildheaded young man of them all  why neither shall they mine replied the monarch by my fathers saul none of them all shall play rex with mei will do what i will and what i ought like a free king  your majesty will then grant me my boon said the lord huntinglen  ay marry will imarry will i said the king but follow me this way man where we may be more private  he led lord huntinglen with rather a hurried step through the courtiers all of whom gazed earnestly on this unwonted scene as is the fashion of all courts on similar occasions the king passed into a little cabinet and bade in the first moment lord huntinglen lock or bar the door but countermanded his direction in the next saying no no nobread o life man i am a free kingwill do what i will and what i shouldi am justus et tenax propositi man nevertheless keep by the door lord huntinglen in case steenie should come in with his mad humour  o my poor master groaned the earl of huntinglen when you were in your own cold country you had warmer blood in your veins  the king hastily looked over the petition or memorial every now and then glancing his eye towards the door and then sinking it hastily on the paper ashamed that lord huntinglen whom he respected should suspect him of timidity  to grant the truth he said after he had finished his hasty perusal this is a hard case and harder than it was represented to me though i had some inkling of it before and so the lad only wants payment of the siller due from us in order to reclaim his paternal estate but then huntinglen the lad will have other debtsand why burden himsell with sae mony acres of barren woodland let the land gang man let the land gang steenie has the promise of it from our scottish chancellorit is the best huntingground in scotlandand babie charles and steenie want to kill a buck there this next year they maun hae the landthey maun hae the land and our debt shall be paid to the young man plack and bawbee and he may have the spending of it at our court or if he has such an eard hunger wouns man well stuff his stomach with english land which is worth twice as much ay ten times as much as these accursed hills and heughs and mosses and muirs that he is sae keen after  all this while the poor king ambled up and down the apartment in a piteous state of uncertainty which was made more ridiculous by his shambling circular mode of managing his legs and his ungainly fashion on such occasions of fiddling with the bunches of ribbons which fastened the lower part of his dress  lord huntinglen listened with great composure and answered an it please your majesty there was an answer yielded by naboth when ahab coveted his vineyard the lord forbid that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee  ey my lordey my lord ejaculated james while all the colour mounted both to his cheek and nose i hope ye mean not to teach me divinity ye need not fear my lord that i will shun to do justice to every man and since your lordship will give me no help to take up this in a more peaceful mannerwhilk methinks would be better for the young man as i said beforewhysince it maun be sosdeath i am a free king man and he shall have his money and redeem his land and make a kirk and a miln of it an he will so saying he hastily wrote an order on the scottish exchequer for the sum in question and then added how they are to pay it i see not but i warrant he will find money on the order among the goldsmiths who can find it for every one but meand now you see my lord of huntinglen that i am neither an untrue man to deny you the boon whilk i became bound for nor an ahab to covet naboths vineyard nor a mere noseofwax to be twisted this way and that by favourites and counsellors at their pleasure i think you will grant now that i am none of those  you are my own native and noble prince said huntinglen as he knelt to kiss the royal handjust and generous whenever you listen to the workings of your own heart  ay ay said the king laughing goodnaturedly as he raised his faithful servant from the ground that is what ye all say when i do any thing to please ye therethere take the signmanual and away with you and this young fellow i wonder steenie and babie charles have not broken in on us before now  lord huntinglen hastened from the cabinet foreseeing a scene at which he was unwilling to be present but which sometimes occurred when james roused himself so far as to exert his own free will of which he boasted so much in spite of that of his imperious favourite steenie as he called the duke of buckingham from a supposed resemblance betwixt his very handsome countenance and that with which the italian artists represented the protomartyr stephen in fact the haughty favourite who had the unusual good fortune to stand as high in the opinion of the heirapparent as of the existing monarch had considerably diminished in his respect towards the latter and it was apparent to the more shrewd courtiers that james endured his domination rather from habit timidity and a dread of encountering his stormy passions than from any heartfelt continuation of regard towards him whose greatness had been the work of his own hands to save himself the pain of seeing what was likely to take place on the dukes return and to preserve the king from the additional humiliation which the presence of such a witness must have occasioned the earl left the cabinet as speedily as possible having first carefully pocketed the important signmanual  no sooner had he entered the presenceroom than he hastily sought lord glenvarloch who had withdrawn into the embrasure of one of the windows from the general gaze of men who seemed disposed only to afford him the notice which arises from surprise and curiosity and taking him by the arm without speaking led him out of the presence chamber into the first anteroom here they found the worthy goldsmith who approached them with looks of curiosity which were checked by the old lord who said hastily all is wellis your barge in waiting heriot answered in the affirmative then said lord huntinglen you shall give me a cast in it as the watermen say and i in requital will give you both your dinner for we must have some conversation together  they both followed the earl without speaking and were in the second anteroom when the important annunciation of the ushers and the hasty murmur with which all made ample way as the company repeated to each otherthe dukethe duke made them aware of the approach of the omnipotent favourite  he entered that unhappy minion of court favour sumptuously dressed in the picturesque attire which will live for ever on the canvas of vandyke and which marks so well the proud age when aristocracy though undermined and nodding to its fall still by external show and profuse expense endeavoured to assert its paramount superiority over the inferior orders the handsome and commanding countenance stately form and graceful action and manners of the duke of buckingham made him become that picturesque dress beyond any man of his time at present however his countenance seemed discomposed his dress a little more disordered than became the place his step hasty and his voice imperative  all marked the angry spot upon his brow and bore back so suddenly to make way for him that the earl of huntinglen who affected no extraordinary haste on the occasion with his companions who could not if they would have decently left him remained as it were by themselves in the middle of the room and in the very path of the angry favourite he touched his cap sternly as he looked on huntinglen but unbonneted to heriot and sunk his beaver with its shadowy plume as low as the floor with a profound air of mock respect in returning his greeting which he did simply and unaffectedly the citizen only saidtoo much courtesy my lord duke is often the reverse of kindness  i grieve you should think so master heriot answered the duke i only meant by my homage to claim your protection siryour patronage you are become i understand a solicitor of suitsa promoteran undertakera fautor of court suitors of merit and quality who chance to be pennyless i trust your bags will bear you out in your new boast  they will bear me the farther my lord duke answered the goldsmith that my boast is but small  o you do yourself less than justice my good master heriot continued the duke in the same tone of irony you have a marvellous courtfaction to be the son of an edinburgh tinker have the goodness to prefer me to the knowledge of the highborn nobleman who is honoured and advantaged by your patronage  that shall be my task said lord huntinglen with emphasis my lord duke i desire you to know nigel olifaunt lord glenvarloch representative of one of the most ancient and powerful baronial houses in scotlandlord glenvarloch i present you to his grace the duke of buckingham representative of sir george villiers knight of brookesby in the county of leicester  the duke coloured still more high as he bowed to lord glenvarloch scornfully a courtesy which the other returned haughtily and with restrained indignation we know each other then said the duke after a moments pause and as if he had seen something in the young nobleman which merited more serious notice than the bitter raillery with which he had commencedwe know each otherand you know me my lord for your enemy  i thank you for your plainness my lord duke replied nigel an open enemy is better than a hollow friend  for you my lord huntinglen said the duke methinks you have but now overstepped the limits of the indulgence permitted to you as the father of the princes friend and my own  by my word my lord duke replied the earl it is easy for any one to outstep boundaries of the existence of which he was not aware it is neither to secure my protection nor approbation that my son keeps such exalted company  o my lord we know you and indulge you said the duke you are one of those who presume for a lifelong upon the merit of one good action  in faith my lord and if it be so said the old earl i have at least the advantage of such as presume more than i do without having done any action of merit whatever but i mean not to quarrel with you my lordwe can neither be friends nor enemiesyou have your path and i have mine  buckingham only replied by throwing on his bonnet and shaking its lofty plume with a careless and scornful toss of the head they parted thus the duke walking onwards through the apartments and the others leaving the palace and repairing to whitehall stairs where they embarked on board the barge of the citizen     chapter x     bid not thy fortune troll upon the wheels   of yonder dancing cubes of mottled bone   and drown it not like egypts royal harlot   dissolving her rich pearl in the brimmd winecup   these are the arts lothario which shrink acres   into brief yardsbring sterling pounds to farthings   credit to infamy and the poor gull   who might have lived an honourd easy life   to ruin and an unregarded grave               the changes  when they were fairly embarked on the thames the earl took from his pocket the supplication and pointing out to george heriot the royal warrant indorsed thereon asked him if it were in due and regular form the worthy citizen hastily read it over thrust forth his hand as if to congratulate the lord glenvarloch then checked himself pulled out his barnacles a present from old david ramsay and again perused the warrant with the most businesslike and critical attention it is strictly correct and formal he said looking to the earl of huntinglen and i sincerely rejoice at it  i doubt nothing of its formality said the earl the king understands business well and if he does not practise it often it is only because indolence obscures parts which are naturally well qualified for the discharge of affairs but what is next to be done for our young friend master heriot you know how i am circumstanced scottish lords living at the english court have seldom command of money yet unless a sum can be presently raised on this warrant matters standing as you hastily hinted to me the mortgage wadset or whatever it is called will be foreclosed  it is true said heriot in some embarrassment there is a large sum wanted in redemptionyet if it is not raised there will be an expiry of the legal as our lawyers call it and the estate will be evicted  my noblemy worthy friends who have taken up my cause so undeservedly so unexpectedly said nigel do not let me be a burden on your kindness you have already done too much where nothing was merited  peace man peace said lord huntinglen and let old heriot and i puzzle this scent out he is about to openhark to him  my lord said the citizen the duke of buckingham sneers at our city moneybags yet they can sometimes open to prop a falling and a noble house  we know they can said lord huntinglenmind not buckingham he is a pegaramsayand now for the remedy  i partly hinted to lord glenvarloch already said heriot that the redemption money might be advanced upon such a warrant as the present and i will engage my credit that it can but then in order to secure the lender he must come in the shoes of the creditor to whom he advances payment  come in his shoes replied the earl why what have boots or shoes to do with this matter my good friend  it is a law phrase my lord my experience has made me pick up a few of them said heriot  ay and of better things along with them master george replied lord huntinglen but what means it  simply this resumed the citizen that the lender of this money will transact with the holder of the mortgage or wadset over the estate of glenvarloch and obtain from him such a conveyance to his right as shall leave the lands pledged for the debt in case the warrant upon the scottish exchequer should prove unproductive i fear in this uncertainty of public credit that without some such counter security it will be very difficult to find so large a sum  ho la said the earl of huntinglen halt there a thought strikes mewhat if the new creditor should admire the estate as a hunting field as much as my lord grace of buckingham seems to do and should wish to kill a buck there in the summer season it seems to me that on your plan master george our new friend will be as well entitled to block lord glenvarloch out of his inheritance as the present holder of the mortgage  the citizen laughed i will engage he said that the keenest sportsman to whom i may apply on this occasion shall not have a thought beyond the lord mayors easterhunt in epping forest but your lordships caution is reasonable the creditor must be bound to allow lord glenvarloch sufficient time to redeem his estate by means of the royal warrant and must wave in his favour the right of instant foreclosure which may be i should think the more easily managed as the right of redemption must be exercised in his own name  but where shall we find a person in london fit to draw the necessary writings said the earl if my old friend sir john skene of halyards had lived we should have had his advice but time presses and  i know said heriot an orphan lad a scrivener that dwells by temple bar he can draw deeds both after the english and scottish fashion and i have trusted him often in matters of weight and of importance i will send one of my servingmen for him and the mutual deeds may be executed in your lordships presence for as things stand there should be no delay his lordship readily assented and as they now landed upon the private stairs leading down to the river from the gardens of the handsome hotel which he inhabited the messenger was dispatched without loss of time  nigel who had sat almost stupefied while these zealous friends volunteered for him in arranging the measures by which his fortune was to be disembarrassed now made another eager attempt to force upon them his broken expressions of thanks and gratitude but he was again silenced by lord huntinglen who declared he would not hear a word on that topic and proposed instead that they should take a turn in the pleached alley or sit upon the stone bench which overlooked the thames until his sons arrival should give the signal for dinner  i desire to introduce dalgarno and lord glenvarloch to each other he said as two who will be near neighbours and i trust will be more kind ones than their fathers were formerly there is but three scots miles betwixt the castles and the turrets of the one are visible from the battlements of the other  the old earl was silent for a moment and appeared to muse upon the recollections which the vicinity of the castles had summoned up  does lord dalgarno follow the court to newmarket next week said heriot by way of removing the conversation  he proposes so i think answered lord huntinglen relapsed into his reverie for a minute or two and then addressed nigel somewhat abruptly  my young friend when you attain possession of your inheritance as i hope you soon will i trust you will not add one to the idle followers of the court but reside on your patrimonial estate cherish your ancient tenants relieve and assist your poor kinsmen protect the poor against subaltern oppression and do what our fathers used to do with fewer lights and with less means than we have  and yet the advice to keep the country said heriot comes from an ancient and constant ornament of the court  from an old courtier indeed said the earl and the first of my family that could so write himselfmy grey beard falls on a cambric ruff and a silken doubletmy fathers descended upon a buff coat and a breastplate i would not that those days of battle returned but i should love well to make the oaks of my old forest of dalgarno ring once more with halloo and horn and hound and to have the old stone arched hall return the hearty shout of my vassals and tenants as the bicker and the quaigh walked their rounds amongst them i should like to see the broad tay once more before i dienot even the thames can match it in my mind  surely my lord said the citizen all this might be easily done it costs but a moments resolution and the journey of some brief days and you will be where you desire to bewhat is there to prevent you  habits master george habits replied the earl which to young men are like threads of silk so lightly are they worn so soon broken but which hang on our old limbs as if time had stiffened them into gyves of iron to go to scotland for a brief space were but labour in vain and when i think of abiding there i cannot bring myself to leave my old master to whom i fancy myself sometimes useful and whose weal and woe i have shared for so many years but dalgarno shall be a scottish noble  has he visited the north said heriot  he was there last year and made such a report of the country that the prince has expressed a longing to see it lord dalgarno is in high grace with his highness and the duke of buckingham observed the goldsmith  he is so answered the earli pray it may be for the advantage of them all the prince is just and equitable in his sentiments though cold and stately in his manners and very obstinate in his most trifling purposes and the duke noble and gallant and generous and open is fiery ambitious and impetuous dalgarno has none of these faults and such as he may have of his own may perchance be corrected by the society in which he movessee here he comes  lord dalgarno accordingly advanced from the farther end of the alley to the bench on which his father and his guests were seated so that nigel had full leisure to peruse his countenance and figure he was dressed pointdevice and almost to extremity in the splendid fashion of the time which suited well with his age probably about fiveand twenty with a noble form and fine countenance in which last could easily be traced the manly features of his father but softened by a more habitual air of assiduous courtesy than the stubborn old earl had ever condescended to assume towards the world in general in other respects his address was gallant free and unencumbered either by pride or ceremonyfar remote certainly from the charge either of haughty coldness or forward impetuosity and so far his father had justly freed him from the marked faults which he ascribed to the manners of the prince and his favourite buckingham  while the old earl presented his young acquaintance lord glenvarloch to his son as one whom he would have him love and honour nigel marked the countenance of lord dalgarno closely to see if he could detect aught of that secret dislike which the king had in one of his broken expostulations seemed to intimate as arising from a clashing of interests betwixt his new friend and the great buckingham but nothing of this was visible on the contrary lord dalgarno received his new acquaintance with the open frankness and courtesy which makes conquest at once when addressed to the feelings of an ingenuous young man  it need hardly be told that his open and friendly address met equally ready and cheerful acceptation from nigel olifaunt for many months and while a youth not much above twoandtwenty he had been restrained by circumstances from the conversation of his equals when on his fathers sudden death he left the low countries for scotland he had found himself involved to all appearance inextricably with the details of the law all of which threatened to end in the alienation of the patrimony which should support his hereditary rank his term of sincere mourning joined to injured pride and the swelling of the heart under unexpected and undeserved misfortune together with the uncertainty attending the issue of his affairs had induced the young lord of glenvarloch to live while in scotland in a very private and reserved manner how he had passed his time in london the reader is acquainted with but this melancholy and secluded course of life was neither agreeable to his age nor to his temper which was genial and sociable he hailed therefore with sincere pleasure the approaches which a young man of his own age and rank made towards him and when he had exchanged with lord dalgarno some of those words and signals by which as surely as by those of freemasonry young people recognise a mutual wish to be agreeable to each other it seemed as if the two noblemen had been acquainted for some time  just as this tacit intercourse had been established one of lord huntinglens attendants came down the alley marshalling onwards a man dressed in black buckram who followed him with tolerable speed considering that according to his sense of reverence and propriety he kept his body bent and parallel to the horizon from the moment that he came in sight of the company to which he was about to be presented  who is this you cuckoldy knave said the old lord who had retained the keen appetite and impatience of a scottish baron even during a long alienation from his native country and why does john cook with a murrain to him keep back dinner  i believe we are ourselves responsible for this persons intrusion said george heriot this is the scrivener whom we desired to see look up man and see us in the face as an honest man should instead of beating thy noddle charged against us thus like a batteringram  the scrivener did look up accordingly with the action of an automaton which suddenly obeys the impulse of a pressed spring but strange to tell not even the haste he had made to attend his patrons mandate a business as master heriots message expressed of weight and importancenay not even the state of depression in which out of sheer humility doubtless he had his head stooped to the earth from the moment he had trod the demesnes of the earl of huntinglen had called any colour into his countenance the drops stood on his brow from haste and toil but his cheek was still pale and tallowcoloured as before nay what seemed stranger his very hair when he raised his head hung down on either cheek as straight and sleek and undisturbed as it was when we first introduced him to our readers seated at his quiet and humble desk  lord dalgarno could not forbear a stifled laugh at the ridiculous and puritanical figure which presented itself like a starved anatomy to the company and whispered at the same time into lord glenvarlochs ear       the devil damn thee black thou creamfaced loon       where gotst thou that gooselook  nigel was too little acquainted with the english stage to understand a quotation which had already grown matter of common allusion in london lord dalgarno saw that he was not understood and continued that fellow by his visage should either be a saint or a most hypocritical rogueand such is my excellent opinion of human nature that i always suspect the worst but they seem deep in business will you take a turn with me in the garden my lord or will you remain a member of the serious conclave  with you my lord most willingly said nigel and they were turning away accordingly when george heriot with the formality belonging to his station observed that as their business concerned lord glenvarloch he had better remain to make himself master of it and witness to it  my presence is utterly needless my good lordand my best friend master heriot said the young nobleman i shall understand nothing the better for cumbering you with my ignorance in these matters and can only say at the end as i now say at the beginning that i dare not take the helm out of the hand of the kind pilots who have already guided my course within sight of a fair and unhopedfor haven whatever you recommend to me as fitting i shall sign and seal and the import of the deeds i shall better learn by a brief explanation from master heriot if he will bestow so much trouble in my behalf than by a thousand learned words and law terms from this person of skill  he is right said lord huntinglen our young friend is right in confiding these matters to you and me master george heriothe has not misplaced his confidence  master george heriot cast a long look after the two young noblemen who had now walked down the alley arminarm and at length said he hath not indeed misplaced his confidence as your lordship well and truly saysbut nevertheless he is not in the right path for it behoves every man to become acquainted with his own affairs so soon as he hath any that are worth attending to  when he had made this observation they applied themselves with the scrivener to look into various papers and to direct in what manner writings should be drawn which might at once afford sufficient security to those who were to advance the money and at the same time preserve the right of the young nobleman to redeem the family estate provided he should obtain the means of doing so by the expected reimbursement from the scottish exchequer or otherwise it is needless to enter into those details but it is not unimportant to mention as an illustration of character that heriot went into the most minute legal details with a precision which showed that experience had made him master even of the intricacies of scottish conveyancing and that the earl of huntinglen though far less acquainted with technical detail suffered no step of the business to pass over until he had attained a general but distinct idea of its import and its propriety  they seemed to be admirably seconded in their benevolent intentions towards the young lord glenvarloch by the skill and eager zeal of the scrivener whom heriot had introduced to this piece of business the most important which andrew had ever transacted in his life and the particulars of which were moreover agitated in his presence between an actual earl and one whose wealth and character might entitle him to be an alderman of his ward if not to be lord mayor in his turn  while they were thus in eager conversation on business the good earl even forgetting the calls of his appetite and the delay of dinner in his anxiety to see that the scrivener received proper instructions and that all was rightly weighed and considered before dismissing him to engross the necessary deeds the two young men walked together on the terrace which overhung the river and talked on the topics which lord dalgarno the elder and the more experienced thought most likely to interest his new friend  these naturally regarded the pleasures attending a court life and lord dalgarno expressed much surprise at understanding that nigel proposed an instant return to scotland  you are jesting with me he said all the court ringsit is needless to mince itwith the extraordinary success of your suit against the highest interest it is said now influencing the horizon at whitehall men think of youtalk of youfix their eyes on you ask each other who is this young scottish lord who has stepped so far in a single day they augur in whispers to each other how high and how far you may push your fortuneand all that you design to make of it is to return to scotland eat raw oatmeal cakes baked upon a peatfire have your hand shaken by every loon of a bluebonnet who chooses to dub you cousin though your relationship comes by noah drink scots twopenny ale eat halfstarved reddeer venison when you can kill it ride upon a galloway and be called my right honourable and maist worthy lord  there is no great gaiety in the prospect before me i confess said lord glenvarloch even if your father and good master heriot should succeed in putting my affairs on some footing of plausible hope and yet i trust to do something for my vassals as my ancestors before me and to teach my children as i have myself been taught to make some personal sacrifices if they be necessary in order to maintain with dignity the situation in which they are placed by providence  lord dalgarno after having once or twice stifled his laughter during this speech at length broke out into a fit of mirth so hearty and so resistless that angry as he was the call of sympathy swept nigel along with him and despite of himself he could not forbear to join in a burst of laughter which he thought not only causeless but almost impertinent  he soon recollected himself however and said in a tone qualified to allay lord dalgarnos extreme mirth this is all well my lord but how am i to understand your merriment lord dalgarno only answered him with redoubled peals of laughter and at length held by lord glenvarlochs cloak as if to prevent his falling down on the ground in the extremity of his convulsion  at length while nigel stood half abashed half angry at becoming thus the subject of his new acquaintances ridicule and was only restrained from expressing his resentment against the son by a sense of the obligations he owed the father lord dalgarno recovered himself and spoke in a halfbroken voice his eyes still running with tears i crave your pardon my dear lord glenvarlochten thousand times do i crave your pardon but that last picture of rural dignity accompanied by your grave and angry surprise at my laughing at what would have made any courtbred hound laugh that had but so much as bayed the moon once from the courtyard at whitehall totally overcame me why my liefest and dearest lord you a young and handsome fellow with high birth a title and the name of an estate so well received by the king at your first starting as makes your further progress scarce matter of doubt if you know how to improve itfor the king has already said you are a braw lad and well studied in the more humane lettersyou too whom all the women and the very marked beauties of the court desire to see because you came from leyden were born in scotland and have gained a hardcontested suit in englandyou i say with a person like a prince an eye of fire and a wit as quick to think of throwing your cards on the table when the game is in your very hand running back to the frozen north and marryinglet me seea tall stalking blueeyed fairskinned bony wench with eighteen quarters in her scutcheon a sort of lots wife newly descended from her pedestal and with her to shut yourself up in your tapestried chamber uh gadswouns i shall never survive the idea  it is seldom that youth however highminded is able from mere strength of character and principle to support itself against the force of ridicule half angry half mortified and to say truth half ashamed of his more manly and better purpose nigel was unable and flattered himself it was unnecessary to play the part of a rigid moral patriot in presence of a young man whose current fluency of language as well as his experience in the highest circles of society gave him in spite of nigels better and firmer thoughts a temporary ascendency over him he sought therefore to compromise the matter and avoid farther debate by frankly owning that if to return to his own country were not his choice it was at least a matter of necessity his affairs he said were unsettled his income precarious  and where is he whose affairs are settled or whose income is less than precarious that is to be found in attendance on the court said lord dalgarno all are either losing or winning those who have wealth come hither to get rid of it while the happy gallants who like you and i dear glenvarloch have little or none have every chance to be sharers in their spoils  i have no ambition of that sort said nigel and if i had i must tell you plainly lord dalgarno i have not the means to do so i can scarce as yet call the suit i wear my own i owe it and i do riot blush to say so to the friendship of yonder good man  i will not laugh again if i can help it said lord dalgarno but lord that you should have gone to a wealthy goldsmith for your habit why i could have brought you to an honest confiding tailor who should have furnished you with halfadozen merely for love of the little word lordship which you place before your nameand then your goldsmith if he be really a friendly goldsmith should have equipped you with such a purse of fair rosenobles as would have bought you thrice as many suits or done better things for you  i do not understand these fashions my lord said nigel his displeasure mastering his shame were i to attend the court of my sovereign it should be when i could maintain without shifting or borrowing the dress and retinue which my rank requires  which my rank requires said lord dalgarno repeating his last words that now is as good as if my father had spoke it i fancy you would love to move to court with him followed by a round score of old bluebottles with white heads and red noses with bucklers and broadswords which their hands trembling betwixt age and strong waters can make no use ofas many huge silver badges on their arms to show whose fools they are as would furnish forth a court cupboard of platerogues fit for nothing but to fill our antechambers with the flavour of onions and genievrepah  the poor knaves said lord glenvarloch they have served your father it may be in the wars what would become of them were he to turn them off  why let them go to the hospital said dalgarno or to the bridge end to sell switches the king is a better man than my father and you see those who have served in his wars do so every day or when their blue coats were well worn out they would make rare scarecrows here is a fellow now comes down the walk the stoutest raven dared not come within a yard of that copper nose i tell you there is more service as you will soon see in my valet of the chamber and such a lither lad as my page lutin than there is in a score of these old memorials of the douglas wars footnote the cruel civil wars waged by the scottish barons during the minority of james vi had the name from the figure made in them by the celebrated james douglas earl of morton both sides executed their prisoners without mercy or favour where they cut each others throats for the chance of finding twelve pennies scots on the person of the slain marry my lord to make amends they will eat mouldy victuals and drink stale ale as if their bellies were puncheonsbut the dinnerbell is going to sound hark it is clearing its rusty throat with a preliminary jowl that is another clamorous relic of antiquity that were i master should soon be at the bottom of the thames how the foul fiend can it interest the peasants and mechanics in the strand to know that the earl of huntinglen is sitting down to dinner but my father looks our waywe must not be late for the grace or we shall be in disgrace if you will forgive a quibble which would have made his majesty laugh you will find us all of a piece and having been accustomed to eat in saucers abroad i am ashamed you should witness our larded capons our mountains of beef and oceans of brewis as large as highland hills and lochs but you shall see better cheer tomorrow where lodge you i will call for you i must be your guide through the peopled desert to certain enchanted lands which you will scarce discover without chart and pilot where lodge you  i will meet you in pauls said nigel a good deal embarrassed at any hour you please to name  o you would be private said the young lord nay fear not mei will be no intruder but we have attained this huge larder of flesh fowl and fish i marvel the oaken boards groan not under it  they had indeed arrived in the diningparlour of the mansion where the table was superabundantly loaded and where the number of attendants to a certain extent vindicated the sarcasms of the young nobleman the chaplain and sir mungo malagrowther were of the party the latter complimented lord glenvarloch upon the impression he had made at court one would have thought ye had brought the apple of discord in your pouch my lord or that you were the very firebrand of whilk althea was delivered and that she had lainin in a barrel of gunpowder for the king and the prince and the duke have been by the lugs about ye and so have many more that kendna before this blessed day that there was such a man living on the face of the earth  mind your victuals sir mungo said the earl they get cold while you talk troth and that needsna my lord said the knight your lordships dinners seldom scald ones mouththe servingmen are turning auld like oursells my lord and it is far between the kitchen and the ha  with this little explosion of his spleen sir mungo remained satisfied until the dishes were removed when fixing his eyes on the brave new doublet of lord dalgarno he complimented him on his economy pretending to recognise it as the same which his father had worn in edinburgh in the spanish ambassadors time lord dalgarno too much a man of the world to be moved by any thing from such a quarter proceeded to crack some nuts with great deliberation as he replied that the doublet was in some sort his fathers as it was likely to cost him fifty pounds some day soon sir mungo forthwith proceeded in his own way to convey this agreeable intelligence to the earl observing that his son was a better maker of bargains than his lordship for he had bought a doublet as rich as that his lordship wore when the spanish ambassador was at holyrood and it had cost him but fifty pounds scotsthat was no fools bargain my lord  pounds sterling if you please sir mungo answered the earl calmly and a fools bargain it is in all the tenses dalgarno was a fool when he boughti will be a fool when i payand you sir mungo craving your pardon are a fool in praesenti for speaking of what concerns you not  so saying the earl addressed himself to the serious business of the table and sent the wine around with a profusion which increased the hilarity but rather threatened the temperance of the company until their joviality was interrupted by the annunciation that the scrivener had engrossed such deeds as required to be presently executed  george heriot rose from the table observing that winecups and legal documents were unseemly neighbours the earl asked the scrivener if they had laid a trencher and set a cup for him in the buttery and received the respectful answer that heaven forbid he should be such an ungracious beast as to eat or drink until his lordships pleasure was performed  thou shalt eat before thou goest said lord huntinglen and i will have thee try moreover whether a cup of sack cannot bring some colour into these cheeks of thine it were a shame to my household thou shouldst glide out into the strand after such a spectrefashion as thou now wearestlook to it dalgarno for the honour of our roof is concerned  lord dalgarno gave directions that the man should be attended to lord glenvarloch and the citizen in the meanwhile signed and interchanged and thus closed a transaction of which the principal party concerned understood little save that it was under the management of a zealous and faithful friend who undertook that the money should be forthcoming and the estate released from forfeiture by payment of the stipulated sum for which it stood pledged and that at the term of lambmas and at the hour of noon and beside the tomb of the regent earl of murray in the high kirk of saint giles at edinburgh being the day and place assigned for such redemption footnote as each covenant in those days of accuracy had a special place nominated for execution the tomb of the regent earl of murray in saint giless church was frequently assigned for the purpose  when this business was transacted the old earl would fain have renewed his carouse but the citizen alleging the importance of the deeds he had about him and the business he had to transact betimes the next morning not only refused to return to table but carried with him to his barge lord glenvarloch who might perhaps have been otherwise found more tractable  when they were seated in the boat and fairly once more afloat on the river george heriot looked back seriously on the mansion they had leftthere live he said the old fashion and the new the father is like a noble old broadsword but harmed with rust from neglect and inactivity the son is your modern rapier wellmounted fairly gilt and fashioned to the taste of the timeand it is time must evince if the metal be as good as the show god grant it prove so says an old friend to the family  nothing of consequence passed betwixt them until lord glenvarloch landing at pauls wharf took leave of his friend the citizen and retired to his own apartment where his attendant richie not a little elevated with the events of the day and with the hospitality of lord huntinglens housekeeping gave a most splendid account of them to the buxom dame nelly who rejoiced to hear that the sun at length was shining upon what richie called the right side of the hedge     chapter xi     you are not for the manner nor the times   they have their vices now most like to virtues   you cannot know them apait by any difference   they wear the same clothes eat the same meat   sleep i the selfsame beds ride in those coaches   or very like four horses in a coach   as the best men and women                             ben jonson  on the following morning while nigel his breakfast finished was thinking how he should employ the day there was a little bustle upon the stairs which attracted his attention and presently entered dame nelly blushing like scarlet and scarce able to bring outa young nobleman sirno one less she added drawing her hand slightly over her lips would be so saucya young nobleman sir to wait on you  and she was followed into the little cabin by lord dalgarno gay easy disembarrassed and apparently as much pleased to rejoin his new acquaintance as if he had found him in the apartments of a palace nigel on the contrary for youth is slave to such circumstances was discountenanced and mortified at being surprised by so splendid a gallant in a chamber which at the moment the elegant and highdressed cavalier appeared in it seemed to its inhabitant yet lower narrower darker and meaner than it had ever shown before he would have made some apology for the situation but lord dalgarno cut him short  not a word of it he said not a single wordi know why you ride at anchor herebut i can keep counselso pretty a hostess would recommend worse quarters  on my wordon my honour said lord glenvarloch  nay nay make no words of the matter said lord dalgarno i am no telltale nor shall i cross your walk there is game enough in the forest thank heaven and i can strike a doe for myself  all this he said in so significant a manner and the explanation which he had adopted seemed to put lord glenvarlochs gallantry on so respectable a footing that nigel ceased to try to undeceive him and less ashamed perhaps for such is human weakness of supposed vice than of real poverty changed the discourse to something else and left poor dame nellys reputation and his own at the mercy of the young courtiers misconstruction  he offered refreshments with some hesitation lord dalgarno had long since breakfasted but had just come from playing a set of tennis he said and would willingly taste a cup of the pretty hostesss single beer this was easily procured was drunk was commended and as the hostess failed not to bring the cup herself lord dalgarno profited by the opportunity to take a second and more attentive view of her and then gravely drank to her husbands health with an almost imperceptible nod to lord glenvarloch dame nelly was much honoured smoothed her apron down with her hands and said  her john was greatly and truly honoured by their lordshipshe was a kind painstaking man for his family as was in the alley or indeed as far north as pauls chain  she would have proceeded probably to state the difference betwixt their ages as the only alloy to their nuptial happiness but her lodger who had no mind to be farther exposed to his gay friends raillery gave her contrary to his wont a signal to leave the room  lord dalgarno looked after her and then looked at glenvarloch shook his head and repeated the wellknown lines  my lord beware of jealousy  it is the greeneyed monster which doth make  the meat it feeds on  but come he said changing his tone i know not why i should worry you thusi who have so many follies of my own when i should rather make excuse for being here at all and tell you wherefore i came  so saying he reached a seat and placing another for lord glenvarloch in spite of his anxious haste to anticipate this act of courtesy he proceeded in the same tone of easy familiarity  we are neighbours my lord and are just made known to each other now i know enough of the dear north to be well aware that scottish neighbours must be either dear friends or deadly enemiesmust either walk handinhand or stand swordpoint to swordpoint so i choose the handinhand unless you should reject my proffer  how were it possible my lord said lord glenvarloch to refuse what is offered so frankly even if your father had not been a second father to meand as he took lord dalgarnos hand he addedi have i think lost no time since during one days attendance at court i have made a kind friend and a powerful enemy  the friend thanks you replied lord dalgarno for your just opinion but my dear glenvarlochor rather for titles are too formal between us of the better filewhat is your christian name  nigel replied lord glenvarloch  then we will be nigel and malcolm to each other said his visitor and my lord to the plebeian world around us but i was about to ask you whom you suppose your enemy  no less than the allpowerful favourite the great duke of buckingham  you dream what could possess you with such an opinion said dalgarno  he told me so himself replied glenvarloch and in so doing dealt frankly and honourably with me  o you know him not yet said his companion the duke is moulded of an hundred noble and fiery qualities that prompt him like a generous horse to spring aside in impatience at the least obstacle to his forward course but he means not what he says in such passing heatsi can do more with him i thank heaven than most who are around him you shall go visit him with me and you will see how you shall be received  i told you my lord said glenvarloch firmly and with some haughtiness the duke of buckingham without the least offence declared himself my enemy in the face of the court and he shall retract that aggression as publicly as it was given ere i will make the slightest advance towards him  you would act becomingly in every other case said lord dalgarno but here you are wrong in the court horizon buckingham is lord of the ascendant and as he is adverse or favouring so sinks or rises the fortune of a suitor the king would bid you remember your phaedrus  arripiens geminas ripis cedentibus ollas  and so forth you are the vase of earth beware of knocking yourself against the vase of iron  the vase of earth said glenvarloch will avoid the encounter by getting ashore out of the currenti mean to go no more to court  o to court you necessarily must go you will find your scottish suit move ill without it for there is both patronage and favour necessary to enforce the signmanual you have obtained of that we will speak more hereafter but tell me in the meanwhile my dear nigel whether you did not wonder to see me here so early  i am surprised that you could find me out in this obscure corner said lord glenvarloch  my page lutin is a very devil for that sort of discovery replied lord dalgarno i have but to say goblin i would know where he or she dwells and he guides me thither as if by art magic  i hope he waits not now in the street my lord said nigel i will send my servant to seek him  do not concern yourselfhe is by this time said lord dalgarno playing at hustlecap and chuckfarthing with the most blackguard imps upon the wharf unless he hath foregone his old customs  are you not afraid said lord glenvarloch that in such company his morals may become depraved  let his company look to their own answered lord dalgarno cooly for it will be a company of real fiends in which lutin cannot teach more mischief than he can learn he is i thank the gods most thoroughly versed in evil for his years i am spared the trouble of looking after his moralities for nothing can make them either better or worse  i wonder you can answer this to his parents my lord said nigel  i wonder where i should find his parents replied his companion to render an account to them  he may be an orphan said lord nigel but surely being a page in your lordships family his parents must be of rank  of as high rank as the gallows could exalt them to replied lord dalgarno with the same indifference they were both hanged i believeat least the gipsies from whom i bought him five years ago intimated as much to meyou are surprised at this now but is it not better that instead of a lazy conceited wheyfaced slip of gentility to whom in your oldworld idea of the matter i was bound to stand sir pedagogue and see that he washed his hands and face said his prayers learned his acddens spoke no naughty words brushed his hat and wore his best doublet only on sundaythat instead of such a jacky goodchild i should have something like this  he whistled shrill and clear and the page he spoke of darted into the room almost with the effect of an actual apparition from his height he seemed but fifteen but from his face might be two or even three years older very neatly made and richly dressed with a thin bronzed visage which marked his gipsy descent and a pair of sparkling black eyes which seemed almost to pierce through those whom he looked at  there he is said lord dalgarno fit for every elementprompt to execute every command good bad or indifferentunmatched in his tribe as rogue thief and liar  all which qualities said the undaunted page have each in turn stood your lordship in stead  out you imp of satan said his master vanishbegoneor my conjuring rod goes about your ears the boy turned and disappeared as suddenly as he had entered you see said lord dalgarno that in choosing my household the best regard i can pay to gentle blood is to exclude it from my servicethat very gallowsbird were enough to corrupt a whole antechamber of pages though they were descended from kings and kaisers  i can scarce think that a nobleman should need the offices of such an attendant as your goblin said nigel you are but jesting with my inexperience  time will show whether i jest or not my dear nigel replied dalgarno in the meantime i have to propose to you to take the advantage of the floodtide to run up the river for pastime and at noon i trust you will dine with me  nigel acquiesced in a plan which promised so much amusement and his new friend and he attended by lutin and moniplies who greatly resembled when thus associated the conjunction of a bear and a monkey took possession of lord dalgarnos wherry which with its badged watermen bearing his lordships crest on their arms lay in readiness to receive them the air was delightful upon the river and the lively conversation of lord dalgarno added zest to the pleasures of the little voyage he could not only give an account of the various public buildings and noblemens houses which they passed in ascending the thames but knew how to season his information with abundance of anecdote political innuendo and personal scandal if he had not very much wit he was at least completely master of the fashionable tone which in that time as in ours more than amply supplies any deficiency of the kind  it was a style of conversation entirely new to his companion as was the world which lord dalgarno opened to his observation and it is no wonder that nigel notwithstanding his natural good sense and high spirit admitted more readily than seemed consistent with either the tone of authoritative instruction which his new friend assumed towards him there would indeed have been some difficulty in making a stand to attempt a high and stubborn tone of morality in answer to the light strain of lord dalgarnos conversation which kept on the frontiers between jest and earnest would have seemed pedantic and ridiculous and every attempt which nigel made to combat his companions propositions by reasoning as jocose as his own only showed his inferiority in that gay species of controversy and it must be owned besides though internally disapproving much of what he heard lord glenvarloch young as he was in society became less alarmed by the language and manners of his new associate than in prudence he ought to have been  lord dalgarno was unwilling to startle his proselyte by insisting upon any topic which appeared particularly to jar with his habits or principles and he blended his mirth and his earnest so dexterously that it was impossible for nigel to discover how far he was serious in his propositions or how far they flowed from a wild and extravagant spirit of raillery and ever and anon those flashes of spirit and honour crossed his conversation which seemed to intimate that when stirred to action by some adequate motive lord dalgarno would prove something very different from the courthaunting and easeloving voluptuary which he was pleased to represent as his chosen character  as they returned down the river lord glenvarloch remarked that the boat passed the mansion of lord huntinglen and noticed the circumstance to lord dalgarno observing that he thought they were to have dined there surely no said the young nobleman i have more mercy on you than to gorge you a second time with raw beef and canary wine i propose something better for you i promise you than such a second scythian festivity and as for my father he proposes to dine today with my grave ancient earl of northampton whilome that celebrated putterdown of pretended prophecies lord henry howard  and do you not go with him said his companion  to what purpose said lord dalgarno to hear his wise lordship speak musty politics in false latin which the old fox always uses that he may give the learned majesty of england an opportunity of correcting his slips in grammar that were a rare employment  nay said lord nigel but out of respect to wait on my lord your father  my lord my father replied lord dalgarno has bluebottles enough to wait on him and can well dispense with such a butterfly as myself he can lift the cup of sack to his head without my assistance and should the said paternal head turn something giddy there be men enough to guide his right honourable lordship to his lordships right honourable couchnow do not stare at me nigel as if my words were to sink the boat with us i love my fatheri love him dearlyand i respect him too though i respect not many things a trustier old trojan never belted a broadsword by a loop of leather but what then he belongs to the old world i to the new he has his follies i have mine and the less either of us sees of the others peccadilloes the greater will be the honour and respectthat i think is the proper phrasei say the respect in which we shall hold each other being apart each of us is himself such as nature and circumstances have made him but couple us up too closely together you will be sure to have in your leash either an old hypocrite or a young one or perhaps both the one and tother  as he spoke thus the boat put into the landingplace at blackfriars lord dalgarno sprung ashore and flinging his cloak and rapier to his page recommended to his companion to do the like we are coming among a press of gallants he said and if we walked thus muffled we shall look like your tawnyvisaged don who wraps him close in his cloak to conceal the defects of his doublet  i have known many an honest man do that if it please your lordship said richie moniplies who had been watching for an opportunity to intrude himself on the conversation and probably remembered what had been his own condition in respect to cloak and doublet at a very recent period  lord dalgarno stared at him as if surprised at his assurance but immediately answered you may have known many things friend but in the meanwhile you do not know what principally concerns your master namely how to carry his cloak so as to show to advantage the gold laced seams and the lining of sables see how lutin holds the sword with his cloak cast partly over it yet so as to set off the embossed hilt and the silver work of the mountinggive your familiar your sword nigel he continued addressing lord glenvarloch that he may practise a lesson in an art so necessary  is it altogether prudent said nigel unclasping his weapon and giving it to richie to walk entirely unarmed  and wherefore not said his companion you are thinking now of auld reekie as my father fondly calls your good scottish capital where there is such bandying of private feuds and public factions that a man of any note shall not cross your high street twice without endangering his life thrice here sir no brawling in the street is permitted your bullheaded citizen takes up the case so soon as the sword is drawn and clubs is the word  and a hard word it is said richie as my brainpan kens at this blessed moment  were i your master sirrah said lord dalgarno i would make your brainpan as you call it boil over were you to speak a word in my presence before you were spoken to  richie murmured some indistinct answer but took the hint and ranked himself behind his master along with lutin who failed not to expose his new companion to the ridicule of the passersby by mimicking as often as he could do so unobserved by richie his stiff and upright stalking gait and discontented physiognomy  and tell me now my dear malcolm said nigel where we are bending our course and whether we shall dine at an apartment of yours  an apartment of mineyes surely answered lord dalgarno you shall dine at an apartment of mine and an apartment of yours and of twenty gallants besides and where the board shall present better cheer better wine and better attendance than if our whole united exhibitions went to maintain it we are going to the most noted ordinary of london  that is in common language an inn or a tavern said nigel  an inn or a tavern my most green and simple friend exclaimed lord dalgarno no nothese are places where greasy citizens take pipe and pot where the knavish pettifoggers of the law spunge on their most unhappy victimswhere templars crack jests as empty as their nuts and where small gentry imbibe such thin potations that they get dropsies instead of getting drunk an ordinary is a lateinvented institution sacred to bacchus and comus where the choicest noble gallants of the time meet with the first and most ethereal wits of the agewhere the wine is the very soul of the choicest grape refined as the genius of the poet and ancient and generous as the blood of the nobles and then the fare is something beyond your ordinary gross terrestrial food sea and land are ransacked to supply it and the invention of six ingenious cooks kept eternally upon the rack to make their art hold pace with and if possible enhance the exquisite quality of the materials  by all which rhapsody said lord glenvarloch i can only understand as i did before that we are going to a choice tavern where we shall be handsomely entertained on paying probably as handsome a reckoning  reckoning exclaimed lord dalgarno in the same tone as before perish the peasantly phrase what profanation monsieur le chevalier de beaujeu pink of paris and flower of gasconyhe who can tell the age of his wine by the bare smell who distils his sauces in an alembic by the aid of lullys philosophywho carves with such exquisite precision that he gives to noble knight and squire the portion of the pheasant which exactly accords with his ranknay he who shall divide a becafico into twelve parts with such scrupulous exactness that of twelve guests not one shall have the advantage of the other in a hairs breadth or the twentieth part of a drachm yet you talk of him and of a reckoning in the same breath why man he is the wellknown and general referee in all matters affecting the mysteries of passage hazard in and in penneeck and verquire and what notwhy beaujeu is king of the cardpack and duke of the dice boxhe call a reckoning like a greenaproned rednosed son of the vulgar spigot o my dearest nigel what a word you have spoken and of what a person that you know him not is your only apology for such blasphemy and yet i scarce hold it adequate for to have been a day in london and not to know beaujeu is a crime of its own kind but you shall know him this blessed moment and shall learn to hold yourself in horror for the enormities you have uttered  well but mark you said nigel this worthy chevalier keeps not all this good cheer at his own cost does he  no no answered lord dalgarno there is a sort of ceremony which my chevaliers friends and intimates understand but with which you have no business at present there is as majesty might say a symbolum to be disbursedin other words a mutual exchange of courtesies take place betwixt beaujeu and his guests he makes them a free present of the dinner and wine as often as they choose to consult their own felicity by frequenting his house at the hour of noon and they in gratitude make the chevalier a present of a jacobus then you must know that besides comus and bacchus that princess of sublunary affairs the diva fortuna is frequently worshipped at beaujeus and he as officiating highpriest hath as in reason he should a considerable advantage from a share of the sacrifice  in other words said lord glenvarloch this man keeps a gaming house  a house in which you may certainly game said lord dalgarno as you may in your own chamber if you have a mind nay i remember old tom tally played a hand at put for a wager with quinze le va the frenchman during morning prayers in st pauls the morning was misty and the parson drowsy and the whole audience consisted of themselves and a blind woman and so they escaped detection  for all this malcolm said the young lord gravely i cannot dine with you today at this same ordinary  and wherefore in the name of heaven should you draw back from your word said lord dalgarno  i do not retract my word malcolm but i am bound by an early promise to my father never to enter the doors of a gaminghouse  i tell you this is none said lord dalgarno it is but in plain terms an eatinghouse arranged on civiller terms and frequented by better company than others in this town and if some of them do amuse themselves with cards and hazard they are men of honour and who play as such and for no more than they can well afford to lose it was not and could not be such houses that your father desired you to avoid besides he might as well have made you swear you would never take accommodation of an inn tavern eatinghouse or place of public reception of any kind for there is no such place of public resort but where your eyes may be contaminated by the sight of a pack of pieces of painted pasteboard and your ears profaned by the rattle of those little spotted cubes of ivory the difference is that where we go we may happen to see persons of quality amusing themselves with a game and in the ordinary houses you will meet bullies and sharpers who will strive either to cheat or to swagger you out of your money  i am sure you would not willingly lead me to do what is wrong said nigel but my father had a horror for games of chance religious i believe as well as prudential he judged from i know not what circumstance a fallacious one i should hope that i should have a propensity to such courses and i have told you the promise which he exacted from me  now by my honour said dalgarno what you have said affords the strongest reason for my insisting that you go with me a man who would shun any danger should first become acquainted with its real bearing and extent and that in the company of a confidential guide and guard do you think i myself game good faith my fathers oaks grow too far from london and stand too fast rooted in the rocks of perthshire for me to troll them down with a die though i have seen whole forests go down like ninepins no nothese are sports for the wealthy southron not for the poor scottish noble the place is an eating house and as such you and i will use it if others use it to game in it is their fault but neither that of the house nor ours  unsatisfied with this reasoning nigel still insisted upon the promise he had given to his father until his companion appeared rather displeased and disposed to impute to him injurious and unhandsome suspicions lord glenvarloch could not stand this change of tone he recollected that much was due from him to lord dalgarno on account of his fathers ready and efficient friendship and something also on account of the frank manner in which the young man himself had offered him his intimacy he had no reason to doubt his assurances that the house where they were about to dine did not fall under the description of places which his fathers prohibition referred and finally he was strong in his own resolution to resist every temptation to join in games of chance he therefore pacified lord dalgarno by intimating his willingness to go along with him and the goodhumour of the young courtier instantaneously returning he again ran on in a grotesque and rodomontade account of the host monsieur de beaujeu which he did not conclude until they had reached the temple of hospitality over which that eminent professor presided     chapter xii       this is the very barnyard     where muster daily the prime cocks o the game     ruffle their pinions crow till they are hoarse     and spar about a barleycorn here too chickens     the callow unfledged brood of forward folly     learn first to rear the crest and aim the spur     and tune their note like fullplumed chanticleer                                         the beargarden  the ordinary now an ignoble sound was in the days of james a new institution as fashionable among the youth of that age as the first rate modern clubhouses are amongst those of the present day it differed chiefly in being open to all whom good clothes and good assurance combined to introduce there the company usually dined together at an hour fixed and the manager of the establishment presided as master of the ceremonies  monsieur le chevalier as he qualified himself saint priest de beaujeu was a sharp thin gascon about sixty years old banished from his own country as he said on account of an affair of honour in which he had the misfortune to kill his antagonist though the best swordsman in the south of france his pretensions to quality were supported by a feathered hat a long rapier and a suit of embroidered taffeta not much the worse for wear in the extreme fashion of the parisian court and fluttering like a maypole with many knots of ribbon of which it was computed he bore at least five hundred yards about his person but notwithstanding this profusion of decoration there were many who thought monsieur le chevalier so admirably calculated for his present situation that nature could never have meant to place him an inch above it it was however part of the amusement of the place for lord dalgarno and other young men of quality to treat monsieur de beaujeu with a great deal of mock ceremony which being observed by the herd of more ordinary and simple gulls they paid him in clumsy imitation much real deference the gascons natural forwardness being much enhanced by these circumstances he was often guilty of presuming beyond the limits of his situation and of course had sometimes the mortification to be disagreeably driven back into them  when nigel entered the mansion of this eminent person which had been but of late the residence of a great baron of queen elizabeths court who had retired to his manors in the country on the death of that princess he was surprised at the extent of the accommodation which it afforded and the number of guests who were already assembled feathers waved spurs jingled lace and embroidery glanced everywhere and at first sight at least it certainly made good lord dalgarnos encomium who represented the company as composed almost entirely of youth of the first quality a more close review was not quite so favourable several individuals might be discovered who were not exactly at their ease in the splendid dresses which they wore and who therefore might be supposed not habitually familiar with such finery again there were others whose dress though on a general view it did not seem inferior to that of the rest of the company displayed on being observed more closely some of these petty expedients by which vanity endeavours to disguise poverty  nigel had very little time to make such observations for the entrance of lord dalgarno created an immediate bustle and sensation among the company as his name passed from one mouth to another some stood forward to gaze others stood back to make waythose of his own rank hastened to welcome himthose of inferior degree endeavoured to catch some point of his gesture or of his dress to be worn and practised upon a future occasion as the newest and most authentic fashion  the genius loci the chevalier himself was not the last to welcome this prime stay and ornament of his establishment he came shuffling forward with a hundred apish conges and chers milors to express his happiness at seeing lord dalgarno againi hope you do bring back the sun with you miloryou did carry away the sun and moon from your pauvre chevalier when you leave him for so long pardieu i believe you take them away in your pockets  that must have been because you left me nothing else in them chevalier answered lord dalgarno but monsieur le chevalier i pray you to know my countryman and friend lord glenvarloch  ah ha tres honoreje men souviensoui jai connu autrefois un milor kenfarloque en ecosse yes i have memory of himle pere de milor apparemmentwe were vera intimate when i was at oly root with monsieur de la mottei did often play at tennis vit milor kenfarloque at labbaie doly rootil etoit meme plus fort que moiah le beaucoup de revers quil avoiti have memory too that he was among the pretty girlsah un vrai diable dechaineaha i have memory  better have no more memory of the late lord glenvarloch said lord dalgarno interrupting the chevalier without ceremony who perceived that the encomium which he was about to pass on the deceased was likely to be as disagreeable to the son as it was totally undeserved by the father who far from being either a gamester or libertine as the chevaliers reminiscences falsely represented him was on the contrary strict and severe in his course of life almost to the extent of rigour  you have the reason milor answered the chevalier you have the rightquest ce que nous avons a faire avec le temps passethe time passed did belong to our fathersour ancetresvery wellthe time present is to usthey have their pretty tombs with their memories and armorials all in brass and marbrewe have the petits plats exquis and the soupeachevalier which i will cause to mount up immediately  so saying he made a pirouette on his heel and put his attendants in motion to place dinner on the table dalgarno laughed and observing his young friend looked grave said to him in a tone of reproachwhy whatyou are not gull enough to be angry with such an ass as that  i keep my anger i trust for better purposes said lord glenvarloch but i confess i was moved to hear such a fellow mention my fathers nameand you too who told me this was no gaminghouse talked to him of having left it with emptied pockets  pshaw man said lord dalgarno i spoke but according to the trick of the time besides a man must set a piece or two sometimes or he would be held a cullionly niggard but here comes dinner and we will see whether you like the chevaliers good cheer better than his conversation  dinner was announced accordingly and the two friends being seated in the most honourable station at the board were ceremoniously attended to by the chevalier who did the honours of his table to them and to the other guests and seasoned the whole with his agreeable conversation the dinner was really excellent in that piquant style of cookery which the french had already introduced and which the homebred young men of england when they aspired to the rank of connoisseurs and persons of taste were under the necessity of admiring the wine was also of the first quality and circulated in great variety and no less abundance the conversation among so many young men was of course light lively and amusing and nigel whose mind had been long depressed by anxiety and misfortune naturally found himself at ease and his spirits raised and animated  some of the company had real wit and could use it both politely and to advantage others were coxcombs and were laughed at without discovering it and again others were originals who seemed to have no objection that the company should be amused with their folly instead of their wit and almost all the rest who played any prominent part in the conversation had either the real tone of good society which belonged to the period or the jargon which often passes current for it  in short the company and conversation was so agreeable that nigels rigour was softened by it even towards the master of ceremonies and he listened with patience to various details which the chevalier de beaujeu seeing as he said that milors taste lay for the curieux and futile chose to address to him in particular on the subject of cookery to gratify at the same time the taste for antiquity which he somehow supposed that his new guest possessed he launched out in commendation of the great artists of former days particularly one whom he had known in his youth maitre de cuisine to the marechal strozzitres bon gentilhomme pourtant who had maintained his masters table with twelve covers every day during the long and severe blockade of le petit leyth although he had nothing better to place on it than the quarter of a carrionhorse now and then and the grass and weeds that grew on the ramparts despardieux cdtoit un homme superbe with one tistlehead and a nettle or two he could make a soupe for twenty guestsan haunch of a little puppydog made a roti des plus excellens but his coupe de maitre was when the rendition what you call the surrender took place and appened and then dieu me damme he made out of the hind quarter of one salted horse fortyfive couverts that the english and scottish officers and nobility who had the honour to dine with monseigneur upon the rendition could not tell what the devil any of them were made upon at all  the good wine had by this time gone so merrily round and had such genial effect on the guests that those of the lower end of the table who had hitherto been listeners began not greatly to their own credit or that of the ordinary to make innovations  you speak of the siege of leith said a tall rawboned man with thick mustaches turned up with a military twist a broad buff belt a long rapier and other outward symbols of the honoured profession which lives by killing other peopleyou talk of the siege of leith and i have seen the placea pretty kind of a hamlet it is with a plain wall or rampart and a pigeonhouse or so of a tower at every angle uds daggers and scabbards if a leaguer of our days had been twentyfour hours not to say so many months before it without carrying the place and all its cocklofts one after another by pure storm they would have deserved no better grace than the provost marshal gives when his noose is reeved  saar said the chevalier monsieur le capitaine i vas not at the siege of the petit leyth and i know not what you say about the cockloft but i will say for monseigneur de strozzi that he understood the grande guerre and was grand capitaineplus grand that is more great it may be than some of the capitaines of angleterre who do speak very loudtenez monsieur car cest a vous  o monsieur answered the swordsman we know the frenchman will fight well behind his barrier of stone or when he is armed with back breast and pot  pot exclaimed the chevalier what do you mean by potdo you mean to insult me among my noble guests saar i have done my duty as a pauvre gentilhomme under the grand henri quatre both at courtrai and yvry and ventre saint gris we had neither pot nor marmite but did always charge in our shirt  which refutes another base scandal said lord dalgarno laughing alleging that linen was scarce among the french gentlemenatarms  gentlemen out at arms and elbows both you mean my lord said the captain from the bottom of the table craving your lordships pardon i do know something of these same gensdarmes  we will spare your knowledge at present captain and save your modesty at the same time the trouble of telling us how that knowledge was acquired answered lord dalgarno rather contemptuously  i need not speak of it my lord said the man of war the world knows itall perhaps but the men of mohairthe poor sneaking citizens of london who would see a man of valour eat his very hilts for hunger ere they would draw a farthing from their long purses to relieve them o if a band of the honest fellows i have seen were once to come near that cuckoos nest of theirs  a cuckoos nestand that said of the city of london said a gallant who sat on the opposite side of the table and who wearing a splendid and fashionable dress seemed yet scarce at home in iti will not brook to hear that repeated  what said the soldier bending a most terrific frown from a pair of broad black eyebrows handling the hilt of his weapon with one hand and twirling with the other his huge mustaches will you quarrel for your city  ay marry will i replied the other i am a citizen i care not who knows it and he who shall speak a word in dispraise of the city is an ass and a peremptory gull and i will break his pate to teach him sense and manners  the company who probably had their reasons for not valuing the captains courage at the high rate which he himself put upon it were much entertained at the manner in which the quarrel was taken up by the indignant citizen and they exclaimed on all sides well run bowbellwell crowed the cock of saint paulssound a charge there or the soldier will mistake his signals and retreat when he should advance  you mistake me gentlemen said the captain looking round with an air of dignity i will but inquire whether this cavaliero citizen is of rank and degree fitted to measure swords with a man of action for conceive me gentlemen it is not with every one that i can match myself without loss of reputation and in that case he shall soon hear from me honourably by way of cartel  you shall feel me most dishonourably in the way of cudgel said the citizen starting up and taking his sword which he had laid in a corner follow me  it is my right to name the place of combat by all the rules of the sword said the captain and i do nominate the maze in tothill fields for placetwo gentlemen who shall be indifferent judges for witnessesand for timelet me say this day fortnight at daybreak  and i said the citizen do nominate the bowlingalley behind the house for place the present good company for witnesses and for time the present moment  so saying he cast on his beaver struck the soldier across the shoulders with his sheathed sword and ran down stairs the captain showed no instant alacrity to follow him yet at last roused by the laugh and sneer around him he assured the company that what he did he would do deliberately and assuming his hat which he put on with the air of ancient pistol he descended the stairs to the place of combat where his more prompt adversary was already stationed with his sword unsheathed of the company all of whom seemed highly delighted with the approaching fray some ran to the windows which overlooked the bowlingalley and others followed the combatants down stairs nigel could not help asking dalgarno whether he would not interfere to prevent mischief  it would be a crime against the public interest answered his friend there can no mischief happen between two such originals which will not be a positive benefit to society and particularly to the chevaliers establishment as he calls it i have been as sick of that captains buff belt and red doublet for this month past as eer i was of aught and now i hope this bold linendraper will cudgel the ass out of that filthy lions hide see nigel see the gallant citizen has taen his ground about a bowlscast forward in the midst of the alleythe very model of a hog in armour behold how he prances with his manly foot and brandishes his blade much as if he were about to measure forth cambric with it see they bring on the reluctant soldado and plant him opposite to his fiery antagonist twelve paces still dividing themlo the captain draws his tool but like a good general looks over his shoulder to secure his retreat in case the worse come ont behold the valiant shopkeeper stoops his head confident doubtless in the civic helmet with which his spouse has fortified his skullwhy this is the rarest of sport by heaven he will run a tilt at him like a ram  it was even as lord dalgarno had anticipated for the citizen who seemed quite serious in his zeal for combat perceiving that the man of war did not advance towards him rushed onwards with as much good fortune as courage beat down the captains guard and pressing on thrust as it seemed his sword clear through the body of his antagonist who with a deep groan measured his length on the ground a score of voices cried to the conqueror as he stood fixed in astonishment at his own feat away away with youfly flyfly by the back doorget into the whitefriars or cross the water to the bankside while we keep off the mob and the constables and the conqueror leaving his vanquished foeman on the ground fled accordingly with all speed  by heaven said lord dalgarno i could never have believed that the fellow would have stood to receive a thrusthe has certainly been arrested by positive terror and lost the use of his limbs see they are raising him  stiff and stark seemed the corpse of the swordsman as one or two of the guests raised him from the ground but when they began to open his waistcoat to search for the wound which nowhere existed the man of war collected his scattered spirits and conscious that the ordinary was no longer a stage on which to display his valour took to his heels as fast as he could run pursued by the laughter and shouts of the company  by my honour said lord dalgarno he takes the same course with his conqueror i trust in heaven he will overtake him and then the valiant citizen will suppose himself haunted by the ghost of him he has slain  despardieux milor said the chevalier if he had stayed one moment he should have had a torchonwhat you call a dishclout pinned to him for a piece of shroud to show he be de ghost of one grand fanfaron  in the meanwhile said lord dalgarno you will oblige us monsieur le chevalier as well as maintain your own honoured reputation by letting your drawers receive the manatarms with a cudgel in case he should venture to come way again  ventre saint gris milor said the chevalier leave that to me begar the maid shall throw the washsud upon the grand poltron  when they had laughed sufficiently at this ludicrous occurrence the party began to divide themselves into little knotssome took possession of the alley late the scene of combat and put the field to its proper use of a bowlingground and it soon resounded with all the terms of the game as run runrub rubhold bias you infernal trundling timber thus making good the saying that three things are thrown away in a bowlinggreen namely time money and oaths in the house many of the gentlemen betook themselves to cards or dice and parties were formed at ombre at basset at gleek at primero and other games then in fashion while the dice were used at various games both with and without the tables as hazard inandin passage and so forth the play however did not appear to be extravagantly deep it was certainly conducted with great decorum and fairness nor did there appear any thing to lead the young scotsman in the least to doubt his companions assurance that the place was frequented by men of rank and quality and that the recreations they adopted were conducted upon honourable principles  lord dalgarno neither had proposed play to his friend nor joined in the amusement himself but sauntered from one table to another remarking the luck of the different players as well as their capacity to avail themselves of it and exchanging conversation with the highest and most respectable of the guests at length as if tired of what in modern phrase would have been termed lounging he suddenly remembered that burbage was to act shakespeares king richard at the fortune that afternoon and that he could not give a stranger in london like lord glenvarloch a higher entertainment than to carry him to that exhibition unless indeed he added in a whisper there is paternal interdiction of the theatre as well as of the ordinary  i never heard my father speak of stageplays said lord glenvarloch for they are shows of a modern date and unknown in scotland yet if what i have heard to their prejudice be true i doubt much whether he would have approved of them  approved of them exclaimed lord dalgarnowhy george buchanan wrote tragedies and his pupil learned and wise as himself goes to see them so it is next door to treason to abstain and the cleverest men in england write for the stage and the prettiest women in london resort to the playhouses and i have a brace of nags at the door which will carry us along the streets like wildfire and the ride will digest our venison and ortolans and dissipate the fumes of the wine and so lets to horsegodden to you gentlemengodden chevalier de la fortune  lord dalgarnos grooms were in attendance with two horses and the young men mounted the proprietor upon a favourite barb and nigel upon a highdressed jennet scarce less beautiful as they rode towards the theatre lord dalgarno endeavoured to discover his friends opinion of the company to which he had introduced him and to combat the exceptions which he might suppose him to have taken and wherefore lookest thou sad he said my pensive neophyte sage son of the alma mater of lowdutch learning what aileth thee is the leaf of the living world which we have turned over in company less fairly written

think but that your lordship and other men of good quality with whom we dined might have chosen a place of meeting free from the intrusion of bullies and a better master of your ceremonial than yonder foreign adventurer  all shall be amended sancte nigelle when thou shalt come forth a new peter the hermit to preach a crusade against dicing drabbing and companykeeping we will meet for dinner in

grooms and make way for us through the press  they dismounted and the assiduous efforts of lutin elbowing bullying and proclaiming his masters name and title made way through a crowd of murmuring citizens and clamorous apprentices to the door where lord dalgarno speedily procured a brace of stools upon the stage for his companion and himself where seated among other gallants of the same class they had an opportunity of displaying their fair dresses and fashionable manners while they criticised the piece during its progress thus forming at the same time a conspicuous part of the spectacle and an important proportion of the audience  nigel olifaunt was too eagerly and deeply absorbed in the interest of the scene to be capable of playing his part as became the place where he was seated he felt all the magic of that sorcerer who had displayed within the paltry circle of a wooden booth the long wars of york and lancaster compelling the heroes of either line to stalk across the scene in language and fashion as they lived as if the grave had given up the dead for the amusement and instruction of the living burbage esteemed the best richard until garrick arose played the tyrant and usurper with such truth and liveliness that when the battle of bosworth seemed concluded by his death the ideas of reality and deception were strongly contending in lord glenvarlochs imagination and it required him to rouse himself from his reverie so strange did the proposal at first sound when his companion declared king richard should sup with them at the mermaid  they were joined at the same time by a small party of the gentlemen with whom they had dined which they recruited by inviting two or three of the most accomplished wits and poets who seldom failed to attend the fortune theatre and were even but too ready to conclude a day of amusement with a night of pleasure thither the whole party adjourned and betwixt fertile cups of sack excited spirits and the emulous wit of their lively companions seemed to realise the joyous boast of one of ben jonsons contemporaries when reminding the bard of              those lyric feasts      where men such clusters had      as made them

upon review seems altogether so exquisite as the partaker of the festivity may have felt it while passing over him nigel olifaunt at least did not feel it so and it required a visit from his new acquaintance lord dalgarno to reconcile him entirely to himself but this visit took place early after breakfast and his friends discourse was prefaced with a question how he liked the company of the preceding evening  why excellently well said lord glenvarloch only i should have liked the wit better had it appeared to flow more freely every mans invention seemed on the stretch and each extravagant simile seemed to set one half of your men of wit into a brown study to produce something which should outherod it  and wherefore not said lord dalgarno or what are these fellows fit for but to play the intellectual gladiators before us he of them who declares himself recreant should dn him be restricted to muddy ale and the patronage of the watermans company i promise you that many a pretty fellow has been mortally wounded with a quibble or a carwitchet at the mermaid and sent from thence in a pitiable estate to wits hospital in the vintry where they languish to this day amongst fools and aldermen  it may be so said lord nigel yet i could swear by my honour that last night i seemed to be in company with more than one man whose genius and learning ought either to have placed him higher in our company or to have withdrawn him altogether from a scene where sooth to speak his part seemed unworthily subordinate  now out upon your tender conscience said lord dalgarno and the fico for such outcasts of parnassus why these are the very leavings of that noble banquet of pickled herrings and rhenish which lost london so many of her principal witmongers and bards of misrule what would you have said had you seen nash or green when you interest yourself about the poor mimes you supped with last night suffice it they had their drench and their doze and they drank and slept as much as may save them from any necessity of eating till evening when if they are industrious they will find patrons or players to feed them footnote the condition of men of wit and talents was never more melancholy than about this period their lives were so irregular and their means of living so precarious that they were alternately rioting in debauchery or encountering and struggling with the meanest necessities two or three lost their lives by a surfeit brought on by that fatal banquet of rhenish wine and pickled herrings which is familiar to those who study the lighter literature of that age the whole history is a most melancholy picture of genius degraded at once by its own debaucheries and the patronage of heartless rakes and profligates for the rest of their wants they can be at no loss for cold water while the new river head holds good and your doublets of parnassus are eternal in duration  virgil and horace had more efficient patronage said nigel  ay replied his countryman but these fellows are neither virgil nor horace besides we have other spirits of another sort to whom i will introduce you on some early occasion our swan of avon hath sung his last but we have stout old ben with as much learning and genius as ever prompted the treader of sock and buskin it is not however of him i mean now to speak but i come to pray you of dear love to row up with me as far as richmond where two or three of the gallants whom you saw yesterday mean to give music and syllabubs to a set of beauties with some curious bright eyes among themsuch i promise you as might win an astrologer from his worship of the galaxy my sister leads the bevy to whom i desire to present you she hath her admirers at court and is regarded though i might dispense with sounding her praise as one of the beauties of the time  there was no refusing an engagement where the presence of the party invited late so low in his own regard was demanded by a lady of quality one of the choice beauties of the time lord glenvarloch accepted as was inevitable and spent a lively day among the gay and the fair he was the gallant in attendance for the day upon his friends sister the beautiful countess of blackchester who aimed at once at superiority in the realms of fashion of power and of wit  she was indeed considerably older than her brother and had probably completed her six lustres but the deficiency in extreme youth was more than atoned for in the most precise and curious accuracy in attire an early acquaintance with every foreign mode and a peculiar gift in adapting the knowledge which she acquired to her own particular features and complexion at court she knew as well as any lady in the circle the precise tone moral political learned or jocose in which it was proper to answer the monarch according to his prevailing humour and was supposed to have been very active by her personal interest in procuring her husband a high situation which the gouty old viscount could never have deserved by any merit of his own commonplace conduct and understanding  it was far more easy for this lady than for her brother to reconcile so young a courtier as lord glenvarloch to the customs and habits of a sphere so new to him in all civilised society the females of distinguished rank and beauty give the tone to manners and through these even to morals lady blackchester had besides interest either in the court or over the court for its source could not be well traced which created friends and overawed those who might have been disposed to play the part of enemies  at one time she was understood to be closely leagued with the buckingham family with whom her brother still maintained a great intimacy and although some coldness had taken place betwixt the countess and the duchess of buckingham so that they were little seen together and the former seemed considerably to have withdrawn herself into privacy it was whispered that lady blackchesters interest with the great favourite was not diminished in consequence of her breach with his lady  our accounts of the private court intrigues of that period and of the persons to whom they were intrusted are not full enough to enable us to pronounce upon the various reports which arose out of the circumstances we have detailed it is enough to say that lady blackchester possessed great influence on the circle around her both from her beauty her abilities and her reputed talents for court intrigue and that nigel olifaunt was not long of experiencing its power as he became a slave in some degree to that species of habit which carries so many men into a certain society at a certain hour without expecting or receiving any particular degree of gratification or even amusement  his life for several weeks may be thus described the ordinary was no bad introduction to the business of the day and the young lord quickly found that if the society there was not always irreproachable still it formed the most convenient and agreeable place of meeting with the fashionable parties with whom he visited hyde park the theatres and other places of public resort or joined the gay and glittering circle which lady blackchester had assembled around her neither did he entertain the same scrupulous horror which led him originally even to hesitate entering into a place where gaming was permitted but on the contrary began to admit the idea that as there could be no harm done in beholding such recreation when only indulged in to a moderate degree so from a parity of reasoning there could be no objection to joining in it always under the same restrictions but the young lord was a scotsman habituated to early reflection and totally unaccustomed to any habit which inferred a careless risk or profuse waste of money profusion was not his natural vice or one likely to be acquired in the course of his education and in all probability while his father anticipated with noble horror the idea of his son approaching the gamingtable he was more startled at the idea of his becoming a gaining than a losing adventurer the second according to his principles had a termination a sad one indeed in the loss of temporal fortunethe first quality went on increasing the evil which he dreaded and perilled at once both body and soul  however the old lord might ground his apprehension it was so far verified by his sons conduct that from an observer of the various games of chance which he witnessed he came by degrees by moderate hazards and small bets or wagers to take a certain interest in them nor could it be denied that his rank and expectations entitled him to hazard a few pieces for his game went no deeper against persons who from the readiness with which they staked their money might be supposed well able to afford to lose it  it chanced or perhaps according to the common belief his evil genius had so decreed that nigels adventures were remarkably successful he was temperate cautious coolheaded had a strong memory and a ready power of calculation was besides of a daring and intrepid character one upon whom no one that had looked even slightly or spoken to though but hastily would readily have ventured to practise any thing approaching to trick or which required to be supported by intimidation while lord glenvarloch chose to play men played with him regularly or according to the phrase upon the square and as he found his luck change or wished to hazard his good fortune no farther the more professed votaries of fortune who frequented the house of monsieur le chevalier de saint priest beaujeu did not venture openly to express their displeasure at his rising a winner but when this happened repeatedly the gamesters murmured amongst themselves equally at the caution and the success of the young scotsman and he became far from being a popular character among their society  it was no slight inducement to the continuance of this most evil habit when it was once in some degree acquired that it seemed to place lord glenvarloch haughty as he naturally was beyond the necessity of subjecting himself to farther pecuniary obligations which his prolonged residence in london must otherwise have rendered necessary he had to solicit from the ministers certain forms of office which were to render his signmanual effectually useful and these though they could not be denied were delayed in such a manner as to lead nigel to believe there was some secret opposition which occasioned the demur in his business his own impulse was to have appeared at court a second time with the kings signmanual in his pocket and to have appealed to his majesty himself whether the delay of the public officers ought to render his royal generosity unavailing but the lord huntinglen that good old peer who had so frankly interfered in his behalf on a former occasion and whom he occasionally visited greatly dissuaded him from a similar adventure and exhorted him quietly to await the deliverance of the ministers which should set him free from dancing attendance in london  lord dalgarno joined his father in deterring his young friend from a second attendance at court at least till he was reconciled with the duke of buckinghama matter in which he said addressing his father i have offered my poor assistance without being able to prevail on lord nigel to make anynot even the leastsubmission to the duke of buckingham  by my faith and i hold the laddie to be in the right ont malcom answered the stout old scots lordwhat right hath buckingham or to speak plainly the son of sir george villiers to expect homage and fealty from one more noble than himself by eight quarters i heard him myself on no reason that i could perceive term lord nigel his enemy and it will never be by my counsel that the lad speaks soft word to him till he recalls the hard one  that is precisely my advice to lord glenvarloch answered lord dalgarno but then you will admit my dear father that it would be the risk of extremity for our friend to return into the presence the duke being his enemybetter to leave it with me to take off the heat of the distemperature with which some pickthanks have persuaded the duke to regard our friend  if thou canst persuade buckingham of his error malcolm said his father for once i will say there hath been kindness and honesty in court service i have oft told your sister and yourself that in the general i esteem it as lightly as may be  you need not doubt my doing my best in nigels case answered lord dalgarno but you must think my dear father i must needs use slower and gentler means than those by which you became a favourite twenty years ago  by my faith i am afraid thou wilt answered his fatheri tell thee malcolm i would sooner wish myself in the grave than doubt thine honesty or honour yet somehow it hath chanced that honest ready service hath not the same acceptance at court which it has in my younger timeand yet you rise there  o the time permits not your oldworld service said lord dalgarno we have now no daily insurrections no nightly attempts at assassination as were the fashion in the scottish court your prompt and uncourteous swordinhand attendance on the sovereign is no longer necessary and would be as unbeseeming as your oldfashioned serving men with their badges broadswords and bucklers would be at a courtmask besides father loyal haste hath its inconveniences i have heard and from royal lips too that when you stuck your dagger into the traitor ruthven it was with such little consideration that the point ran a quarter of an inch into the royal buttock the king never talks of it but he rubs the injured part and quotes his infandumrenovare dolorem but this comes of old fashions and of wearing a long liddesdale whinger instead of a poniard of parma yet this my dear father you call prompt and valiant service the king i am told could not sit upright for a fortnight though all the cushions in falkland were placed in his chair of state and the provost of dunfermlines borrowed to the boot of all  it is a lie said the old earl a false lie forge it who listit is true i wore a dagger of service by my side and not a bodkin like yours to pick ones teeth withaland for prompt serviceodds nouns it should be prompt to be useful when kings are crying treason and murder with the screech of a halfthrottled hen but you young courtiers know nought of these matters and are little better than the green geese they bring over from the indies whose only merit to their masters is to repeat their own words after thema pack of mouthers and flatterers and earwigswell i am old and unable to mend else i would break all off and hear the tay once more flinging himself over the campsie linn  but there is your dinnerbell father said lord dalgarno which if the venison i sent you prove seasonable is at least as sweet a sound  follow me then youngsters if you list said the old earl and strode on from the alcove in which this conversation was held towards the house followed by the two young men  in their private discourse lord dalgarno had little trouble in dissuading nigel from going immediately to court while on the other hand the offers he made him of a previous introduction to the duke of buckingham were received by lord glenvarloch with a positive and contemptuous refusal his friend shrugged his shoulders as one who claims the merit of having given to an obstinate friend the best counsel and desires to be held free of the consequences of his pertinacity  as for the father his table indeed and his best liquor of which he was more profuse than necessary were at the command of his young friend as well as his best advice and assistance in the prosecution of his affairs but lord huntinglens interest was more apparent than real and the credit he had acquired by his gallant defence of the kings person was so carelessly managed by himself and so easily eluded by the favourites and ministers of the sovereign that except upon one or two occasions when the king was in some measure taken by surprise as in the case of lord glenvarloch the royal bounty was never efficiently extended either to himself or to his friends  there never was a man said lord dalgarno whose shrewder knowledge of the english court saw where his fathers deficiency lay that had it so perfectly in his power to have made his way to the pinnacle of fortune as my poor father he had acquired a right to build up a staircase step by step slowly and surely letting every boon which he begged year after year become in its turn the restingplace for the next annual grant but your fortunes shall not shipwreck upon the same coast nigel he would conclude if i have fewer means of influence than my father has or rather had till he threw them away for butts of sack hawks hounds and such carrion i can far better than he improve that which i possess and that my dear nigel is all engaged in your behalf do not be surprised or offended that you now see me less than formerly the staghunting is commenced and the prince looks that i should attend him more frequently i must also maintain my attendance on the duke that i may have an opportunity of pleading your cause when occasion shall permit  i have no cause to plead before the duke said nigel gravely i have said so repeatedly  why i meant the phrase no otherwise thou churlish and suspicious disputant answered dalgarno than as i am now pleading the dukes cause with thee surely i only mean to claim a share in our royal masters favourite benediction beati pacifici  upon several occasions lord glenvarlochs conversations both with the old earl and his son took a similar turn and had a like conclusion he sometimes felt as if betwixt the one and the other not to mention the more unseen and unboasted but scarce less certain influence of lady blackchester his affair simple as it had become might have been somehow accelerated but it was equally impossible to doubt the rough honesty of the father and the eager and officious friendship of lord dalgarno nor was it easy to suppose that the countenance of the lady by whom he was received with such distinction would be wanting could it be effectual in his service  nigel was further sensible of the truth of what lord dalgarno often pointed out that the favourite being supposed to be his enemy every petty officer through whose hands his affair must necessarily pass would desire to make a merit of throwing obstacles in his way which he could only surmount by steadiness and patience unless he preferred closing the breach or as lord dalgarno called it making his peace with the duke of buckingham  nigel might and doubtless would have had recourse to the advice of his friend george heriot upon this occasion having found it so advantageous formerly but the only time he saw him after their visit to court he found the worthy citizen engaged in hasty preparations for a journey to paris upon business of great importance in the way of his profession and by an especial commission from the court and the duke of buckingham which was likely to be attended with considerable profit the good man smiled as he named the duke of buckingham he had been he said pretty sure that his disgrace in that quarter would not be of long duration lord glenvarloch expressed himself rejoiced at that reconciliation observing that it had been a most painful reflection to him that master heriot should in his behalf have incurred the dislike and perhaps exposed himself to the ill offices of so powerful a favourite  my lord said heriot for your fathers son i would do much and yet truly if i know myself i would do as much and risk as much for the sake of justice in the case of a much more insignificant person as i have ventured for yours but as we shall not meet for some time i must commit to your own wisdom the farther prosecution of this matter  and thus they took a kind and affectionate leave of each other  there were other changes in lord glenvarlochs situation which require to be noticed his present occupations and the habits of amusement which he had acquired rendered his living so far in the city a considerable inconvenience he may also have become a little ashamed of his cabin on pauls wharf and desirous of being lodged somewhat more according to his quality for this purpose he had hired a small apartment near the temple he was nevertheless almost sorry for what he had done when he observed that his removal appeared to give some pain to john christie and a great deal to his cordial and officious landlady the former who was grave and saturnine in every thing he did only hoped that all had been to lord glenvarlochs mind and that he had not left them on account of any unbeseeming negligence on their part but the tear twinkled in dame nellys eye while she recounted the various improvements she had made in the apartment of express purpose to render it more convenient to his lordship  there was a great seachest she said had been taken upstairs to the shopmans garret though it left the poor lad scarce eighteen inches of opening to creep betwixt it and his bed and heaven knew she did notwhether it could ever be brought down that narrow stair again then the turning the closet into an alcove had cost a matter of twenty round shillings and to be sure to any other lodger but his lordship the closet was more convenient there was all the linen too which she had bought on purposebut heavens will be doneshe was resigned  everybody likes marks of personal attachment and nigel whose heart really smote him as if in his rising fortunes he were disdaining the lowly accommodations and the civilities of the humble friends which had been but lately actual favours failed not by every assurance in his power and by as liberal payment as they could be prevailed upon to accept to alleviate the soreness of their feelings at his departure and a parting kiss from the fair lips of his hostess sealed his forgiveness  richie moniplies lingered behind his master to ask whether in case of need john christie could help a canny scotsman to a passage back to his own country and receiving assurance of johns interest to that effect he said at parting he would remind him of his promise soon for said he if my lord is

two or three mornings after the young lord had possessed himself of his new lodgings he appeared before nigel as he was preparing to dress having left his pillow at an hour much later than had formerly been his custom  as nigel looked upon his attendant he observed there was a gathering gloom upon his solemn features which expressed either additional importance or superadded discontent or a portion of both  how now he said what is the matter this morning richie that you have made your face so like the grotesque mask on one of the spouts yonder pointing to the temple church of which gothic building they had a view from the window  richie swivelled his head a little to the right with as little alacrity as if he had the crick in his neck and instantly resuming his posture repliedmask here mask thereit were nae such matters that i have to speak anent  and what matters have you to speak anent then said his master whom circumstances had inured to tolerate a good deal of freedom from his attendant  my lordsaid richie and then stopped to cough and hem as if what he had to say stuck somewhat in his throat  i guess the mystery said nigel you want a little money richie will five pieces serve the present turn  my lord said richie i may it is like want a trifle of money and i am glad at the same time and sorry that it is mair plenty with your lordship than formerly  glad and sorry man said lord nigel why you are reading riddles to me richie  my riddle will be briefly read said richie i come to crave of your lordship your commands for scotland  for scotlandwhy art

thou hast stuck to me in adversity  adversity my lord should never have parted us said richie methinks had the warst come to warst i could have starved as gallantly as your lordship or more so being in some sort used to it for though i was bred at a flashers stall i have not through my life had a constant intimacy with collops  now what is the meaning of all this trash said nigel or has it no other end than to provoke my patience you know well enough that had i twenty servingmen i would hold the faithful follower that stood by me in my distress the most valued of them all but it is totally out of reason to plague me with your solemn capriccios  my lord said richie in declaring your trust in me you have done what is honourable to yourself if i may with humility say so much and in no way undeserved on my side nevertheless we must part  body of me man why said lord nigel what reason can there be for it if we are mutually satisfied  my lord said richie moniplies your lordships occupations are such as i cannot own or countenance by my presence  how now sirrah said his master angrily  under favour my lord replied his domestic it is unequal dealing to be equally offended by my speech and by my silence if you can hear with patience the grounds of my departure it may be for aught i know the better for you here and hereafterif not let me have my license of departure in silence and so no more about it  go to sir said nigel speak out your mindonly remember to whom you speak it  weel weel my lordi speak it with humility never did richie look with more starched dignity than when he uttered the word but do you think this dicing and cardshuffling and haunting of taverns and playhouses suits your lordshipfor i am sure it does not suit me  why you are not turned precisian or puritan fool said lord glenvarloch laughing though betwixt resentment and shame it cost him some trouble to do so  my lord replied the follower i ken the purport of your query i am it may be a little of a precisian and i wish to heaven i was mair worthy of the name but let that be a passoveri have stretched the duties of a servingman as far as my northern conscience will permit i can give my gude word to my master or to my native country when i am in a foreign land even though i should leave downright truth a wee bit behind me ay and i will take or give a slash with ony man that speaks to the derogation of either but this chambering dicing and playhaunting is not my elementi cannot draw breath in itand when i hear of your lordship winning the siller that some poor creature may full sairly missby my saul if it wad serve your necessity rather than you gained it from him i wad take a jump over the hedge with your lordship and cry stand to the first grazier we met that was coming from smithfield with the price of his essex calves in his leathern pouch  you are a simpleton said nigel who felt however much conscience struck i never play but for small sums  ay my lord replied the unyielding domestic andstill with reverenceit is even sae much the waur if you played with your equals there might be like sin but there wad be mair warldly honour in it your lordship kens or may ken by experience of your ain whilk is not as yet mony weeks auld that small sums can ill be missed by those that have nane larger and i maun een be plain with you that men notice it of your lordship that ye play wi nane but the misguided creatures that can but afford to lose bare stakes  no man dare say so replied nigel very angrily i play with whom i please but i will only play for what stake i please  that is just what they say my lord said the unmerciful richie whose natural love of lecturing as well as his bluntness of feeling prevented him from having any idea of the pain which he was inflicting on his master these are even their own very words it was but yesterday your lordship was pleased at that same ordinary to win from yonder young hafflins gentleman with the crimson velvet doublet and the cocks feather in his beaverhim i mean who fought with the ranting captaina matter of five pounds or thereby i saw him come through the hall and if he was not cleaned out of cross and pile i never saw a ruined man in my life  impossible said lord glenvarlochwhy who is he he looked like a man of substance  all is not gold that glistens my lord replied richie broidery and bullion buttons make bare pouches and if you ask who he ismaybe i have a guess and care not to tell  at least if i have done any such fellow an injury said the lord nigel let me know how i can repair it  never fash your beard about that my lordwith reverence always said richiehe shall be suitably cared after think on him but as ane wha was running post to the devil and got a shouldering from your lordship to help him on his journey but i will stop him if reason can and so your lordship needs asks nae mair about it for there is no use in your knowing it but much the contrair  hark you sirrah said his master i have borne with you thus far for certain reasons but abuse my goodnature no fartherand since you must needs go why go a gods name and here is to pay your journey so saying he put gold into his hand which richie told over piece by piece with the utmost accuracy  is it all rightor are they wanting in weightor what the devil keeps you when your hurry was so great five minutes since said the young lord now thoroughly nettled at the presumptuous precision with which richie dealt forth his canons of morality  the tale of coin is complete said richie with the most imperturbable gravity and for the weight though they are sae scrupulous in this town as make mouths at a piece that is a wee bit light or that has been cracked within the ring my sooth they will jump at them in edinburgh like a cock at a grosart gold pieces are not so plenty there the mair the pity  the more is your folly then said nigel whose anger was only momentary that leave the land where there is enough of them  my lord said richie to be round with you the grace of god is better than gold pieces when goblin as you call yonder monsieur lutinand you might as well call him gibbet since that is what he is like to end inshall recommend a page to you ye will hear little such doctrine as ye have heard from meand if they were my last words he said raising his voice i would say you are misled and are forsaking the paths which your honourable father trode in and what is more you are goingstill under correctionto the devil with a dishclout for ye are laughed at by them that lead you into these disordered bypaths  laughed at said nigel who like others of his age was more sensible to ridicule than to reasonwho dares laugh at me  my lord as sure as i live by breadnay more as i am a true man and i think your lordship never found richies tongue bearing aught but the truthunless that your lordships credit my countrys profit or it may be some sma occasion of my ain made it unnecessary to promulgate the haill veritiei say then as i am a true man when i saw that puir creature come through the ha at that ordinary whilk is accurst heaven forgive me for swearing of god and man with his teeth set and his hands clenched and his bonnet drawn over his brows like a desperate man goblin said to me there goes a dunghill chicken that your master has plucked clean enough it will be long ere his lordship ruffle a feather with a cock of the game and so my lord to speak it out the lackeys and the gallants and more especially your sworn brother lord dalgarno call you the sparrowhawki had some thought to have cracked lutins pate for the speech but after a the controversy was not worth it  do they use such terms of me said lord nigel death and the devil  and the devils dam my lord answered richie they are all three busy in londonand besides lutin and his master laughed at you my lord for letting it be thought thati shame to speak itthat ye were over well with the wife of the decent honest man whose house you but now left as not sufficient for your new bravery whereas they said the licentious scoffers that you pretended to such favour when you had not courage enough for so fair a quarrel and that the sparrowhawk was too cravencrested to fly at the wife of a cheesemongerhe stopped a moment and looked fixedly in his masters face which was inflamed with shame and anger and then proceeded my lord i did you justice in my thought and myself too for thought i he would have been as deep in that sort of profligacy as in others if it hadna been richies four quarters  what new nonsense have you got to plague me with said lord nigel but go on since it is the last time i am to be tormented with your impertinencego on and make the most of your time  in troth said richie and so will i even do and as heaven has bestowed on me a tongue to speak and to advise  which talent you can by no means be accused of suffering to remain idle said lord glenvarloch interrupting him  true my lord said richie again waving his hand as if to bespeak his masters silence and attention so i trust you will think some time hereafter and as i am about to leave your service it is proper that ye suld know the truth that ye may consider the snares to which your youth and innocence may be exposed when aulder and doucer heads are withdrawn from beside youthere has been a lusty goodlooking kimmer of some forty or bygane making mony speerings about you my lord  well sir what did she want with me said lord nigel  at first my lord replied his sapient follower as she seemed to be a wellfashioned woman and to take pleasure in sensible company i was no way reluctant to admit her to my conversation  i dare say not said lord nigel nor unwilling to tell her about my private affairs  not i truly my lord said the attendantfor though she asked me mony questions about your fame your fortune your business here and such like i did not think it proper to tell her altogether the truth thereanent  i see no call on you whatever said lord nigel to tell the woman either truth or lies upon what she had nothing to do with  i thought so too my lord replied richie and so i told her neither  and what did you tell her then you eternal babbler said his master impatient of his prate yet curious to know what it was all to end in  i told her said richie about your warldly fortune and sae forth something whilk is not truth just at this time but which hath been truth formerly suld be truth now and will be truth againand that was that you were in possession of your fair lands whilk ye are but in right of as yet pleasant communing we had on that and other topics until she showed the cloven foot beginning to confer with me about some wench that she said had a goodwill to your lordship and fain she would have spoken with you in particular anent it but when i heard of such inklings i began to suspect she was little better than whew here he concluded his narrative with a low but very expressive whistle  and what did your wisdom do in these circumstances said lord nigel who notwithstanding his former resentment could now scarcely forbear laughing  i put on a look my lord replied richie bending his solemn brows that suld give her a heartscald of walking on such errands i laid her enormities clearly before her and i threatened her in sae mony words that i would have her to the duckingstool and she on the contrair part miscawed me for a forward northern tykeand so we parted never to meet again as i hope and trust and so i stood between your lordship and that temptation which might have been worse than the ordinary or the playhouse either since you wot well what solomon king of the jews sayeth of the strange womanfor said i to mysell we have taken to dicing already and if we take to drabbing next the lord kens what we may land in  your impertinence deserves correction but it is the last which for a time at least i shall have to forgiveand i forgive it said lord glenvarloch and since we are to part richie i will say no more respecting your precautions on my account than that i think you might have left me to act according to my own judgment  mickle better not answered richiemickle better not we are a frail creatures and can judge better for ilk ither than in our ain cases and for me even myself saving that case of the sifflication which might have happened to ony one i have always observed myself to be much more prudential in what i have done in your lordships behalf than even in what i have been able to transact for my own interest whilk last i have indeed always postponed as in duty i ought  i do believe thou hast said lord nigel having ever found thee true and faithful and since london pleases you so little i will bid you a short farewell and you may go down to edinburgh until i come thither myself when i trust you will reenter into my service  now heaven bless you my lord said richie moniplies with uplifted eyes for that word sounds more like grace than ony has come out of your mouth this fortnighti give you godden my lord  so saying he thrust forth his immense bony hand seized on that of lord glenvarloch raised it to his lips then turned short on his heel and left the room hastily as if afraid of showing more emotion than was consistent with his ideas of decorum lord nigel rather surprised at his sudden exit called after him to know whether he was sufficiently provided with money but richie shaking his head without making any other answer ran hastily down stairs shut the streetdoor heavily behind him and was presently seen striding along the strand  his master almost involuntarily watched and distinguished the tall rawboned figure of his late follower from the window for some time until he was lost among the crowd of passengers nigels reflections were not altogether those of selfapproval it was no good sign of his course of life he could not help acknowledging this much to himself that so faithful an adherent no longer seemed to feel the same pride in his service or attachment to his person which he had formerly manifested neither could he avoid experiencing some twinges of conscience while he felt in some degree the charges which richie had preferred against him and experienced a sense of shame and mortification arising from the colour given by others to that which he himself would have called his caution and moderation in play he had only the apology that it had never occurred to himself in this light  then his pride and selflove suggested that on the other hand richie with all his good intentions was little better than a conceited pragmatical domestic who seemed disposed rather to play the tutor than the lackey and who out of sheer love as he alleged to his masters person assumed the privilege of interfering with and controlling his actions besides rendering him ridiculous in the gay world from the antiquated formality and intrusive presumption of his manners  nigels eyes were scarce turned from the window when his new landlord entering presented to him a slip of paper carefully bound round with a string of floxsilk and sealedit had been given in he said by a woman who did not stop an instant the contents harped upon the same string which richie moniplies had already jarred the epistle was in the following words  for the right honourable hands of lord glenvarloch  these from a friend unknown  my lord  you are trusting to an unhonest friend and diminishing an honest reputation an unknown but real friend of your lordship will speak in one word what you would not learn from flatterers in so many days as should suffice for your utter ruin he whom you think most truei say your friend lord dalgarnois utterly false to you and doth but seek under pretence of friendship to mar your fortune and diminish the good name by which you might mend it the kind countenance which he shows to you is more dangerous than the princes frown even as to gain at beaujeus ordinary is more discreditable than to lose beware of bothand this is all from your true but nameless friend     ignoto  lord glenvarloch paused for an instant and crushed the paper togetherthen again unfolded and read it with attentionbent his browsmused for a moment and then tearing it to fragments exclaimedbegone for a vile calumny but i will watchi will observe  thought after thought rushed on him but upon the whole lord glenvarloch was so little satisfied with the result of his own reflections that he resolved to dissipate them by a walk in the park and taking his cloak and beaver went thither accordingly     chapter xv     twas when fleet snowballs head was woxen grey   a luckless levret met him on his way   who knows not snowballhe whose race renownd   is still victorious on each coursing ground   swaffhanm newmarket and the roman camp   have seen them victors oer each meaner stamp   in vain the youngling sought with doubling wile   the hedge the hill the thicket or the stile   experience sage the lack of speed supplied   and in the gap he sought the victim died   so was i once in thy fair street saint james   through walking cavaliers and carborne dames   descried pursued turnd oer again and oer   coursed coted mouthd by an unfeeling bore                                         c c c  the park of saint jamess though enlarged planted with verdant alleys and otherwise decorated by charles ii existed in the days of his grandfather as a public and pleasant promenade and for the sake of exercise or pastime was much frequented by the better classes  lord glenvarloch repaired thither to dispel the unpleasant reflections which had been suggested by his parting with his trusty squire richie moniplies in a manner which was agreeable neither to his pride nor his feelings and by the corroboration which the hints of his late attendant had received from the anonymous letter mentioned in the end of the last chapter  there was a considerable number of company in the park when he entered it but his present state of mind inducing him to avoid society he kept aloof from the more frequented walks towards westminster and whitehall and drew to the north or as we should now say the piccadilly verge of the enclosure believing he might there enjoy or rather combat his own thoughts unmolested  in this however lord glenvarloch was mistaken for as he strolled slowly along with his arms folded in his cloak and his hat drawn over his eyes he was suddenly pounced upon by sir mungo malagrowther who either shunning or shunned had retreated or had been obliged to retreat to the same less frequented corner of the park  nigel started when he heard the high sharp and querulous tones of the knights cracked voice and was no less alarmed when he beheld his tall thin figure hobbling towards him wrapped in a threadbare cloak on whose surface ten thousand varied stains eclipsed the original scarlet and having his head surmounted with a wellworn beaver bearing a black velvet band for a chain and a capons feather for an ostrich plume  lord glenvarloch would fain have made his escape but as our motto intimates a leveret had as little chance to free herself of an experienced greyhound sir mungo to continue the simile had long ago learned to run cunning and make sure of mouthing his game so nigel found himself compelled to stand and answer the hackneyed question what news today  nothing extraordinary i believe answered the young nobleman attempting to pass on  o ye are ganging to the french ordinary belive replied the knight but it is early day yetwe will take a turn in the park in the meanwhileit will sharpen your appetite  so saying he quietly slipped his arm under lord glenvarlochs in spite of all the decent reluctance which his victim could exhibit by keeping his elbow close to his side and having fairly grappled the prize he proceeded to take it in tow  nigel was sullen and silent in hopes to shake off his unpleasant companion but sir mungo was determined that if he did not speak he should at least hear  ye are bound for the ordinary my lord said the cynicweel ye canna do betterthere is choice company there and peculiarly selected as i am tauld being dootless sic as it is desirable that young noblemen should herd withaland your noble father wad have been blithe to see you keeping such worshipful society  i believe said lord glenvarloch thinking himself obliged to say something that the society is as good as generally can be found in such places where the door can scarcely be shut against those who come to spend their money  right my lordvera right said his tormentor bursting out into a chuckling but most discordant laugh these citizen chuffs and clowns will press in amongst us when there is but an inch of a door open and what remedyjust een this that as their cash gies them confidence we should strip them of it flay them my lordsinge them as the kitchen wench does the rats and then they winna long to come back againay aypluck them plume themand then the larded capons will not be for flying so high a wing my lord among the goss hawks and sparrowhawks and the like  and therewithal sir mungo fixed on nigel his quick sharp grey eye watching the effect of his sarcasm as keenly as the surgeon in a delicate operation remarks the progress of his anatomical scalpel  nigel however willing to conceal his sensations could not avoid gratifying his tormentor by wincing under the operation he coloured with vexation and anger but a quarrel with sir mungo malagrowther would he felt be unutterably ridiculous and he only muttered to himself the words impertinent coxcomb which on this occasion sir mungos imperfection of organ did not prevent him from hearing and replying to  ay ayvera true exclaimed the caustic old courtierimpertinent coxcombs they are that thus intrude themselves on the society of their betters but your lordship kens how to gar them as gudeye have the trick ontthey had a braw sport in the presence last friday how ye suld have routed a young shopkeeper horse and foot taen his spolia ofima and a the specie he had about him down to the very silver buttons of his cloak and sent him to graze with nebuchadnezzar king of babylon muckle honour redounded to your lordship therebywe were tauld the loon threw himsell into the thames in a fit of desperation theres enow of them behindthere was mair tint on floddenedge  you have been told a budget of lies so far as i am concerned sir mungo said nigel speaking loud and sternly  vera likelyvera likely said the unabashed and undismayed sir mungo naething but lies are current in the circleso the chield is not drowned thenthe mairs the pitybut i never believed that part of the storya london dealer has mair wit in his anger i dare swear the lad has a bonny broomshank in his hand by this time and is scrubbing the kennels in quest after rusty nails to help him to begin his pack againhe has three bairns they say they will help him bravely to grope in the gutters your good lordship may have the ruining of him again my lord if they have any luck in strand scouring  this is more than intolerable said nigel uncertain whether to make an angry vindication of his character or to fling the old tormentor from his arm but an instants recollection convinced him that to do either would only give an air of truth and consistency to the scandals which he began to see were affecting his character both in the higher and lower circles hastily therefore he formed the wiser resolution to endure sir mungos studied impertinence under the hope of ascertaining if possible from what source those reports arose which were so prejudicial to his reputation  sir mungo in the meanwhile caught up as usual nigels last words or rather the sound of them and amplified and interpreted them in his own way tolerable luck he repeated yes truly my lord i am told that you have tolerable luck and that ye ken weel how to use that jilting quean dame fortune like a canny douce lad willing to warm yourself in her smiles without exposing yourself to her frowns and that is what i ca having luck in a bag  sir mungo malagrowther said lord glenvarloch turning towards him seriously have the goodness to hear me for a moment  as weel as i can my lordas weel as i can said sir mungo shaking his head and pointing the finger of his left hand to his ear  i will try to speak very distinctly said nigel arming himself with patience you take me for a noted gamester i give you my word that you have not been rightly informedi am none such you owe me some explanation at least respecting the source from which you have derived such false information  i never heard ye were a great gamester and never thought or said ye were such my lord said sir mungo who found it impossible to avoid hearing what nigel said with peculiarly deliberate and distinct pronunciation i repeat iti never heard said or thought that you were a ruffling gamestersuch as they call those of the first head look you my lord i call him a gamester that plays with equal stakes and equal skill and stands by the fortune of the game good or bad and i call him a ruffling gamester or ane of the first head who ventures frankly and deeply upon such a wager but he my lord who has the patience and prudence never to venture beyond small game such as at most might crack the christmasbox of a grocers prentice who vies with those that have little to hazard and who therefore having the larger stock can always rook them by waiting for his good fortune and by rising from the game when luck leaves himsuch a one as he my lord i do not call a great gamester to whatever other name he may be entitled  and such a meanspirited sordid wretch you would infer that i am replied lord glenvarloch one who fears the skilful and preys upon the ignorantwho avoids playing with his equals that he may make sure of pillaging his inferiorsis this what i am to understand has been reported of me  nay my lord you will gain nought by speaking big with me said sir mungo who besides that his sarcastic humour was really supported by a good fund of animal courage had also full reliance on the immunities which he had derived from the broadsword of sir rullion rattray and the baton of the satellites employed by the lady cockpen and for the truth of the matter he continued your lordship best knows whether you ever lost more than five pieces at a time since you frequented beaujeuswhether you have not most commonly risen a winnerand whether the brave young gallants who frequent the ordinaryi mean those of noble rank and means conformingare in use to play upon those terms  my father was right said lord glenvarloch in the bitterness of his spirit and his curse justly followed me when i first entered that place there is contamination in the air and he whose fortune avoids ruin shall be blighted in his honour and reputation  sir mungo who watched his victim with the delighted yet wary eye of an experienced angler became now aware that if he strained the line on him too tightly there was every risk of his breaking hold in order to give him room therefore to play he protested that lord glenvarloch should not take his free speech in malam partem if you were a trifle ower sicker in your amusement my lord it canna be denied that it is the safest course to prevent farther endangerment of your somewhat dilapidated fortunes and if ye play with your inferiors ye are relieved of the pain of pouching the siller of your friends and equals forby that the plebeian knaves have had the advantage tecum certasse as ajax telamon sayeth apud metamorphoseos and for the like of them to have played with ane scottish nobleman is an honest and honourable consideration to compensate the loss of their stake whilk i dare say moreover maist of the churls can weel afford  be that as it may sir mungo said nigel i would fain know  ay ay interrupted sir mungo and as you say who cares whether the fat bulls of bashan can spare it or no gentlemen are not to limit their sport for the like of them  i wish to know sir mungo said lord glenvarloch in what company you have learned these offensive particulars respecting me  dootlessdootless my lord said sir mungo i have ever heard and have ever reported that your lordship kept the best of company in a private waythere is the fine countess of blackchester but i think she stirs not much abroad since her affair with his grace of buckingham and there is the gude auldfashioned scottish nobleman lord huntinglen an undeniable man of qualityit is pity but he could keep caup and can frae his head whilk now and then dothminish his reputation and there is the gay young lord dalgarno that carries the craft of gray hairs under his curled lovelocksa fair race they are father daughter and son all of the same honourable family i think we needna speak of george heriot honest man when we have nobility in question so that is the company i have heard of your keeping my lord outtaken those of the ordinary  my company has not indeed been much more extended than amongst those you mention said lord glenvarloch but in short  to court said sir mungo that was just what i was going to say lord dalgarno says he cannot prevail on ye to come to court and that does ye prejudice my lordthe king hears of you by others when he should see you in personi speak in serious friendship my lord his majesty when you were named in the circle short while since was heard to say jacta est aleaglenvarlochides is turned dicer and drinkermy lord dalgarno took your part and he was een borne down by the popular voice of the courtiers who spoke of you as one who had betaken yourself to living a town life and risking your barons coronet amongst the flatcaps of the city  and this was publicly spoken of me said nigel and in the kings presence  spoken openly repeated sir mungo malagrowther ay by my troth was itthat is to say it was whispered privatelywhilk is as open promulgation as the thing permitted for ye may think the court is not like a place where men are as sib as simmie and his brother and roar out their minds as if they were at an ordinary  a curse on the court and the ordinary both cried nigel impatiently  with all my heart said the knight i have got little by a knights service in the court and the last time i was at the ordinary i lost four angels  may i pray of you sir mungo to let me know said nigel the names of those who thus make free with the character of one who can be but little known to them and who never injured any of them  have i not told you already answered sir mungo that the king said something to that effectso did the prince tooand such being the case ye may take it on your corporal oath that every man in the circle who was not silent sung the same song as they did  you said but now replied glenvarloch that lord dalgarno interfered in my behalf  in good troth did he answered sir mungo with a sneer but the young nobleman was soon borne downby token he had something of a catarrh and spoke as hoarse as a roopit raven poor gentleman if he had had his full extent of voice he would have been as well listened to dootless as in a cause of his ain whilk no man kens better how to plead to purposeand let me ask you by the way continued sir mungo whether lord dalgarno has ever introduced your lordship to the prince or the duke of buckingham either of whom might soon carry through your suit  i have no claim on the favour of either the prince or the duke of buckingham said lord glenvarlochas you seem to have made my affairs your study sir mungo although perhaps something unnecessarily you may have heard that i have petitioned my sovereign for payment of a debt due to my family i cannot doubt the kings desire to do justice nor can i in decency employ the solicitation of his highness the prince or his grace the duke of buckingham to obtain from his majesty what either should be granted me as a right or refused altogether  sir mungo twisted his whimsical features into one of his most grotesque sneers as he replied  it is a vera clear and parspicuous position of the case my lord and in relying thereupon you show an absolute and unimprovable acquaintance with the king court and mankind in generalbut whom have we got herestand up my lord and make wayby my word of honour they are the very men we spoke oftalk of the devil and humph  it must be here premised that during the conversation lord glenvarloch perhaps in the hope of shaking himself free of sir mungo had directed their walk towards the more frequented part of the park while the good knight had stuck to him being totally indifferent which way they went provided he could keep his talons clutched upon his companion they were still however at some distance from the livelier part of the scene when sir mungos experienced eye noticed the appearances which occasioned the latter part of his speech to lord glenvarloch a low respectful murmur arose among the numerous groups of persons which occupied the lower part of the park they first clustered together with their faces turned towards whitehall then fell back on either hand to give place to a splendid party of gallants who advancing from the palace came onward through the park all the other company drawing off the pathway and standing uncovered as they passed  most of these courtly gallants were dressed in the garb which the pencil of vandyke has made familiar even at the distance of nearly two centuries and which was just at this period beginning to supersede the more fluttering and frivolous dress which had been adopted from the french court of henri quatre  the whole train were uncovered excepting the prince of wales afterwards the most unfortunate of british monarchs who came onward having his long curled auburn tresses and his countenance which even in early youth bore a shade of anticipated melancholy shaded by the spanish hat and the single ostrich feather which drooped from it on his right hand was buckingham whose commanding and at the same time graceful deportment threw almost into shade the personal demeanour and majesty of the prince on whom he attended the eye movements and gestures of the great courtier were so composed so regularly observant of all etiquette belonging to his situation as to form a marked and strong contrast with the forward gaiety and frivolity by which he recommended himself to the favour of his dear dad and gossip king james a singular fate attended this accomplished courtier in being at once the reigning favourite of a father and son so very opposite in manners that to ingratiate himself with the youthful prince he was obliged to compress within the strictest limits of respectful observance the frolicsome and free humour which captivated his aged father  it is true buckingham well knew the different dispositions both of james and charles and had no difficulty in so conducting himself as to maintain the highest post in the favour of both it has indeed been supposed as we before hinted that the duke when he had completely possessed himself of the affections of charles retained his hold in those of the father only by the tyranny of custom and that james could he have brought himself to form a vigorous resolution was in the latter years of his life especially not unlikely to have discarded buckingham from his counsels and favour but if ever the king indeed meditated such a change he was too timid and too much accustomed to the influence which the duke had long exercised over him to summon up resolution enough for effecting such a purpose and at all events it is certain that buckingham though surviving the master by whom he was raised had the rare chance to experience no wane of the most splendid courtfavour during two reigns until it was at once eclipsed in his blood by the dagger of his assassin felton  to return from this digression the prince with his train advanced and were near the place where lord glenvarloch and sir mungo had stood aside according to form in order to give the prince passage and to pay the usual marks of respect nigel could now remark that lord dalgarno walked close behind the duke of buckingham and as he thought whispered something in his ear as they came onward at any rate both the princes and duke of buckinghams attention seemed to be directed by such circumstance towards nigel for they turned their heads in that direction and looked at him attentivelythe prince with a countenance the grave melancholy expression of which was blended with severity while buckinghams looks evinced some degree of scornful triumph lord dalgarno did not seem to observe his friend perhaps because the sunbeams fell from the side of the walk on which nigel stood obliging malcolm to hold up his hat to screen his eyes  as the prince passed lord glenvarloch and sir mungo bowed as respect required and the prince returning their obeisance with that grave ceremony which paid to every rank its due but not a tittle beyond it signed to sir mungo to come forward commencing an apology for his lameness as he started which he had just completed as his hobbling gait brought him up to the prince sir mungo lent an attentive and as it seemed an intelligent ear to questions asked in a tone so low that the knight would certainly have been deaf to them had they been put to him by any one under the rank of prince of wales after about a minutes conversation the prince bestowed on nigel the embarrassing notice of another fixed look touched his hat slightly to sir mungo and walked on  it is even as i suspected my lord said sir mungo with an air which he designed to be melancholy and sympathetic but which in fact resembled the grin of an ape when he has mouthed a scalding chestnutye have backfriends my lord that is unfriendsor to be plain enemiesabout the person of the prince  i am sorry to hear it said nigel but i would i knew what they accuse me of  ye shall hear my lord said sir mungo the princes vera words sir mungo said he i rejoice to see you and am glad your rheumatic troubles permit you to come hither for exercisei bowed as in duty boundye might remark my lord that i did so whilk formed the first branch of our conversationhis highness then demanded of me if he with whom i stood was the young lord glenvarloch i answered that you were such for his highnesss service whilk was the second branchthirdly his highness resuming the argument said that truly he had been told so meaning that he had been told you were that personage but that he could not believe that the heir of that noble and decayed house could be leading an idle scandalous and precarious life in the eating houses and taverns of london while the kings drums were beating and colours flying in germany in the cause of the palatine his sonin lawi could your lordship is aware do nothing but make an obeisance and a gracious give ye goodday sir mungo malagrowther licensed me to fall back to your lordship and now my lord if your business or pleasure calls you to the ordinary or anywhere in the direction of the citywhy have with you for dootless ye will think ye have tarried lang enough in the park as they will likely turn at the head of the walk and return this wayand you have a broad hint i think not to cross the princes presence in a hurry  you may stay or go as you please sir mungo said nigel with an expression of calm but deep resentment but for my own part my resolution is taken i will quit this public walk for pleasure of no manstill less will i quit it like one unworthy to be seen in places of public resort i trust that the prince and his retinue will return this way as you expect for i will abide sir mungo and beard them  beard them exclaimed sir mungo in the extremity of surprise beard the prince of walesthe heirapparent of the kingdomsby my saul you shall beard him yourself then  accordingly he was about to leave nigel very hastily when some unwonted touch of goodnatured interest in his youth and experience seemed suddenly to soften his habitual cynicism  the devil is in me for an auld fule said sir mungo but i must needs concern myselli that owe so little either to fortune or my fellowcreatures must i say needs concern mysellwith this springald whom i will warrant to be as obstinate as a pig possessed with a devil for its the cast of his family and yet i maun een fling away some sound advice on himmy dainty young lord glenvarloch understand me distinctly for this is no bairnsplay when the prince said sae much to me as i have repeated to you it was equivalent to a command not to appear in his presence wherefore take an auld mans advice that wishes you weel and maybe a wee thing better than he has reason to wish ony body jouk and let the jaw gae by like a canny bairngang hame to your lodgings keep your foot frae taverns and your fingers frae the dicebox compound your affairs quietly wi some ane that has better favour than yours about court and you will get a round spell of money to carry you to germany or elsewhere to push your fortune it was a fortunate soldier that made your family four or five hundred years syne and if you are brave and fortunate you may find the way to repair it but take my word for it that in this court you will never thrive  when sir mungo had completed his exhortation in which there was more of sincere sympathy with anothers situation than he had been heretofore known to express in behalf of any one lord glenvarloch replied i am obliged to you sir mungoyou have spoken i think with sincerity and i thank you but in return for your good advice i heartily entreat you to leave me i observe the prince and his train are returning down the walk and you may prejudice yourself but cannot help me by remaining with me  and that is truesaid sir mungo yet were i ten years younger i would be tempted to stand by you and gie them the meeting but at threescore and upward mens courage turns cauldrife and they that canna win a living must not endanger the small sustenance of their age i wish you weel through my lord but it is an unequal fight so saying he turned and limped away often looking back however as if his natural spirit even in its present subdued state aided by his love of contradiction and of debate rendered him unwilling to adopt the course necessary for his own security  thus abandoned by his companion whose departure he graced with better thoughts of him than those which he bestowed on his appearance nigel remained with his arms folded and reclining against a solitary tree which overhung the path making up his mind to encounter a moment which he expected to be critical of his fate but he was mistaken in supposing that the prince of wales would either address him or admit him to expostulation in such a public place as the park he did not remain unnoticed however for when he made a respectful but haughty obeisance intimating in look and manner that he was possessed of and undaunted by the unfavourable opinion which the prince had so lately expressed charles returned his reverence with such a frown as is only given by those whose frown is authority and decision the train passed on the duke of buckingham not even appearing to see lord glenvarloch while lord dalgarno though no longer incommoded by the sunbeams kept his eyes which had perhaps been dazzled by their former splendour bent upon the ground  lord glenvarloch had difficulty to restrain an indignation to which in the circumstances it would have been madness to have given vent he started from his reclining posture and followed the princes train so as to keep them distinctly in sight which was very easy as they walked slowly nigel observed them keep their road towards the palace where the prince turned at the gate and bowed to the noblemen in attendance in token of dismissing them and entered the palace accompanied only by the duke of buckingham and one or two of his equerries the rest of the train having returned in  all dutiful humility the farewell of the prince began to disperse themselves through the park  all this was carefully noticed by lord glenvarloch who as he adjusted his cloak and drew his swordbelt round so as to bring the hilt closer to his hand muttereddalgarno shall explain all this to me for it is evident that he is in the secret     chapter xvi     give waygive wayi must and will have justice   and tell me not of privilege and place   where i am injured there ill sue redress   look to it every one who bars my access   i have a heart to feel the injury   a hand to night myself and by my honour   that hand shall grasp what greybeard law denies me                                 the chamberlain  it was not long ere nigel discovered lord dalgarno advancing towards him in the company of another young man of quality of the princes train and as they directed their course towards the southeastern corner of the park he concluded they were about to go to lord huntinglens they stopped however and turned up another path leading to the north and lord glenvarloch conceived that this change of direction was owing to their having seen him and their desire to avoid him  nigel followed them without hesitation by a path which winding around a thicket of shrubs and trees once more conducted him to the less frequented part of the park he observed which side of the thicket was taken by lord dalgarno and his companion and he himself walking hastily round the other verge was thus enabled to meet them face to face  goodmorrow my lord dalgarno said lord glenvarloch sternly  ha my friend nigel answered lord dalgarno in his usual careless and indifferent tone my friend nigel with business on his brow but you must wait till we meet at beaujeus at noonsir ewes haldimund and i are at present engaged in the princes service  if you were engaged in the kings my lord said lord glenvarloch you must stand and answer me  heyday said lord dalgarno with an air of great astonishment what passion is this why nigel this is king cambyses veinyou have frequented the theatres too much latelyaway with this folly man go dine upon soup and salad drink succorywater to cool your blood go to bed at sundown and defy those foul fiends wrath and misconstruction  i have had misconstruction enough among you said glenvarloch in the same tone of determined displeasure and from you my lord dalgarno in particular and all under the mask of friendship  here is a proper businesssaid dalgarno turning as if to appeal to sir ewes haldimund do you see this angry ruffler sir ewes a month since he dared not have looked one of yonder sheep in the face and now he is a prince of roisterers a plucker of pigeons a controller of players and poetsand in gratitude for my having shown him the way to the eminent character which he holds upon town he comes hither to quarrel with his best friend if not his only one of decent station  i renounce such hollow friendship my lord said lord glenvarloch i disclaim the character which even to my very face you labour to fix upon me and ere we part i will call you to a reckoning for it  my lords both interrupted sir ewes haldimund let me remind you that the royal park is no place to quarrel in  i will make my quarrel good said nigel who did not know or in his passion might not have recollected the privileges  of the place wherever i find my enemy  you shall find quarelling enough replied lord dalgarno calmly so soon as you assign a sufficient cause for it sir ewes haldimund who knows the court will warrant you that i am not backward on such occasionsbut of what is it that you now complain after having experienced nothing save kindness from me and my family  of your family i complain not replied lord glenvarloch they have done for me all they could more far more than i could have expected but you my lord have suffered me while you called me your friend to be traduced where a word of your mouth would have placed my character in its true coloursand hence the injurious message which i just now received from the prince of wales to permit the misrepresentation of a friend my lord is to share in the slander  you have been misinformed my lord glenvarloch said sir ewes haldimund i have myself often heard lord dalgarno defend your character and regret that your exclusive attachment to the pleasures of a london life prevented your paying your duty regularly to the king and prince  while he himself said lord glenvarloch dissuaded me from presenting myself at court  i will cut this matter short said lord dalgarno with haughty coldness you seem to have conceived my lord that you and i were pylades and orestesa second edition of damon and pythiastheseus and pirithoiis at the least you are mistaken and have given the name of friendship to what on my part was mere goodnature and compassion for a raw and ignorant countryman joined to the cumbersome charge which my father gave me respecting you your character my lord is of no ones drawing but of your own making i introduced you where as in all such places there was good and indifferent company to be met withyour habits or taste made you prefer the worse your holy horror at the sight of dice and cards degenerated into the cautious resolution to play only at those times and with such persons as might ensure your rising a winnerno man can long do so and continue to be held a gentleman such is the reputation you have made for yourself and you have no right to be angry that i do not contradict in society what yourself know to be true let us pass on my lord and if you want further explanation seek some other time and fitter place  no time can be better than the present said lord glenvarloch whose resentment was now excited to the uttermost by the coldblooded and insulting manner in which dalgarno vindicated himselfno place fitter than the place where we now stand those of my house have ever avenged insult at the moment and on the spot where it was offered were it at the foot of the thronelord dalgarno you are a villain draw and defend yourself at the same moment he unsheathed his rapier  are you mad said lord dalgarno stepping back we are in the precincts of the court  the better answered lord glenvarloch i will cleanse them from a calumniator and a coward he then pressed on lord dalgarno and struck him with the flat of the sword  the fray had now attracted attention and the cry went round keep the peacekeep the peaceswords drawn in the parkwhat ho guardskeepersyeomenrangers and a number of people came rushing to the spot from all sides  lord dalgarno who had half drawn his sword on receiving the blow returned it to his scabbard when he observed the crowd thicken and taking sir ewes haldimund by the arm walked hastily away only saying to lord glenvarloch as they left him you shall dearly abye this insultwe will meet again  a decentlooking elderly man who observed that lord glenvarloch remained on the spot taking compassion on his youthful appearance said to him are you aware that this is a starchamber business young gentleman and that it may cost you your right handshift for yourself before the keepers or constables come upget into whitefriars or somewhere for sanctuary and concealment till you can make friends or quit the city  the advice was not to be neglected lord glenvarloch made hastily towards the issue from the park by saint jamess palace then saint jamess hospital the hubbub increased behind him and several peace officers of the royal household came up to apprehend the delinquent fortunately for nigel a popular edition of the cause of the affray had gone abroad it was said that one of the duke of buckinghams companions had insulted a stranger gentleman from the country and that the stranger had cudgelled him soundly a favourite or the companion of a favourite is always odious to john bull who has besides a partiality to those disputants who proceed as lawyers term it par wye du fait and both prejudices were in nigels favour the officers therefore who came to apprehend him could learn from the spectators no particulars of his appearance or information concerning the road he had taken so that for the moment he escaped being arrested  what lord glenvarloch heard among the crowd as he passed along was sufficient to satisfy him that in his impatient passion he had placed himself in a predicament of considerable danger  he was no stranger to the severe and arbitrary proceedings of the court of starchamber especially in cases of breach of privilege which made it the terror of all men and it was no farther back than the queens time that the punishment of mutilation had been actually awarded and executed for some offence of the same kind which he had just committed he had also the comfortable reflection that by his violent quarrel with lord dalgarno he must now forfeit the friendship and good offices of that noblemans father and sister almost the only persons of consideration in whom he could claim any interest while all the evil reports which had been put in circulation concerning his character were certain to weigh heavily against him in a case where much must necessarily depend on the reputation of the accused to a youthful imagination the idea of such a punishment as mutilation seems more ghastly than death itself and every word which he overheard among the groups which he met mingled with or overtook and passed announced this as the penalty of his offence he dreaded to increase his pace for fear of attracting suspicion and more than once saw the rangers officers so near him that his wrist tingled as if already under the blade of the dismembering knife at length he got out of the park and had a little more leisure to consider what he was next to do  whitefriars adjacent to the temple then well known by the cant name of alsatia had at this time and for nearly a century afterwards the privilege of a sanctuary unless against the writ of the lord chief justice or of the lords of the privycouncil indeed as the place abounded with desperadoes of every descriptionbankrupt citizens ruined gamesters irreclaimable prodigals desperate duellists bravoes homicides and debauched profligates of every description all leagued together to maintain the immunities of their asylumit was both difficult and unsafe for the officers of the law to execute warrants emanating even from the highest authority amongst men whose safety was inconsistent with warrants or authority of any kind this lord glenvarloch well knew and odious as the place of refuge was it seemed the only one where for a space at least he might be concealed and secure from the immediate grasp of the law until he should have leisure to provide better for his safety or to get this unpleasant matter in some shape accommodated  meanwhile as nigel walked hastily forward towards the place of sanctuary he bitterly blamed himself for suffering lord dalgarno to lead him into the haunts of dissipation and no less accused his intemperate heat of passion which now had driven him for refuge into the purlieus of profane and avowed vice and debauchery  dalgarno spoke but too truly in that were his bitter reflections i have made myself an evil reputation by acting on his insidious counsels and neglecting the wholesome admonitions which ought to have claimed implicit obedience from me and which recommended abstinence even from the slightest approach of evil but if i escape from the perilous labyrinth in which folly and inexperience as well as violent passions have involved me i will find some noble way of redeeming the lustre of a name which was never sullied until i bore it  as lord glenvarloch formed these prudent resolutions he entered the temple walks whence a gate at that time opened into whitefriars by which as by the more private passage he proposed to betake himself to the sanctuary as he approached the entrance to that den of infamy from which his mind recoiled even while in the act of taking shelter there his pace slackened while the steep and broken stairs reminded him of the facilis descensus averni and rendered him doubtful whether it were not better to brave the worst which could befall him in the public haunts of honourable men than to evade punishment by secluding himself in those of avowed vice and profligacy  as nigel hesitated a young gentleman of the temple advanced towards him whom he had often seen and sometimes conversed with at the ordinary where he was a frequent and welcome guest being a wild young gallant indifferently well provided with money who spent at the theatres and other gay places of public resort the time which his father supposed he was employing in the study of the law but reginald lowestoffe such was the young templars name was of opinion that little law was necessary to enable him to spend the revenues of the paternal acres which were to devolve upon him at his fathers demose and therefore gave himself no trouble to acquire more of that science than might be imbibed along with the learned air of the region in which he had his chambers in other respects he was one of the wits of the place read ovid and martial aimed at quick repartee and pun often very far fetched danced fenced played at tennis and performed sundry tunes on the fiddle and french horn to the great annoyance of old counsellor barratter who lived in the chambers immediately below him such was reginald lowestoffe shrewd alert and wellacquainted with the town through all its recesses but in a sort of disrespectable way this gallant now approaching the lord glenvarloch saluted him by name and title and asked if his lordship designed for the chevaliers this day observing it was near noon and the woodcock would be on the board before they could reach the ordinary  i do not go there today answered lord glenvarloch which way then my lord said the young templar who was perhaps not undesirous to parade a part at least of the street in company with a lord though but a scottish one  ii said nigel desiring to avail himself of this young mans local knowledge yet unwilling and ashamed to acknowledge his intention to take refuge in so disreputable a quarter or to describe the situation in which he stoodi have some curiosity to see whitefriars  what your lordship is for a frolic into alsatia said lowestoffe have with you my lordyou cannot have a better guide to the infernal regions than myself i promise you there are bonarobas to be found theregood wine too ay and good fellows to drink it with though somewhat suffering under the frowns of fortune but your lordship will pardon meyou are the last of our acquaintance to whom i would have proposed such a voyage of discovery  i am obliged to you master lowestoffe for the good opinion you have expressed in the observation said lord glenvarloch but my present circumstances may render even a residence of a day or two in the sanctuary a matter of necessity  indeed said lowestoffe in a tone of great surprise i thought your lordship had always taken care not to risk any considerable stakei beg pardon but if the bones have proved perfidious i know just so much law as that a peers person is sacred from arrest and for mere impecuniosity my lord better shift can be made elsewhere than in whitefriars where all are devouring each other for very poverty  my misfortune has no connexion with want of money said nigel  why then i suppose said lowestoffe you have been tilting my lord and have pinked your man in which case and with a purse reasonably furnished you may lie perdu in whitefriars for a twelvemonthmarry but you must be entered and received as a member of their worshipful society my lord and a frank burgher of alsatia so far you must condescend there will be neither peace nor safety for you else  my fault is not in a degree so deadly master lowestoffe answered lord glenvarloch as you seem to conjecturei have stricken a gentleman in the park that is all  by my hand my lord and you had better have struck your sword through him at barns elms said the templar strike within the verge of the court you will find that a weighty dependence upon your hands especially if your party be of rank and have favour  i will be plain with you master lowestoffe said nigel since i have gone thus far the person i struck was lord dalgarno whom you have seen at beaujeus  a follower and favourite of the duke of buckinghamit is a most unhappy chance my lord but my heart was formed in england and cannot bear to see a young nobleman borne down as you are like to be we converse here greatly too open for your circumstances the templars would suffer no bailiff to execute a writ and no gentleman to be arrested for a duel within their precincts but in such a matter between lord dalgarno and your lordship there might be a party on either side you must away with me instantly to my poor chambers here hard by and undergo some little change of dress ere you take sanctuary for else you will have the whole rascal rout of the friars about you like crows upon a falcon that strays into their rookery we must have you arrayed something more like the natives of alsatia or there will be no life there for you  while lowestoffe spoke he pulled lord glenvarloch along with him into his chambers where he had a handsome library filled with all the poems and playbooks which were then in fashion the templar then dispatched a boy who waited upon him to procure a dish or two from the next cooks shop and this he said must be your lordships dinner with a glass of old sack of which my grandmother the heavens requite her sent me a dozen bottles with charge to use the liquor only with clarified whey when i felt my breast ache with over study marry we will drink the good ladys health in it if it is your lordships pleasure and you shall see how we poor students eke out our muttoncommons in the hall  the outward door of the chambers was barred so soon as the boy had re entered with the food the boy was ordered to keep close watch and admit no one and lowestoffe by example and precept pressed his noble guest to partake of his hospitality his frank and forward manners though much differing from the courtly ease of lord dalgarno were calculated to make a favourable impression and lord glenvarloch though his experience of dalgarnos perfidy had taught him to be cautious of reposing faith in friendly professions could not avoid testifying his gratitude to the young templar who seemed so anxious for his safety and accommodation  you may spare your gratitude any great sense of obligation my lord said the templar no doubt i am willing to be of use to any gentleman that has cause to sing fortune my foe and particularly proud to serve your lordships turn but i have also an old grudge to speak heavens truth at your opposite lord dalgarno  may i ask on what account master lowestoffe said lord glenvarloch  o my lord replied the templar it was for a hap that chanced after you left the ordinary one evening about three weeks sinceat least i think you were not by as your lordship always left us before deep play begani mean no offence but such was your lordships customwhen there were words between lord dalgarno and me concerning a certain game at gleek and a certain mournival of aces held by his lordship which went for eighttib which went for fifteentwenty three in all now i held king and queen being threea natural towser making fifteenand tiddy nineteen we vied the ruff and revied as your lordship may suppose till the stake was equal to half my yearly exhibition fifty as fair yellow canary birds as eer chirped in the bottom of a green silk purse well my lord i gained the cards and lo you it pleases his lordship to say that we played without tiddy and as the rest stood by and backed him and especially the sharking frenchman why i was obliged to lose more than i shall gain all the seasonso judge if i have not a crow to pluck with his lordship was it ever heard there was a game at gleek at the ordinary before without counting tiddymarry quep upon his lordshipevery man who comes there with his purse in his hand is as free to make new laws as he i hope since touch pot touch penny makes every man equal  as master lowestoffe ran over this jargon of the gamingtable lord glenvarloch was both ashamed and mortified and felt a severe pang of aristocratic pride when he concluded in the sweeping clause that the dice like the grave levelled those distinguishing points of society to which nigels early prejudices clung perhaps but too fondly it was impossible however to object any thing to the learned reasoning of the young templar and therefore nigel was contented to turn the conversation by making some inquiries respecting the present state of whitefriars there also his host was at home  you know my lord said master lowestoffe that we templars are a power and a dominion within ourselves and i am proud to say that i hold some rank in our republicwas treasurer to the lord of misrule last year and am at this present moment in nomination for that dignity myself in such circumstances we are under the necessity of maintaining an amicable intercourse with our neighbours of alsatia even as the christian states find themselves often in mere policy obliged to make alliance with the grand turk or the barbary states  i should have imagined you gentlemen of the temple more independent of your neighbours said lord glenvarloch  you do us something too much honour my lord said the templar the alsatians and we have some common enemies and we have under the rose some common friends we are in the use of blocking all bailiffs out of our bounds and we are powerfully aided by our neighbours who tolerate not a rag belonging to them within theirs moreover the alsatians havei beg you to understand methe power of protecting or distressing our friends male or female who may be obliged to seek sanctuary within their bounds in short the two communities serve each other though the league is between states of unequal quality and i may myself say that i have treated of sundry weighty affairs and have been a negotiator well approved on both sidesbut hark harkwhat is that  the sound by which master lowestoffe was interrupted was that of a distant horn winded loud and keenly and followed by a faint and remote huzza  there is something doing said lowestoffe in the whitefriars at this moment that is the signal when their privileges are invaded by tipstaff or bailiff and at the blast of the horn they all swarm out to the rescue as bees when their hive is disturbedjump jim he said calling out to the attendant and see what they are doing in alsatiathat bastard of a boy he continued as the lad accustomed to the precipitate haste of his master tumbled rather than ran out of the apartment and so down stairs is worth gold in this quarterhe serves six mastersfour of them in distinct numbers and you would think him present like a fairy at the mere wish of him that for the time most needs his attendance no scout in oxford no gip in cambridge ever matched him in speed and intelligence he knows the step of a dun from that of a client when it reaches the very bottom of the staircase can tell the trip of a pretty wench from the step of a bencher when at the upper end of the court and is take him all in allbut i see your lordship is anxiousmay i press another cup of my kind grandmothers cordial or will you allow me to show you my wardrobe and act as your valet or groom of the chamber  lord glenvarloch hesitated not to acknowledge that he was painfully sensible of his present situation and anxious to do what must needs be done for his extrication  the goodnatured and thoughtless young templar readily acquiesced and led the way into his little bedroom where from bandboxes portmanteaus mailtrunks not forgetting an old walnuttree wardrobe he began to select the articles which he thought best suited effectually to disguise his guest in venturing into the lawless and turbulent society of alsatia     chapter xvii    come hither young onemark me thou art now  mongst men o the sword that live by reputation  more than by constant incomesinglesuited  they are i grant you yet each single suit  maintains on the rough guess a thousand followers  and they be men who hazarding their all  needful apparel necessary income  and human body and immortal soul  do in the very deed but hazard nothing  so strictly is that all bound

                               the mohocks  your lordship said reginald lowestoffe must be content to exchange your decent and courtbeseeming rapier which i will retain in safe keeping for this broadsword with an hundredweight of rusty iron about the hilt and to wear these hugepaned slops instead of your civil and moderate hose we allow no cloak for your ruffian always walks in cuerpo and the tarnished doublet of bald velvet with its discoloured embroidery andi grieve to speak ita few stains from the blood of the grape will best suit the garb of a roaring boy i will leave you to change your suit for an instant till i can help to truss you  lowestoffe retired while slowly and with hesitation nigel obeyed his instructions he felt displeasure and disgust at the scoundrelly disguise which he was under the necessity of assuming but when he considered the bloody consequences which law attached to his rash act of violence the easy and indifferent temper of james the prejudices of his son the overbearing influence of the duke of buckingham which was sure to be thrown into the scale against him and above all when he reflected that he must now look upon the active assiduous and insinuating lord dalgarno as a bitter enemy reason told him he was in a situation of peril which authorised all honest means even the most unseemly in outward appearance to extricate himself from so dangerous a predicament  while he was changing his dress and musing on these particulars his friendly host reentered the sleeping apartmentzounds he said my lord it was well you went not straight into that same alsatia of ours at the time you proposed for the hawks have stooped upon it here is jem come back with tidings that he saw a pursuivant there with a privycouncil warrant and half a score of yeomen assistants armed to the teeth and the horn which we heard was sounded to call out the posse of the friars indeed when old duke hildebrod saw that the quest was after some one of whom he knew nothing he permitted out of courtesy the mancatcher to search through his dominions quite certain that they would take little by their motions for duke hildebrod is a most judicious potentatego back you bastard and bring us word when all is quiet  and who may duke hildebrod be said lord glenvarloch  nouns my lord said the templar have you lived so long on the town and never heard of the valiant and as wise and politic as valiant duke hildebrod grand protector of the liberties of alsatia i thought the man had never whirled a die but was familiar with his fame  yet i have never heard of him master lowestoffe said lord glenvarloch or what is the same thing i have paid no attention to aught that may have passed in conversation respecting him  why then said lowestoffebut first let me have the honour of trussing you now observe i have left several of the points untied of set purpose and if it please you to let a small portion of your shirt be seen betwixt your doublet and the band of your upper stock it will have so much the more rakish effect and will attract you respect in alsatia where linen is something scarce now i tie some of the points carefully asquint for your ruffianly gallant never appears too accurately trussedso  arrange it as you will sir said nigel but let me hear at least something of the conditions of the unhappy district into which with other wretches i am compelled to retreat  why my lord replied the templar our neighbouring state of alsatia which the law calls the sanctuary of whitefriars has had its mutations and revolutions like greater kingdoms and being in some sort a lawless arbitrary government it follows of course that these have been more frequent than our own better regulated commonwealth of the templars that of grays inn and other similar associations have had the fortune to witness our traditions and records speak of twenty revolutions within the last twelve years in which the aforesaid state has repeatedly changed from absolute despotism to republicanism not forgetting the intermediate stages of oligarchy limited monarchy and even gynocracy for i myself remember alsatia governed for nearly nine months by an old fishwoman i hen it fell under the dominion of a broken attorney who was dethroned by a reformado captain who proving tyrannical was deposed by a hedgeparson who was succeeded upon resignation of his power by duke jacob hildebrod of that name the first whom heaven long preserve  and is this potentates government said lord glenvarloch forcing himself to take some interest in the conversation of a despotic character  pardon me my lord said the templar this said sovereign is too wise to incur like many of his predecessors the odium of wielding so important an authority by his own sole will he has established a council of state who regularly meet for their mornings draught at seven oclock convene a second time at eleven for their ante meridiem or whet and assembling in solemn conclave at the hour of two afternoon for the purpose of consulting for the good of the commonwealth are so prodigal of their labour in the service of the state that they seldom separate before midnight into this worthy senate composed partly of duke hildebrods predecessors in his high office whom he has associated with him to prevent the envy attending sovereign and sole authority i must presently introduce your lordship that they may admit you to the immunities of the friars and assign you a place of residence  does their authority extend to such regulation said lord glenvarloch  the council account it a main point of their privileges my lord answered lowestoffe and in fact it is one of the most powerful means by which they support their authority for when duke ilildebrod and his senate find a topping householder in the friars becomes discontented and factious it is but assigning him for a lodger some fat bankrupt or new lesidenter whose circumstances require refuge and whose purse can pay for it and the malecontent becomes as tractable as a lamb as for the poorer refugees they let them shift as they can but the registration of their names in the dukes entry book and the payment of garnish conforming to their circumstances is never dispensed with and the friars would be a very unsafe residence for the stranger who should dispute these points of jurisdiction  well master lowestoffe said lord glenvarloch i must be controlled by the circumstances which dictate to me this state of concealmentof course i am desirous not to betray my name and rank  it will be highly advisable my lord said lowestoffe and is a case thus provided for in the statutes of the republic or monarchy or whatsoever you call ithe who desires that no questions shall be asked him concerning his name cause of refuge and the like may escape the usual interrogations upon payment of double the garnish otherwise belonging to his condition complying with this essential stipulation your lordship may register yourself as king of bantam if you will for not a question will be asked of youbut here comes our scout with news of peace and tranquillity now i will go with your lordship myself and present you to the council of alsatia with all the influence which i have over them as an officebearer in the temple which is not slight for they have come halting off upon all occasions when we have taken part against them and that they well know the time is propitious for as the council is now met in alsatia so the temple walks are quiet now my lord throw your cloak about you to hide your present exterior you shall give it to the boy at the foot of the stairs that go down to the sanctuary and as the ballad says that queen eleanor sunk at charing cross and rose at queenhithe so you shall sink a nobleman in the temple gardens and rise an alsatian at whitefriars  they went out accordingly attended by the little scout traversed the gardens descended the stairs and at the bottom the young templar exclaimedand now let us sing with ovid  in nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas  off off ye lendings he continued in the same vein via the curtain that shadowed borgiabut how now my lord he continued when he observed lord glenvarloch was really distressed at the degrading change in his situation i trust you are not offended at my rattling folly i would but reconcile you to your present circumstances and give you the tone of this strange place come cheer up i trust it will only be your residence for a very few days  nigel was only able to press his hand and reply in a whisper i am sensible of your kindness i know i must drink the cup which my own folly has filled for me pardon me that at the first taste i feel its bitterness  reginald lowestoffe was bustlingly officious and goodnatured but used to live a scrambling rakish course of life himself he had not the least idea of the extent of lord glenvarlochs mental sufferings and thought of his temporary concealment as if it were merely the trick of a wanton boy who plays at hideandseek with his tutor with the appearance of the place too he was familiarbut on his companion it produced a deep sensation  the ancient sanctuary at whitefriars lay considerably lower than the elevated terraces and gardens of the temple and was therefore generally involved in the damps and fogs arising from the thames the brick buildings by which it was occupied crowded closely on each other for in a place so rarely privileged every foot of ground was valuable but erected in many cases by persons whose funds were inadequate to their speculations the houses were generally insufficient and exhibited the lamentable signs of having become ruinous while they were yet new the wailing of children the scolding of their mothers the miserable exhibition of ragged linens hung from the windows to dry spoke the wants and distresses of the wretched inhabitants while the sounds of complaint were mocked and overwhelmed in the riotous shouts oaths profane songs and boisterous laughter that issued from the alehouses and taverns which as the signs indicated were equal in number to all the other houses and that the full character of the place might be evident several faded tinselled and painted females looked boldly at the strangers from their open lattices or more modestly seemed busied with the cracked flowerpots filled with mignonette and rosemary which were disposed in front of the windows to the great risk of the passengers  semireducta venus said the templar pointing to one of these nymphs who seemed afraid of observation and partly concealed herself behind the casement as she chirped to a miserable blackbird the tenant of a wicker prison which hung outside on the black brick walli know the face of yonder waistcoateer continued the guide and i could wager a rosenoble from the posture she stands in that she has clean headgear and a soiled nightrailbut here come two of the male inhabitants smoking like moving volcanoes these are roaring blades whom nicotia and trinidado serve i dare swear in lieu of beef and pudding for be it known to you my lord that the kings counterblast against the indian weed will no more pass current in alsatia than will his writ of capias  as he spoke the two smokers approached shaggy uncombed ruffians whose enormous mustaches were turned back over their ears and mingled with the wild elflocks of their hair much of which was seen under the old beavers which they wore aside upon their heads while some straggling portion escaped through the rents of the hats aforesaid their tarnished plush jerkins large slops or trunkbreeches their broad greasy shoulderbelts and discoloured scarfs and above all the ostentatious manner in which the one wore a broadsword and the other an extravagantly long rapier and poniard marked the true alsatian bully then and for a hundred years afterwards a wellknown character  tour out said the one ruffian to the other tour the bien mort twiring at the gentry cove footnote look sharp see how the girl is coquetting with the strange gallants  i smell a spy replied the other looking at nigel chalk him across the peepers with your cheery footnote slash him over the eyes with your dagger  bing avast bing avast replied his companion yon other is rattling reginald lowestoffe of the templei know him he is a good boy and free of the province  so saying and enveloping themselves in another thick cloud of smoke they went on without farther greeting  grasso in aere said the templar you hear what a character the impudent knave gives me but so it serves your lordships turn i care notand now let me ask your lordship what name you will assume for we are near the ducal palace of duke hildebrod  i will be called grahame said nigel it was my mothers name  grime repeated the templar will suit alsatia well enoughboth a grim and grimy place of refuge  i said grahame sir not grime said nigel something shortly and laying an emphasis on the vowelfor few scotsmen understand raillery upon the subject of their names  i beg pardon my lord answered the undisconcerted punster but graam will suit the circumstance tooit signifies tribulation in the high dutch and your lordship must be considered as a man under trouble  nigel laughed at the pertinacity of the templar who proceeding to point out a sign representing or believed to represent a dog attacking a bull and running at his head in the true scientific style of onsetthere said he doth faithful duke hildebrod deal forth laws as well as ale and strong waters to his faithful alsatians being a determined champion of paris garden he has chosen a sign corresponding to his habits and he deals in giving drink to the thirsty that he himself may drink without paying and receive pay for what is drunken by otherslet us enter the everopen gate of this second axylus  as they spoke they entered the dilapidated tavern which was nevertheless more ample in dimensions and less ruinous than many houses in the same evil neighbourhood two or three haggard ragged drawers ran to and fro whose looks like those of owls seemed only adapted for midnight when other creatures sleep and who by day seemed bleared stupid and only half awake guided by one of these blinking ganymedes they entered a room where the feeble rays of the sun were almost wholly eclipsed by volumes of tobaccosmoke rolled from the tubes of the company while out of the cloudy sanctuary arose the old chant of        old sir simon the king        and old sir simon the king        with his malmsey nose        and his aledropped hose        and sing hey dingadingding  duke hildebrod who himself condescended to chant this ditty to his loving subjects was a monstrously fat old man with only one eye and a nose which bore evidence to the frequency strength and depth of his potations he wore a murreycoloured plush jerkin stained with the overflowings of the tankard and much the worse for wear and unbuttoned at bottom for the ease of his enormous paunch behind him lay a favourite bulldog whose round head and single black glancing eye as well as the creatures great corpulence gave it a burlesque resemblance to its master  the wellbeloved counsellors who surrounded the ducal throne incensed it with tobacco pledged its occupier in thick clammy ale and echoed back his choral songs were satraps worthy of such a soldan the buff jerkin broad belt and long sword of one showed him to be a low country soldier whose look of scowling importance and drunken impudence were designed to sustain his title to call himself a roving blade it seemed to nigel that he had seen this fellow somewhere or other a hedgeparson or bucklebeggar as that order of priesthood has been irreverently termed sat on the dukes left and was easily distinguished by his torn band flapped hat and the remnants of a rusty cassock beside the parson sat a most wretched and meagre looking old man with a threadbare hood of coarse kersey upon his head and buttoned about his neck while his pinched features like those of old daniel were illuminated by                             an eye  through the last look of dotage still cunning and sly  on his left was placed a broken attorney who for some malpractices had been struck from the roll of practitioners and who had nothing left of his profession except its roguery one or two persons of less figure amongst whom there was one face which like that of the soldier seemed not unknown to nigel though he could not recollect where he had seen it completed the councilboard of jacob duke hildebrod  the strangers had full time to observe all this for his grace the duke whether irresistibly carried on by the full tide of harmony or whether to impress the strangers with a proper idea of his consequence chose to sing his ditty to an end before addressing them though during the whole time he closely scrutinized them with his single optic  when duke hildebrod had ended his song he informed his peers that a worthy officer of the temple attended them and commanded the captain and parson to abandon their easy chairs in behalf of the two strangers whom he placed on his right and left hand the worthy representative of the army and the church of alsatia went to place themselves on a crazy form at the bottom of the table which ill calculated to sustain men of such weight gave way under them and the man of the sword and man of the gown were rolled over each other on the floor amidst the exulting shouts of the company they arose in wrath contending which should vent his displeasure in the loudest and deepest oaths a strife in which the parsons superior acquaintance with theology enabled him greatly to excel the captain and were at length with difficulty tranquillised by the arrival of the alarmed waiters with more stable chairs and by a long draught of the cooling tankard when this commotion was appeased and the strangers courteously accommodated with flagons after the fashion of the others present the duke drank prosperity to the temple in the most gracious manner together with a cup of welcome to master reginald lowestoffe and this courtesy having been thankfully accepted the party honoured prayed permission to call for a gallon of rhenish over which he proposed to open his business  the mention of a liquor so superior to their usual potations had an instant and most favourable effect upon the little senate and its immediate appearance might be said to secure a favourable reception of master lowestoffes proposition which after a round or two had circulated he explained to be the admission of his friend master nigel grahame to the benefit of the sanctuary and other immunities of alsatia in the character of a grand compounder for so were those termed who paid a double fee at their matriculation in order to avoid laying before the senate the peculiar circumstances which compelled them to take refuge there  the worthy duke heard the proposition with glee which glittered in his single eye and no wonder as it was a rare occurrence and of peculiar advantage to his private revenue accordingly he commanded his ducal register to be brought him a huge book secured with brass clasps like a merchants ledger and whose leaves stained with wine and slabbered with tobacco juice bore the names probably of as many rogues as are to be found in the calendar of newgate  nigel was then directed to lay down two nobles as his ransom and to claim privilege by reciting the following doggerel verses which were dictated to him by the duke          your suppliant by name          nigel grahame          in fear of mishap          from a shouldertap          and dreading a claw          from the talons of law           that are sharper than briers          his freedom to sue          and rescue by you          thorugh weapon and wit          from warrant and writ          from bailiffs hand          from tipstaffs wand           is come hither to whitefriars  as duke hildebrod with a tremulous hand began to make the entry and had already with superfluous generosity spelled nigel with two gs instead of one he was interrupted by the parson footnote this curious register is still in existence being in possession of that eminent antiquary dr dryasdust who liberally offered the author permission to have the autograph of duke hildebrod engraved as an illustration of this passage unhappily being rigorous as ritson himself in adhering to the very letter of his copy the worthy doctor clogged his munificence with the condition that we should adopt the dukes orthography and entitle the work the fortunes of niggle with which stipulation we did not think it necessary to comply this reverend gentleman had been whispering for a minute or two not with the captain but with that other individual who dwelt imperfectly as we have already mentioned in nigels memory and being perhaps still something malecontent on account of the late accident he now requested to be heard before the registration took place  the person he said who hath now had the assurance to propose himself as a candidate for the privileges and immunities of this honourable society is in plain terms a beggarly scot and we have enough of these locusts in london alreadyif we admit such palmer worms and caterpillars to the sanctuary we shall soon have the whole nation  we are not entitled to inquire said duke hildebrod whether he be scot or french or english seeing he has honourably laid down his garnish he is entitled to our protection  word of denial most sovereign duke replied the parson i ask him no questionshis speech betrayeth himhe is a galileanand his garnish is forfeited for his assurance in coming within this our realm and i call on you sir duke to put the laws in force against him  the templar here rose and was about to interrupt the deliberations of the court when the duke gravely assured him that he should be heard in behalf of his friend so soon as the council had finished their deliberations  the attorney next rose and intimating that he was to speak to the point of law saidit was easy to be seen that this gentleman did not come here in any civil case and that he believed it to be the story they had already heard of concerning a blow given within the verge of the parkthat the sanctuary would not bear out the offender in such caseand that the queer old chief would send down a broom which would sweep the streets of alsatia from the strand to the stairs and it was even policy to think what evil might come to their republic by sheltering an alien in such circumstances  the captain who had sat impatiently while these opinions were expressed now sprung on his feet with the vehemence of a cork bouncing from a bottle of brisk beer and turning up his mustaches with a martial air cast a glance of contempt on the lawyer and churchman while he thus expressed his opinion  most noble duke hildebrod when i hear such base skeldering coistril propositions come from the counsellors of your grace and when i remember the huffs the muns and the tityretus by whom your graces ancestors and predecessors were advised on such occasions i begin to think the spirit of action is as dead in alsatia as in my old grannam and yet who thinks so thinks a lie since i will find as many roaring boys in the friars as shall keep the liberties against all the scavengers of westminster and if we should be overborne for a turn death and darkness have we not time to send the gentleman off by water either to paris garden or to the bankside and if he is a gallant of true breed will he not make us full amends for all the trouble we have let other societies exist by the law i say that we brisk boys of the fleet live in spite of it and thrive best when we are in right opposition to sign and seal writ and warrant sergeant and tipstaff catchpoll and bumbailey  this speech was followed by a murmur of approbation and lowestoffe striking in before the favourable sound had subsided reminded the duke and his council how much the security of their state depended upon the amity of the templars who by closing their gates could at pleasure shut against the alsatians the communication betwixt the friars and the temple and that as they conducted themselves on this occasion so would they secure or lose the benefit of his interest with his own body which they knew not to be inconsiderable and in respect of my friend being a scotsman and alien as has been observed by the reverend divine and learned lawyer you are to consider said lowestoffe for what he is pursued hitherwhy for giving the bastinado not to an englishman but to one of his own countrymen and for my own simple part he continued touching lord glenvarloch at the same time to make him understand he spoke but in jest if all the scots in london were to fight a welsh main and kill each other to a man the survivor would in my humble opinion be entitled to our gratitude as having done a most acceptable service to poor old england  a shout of laughter and applause followed this ingenious apology for the clients state of alienage and the templar followed up his plea with the following pithy propositioni know well said he it is the custom of the fathers of this old and honourable republic ripely and well to consider all their proceedings over a proper allowance of liquor and far be it from me to propose the breach of so laudable a custom or to pretend that such an affair as the present can be well and constitutionally considered during the discussion of a pitiful gallon of rhenish but as it is the same thing to this honourable conclave whether they drink first and determine afterwards or whether they determine first and drink afterwards i propose your grace with the advice of your wise and potent senators shall pass your edict granting to mine honourable friend the immunities of the place and assigning him a lodging according to your wise forms to which he will presently retire being somewhat spent with this days action whereupon i will presently order you a rundlet of rhenish with a corresponding quantity of neats tongues and pickled herrings to make you all as glorious as georgeagreen  this overture was received with a general shout of applause which altogether drowned the voice of the dissidents if any there were amongst the alsatian senate who could have resisted a proposal so popular the words of kind heart noble gentleman generous gallant flew from mouth to mouth the inscription of the petitioners name in the great book was hastily completed and the oath administered to him by the worthy doge like the laws of the twelve tables of the ancient cambrobritons and other primitive nations it was couched in poetry and ran as follows   by spigot and barrel   by bilboe and buff   thou art sworn to the quarrel   of the blades of the huff   for whitefriars and its claims   to be champion or martyr   and to fight for its dames   like a knight of the garter  nigel felt and indeed exhibited some disgust at this mummery but the templar reminding him that he was too far advanced to draw back he repeated the words or rather assented as they were repeated by duke hildebrod who concluded the ceremony by allowing him the privilege of sanctuary in the following form of prescriptive doggerel   from the touch of the tip   from the blight of the warrant   from the watchmen who skip   on the harman becks errand   from the bailiffs cramp speech   that makes man a thrall   i charm thee from each   and i charm thee from all   thy freedoms complete   as a blade of the huff   to be cheated and cheat   to be cuffd and to cuff   to stride swear and swagger   to drink till you stagger   to stare and to stab   and to brandish your dagger   in the cause of your drab   to walk woolward in winter   drink brandy and smoke   and go fresco in summer   for want of a cloak   to eke out your living   by the wag of your elbow   by fulham and gourd   and by baring of bilboe   to live by your shifts   and to swear by your honour   are the freedom and gifts   of which i am the donorfootnote of the cant words used in this inauguratory oration some are obvious in their meaning others as harman beck constable and the like derive their source from that ancient piece of lexicography the slang dictionary  this homily being performed a dispute arose concerning the special residence to be assigned the new brother of the sanctuary for as the alsatians held it a maxim in their commonwealth that asss milk fattens there was usually a competition among the inhabitants which should have the managing as it was termed of a new member of the society  the hector who had spoken so warmly and critically in nigels behalf stood out now chivalrously in behalf of a certain blowselinda or bonstrops who had it seems a room to hire once the occasional residence of slicing dick of paddington who lately suffered at tyburn and whose untimely exit had been hitherto mourned by the damsel in solitary widowhood after the fashion of the turtledove  the captains interest was however overruled in behalf of the old gentleman in the kersey hood who was believed even at his extreme age to understand the plucking of a pigeon as well or better than any man in alsatia  this venerable personage was an usurer of notoriety called trapbois and had very lately done the state considerable service in advancing a subsidy necessary to secure a fresh importation of liquors to the dukes cellars the winemerchant at the vintry being scrupulous to deal with so great a man for any thing but ready money  when therefore the old gentleman arose and with much coughing reminded the duke that he had a poor apartment to let the claims of all others were set aside and nigel was assigned to trapbois as his guest  no sooner was this arrangement made than lord glenvarloch expressed to lowestoffe his impatience to leave this discreditable assembly and took his leave with a careless haste which but for the rundlet of rhenish wine that entered just as he left the apartment might have been taken in bad part the young templar accompanied his friend to the house of the old usurer with the road to which he and some other youngsters about the temple were even but too well acquainted on the way he assured lord glenvarloch that he was going to the only clean house in whitefriars a property which it owed solely to the exertions of the old mans only daughter an elderly damsel ugly enough to frighten sin yet likely to be wealthy enough to tempt a puritan so soon as the devil had got her old dad for his due as lowestoffe spoke thus they knocked at the door of the house and the sour stern countenance of the female by whom it was opened fully confirmed all that the templar had said of the hostess she heard with an ungracious and discontented air the young templars information that the gentleman his companion was to be her fathers lodger muttered something about the trouble it was likely to occasion but ended by showing the strangers apartment which was better than could have been augured from the general appearance of the place and much larger in extent than that which he occupied at pauls wharf though inferior to it in neatness  lowestoffe having thus seen his friend fairly installed in his new apartment and having obtained for him a note of the rate at which he could be accommodated with victuals from a neighbouring cooks shop now took his leave offering at the same time to send the whole or any part of lord glenvarlochs baggage from his former place of residence to his new lodging nigel mentioned so few articles that the templar could not help observing that his lordship it would seem did not intend to enjoy his new privileges long  they are too little suited to my habits and taste that i should do so replied lord glenvarloch  you may change your opinion tomorrow said lowestoffe and so i wish you a good even tomorrow i will visit you betimes  the morning came but instead of the templar it brought only a letter from him the epistle stated that lowestoffes visit to alsatia had drawn down the animadversions of some crabbed old pantaloons among the benchers and that he judged it wise not to come hither at present for fear of attracting too much attention to lord glenvarlochs place of residence he stated that he had taken measures for the safety of his baggage and would send him by a safe hand his moneycasket and what articles he wanted then followed some sage advices dictated by lowestoffes acquaintance with alsatia and its manners he advised him to keep the usurer in the most absolute uncertainty concerning the state of his fundsnever to throw a main with the captain who was in the habit of playing dryfisted and paying his losses with three vowels and finally to beware of duke hildebrod who was as sharp he said as a needle though he had no more eyes than are possessed by that necessary implement of female industry     chapter xviii   mother what i dazzled by a flash from cupids mirror with which the boy as mortal urchins wont flings back the sunbeam in the eye of passengers then laughs to see them stumble  daughter mother no it was a lightningflash which dazzled me and never shall these eyes see true again               beef and puddingan old english comedy  it is necessary that we should leave our hero nigel for a time although in a situation neither safe comfortable nor creditable in order to detail some particulars which have immediate connexion with his fortunes  it was but the third day after he had been forced to take refuge in the house of old trapbois the noted usurer of whitefriars commonly called golden trapbois when the pretty daughter of old ramsay the watchmaker after having piously seen her father finish his breakfast from the fear that he might in an abstruse fit of thought swallow the saltcellar instead of a crust of the brown loaf set forth from the house as soon as he was again plunged into the depth of calculation and accompanied only by that faithful old drudge janet the scots laundress to whom her whims were laws made her way to lombard street and disturbed at the unusual hour of eight in the morning aunt judith the sister of her worthy godfather  the venerable maiden received her young visitor with no great complacency for naturally enough she had neither the same admiration of her very pretty countenance nor allowance for her foolish and girlish impatience of temper which master george heriot entertained still mistress margaret was a favourite of her brothers whose will was to aunt judith a supreme law and she contented herself with asking her untimely visitor what she made so early with her pale chitty face in the streets of london  i would speak with the lady hermione answered the almost breathless girl while the blood ran so fast to her face as totally to remove the objection of paleness which aunt judith had made to her complexion  with the lady hermione said aunt judithwith the lady hermione and at this time in the morning when she will scarce see any of the family even at seasonable hours you are crazy you silly wench or you abuse the indulgence which my brother and the lady have shown to you  indeed indeed i have not repeated margaret struggling to retain the unbidden tear which seemed ready to burst out on the slightest occasion do but say to the lady that your brothers goddaughter desires earnestly to speak to her and i know she will not refuse to see me  aunt judith bent an earnest suspicious and inquisitive glance on her young visitor you might make me your secretary my lassie she said as well as the lady hermione i am older and better skilled to advise i live more in the world than one who shuts herself up within four rooms and i have the better means to assist you  o nonono said margaret eagerly and with more earnest sincerity than complaisance there are some things to which you cannot advise me aunt judith it is a casepardon me my dear aunt a case beyond your counsel  i am glad ont maiden said aunt judith somewhat angrily for i think the follies of the young people of this generation would drive mad an old brain like mine here you come on the viretot through the whole streets of london to talk some nonsense to a lady who scarce sees gods sun but when he shines on a brick wall but i will tell her you are here  she went away and shortly returned with a drymiss marget the lady will be glad to see you and thats more my young madam than you had a right to count upon  mistress margaret hung her head in silence too much perplexed by the train of her own embarrassed thoughts for attempting either to conciliate aunt judiths kindness or which on other occasions would have been as congenial to her own humour to retaliate on her cross tempered remarks and manner she followed aunt judith therefore in silence and dejection to the strong oaken door which divided the lady hermiones apartments from the rest of george heriots spacious house  at the door of this sanctuary it is necessary to pause in order to correct the reports with which richie moniplies had filled his masters ear respecting the singular appearance of that ladys attendance at prayers whom we now own to be by name the lady hermione some part of these exaggerations had been communicated to the worthy scotsman by jenkin vincent who was well experienced in the species of wit which has been long a favourite in the city under the names of crossbiting giving the dor bamboozling cramming hoaxing humbugging and quizzing for which sport richie moniplies with his solemn gravity totally unapprehensive of a joke and his natural propensity to the marvellous formed an admirable subject farther ornaments the tale had received from richie himself whose tongue especially when oiled with good liquor had a considerable tendency to amplification and who failed not while he retailed to his master all the wonderful circumstances narrated by vincent to add to them many conjectures of his own which his imagination had overhastily converted into facts  yet the life which the lady hermione had led for two years during which she had been the inmate of george heriots house was so singular as almost to sanction many of the wild reports which went abroad the house which the worthy goldsmith inhabited had in former times belonged to a powerful and wealthy baronial family which during the reign of henry viii terminated in a dowager lady very wealthy very devout and most unalienably attached to the catholic faith the chosen friend of the honourable lady foljambe was the abbess of saint roques nunnery like herself a conscientious rigid and devoted papist when the house of saint roque was despotically dissolved by the fiat of the impetuous monarch the lady foljambe received her friend into her spacious mansion together with two vestal sisters who like their abbess were determined to follow the tenor of their vows instead of embracing the profane liberty which the monarchs will had thrown in their choice for their residence the lady foljambe contrived with all secrecyfor henry might not have relished her interferenceto set apart a suite of four rooms with a little closet fitted up as an oratory or chapel the whole apartments fenced by a stout oaken door to exclude strangers and accommodated with a turning wheel to receive necessaries according to the practice of all nunneries in this retreat the abbess of saint roque and her attendants passed many years communicating only with the lady foljambe who in virtue of their prayers and of the support she afforded them accounted herself little less than a saint on earth the abbess fortunately for herself died before her munificent patroness who lived deep in queen elizabeths time ere she was summoned by fate  the lady foljambe was succeeded in this mansion by a sour fanatic knight a distant and collateral relation who claimed the same merit for expelling the priestess of baal which his predecessor had founded on maintaining the votaresses of heaven of the two unhappy nuns driven from their ancient refuge one went beyond sea the other unable from old age to undertake such a journey died under the roof of a faithful catholic widow of low degree sir paul crambagge having got rid of the nuns spoiled the chapel of its ornaments and had thoughts of altogether destroying the apartments until checked by the reflection that the operation would be an unnecessary expense since he only inhabited three rooms of the large mansion and had not therefore the slightest occasion for any addition to its accommodations his son proved a waster and a prodigal and from him the house was bought by our friend george heriot who finding like sir paul the house more than sufficiently ample for his accommodation left the foljambe apartments or saint roques rooms as they were called in the state in which he found them  about two years and a half before our history opened when heriot was absent upon an expedition to the continent he sent special orders to his sister and his cashkeeper directing that the foljambe apartments should be fitted up handsomely though plainly for the reception of a lady who would make them her residence for some time and who would live more or less with his own family according to her pleasure he also directed that the necessary repairs should be made with secrecy and that as little should be said as possible upon the subject of his letter  when the time of his return came nigh aunt judith and the household were on the tenterhooks of impatience master george came as he had intimated accompanied by a lady so eminently beautiful that had it not been for her extreme and uniform paleness she might have been reckoned one of the loveliest creatures on earth she had with her an attendant or humble companion whose business seemed only to wait upon her this person a reserved woman and by her dialect a foreigner aged about fifty was called by the lady monna paula and by master heriot and others mademoiselle pauline she slept in the same room with her patroness at night ate in her apartment and was scarcely ever separated from her during the day  these females took possession of the nunnery of the devout abbess and without observing the same rigorous seclusion according to the letter seemed wellnigh to restore the apartments to the use to which they had been originally designed the new inmates lived and took their meals apart from the rest of the family with the domestics lady hermione for so she was termed held no communication and mademoiselle pauline only such as was indispensable which she dispatched as briefly as possible frequent and liberal largesses reconciled the servants to this conduct and they were in the habit of observing to each other that to do a service for mademoiselle pauline was like finding a fairy treasure  to aunt judith the lady hermione was kind and civil but their intercourse was rare on which account the elder lady felt some pangs both of curiosity and injured dignity but she knew her brother so well and loved him so dearly that his will once expressed might be truly said to become her own the worthy citizen was not without a spice of the dogmatism which grows on the best disposition when a word is a law to all around master george did not endure to be questioned by his family and when he had generally expressed his will that the lady hermione should live in the way most agreeable to her and that no inquiries should be made concerning their history or her motives for observing such strict seclusion his sister well knew that he would have been seriously displeased with any attempt to pry into the secret  but though heriots servants were bribed and his sister awed into silent acquiescence in these arrangements they were not of a nature to escape the critical observation of the neighbourhood some opined that the wealthy goldsmith was about to turn papist and reestablish lady foljambes nunneryothers that he was going madothers that he was either going to marry or to do worse master georges constant appearance at church and the knowledge that the supposed votaress always attended when the prayers of the english ritual were read in the family liberated him from the first of these suspicions those who had to transact business with him upon change could not doubt the soundness of master heriots mind and to confute the other rumours it was credibly reported by such as made the matter their particular interest that master george heriot never visited his guest but in presence of mademoiselle pauline who sat with her work in a remote part of the same room in which they conversed it was also ascertained that these visits scarcely ever exceeded an hour in length and were usually only repeated once a week an intercourse too brief and too long interrupted to render it probable that love was the bond of their union  the inquirers were therefore at fault and compelled to relinquish the pursuit of master heriots secret while a thousand ridiculous tales were circulated amongst the ignorant and superstitious with some specimens of which our friend richie moniplies had been crammed as we have seen by the malicious apprentice of worthy david ramsay  there was one person in the world who it was thought could if she would have said more of the lady hermione than any one in london except george heriot himself and that was the said david ramsays only child margaret  this girl was not much past the age of fifteen when the lady hermione first came to england and was a very frequent visitor at her godfathers who was much amused by her childish sallies and by the wild and natural beauty with which she sung the airs of her native country spoilt she was on all hands by the indulgence of her godfather the absent habits and indifference of her father and the deference of all around to her caprices as a beauty and as an heiress but though from these circumstances the citybeauty had become as wilful as capricious and as affected as unlimited indulgence seldom fails to render those to whom it is extended and although she exhibited upon many occasions that affectation of extreme shyness silence and reserve which misses in their teens are apt to take for an amiable modesty and upon others a considerable portion of that flippancy which youth sometimes confounds with wit mistress margaret had much real shrewdness and judgment which wanted only opportunities of observation to refine ita lively goodhumoured playful disposition and an excellent heart her acquired follies were much increased by reading plays and romances to which she devoted a great deal of her time and from which she adopted ideas as different as possible from those which she might have obtained from the invaluable and affectionate instructions of an excellent mother and the freaks of which she was sometimes guilty rendered her not unjustly liable to the charge of affectation and coquetry but the little lass had sense and shrewdness enough to keep her failings out of sight of her godfather to whom she was sincerely attached and so high she stood in his favour that at his recommendation she obtained permission to visit the recluse lady hermione  the singular mode of life which that lady observed her great beauty rendered even more interesting by her extreme paleness the conscious pride of being admitted farther than the rest of the world into the society of a person who was wrapped in so much mystery made a deep impression on the mind of margaret ramsay and though their conversations were at no time either long or confidential yet proud of the trust reposed in her margaret was as secret respecting their tenor as if every word repeated had been to cost her life no inquiry however artfully backed by flattery and insinuation whether on the part of dame ursula or any other person equally inquisitive could wring from the little maiden one word of what she heard or saw after she entered these mysterious and secluded apartments the slightest question concerning master heriots ghost was sufficient at her gayest moment to check the current of her communicative prattle and render her silent  we mention this chiefly to illustrate the early strength of margarets charactera strength concealed under a hundred freakish whims and humours as an ancient and massive buttress is disguised by its fantastic covering of ivy and wildflowers in truth if the damsel had told all she heard or saw within the foljambe apartments she would have said but little to gratify the curiosity of inquirers  at the earlier period of their acquaintance the lady hermione was wont to reward the attentions of her little friend with small but elegant presents and entertain her by a display of foreign rarities and curiosities many of them of considerable value sometimes the time was passed in a way much less agreeable to margaret by her receiving lessons from pauline in the use of the needle but although her preceptress practised these arts with a dexterity then only known in foreign convents the pupil proved so incorrigibly idle and awkward that the task of needlework was at length given up and lessons of music substituted in their stead here also pauline was excellently qualified as an instructress and margaret more successful in a science for which nature had gifted her made proficiency both in vocal and instrumental music these lessons passed in presence of the lady hermione to whom they seemed to give pleasure she sometimes added her own voice to the performance in a pure clear stream of liquid melody but this was only when the music was of a devotional cast as margaret became older her communications with the recluse assumed a different character she was allowed if not encouraged to tell whatever she had remarked out of doors and the lady hermione while she remarked the quick sharp and retentive powers of observation possessed by her young friend often found sufficient reason to caution her against rashness in forming opinions and giddy petulance in expressing them  the habitual awe with which she regarded this singular personage induced mistress margaret though by no means delighting in contradiction or reproof to listen with patience to her admonitions and to make full allowance for the good intentions of the patroness by whom they were bestowed although in her heart she could hardly conceive how madame hermione who never stirred from the foljambe apartments should think of teaching knowledge of the world to one who walked twice aweek between temple bar and lombard street besides parading in the park every sunday that proved to be fair weather indeed pretty mistress margaret was so little inclined to endure such remonstrances that her intercourse with the inhabitants of the foljambe apartments would have probably slackened as her circle of acquaintance increased in the external world had she not on the one hand entertained an habitual reverence for her monitress of which she could not divest herself and been flattered on the other by being to a certain degree the depository of a confidence for which others thirsted in vain besides although the conversation of hermione was uniformly serious it was not in general either formal or severe nor was the lady offended by flights of levity which mistress margaret sometimes ventured on in her presence even when they were such as made monna paula cast her eyes upwards and sigh with that compassion which a devotee extends towards the votaries of a trivial and profane world thus upon the whole the little maiden was disposed to submit though not without some wincing to the grave admonitions of the lady hermione and the rather that the mystery annexed to the person of her monitress was in her mind early associated with a vague idea of wealth and importance which had been rather confirmed than lessened by many accidental circumstances which she had noticed since she was more capable of observation  it frequently happens that the counsel which we reckon intrusive when offered to us unasked becomes precious in our eyes when the pressure of difficulties renders us more diffident of our own judgment than we are apt to find ourselves in the hours of ease and indifference and this is more especially the case if we suppose that our adviser may also possess power and inclination to back his counsel with effectual assistance mistress margaret was now in that situation she was or believed herself to be in a condition where both advice and assistance might be necessary and it was therefore after an anxious and sleepless night that she resolved to have recourse to the lady hermione who she knew would readily afford her the one and as she hoped might also possess means of giving her the other the conversation between them will best explain the purport of the visit     chapter xix     by this good light a wench of matchless mettle   this were a leaguerlass to love a soldier   to bind his wounds and kiss his bloody brow   and sing a roundel as she helpd to arm him   though the rough foemans drums were beat so nigh   they seemd to bear the burden                                old play  when mistress margaret entered the foljambe apartment she found the inmates employed in their usual manner the lady in reading and her attendant in embroidering a large piece of tapestry which had occupied her ever since margaret had been first admitted within these secluded chambers  hermione nodded kindly to her visitor but did not speak and margaret accustomed to this reception and in the present case not sorry for it as it gave her an interval to collect her thoughts stooped over monna paulas frame and observed in a half whisper you were just so far as that rose monna when i first saw yousee there is the mark where i had the bad luck to spoil the flower in trying to catch the stitchi was little above fifteen then these flowers make me an old woman monna paula  i wish they could make you a wise one my child answered monna paula in whose esteem pretty mistress margaret did not stand quite so high as in that of her patroness partly owing to her natural austerity which was something intolerant of youth and gaiety and partly to the jealousy with which a favourite domestic regards any one whom she considers as a sort of rival in the affections of her mistress  what is it you say to monna little one asked the lady  nothing madam replied mistress margaret but that i have seen the real flowers blossom three times over since i first saw monna paula working in her canvass garden and her violets have not budded yet  true ladybird replied hermione but the buds that are longest in blossoming will last the longest in flower you have seen them in the garden bloom thrice but you have seen them fade thrice also now monna paulas will remain in blow for everthey will fear neither frost nor tempest  true madam answered mistress margaret but neither have they life or odour  that little one replied the recluse is to compare a life agitated by hope and fear and chequered with success and disappointment and fevered by the effects of love and hatred a life of passion and of feeling saddened and shortened by its exhausting alternations to a calm and tranquil existence animated but by a sense of duties and only employed during its smooth and quiet course in the unwearied discharge of them is that the moral of your answer  i do not know madam answered mistress margaret but of all birds in the air i would rather be the lark that sings while he is drifting down the summer breeze than the weathercock that sticks fast yonder upon his iron perch and just moves so much as to discharge his duty and tell us which way the wind blows  metaphors are no arguments my pretty maiden said the lady hermione smiling  i am sorry for that madam answered margaret for they are such a pretty indirect way of telling ones mind when it differs from ones bettersbesides on this subject there is no end of them and they are so civil and becoming withal  indeed replied the lady let me hear some of them i pray you  it would be for example very bold in me said margaret to say to your ladyship that rather than live a quiet life i would like a little variety of hope and fear and liking and dislikingandand and the other sort of feelings which your ladyship is pleased to speak of but i may say freely and without blame that i like a butterfly better than a bettle or a trembling aspen better than a grim scots fir that never wags a leafor that of all the wood brass and wire that ever my fathers fingers put together i do hate and detest a certain huge old clock of the german fashion that rings hours and half hours and quarters and half quarters as if it were of such consequence that the world should know it was wound up and going now dearest lady i wish you would only compare that clumsy clanging dutchlooking piece of lumber with the beautiful timepiece that master heriot caused my father to make for your ladyship which uses to play a hundred merry tunes and turns out when it strikes the hour a whole band of morrice dancers to trip the hays to the measure  and which of these timepieces goes the truest margaret said the lady  i must confess the old dutchman has the advantage in thatsaid margaret i fancy you are right madam and that comparisons are no arguments at least mine has not brought me through  upon my word maiden margaret said the lady smiling you have been of late thinking very much of these matters  perhaps too much madam said margaret so low as only to be heard by the lady behind the back of whose chair she had now placed herself the words were spoken very gravely and accompanied by a half sigh which did not escape the attention of her to whom they were addressed the lady hermione turned immediately round and looked earnestly at margaret then paused for a moment and finally commanded monna paula to carry her frame and embroidery into the antechamber when they were left alone she desired her young friend to come from behind the chair on the back of which she still rested and sit down beside her upon a stool  i will remain thus madam under your favour answered margaret without changing her posture i would rather you heard me without seeing me  in gods name maiden returned her patroness what is it you can have to say that may not be uttered face to face to so true a friend as i am  without making any direct answer margaret only replied you were right dearest lady when you said i had suffered my feelings too much to engross me of late i have done very wrong and you will be angry with meso will my godfather but i cannot help ithe must be rescued  he repeated the lady with emphasis that brief little word does indeed so far explain your mysterybut come from behind the chair you silly popinjay i will wager you have suffered yonder gay young apprentice to sit too near your heart i have not heard you mention young vincent for many a dayperhaps he has not been out of mouth and out of mind both have you been so foolish as to let him speak to you seriouslyi am told he is a bold youth  not bold enough to say any thing that could displease me madam said margaret  perhaps then you were not displeased said the lady or perhaps he has not spoken which would be wiser and better be openhearted my loveyour godfather will soon return and we will take him into our consultations if the young man is industrious and come of honest parentage his poverty may be no such insurmountable obstacle but you are both of you very young margareti know your godfather will expect that the youth shall first serve out his apprenticeship  margaret had hitherto suffered the lady to proceed under the mistaken impression which she had adopted simply because she could not tell how to interrupt her but pure despite at hearing her last words gave her boldness at length to say i crave your pardon madam but neither the youth you mention nor any apprentice or master within the city of london  margaret said the lady in reply the contemptuous tone with which you mention those of your own class many hundreds if not thousands of whom are in all respects better than yourself and would greatly honour you by thinking of you is methinks no warrant for the wisdom of your choicefor a choice it seems there is who is it maiden to whom you have thus rashly attached yourselfrashly i fear it must be  it is the young scottish lord glenvarloch madam answered margaret in a low and modest tone but sufficiently firm considering the subject  the young lord of glenvarloch repeated the lady in great surprise maiden you are distracted in your wits  i knew you would say so madam answered margaret it is what another person has already told meit is perhaps what all the world would tell meit is what i am sometimes disposed to tell myself but look at me madam for i will now come before you and tell me if there is madness or distraction in my look and word when i repeat to you again that i have fixed my affections on this young nobleman  if there is not madness in your look or word maiden there is infinite folly in what you say answered the lady hermione sharply when did you ever hear that misplaced love brought any thing but wretchedness seek a match among your equals margaret and escape the countless kinds of risk and misery that must attend an affection beyond your degreewhy do you smile maiden is there aught to cause scorn in what i say  surely no madam answered margaret i only smiled to think how it should happen that while rank made such a wide difference between creatures formed from the same clay the wit of the vulgar should nevertheless jump so exactly the same length with that of the accomplished and the exalted it is but the variation of the phrase which divides them dame ursley told me the very same thing which your ladyship has but now uttered only you madam talk of countless misery and dame ursley spoke of the gallows and mistress turner who was hanged upon it  indeed answered the lady hermione and who may dame ursley be that your wise choice has associated with me in the difficult task of advising a fool  the barbers wife at next door madam answered margaret with feigned simplicity but far from being sorry at heart that she had found an indirect mode of mortifying her monitress she is the wisest woman that i know next to your ladyship  a proper confidant said the lady and chosen with the same delicate sense of what is due to yourself and othersbut what ails you maidenwhere are you going  only to ask dame ursleys advice said margaret as if about to depart for i see your ladyship is too angry to give me any and the emergency is pressing  what emergency thou simple one said the lady in a kinder tone sit down maiden and tell me your tale it is true you are a fool and a pettish fool to boot but then you are a childan amiable child with all your selfwilled folly and we must help you if we cansit down i say as you are desired and you will find me a safer and wiser counseller than the barberwoman and tell me how you come to suppose that you have fixed your heart unalterably upon a man whom you have seen as i think but once  i have seen him oftener said the damsel looking down but i have only spoken to him once i should have been able to get that once out of my head though the impression was so deep that i could even now repeat every trifling word he said but other things have since riveted it in my bosom for ever  maiden replied the lady for ever is the word which comes most lightly on the lips in such circumstances but  which not the less is almost the last that we should use the fashion of this world its passions its joys and its sorrows pass away like the winged breezethere is nought for ever but that which belongs to the world beyond the grave  you have corrected me justly madam said margaret calmly i ought only to have spoken of my present state of mind as what will last me for my lifetime which unquestionably may be but short  and what is there in this scottish lord that can rivet what concerns him so closely in your fancy said the lady i admit him a personable man for i have seen him and i will suppose him courteous and agreeable but what are his accomplishments besides for these surely are not uncommon attributes  he is unfortunate madammost unfortunateand surrounded by snares of different kinds ingeniously contrived to ruin his character destroy his estate and perhaps to reach even his life these schemes have been devised by avarice originally but they are now followed close by vindictive ambition animated i think by the absolute and concentrated spirit of malice for the lord dalgarno  here monna paulamonna paula exclaimed the lady hermione interrupting her young friends narrative she hears me not she answered rising and going out i must seek heri will return instantly she returned accordingly very soon after you mentioned a name which i thought was familiar to me she said but monna paula has put me right i know nothing of your lordhow was it you named him  lord dalgarno said margaretthe wickedest man who lives under pretence of friendship he introduced the lord glenvarloch to a gamblinghouse with the purpose of engaging him in deep play but he with whom the perfidious traitor had to deal was too virtuous moderate and cautious to be caught in a snare so open what did they next but turn his own moderation against him and persuade others thatbecause he would not become the prey of wolves he herded with them for a share of their booty and while this base lord dalgarno was thus undermining his unsuspecting countryman he took every measure to keep him surrounded by creatures of his own to prevent him from attending court and mixing with those of his proper rank since the gunpowder treason there never was a conspiracy more deeply laid more basely and more deliberately pursued  the lady smiled sadly at margarets vehemence but sighed the next moment while she told her young friend how little she knew the world she was about to live in since she testified so much surprise at finding it full of villainy  but by what means she added could you maiden become possessed of the secret views of a man so cautious as lord dalgarnoas villains in general are  permit me to be silent on that subject said the maiden i could not tell you without betraying otherslet it suffice that my tidings are as certain as the means by which i acquired them are secret and sure but i must not tell them even to you  you are too bold margaret said the lady to traffic in such matters at your early age it is not only dangerous but even unbecoming and unmaidenly  i knew you would say that also said margaret with more meekness and patience than she usually showed on receiving reproof but god knows my heart acquits me of every other feeling save that of the wish to assist this most innocent and betrayed mani contrived to send him warning of his friends falsehoodalas my care has only hastened his utter ruin unless speedy aid be found he charged his false friend with treachery and drew on him in the park and is now liable to the fatal penalty due for breach of privilege of the kings palace  this is indeed an extraordinary tale said hermione is lord glenvarloch then in prison  no madam thank god but in the sanctuary at whitefriarsit is matter of doubt whether it will protect him in such a casethey speak of a warrant from the lord chief justicea gentleman of the temple has been arrested and is in trouble for having assisted him in his flighteven his taking temporary refuge in that base place though from extreme necessity will be used to the further defaming him all this i know and yet i cannot rescue himcannot rescue him save by your means  by my means maiden said the ladyyou are beside yourselfwhat means can i possess in this secluded situation of assisting this unfortunate nobleman  you have means said margaret eagerly you have those means unless i mistake greatly which can do anythingcan do everything in this city in this worldyou have wealth and the command of a small portion of it will enable me to extricate him from his present danger he will be enabled and directed how to make his escapeand i she paused  will accompany him doubtless and reap the fruits of your sage exertions in his behalf said the lady hermione ironically  may heaven forgive you the unjust thought lady answered margaret i will never see him morebut i shall have saved him and the thought will make me happy  a cold conclusion to so bold and warm a flame said the lady with a smile which seemed to intimate incredulity  it is however the only one which i expect madami could almost say the only one which i wishi am sure i will use no efforts to bring about any other if i am bold in his cause i am timorous enough in my own during our only interview i was unable to speak a word to him he knows not the sound of my voiceand all that i have risked and must yet risk i am doing for one who were he asked the question would say he has long since forgotten that he ever saw spoke to or sat beside a creature of so little signification as i am  this is a strange and unreasonable indulgence of a passion equally fanciful and dangerous said lady hermione you will not assist me then said margaret have goodday then madammy secret i trust is safe in such honourable keeping  tarry yet a little said the lady and tell me what resource you have to assist this youth if you were supplied with money to put it in motion  it is superfluous to ask me the question madam answered margaret unless you purpose to assist me and if you do so purpose it is still superfluous you could not understand the means i must use and time is too brief to explain  but have you in reality such means said the lady  i have with the command of a moderate sum answered margaret ramsay the power of baffling all his enemiesof eluding the passion of the irritated kingthe colder but more determined displeasure of the princethe vindictive spirit of buckingham so hastily directed against whomsoever crosses the path of his ambitionthe cold concentrated malice of lord dalgarnoall i can baffle them all  but is this to be done without your own personal risk margaret replied the lady for be your purpose what it will you are not to peril your own reputation or person in the romantic attempt of serving another and i maiden am answerable to your godfatherto your benefactor and my ownnot to aid you in any dangerous or unworthy enterprise  depend upon my wordmy oathdearest lady replied the supplicant that i will act by the agency of others and do not myself design to mingle in any enterprise in which my appearance might be either perilous or unwomanly  i know not what to do said the lady hermione it is perhaps incautious and inconsiderate in me to aid so wild a project yet the end seems honourable if the means be surewhat is the penalty if he fall into their power  alas alas the loss of his right hand replied margaret her voice almost stifled with sobs  are the laws of england so cruel then there is mercy in heaven alone said the lady since even in this free land men are wolves to each othercompose yourself margaret and tell me what money is necessary to secure lord glenvarlochs escape  two hundred pieces replied margaret i would speak to you of restoring themand i must one day have the poweronly that i know that is i thinkyour ladyship is indifferent on that score  not a word more of it said the lady call monna paula hither     chapter xx     credit me friend it hath been ever thus   since the ark rested on mount ararat   false man hath sworn and woman hath believed   repented and reproachd and then believed once more                                   the new world  by the time that margaret returned with monna paula the lady hermione was rising from the table at which she had been engaged in writing something on a small slip of paper which she gave to her attendant  monna paula she said carry this paper to roberts the cashkeeper let them give you the money mentioned in the note and bring it hither presently  monna paula left the room and her mistress proceeded  i do not know she said margaret if i have done and am doing well in this affair my life has been one of strange seclusion and i am totally unacquainted with the practical ways of this worldan ignorance which i know cannot be remedied by mere readingi fear i am doing wrong to you and perhaps to the laws of the country which affords me refuge by thus indulging you and yet there is something in my heart which cannot resist your entreaties  o listen to itlisten to it dear generous lady said margaret throwing herself on her knees and grasping those of her benefactress and looking in that attitude like a beautiful mortal in the act of supplicating her tutelary angel the laws of men are but the injunctions of mortality but what the heart prompts is the echo of the voice from heaven within us  rise rise maiden said hermione you affect me more than i thought i could have been moved by aught that should approach me rise and tell me whence it comes that in so short a time your thoughts your looks your speech and even your slightest actions are changed from those of a capricious and fanciful girl to all this energy and impassioned eloquence of word and action  i am sure i know not dearest lady said margaret looking down but i suppose that when i was a trifler i was only thinking of trifles what i now reflect is deep and serious and i am thankful if my speech and manner bear reasonable proportion to my thoughts  it must be so said the lady yet the change seems a rapid and strange one it seems to be as if a childish girl had at once shot up into deepthinking and impassioned woman ready to make exertions alike and sacrifices with all that vain devotion to a favourite object of affection which is often so basely rewarded  the lady hermione sighed bitterly and monna paula entered ere the conversation proceeded farther she spoke to her mistress in the foreign language in which they frequently conversed but which was unknown to margaret  we must have patience for a time said the lady to her visitor the cashkeeper is abroad on some business but he is expected home in the course of half an hour  margaret wrung her hands in vexation and impatience  minutes are precious continued the lady that i am well aware of and we will at least suffer none of them to escape us monna paula shall remain below and transact our business the very instant that roberts returns home  she spoke to her attendant accordingly who again left the room  you are very kind madamvery good said the poor little margaret while the anxious trembling of her lip and of her hand showed all that sickening agitation of the heart which arises from hope deferred  be patient margaret and collect yourself said the lady you may you must have much to do to carry through this your bold purpose reserve your spirits which you may need so muchbe patientit is the only remedy against the evils of life  yes madam said margaret wiping her eyes and endeavouring in vain to suppress the natural impatience of her temperi have heard so very often indeed and i dare say i have myself heaven forgive me said so to people in perplexity and affliction but it was before i had suffered perplexity and vexation myself and i am sure i will never preach patience to any human being again now that i know how much the medicine goes against the stomach  you will think better of it maiden said the lady hermione i also when i first felt distress thought they did me wrong who spoke to me of patience but my sorrows have been repeated and continued till i have been taught to cling to it as the best andreligious duties excepted of which indeed patience forms a partthe only alleviation which life can afford them  margaret who neither wanted sense nor feeling wiped her tears hastily and asked her patronesss forgiveness for her petulance  i might have thoughtshe said i ought to have reflected that even from the manner of your life madam it is plain you must have suffered sorrow and yet god knows the patience which i have ever seen you display well entitles you to recommend your own example to others  the lady was silent for a moment and then replied  margaret i am about to repose a high confidence in you you are no longer a child but a thinking and a feeling woman you have told me as much of your secret as you daredi will let you know as much of mine as i may venture to tell you will ask me perhaps why at a moment when your own mind is agitated i should force upon you the consideration of my sorrows and i answer that i cannot withstand the impulse which now induces me to do so perhaps from having witnessed for the first time these three years the natural effects of human passion my own sorrows have been awakened and are for the moment too big for my own bosomperhaps i may hope that you who seem driving full sail on the very rock on which i was wrecked for ever will take warning by the tale i have to tell enough if you are willing to listen i am willing to tell you who the melancholy inhabitant of the foljambe apartments really is and why she resides here it will serve at least to while away the time until monna paula shall bring us the reply from roberts  at any other moment of her life margaret ramsay would have heard with undivided interest a communication so flattering in itself and referring to a subject upon which the general curiosity had been so strongly excited and even at this agitating moment although she ceased not to listen with an anxious ear and throbbing heart for the sound of monna paulas returning footsteps she nevertheless as gratitude and policy as well as a portion of curiosity dictated composed herself in appearance at least to the strictest attention to the lady hermione and thanked her with humility for the high confidence she was pleased to repose in her the lady hermione with the same calmness which always attended her speech and actions thus recounted her story to her young friend  my father she said was a merchant but he was of a city whose merchants are princes i am the daughter of a noble house in genoa whose name stood as high in honour and in antiquity as any inscribed in the golden register of that famous aristocracy  my mother was a noble scottish woman she was descendeddo not startand not remotely descended of the house of glenvarlochno wonder that i was easily led to take concern in the misfortunes of this young lord he is my near relation and my mother who was more than sufficiently proud of her descent early taught me to take an interest in the name my maternal grandfather a cadet of that house of glenvarloch had followed the fortunes of an unhappy fugitive francis earl of bothwell who after showing his miseries in many a foreign court at length settled in spain upon a miserable pension which he earned by conforming to the catholic faith ralph olifaunt my grandfather separated from him in disgust and settled at barcelona where by the friendship of the governor his heresy as it was termed was connived at my father in the course of his commerce resided more at barcelona than in his native country though at times he visited genoa  it was at barcelona that he became acquainted with my mother loved her and married her they differed in faith but they agreed in affection i was their only child in public i conformed to the docterins and ceremonial of the church of rome but my mother by whom these were regarded with horror privately trained me up in those of the reformed religion and my father either indifferent in the matter or unwilling to distress the woman whom he loved overlooked or connived at my secretly joining in her devotions  but when unhappily my father was attacked while yet in the prime of life by a slow wasting disease which he felt to be incurable he foresaw the hazard to which his widow and orphan might be exposed after he was no more in a country so bigoted to catholicism as spain he made it his business during the two last years of his life to realize and remit to england a large part of his fortune which by the faith and honour of his correspondent the excellent man under whose roof i now reside was employed to great advantage had my father lived to complete his purpose by withdrawing his whole fortune from commerce he himself would have accompanied us to england and would have beheld us settled in peace and honour before his death but heaven had ordained it otherwise he died leaving several sums engaged in the hands of his spanish debtors and in particular he had made a large and extensive consignment to a certain wealthy society of merchants at madrid who showed no willingness after his death to account for the proceeds would to god we had left these covetous and wicked men in possession of their booty for such they seemed to hold the property of their deceased correspondent and friend we had enough for comfort and even splendour already secured in england but friends exclaimed upon the folly of permitting these unprincipled men to plunder us of our rightful property the sum itself was large and the claim having been made my mother thought that my fathers memory was interested in its being enforced especially as the defences set up for the mercantile society went in some degree to impeach the fairness of his transactions  we went therefore to madrid i was then my margaret about your age young and thoughtless as you have hitherto beenwe went i say to madrid to solicit the protection of the court and of the king without which we were told it would be in vain to expect justice against an opulent and powerful association  our residence at the spanish metropolis drew on from weeks to months for my part my natural sorrow for a kind though not a fond father having abated i cared not if the lawsuit had detained us at madrid for ever my mother permitted herself and me rather more liberty than we had been accustomed to she found relations among the scottish and irish officers many of whom held a high rank in the spanish armies their wives and daughters became our friends and companions and i had perpetual occasion to exercise my mothers native language which i had learned from my infancy by degrees as my mothers spirits were low and her health indifferent she was induced by her partial fondness for me to suffer me to mingle occasionally in society which she herself did not frequent under the guardianship of such ladies as she imagined she could trust and particularly under the care of the lady of a general officer whose weakness or falsehood was the original cause of my misfortunes i was as gay margaret and thoughtlessi again repeat itas you were but lately and my attention like yours became suddenly riveted to one object and to one set of feelings  the person by whom they were excited was young noble handsome accomplished a soldier and a briton so far our cases are nearly parallel but may heaven forbid that the parallel should become complete this man so noble so fairly formed so gifted and so bravethis villain for that margaret was his fittest name spoke of love to me and i listenedcould i suspect his sincerity if he was wealthy noble and longdescended i also was a noble and an opulent heiress it is true that he neither knew the extent of my fathers wealth nor did i communicate to him i do not even remember if i myself knew it at the time the important circumstance that the greater part of that wealth was beyond the grasp of arbitrary power and not subject to the precarious award of arbitrary judges my lover might think perhaps as my mother was desirous the world at large should believe that almost our whole fortune depended on the precarious suit which we had come to madrid to prosecutea belief which she had countenanced out of policy being well aware that a knowledge of my fathers having remitted such a large part of his fortune to england would in no shape aid the recovery of further sums in the spanish courts yet with no more extensive views of my fortune than were possessed by the public i believe that he of whom i am speaking was at first sincere in his pretensions he had himself interest sufficient to have obtained a decision in our favour in the courts and my fortune reckoning only what was in spain would then have been no inconsiderable sum to be brief whatever might be his motives or temptation for so far committing himself he applied to my mother for my hand with my consent and approval my mothers judgment had become weaker but her passions had become more irritable during her increasing illness  you have heard of the bitterness of the ancient scottish feuds of which it may be said in the language of scripture that the fathers eat sour grapes and the teeth of the children are set on edge unhappilyi should say happily considering what this man has now shown himself to besome such strain of bitterness had divided his house from my mothers and she had succeeded to the inheritance of hatred when he asked her for my hand she was no longer able to command her passionsshe raked up every injury which the rival families had inflicted upon each other during a bloody feud of two centuriesheaped him with epithets of scorn and rejected his proposal of alliance as if it had come from the basest of mankind  my lover retired in passion and i remained to weep and murmur against fortune andi will confess my faultagainst my affectionate parent i had been educated with different feelings and the traditions of the feuds and quarrels of my mothers family in scotland which were to her monuments and chronicles seemed to me as insignificant and unmeaning as the actions and fantasies of don quixote and i blamed my mother bitterly for sacrificing my happiness to an empty dream of family dignity  while i was in this humour my lover sought a renewal of our intercourse we met repeatedly in the house of the lady whom i have mentioned and who in levity or in the spirit of intrigue countenanced our secret correspondence at length we were secretly marriedso far did my blinded passion hurry me my lover had secured the assistance of a clergyman of the english church monna paula who had been my attendant from infancy was one witness of our union let me do the faithful creature justiceshe conjured me to suspend my purpose till my mothers death should permit us to celebrate our marriage openly but the entreaties of my lover and my own wayward passion prevailed over her remonstrances the lady i have spoken of was another witness but whether she was in full possession of my bridegrooms secret i had never the means to learn but the shelter of her name and roof afforded us the means of frequently meeting and the love of my husband seemed as sincere and as unbounded as my own  he was eager he said to gratify his pride by introducing me to one or two of his noble english friends this could not be done at lady d s but by his command which i was now entitled to consider as my law i contrived twice to visit him at his own hotel accompanied only by monna paula there was a very small party of two ladies and two gentlemen there was music mirth and dancing i had heard of the frankness of the english nation but i could not help thinking it bordered on license during these entertainments and in the course of the collation which followed but i imputed my scruples to my inexperience and would not doubt the propriety of what was approved by my husband  i was soon summoned to other scenes my poor mothers disease drew to a conclusionhappy i am that it took place before she discovered what would have cut her to the soul  in spain you may have heard how the catholic priests and particularly the monks besiege the beds of the dying to obtain bequests for the good of the church i have said that my mothers temper was irritated by disease and her judgment impaired in proportion she gathered spirits and force from the resentment which the priests around her bed excited by their importunity and the boldness of the stern sect of reformers to which she had secretly adhered seemed to animate her dying tongue she avowed the religion she had so long concealed renounced all hope and aid which did not come by and through its dictates rejected with contempt the ceremonial of the romish church loaded the astonished priests with reproaches for their greediness and hypocrisy and commanded them to leave her house they went in bitterness and rage but it was to return with the inquisitorial power its warrants and its officers and they found only the cold corpse left of her on whom they had hoped to work their vengeance as i was soon discovered to have shared my mothers heresy i was dragged from her dead body imprisoned in a solitary cloister and treated with severity which the abbess assured me was due to the looseness of my life as well as my spiritual errors i avowed my marriage to justify the situation in which i found myselfi implored the assistance of the superior to communicate my situation to my husband she smiled coldly at the proposal and told me the church had provided a better spouse for me advised me to secure myself of divine grace hereafter and deserve milder treatment here by presently taking the veil in order to convince me that i had no other resource she showed me a royal decree by which all my estate was hypothecated to the convent of saint magdalen and became their complete property upon my death or my taking the vows as i was both from religious principle and affectionate attachment to my husband absolutely immovable in my rejection of the veil i believe may heaven forgive me if i wrong herthat the abbess was desirous to make sure of my spoils by hastening the former event  it was a small and a poor convent and situated among the mountains of guadarrama some of the sisters were the daughters of neighbouring hidalgoes as poor as they were proud and ignorant others were women immured there on account of their vicious conduct the superior herself was of a high family to which she owed her situation but she was said to have disgraced her connexions by her conduct during youth and now in advanced age covetousness and the love of power a spirit too of severity and cruelty had succeeded to the thirst after licentious pleasure i suffered much under this womanand still her dark glassy eye her tall shrouded form and her rigid features haunt my slumbers  i was not destined to be a mother i was very ill and my recovery was long doubtful the most violent remedies were applied if remedies they indeed were my health was restored at length against my own expectation and that of all around me but when i first again beheld the reflection of my own face i thought it was the visage of a ghost i was wont to be flattered by all but particularly by my husband for the fineness of my complexionit was now totally gone and what is more extraordinary it has never returned i have observed that the few who now see me look upon me as a bloodless phantomsuch has been the abiding effect of the treatment to which i was subjected may god forgive those who were the agents of iti thank heaven i can say so with as sincere a wish as that with which i pray for forgiveness of my own sins they now relented somewhat towards memoved perhaps to compassion by my singular appearance which bore witness to my sufferings or afraid that the matter might attract attention during a visitation of the bishop which was approaching one day as i was walking in the conventgarden to which i had been lately admitted a miserable old moorish slave who was kept to cultivate the little spot muttered as i passed him but still keeping his wrinkled face and decrepit form in the same angle with the earththere is hearts ease near the postern  i knew something of the symbolical language of flowers once carried to such perfection among the moriscoes of spain but if i had been ignorant of it the captive would soon have caught at any hint which seemed to promise liberty with all the haste consistent with the utmost circumspectionfor i might be observed by the abbess or some of the sisters from the windowi hastened to the postern it was closely barred as usual but when i coughed slightly i was answered from the other sideand o heaven it was my husbands voice which said lose not a minute here at present but be on this spot when the vesper bell has tolled  i retired in an ecstasy of joy i was not entitled or permitted to assist at vespers but was accustomed to be confined to my cell while the nuns were in the choir since my recovery they had discontinued locking the door though the utmost severity was denounced against me if i left these precincts but let the penalty be what it would i hastened to dare itno sooner had the last toll of the vesper bell ceased to sound than i stole from my chamber reached the garden unobserved hurried to the postern beheld it open with rapture and in the next moment was in my husbands arms he had with him another cavalier of noble mienboth were masked and armed their horses with one saddled for my use stood in a thicket hard by with two other masked horsemen who seemed to be servants in less than two minutes we were mounted and rode off as fast as we could through rough and devious roads in which one of the domestics appeared to act as guide  the hurried pace at which we rode and the anxiety of the moment kept me silent and prevented my expressing my surprise or my joy save in a few broken words it also served as an apology for my husbands silence at length we stopped at a solitary hutthe cavaliers dismounted and i was assisted from my saddle not by mmmy husband i would say who seemed busied about his horse but by the stranger  go into the hut said my husband change your dress with the speed of lightningyou will find one to assist youwe must forward instantly when you have shifted your apparel  i entered the hut and was received in the arms of the faithful monna paula who had waited my arrival for many hours half distracted with fear and anxiety with her assistance i speedily tore off the detested garments of the convent and exchanged them for a travelling suit made after the english fashion i observed that monna paula was in a similar dress i had but just huddled on my change of attire when we were hastily summoned to mount a horse i found was provided for monna paula and we resumed our route on the way my conventgarb which had been wrapped hastily together around a stone was thrown into a lake along the verge of which we were then passing the two cavaliers rode together in front my attendant and i followed and the servants brought up the rear monna paula as we rode on repeatedly entreated me to be silent upon the road as our lives depended on it i was easily reconciled to be passive for the first fever of spirits which attended the sense of liberation and of gratified affection having passed away i felt as it were dizzy with the rapid motion and my utmost exertion was necessary to keep my place on the saddle until we suddenly it was now very dark saw a strong light before us  my husband reined up his horse and gave a signal by a low whistle twice repeated which was answered from a distance the whole party then halted under the boughs of a large corktree and my husband drawing himself close to my side said in a voice which i then thought was only embarrassed by fear for my safetywe must now part those to whom i commit you are contrabandists who only know you as englishwomen but who for a high bribe have undertaken to escort you through the passes of the pyrenees as far as saint jean de luz  and do you not go with us i exclaimed with emphasis though in a whisper  it is impossible he said and would ruin allsee that you speak in english in these peoples hearing and give not the least sign of understanding what they say in spanishyour life depends on it for though they live in opposition to and evasion of the laws of spain they would tremble at the idea of violating those of the churchi see them comingfarewellfarewell  the last words were hastily utteredi endeavoured to detain him yet a moment by my feeble grasp on his cloak  you will meet me then i trust at saint jean de luz  yes yes he answered hastily at saint jean de luz you will meet your protector  he then extricated his cloak from my grasp and was lost in the darkness his companion approachedkissed my hand which in the agony of the moment i was scarce sensible of and followed my husband attended by one of the domestics  the tears of hermione here flowed so fast as to threaten the interruption of her narrative when she resumed it it was with a kind of apology to margaret  every circumstance she said occurring in those moments when i still enjoyed a delusive idea of happiness is deeply imprinted in my remembrance which respecting all that has since happened is waste and unvaried as an arabian desert but i have no right to inflict on you margaret agitated as you are with your own anxieties the unavailing details of my useless recollections  margarets eyes were full of tearsit was impossible it could be otherwise considering that the tale was told by her suffering benefactress and resembled in some respects her own situation and yet she must not be severely blamed if while eagerly pressing her patroness to continue her narrative her eye involuntarily sought the door as if to chide the delay of monna paula  the lady hermione saw and forgave these conflicting emotions and she too must be pardoned if in her turn the minute detail of her narrative showed that in the discharge of feelings so long locked in her own bosom she rather forgot those which were personal to her auditor and by which it must be supposed margarets mind was principally occupied if not entirely engrossed  i told you i think that one domestic followed the gentlemen thus the lady continued her story the other remained with us for the purpose as it seemed of introducing us to two persons whom m i say whom my husbands signal had brought to the spot a word or two of explanation passed between them and the servant in a sort of patois which i did not understand and one of the strangers taking hold of my bridle the other of monna paulas they led us towards the light which i have already said was the signal of our halting i touched monna paula and was sensible that she trembled very much which surprised me because i knew her character to be so strong and bold as to border upon the masculine  when we reached the fire the gipsy figures of those who surrounded it with their swarthy features large sombrero hats girdles stuck full of pistols and poniards and all the other apparatus of a roving and perilous life would have terrified me at another moment but then i only felt the agony of having parted from my husband almost in the very moment of my rescue the females of the gangfor there were four or five women amongst these contraband tradersreceived us with a sort of rude courtesy they were in dress and manners not extremely different from the men with whom they associatedwere almost as hardy and adventurous carried arms like them and were as we learned from passing circumstances scarce less experienced in the use of them  it was impossible not to fear these wild people yet they gave us no reason to complain of them but used us on all occasions with a kind of clumsy courtesy accommodating themselves to our wants and our weakness during the journey even while we heard them grumbling to each other against our effeminacylike some rude carrier who in charge of a package of valuable and fragile ware takes every precaution for its preservation while he curses the unwonted trouble which it occasions him once or twice when they were disappointed in their contraband traffic lost some goods in a rencontre with the spanish officers of the revenue and were finally pursued by a military force their murmurs assumed a more alarming tone in the terrified ears of my attendant and myself when without daring to seem to understand them we heard them curse the insular heretics on whose account god saint james and our lady of the pillar had blighted their hopes of profit these are dreadful recollections margaret  why then dearest lady answered margaret will you thus dwell on them  it is only said the lady hermione because i linger like a criminal on the scaffold and would fain protract the time that must inevitably bring on the final catastrophe yes dearest margaret i rest and dwell on the events of that journey marked as it was by fatigue and danger though the road lay through the wildest and most desolate deserts and mountains and though our companions both men and women were fierce and lawless themselves and exposed to the most merciless retaliation from those with whom they were constantly engagedyet would i rather dwell on these hazardous events than tell that which awaited me at saint jean de luz  but you arrived there in safety said margaret  yes maiden replied the lady hermione and were guided by the chief of our outlawed band to the house which had been assigned for reception with the same punctilious accuracy with which he would have delivered a bale of uncustomed goods to a correspondent i was told a gentleman had expected me for two daysi rushed into the apartment and when i expected to embrace my husbandi found myself in the arms of his friend  the villain exclaimed margaret whose anxiety had in spite of herself been a moment suspended by the narrative of the lady  yes replied hermione calmly though her voice somewhat faltered it is the name that bestthat well befits him he margaret for whom i had sacrificed allwhose love and whose memory were dearer to me than my freedom when i was in the conventthan my life when i was on my perilous journeyhad taken his measures to shake me off and transfer me as a privileged wanton to the protection of his libertine friend at first the stranger laughed at my tears and my agony as the hysterical passion of a deluded and overreached wanton or the wily affection of a courtezan my claim of marriage he laughed at assuring me he knew it was a mere farce required by me and submitted to by his friend to save some reserve of delicacy and expressed his surprise that i should consider in any other light a ceremony which could be valid neither in spain nor england and insultingly offered to remove my scruples by renewing such a union with me himself my exclamations brought monna paula to my aidshe was not indeed far distant for she had expected some such scene  good heaven said margaret was she a confidant of your base husband  no answered hermione do her not that injustice it was her persevering inquiries that discovered the place of my confinementit was she who gave the information to my husband and who remarked even then that the news was so much more interesting to his friend than to him that she suspected from an early period it was the purpose of the villain to shake me off on the journey her suspicions were confirmed she had heard him remark to his companion with a cold sarcastic sneer the total change which my prison and my illness had made on my complexion and she had heard the other reply that the defect might be cured by a touch of spanish red this and other circumstances having prepared her for such treachery monna paula now entered completely possessed of herself and prepared to support me her calm representations went farther with the stranger than the expressions of my despair if he did not entirely believe our tale he at least acted the part of a man of honour who would not intrude himself on defenceless females whatever was their character desisted from persecuting us with his presence and not only directed monna paula how we should journey to paris but furnished her with money for the purpose of our journey from the capital i wrote to master heriot my fathers most trusted correspondent he came instantly to paris on receiving the letter andbut here comes monna paula with more than the sum you desired take it my dearest maidenserve this youth if you will but o margaret look for no gratitude in return  the lady hermione took the bag of gold from her attendant and gave it to her young friend who threw herself into her arms kissed her on both the pale cheeks over which the sorrows so newly awakened by her narrative had drawn many tears then sprung up wiped her own overflowing eyes and left the foljambe apartments with a hasty and resolved step     chapter xxi     rove not from pole to polethe man lives here   whose razors only equalld by his beer   and where in either sense the cockneyput   may if he pleases get confounded cut        on the sign of an alehouse kept by a barber  we are under the necessity of transporting our readers to the habitation of benjamin suddlechop the husband of the active and efficient dame ursula and who also in his own person discharged more offices than one for besides trimming locks and beards and turning whiskers upward into the martial and swaggering curl or downward into the drooping form which became mustaches of civil policy besides also occasionally letting blood either by cupping or by the lancet extracting a stump and performing other actions of petty pharmacy very nearly as well as his neighbour raredrench the apothecary he could on occasion draw a cup of beer as well as a tooth tap a hogshead as well as a vein and wash with a draught of good ale the mustaches which his art had just trimmed but he carried on these trades apart from each other  his barbers shop projected its long and mysterious pole into fleet street painted partycolouredwise to represent the ribbons with which in elder times that ensign was garnished in the window were seen rows of teeth displayed upon strings like rosariescups with a red rag at the bottom to resemble blood an intimation that patients might be bled cupped or blistered with the assistance of sufficient advice while the more profitable but less honourable operations upon the hair of the head and beard were briefly and gravely announced within was the wellworn leather chair for customers the guitar then called a ghittern or cittern with which a customer might amuse himself till his predecessor was dismissed from under benjamins hands and which therefore often flayed the ears of the patient metaphorically while his chin sustained from the razor literal scarification all therefore in this department spoke the chirurgeonbarber or the barberchirurgeon  but there was a little backroom used as a private taproom which had a separate entrance by a dark and crooked alley which communicated with fleet street after a circuitous passage through several bylanes and courts this retired temple of bacchus had also a connexion with benjamins more public shop by a long and narrow entrance conducting to the secret premises in which a few old topers used to take their morning draught and a few gillsippers their modicum of strong waters in a bashful way after having entered the barbers shop under pretence of being shaved besides this obscure taproom gave a separate admission to the apartments of dame ursley which she was believed to make use of in the course of her multifarious practice both to let herself secretly out and to admit clients and employers who cared not to be seen to visit her in public accordingly after the hour of noon by which time the modest and timid whetters who were benjamins best customers had each had his draught or his thimbleful the business of the tap was in a manner ended and the charge of attending the backdoor passed from one of the barbers apprentices to the little mulatto girl the dingy iris of dame suddlechop then came mystery thick upon mystery muffled gallants and masked females in disguises of different fashions were seen to glide through the intricate mazes of the alley and even the low tap on the door which frequently demanded the attention of the little creole had in it something that expressed secrecy and fear of discovery  it was the evening of the same day when margaret had held the long conference with the lady hermione that dame suddlechop had directed her little portress to keep the door fast as a misers pursestrings and as she valued her saffron skin to let in none but the name she added in a whisper and accompanied it with a nod the little domestic blinked intelligence went to her post and in brief time thereafter admitted and ushered into the presence of the dame that very citygallant whose clothes sat awkwardly upon him and who had behaved so doughtily in the fray which befell at nigels first visit to beaujeus ordinary the mulatto introduced himmissis fine young gentleman all over gold and velvet then muttered to herself as she shut the door fine young gentleman heapprentice to him who makes the ticktick  it was indeedwe are sorry to say it and trust our readers will sympathize with the interest we take in the matterit was indeed honest jin vin who had been so far left to his own devices and abandoned by his better angel as occasionally to travesty himself in this fashion and to visit in the dress of a gallant of the day those places of pleasure and dissipation in which it would have been everlasting discredit to him to have been seen in his real character and condition that is had it been possible for him in his proper shape to have gained admission there was now a deep gloom on his brow his rich habit was hastily put on and buttoned awry his belt buckled in a most disorderly fashion so that his sword stuck outwards from his side instead of hanging by it with graceful negligence while his poniard though fairly hatched and gilded stuck in his girdle like a butchers steel in the fold of his blue apron persons of fashion had by the way the advantage formerly of being better distinguished from the vulgar than at present for what the ancient farthingale and more modern hoop were to court ladies the sword was to the gentleman an article of dress which only rendered those ridiculous who assumed it for the nonce without being in the habit of wearing it vincents rapier got between his legs and as he stumbled over it he exclaimedzounds tis the second time it has served me thusi believe the damned trinket knows i am no true gentleman and does it of set purpose  come come mine honest jin vincome my good boy said the dame in a soothing tone never mind these trankumsa frank and hearty london prentice is worth all the gallants of the inns of court  i was a frank and hearty london prentice before i knew you dame suddlechop said vincent what your advice has made me you may find a name for since fore george i am ashamed to think about it myself  awelladay quoth the dame and is it even so with theenay then i know but one cure and with that going to a little corner cupboard of carved wainscoat she opened it by the assistance of a key which with halfadozen besides hung in a silver chain at her girdle and produced a long flask of thin glass cased with wicker bringing forth at the same time two flemish rummer glasses with long stalks and capacious wombs she filled the one brimful for her guest and the other more modestly to about twothirds of its capacity for her own use repeating as the rich cordial trickled forth in a smooth oily streamright rosa solis as ever washed mulligrubs out of a moody brain  but though jin vin tossed off his glass without scruple while the lady sippped hers more moderately it did not appear to produce the expected amendment upon his humour on the contrary as he threw himself into the great leathern chair in which dame ursley was wont to solace herself of an evening he declared himself the most miserable dog within the sound of bowbell  and why should you be so idle as to think yourself so silly boy said dame suddlechop but tis always thusfools and children never know when they are well why there is not one that walks in st pauls whether in flat cap or hat and feather that has so many kind glances from the wenches as you when ye swagger along fleet street with your bat under your arm and your cap set aside upon your head thou knowest well that from mrs deputys self down to the waist coateers in the alley all of them are twiring and peeping betwixt their fingers when you pass and yet you call yourself a miserable dog and i must tell you all this over and over again as if i were whistling the chimes of london to a pettish child in order to bring the pretty baby into goodhumour  the flattery of dame ursula seemed to have the fate of her cordialit was swallowed indeed by the party to whom she presented it and that with some degree of relish but it did not operate as a sedative on the disturbed state of the youths mind he laughed for an instant half in scorn and half in gratified vanity but cast a sullen look on dame ursley as he replied to her last words  you do treat me like a child indeed when you sing over and over to me a cuckoo song that i care not a copperfiling for  aha said dame ursley that is to say you care not if you please all unless you please oneyou are a true lover i warrant and care not for all the city from here to whitechapel so you could write yourself first in your pretty pegaramsays goodwill well well take patience man and be guided by me for i will be the hoop will bind you together at last  it is time you were so said jenkin for hitherto you have rather been the wedge to separate us  dame suddlechop had by this time finished her cordialit was not the first she had taken that day and though a woman of strong brain and cautious at least if not abstemious in her potations it may nevertheless be supposed that her patience was not improved by the regimen which she observed  why thou ungracious and ingrate knave said dame ursley have not i done every thing to put thee in thy mistresss good graces she loves gentry the proud scottish minx as a welshman loves cheese and has her fathers descent from that duke of daldevil or whatsoever she calls him as close in her heart as gold in a misers chest though she as seldom shows itand none she will think of or have but a gentlemanand a gentleman i have made of thee jin vin the devil cannot deny that  you have made a fool of me said poor jenkin looking at the sleeve of his jacket  never the worse gentleman for that said dame ursley laughing  and what is worse said he turning his back to her suddenly and writhing in his chair you have made a rogue of me  never the worse gentleman for that neither said dame ursley in the same tone let a man bear his folly gaily and his knavery stoutly and let me see if gravity or honesty will look him in the face nowa days tut man it was only in the time of king arthur or king lud that a gentleman was held to blemish his scutcheon by a leap over the line of reason or honestyit is the bold look the ready hand the fine clothes the brisk oath and the wild brain that makes the gallant nowadays  i know what you have made me said jin vin since i have given up skittles and trapball for tennis and bowls good english ale for thin bordeaux and sour rhenish roastbeef and pudding for woodcocks and kickshawsmy bat for a sword my cap for a beaver my forsooth for a modish oath my christmasbox for a dicebox my religion for the devils matins and mine honest name forwoman i could brain thee when i think whose advice has guided me in all this  whose advice then whose advice then speak out thou poor petty cloakbrusher and say who advised thee retorted dame ursley flushed and indignantmarry come up my paltry companionsay by whose advice you have made a gamester of yourself and a thief besides as your words would bearthe lord deliver us from evil and here dame ursley devoutly crossed herself  hark ye dame ursley suddlechop said jenkin starting up his dark eyes flashing with anger remember i am none of your husbandand if i were you would do well not to forget whose threshold was swept when they last rode the skimmington footnote a species of triumphal procession in honour of female supremacy when it rose to such a height as to attract the attention of the neighbourhood it is described at full length in hudibras part ii canto ii as the procession passed on those who attended it in an official capacity were wont to sweep the threshold of the houses in which fame affirmed the mistresses to exercise paramount authority which was given and received as a hint that their inmates might in their turn be made the subject of a similar ovation the skimmington which in some degree resembled the proceedings of mumbo jumbo in an african village has been long discontinued in england apparently because female rule has become either milder or less frequent than among our ancestors upon such another scolding jade as yourself  i hope to see you ride up holborn next said dame ursley provoked out of all her holiday and sugarplum expressions with a nosegay at your breast and a parson at your elbow  that may well be answered jin vin bitterly if i walk by your counsels as i have begun by them but before that day comes you shall know that jin vin has the brisk boys of fleet street still at his winkyes you jade you shall be carted for bawd and conjurer doubledyed in grain and bing off to bridewell with every brass basin betwixt the bar and pauls beating before you as if the devil were banging them with his beefhook  dame ursley coloured like scarlet seized upon the halfemptied flask of cordial and seemed by her first gesture about to hurl it at the head of her adversary but suddenly and as if by a strong internal effort she checked her outrageous resentment and putting the bottle to its more legitimate use filled with wonderful composure the two glasses and taking up one of them said with a smile which better became her comely and jovial countenance than the fury by which it was animated the moment before  here is to thee jin vin my lad in all loving kindness whatever spite thou bearest to me that have always been a mother to thee  jenkins english goodnature could not resist this forcible appeal he took up the other glass and lovingly pledged the dame in her cup of reconciliation and proceeded to make a kind of grumbling apology for his own violence  for you know he said it was you persuaded me to get these fine things and go to that godless ordinary and ruffle it with the best and bring you home all the news and you said i that was the cock of the ward would soon be the cock of the ordinary and would win ten times as much at gleek and primero as i used to do at put and beggar myneighbourand turn up doublets with the dice as busily as i was wont to trowl down the ninepins in the skittlegroundand then you said i should bring you such news out of the ordinary as should make us all when used as you knew how to use itand now you see what is to come of it all  tis all true thou sayest lad said the dame but thou must have patience rome was not built in a dayyou cannot become used to your courtsuit in a months time any more than when you changed your long coat for a doublet and hose and in gaming you must expect to lose as well as gaintis the sitting gamester sweeps the board  the board has swept me i know replied jin vin and that pretty clean outi would that were the worst but i owe for all this finery and settlingday is coming on and my master will find my accompt worse than it should be by a score of pieces my old father will be called in to make them good and imay save the hangman a labour and do the job myself or go the virginia voyage  do not speak so loud my dear boy said dame ursley but tell me why you borrow not from a friend to make up your arrear you could lend him as much when his settlingday came round  no noi have had enough of that work said vincent tunstall would lend me the money poor fellow an he had it but his gentle beggarly kindred plunder him of all and keep him as bare as a birch at christmas nomy fortune may be spelt in four letters and these read ruin  now hush you simple craven said the dame did you never hear that when the need is highest the help is nighest we may find aid for you yet and sooner than you are aware of i am sure i would never have advised you to such a course but only you had set heart and eye on pretty mistress marget and less would not serve youand what could i do but advise you to cast your cityslough and try your luck where folks find fortune  ay ayi remember your counsel well said jenkin i was to be introduced to her by you when i was perfect in my gallantries and as rich as the king and then she was to be surprised to find i was poor jin vin that used to watch from matin to curfew for one glance of her eye and now instead of that she has set her soul on this scottish sparrowhawk of a lord that won my last tester and be cursed to him and so i am bankrupt in love fortune and character before i am out of my time and all along of you mother midnight  do not call me out of my own name my dear boy jin vin answered ursula in a tone betwixt rage and coaxingdo not because i am no saint but a poor sinful woman with no more patience than she needs to carry her through a thousand crosses and if i have done you wrong by evil counsel i must mend it and put you right by good advice and for the score of pieces that must be made up at settlingday why here is in a good green purse as much as will make that matter good and we will get old crosspatch the tailor to take a long day for your clothes and  mother are you serious said jin vin unable to trust either his eyes or his ears  in troth am i said the dame and will you call me mother midnight now jin vin  mother midnight exclaimed jenkin hugging the dame in his transport and bestowing on her still comely cheek a hearty and not unacceptable smack that sounded like the report of a pistolmother midday rather that has risen to light me out of my troublesa mother more dear than she who bore me for she poor soul only brought me into a world of sin and sorrow and your timely aid has helped me out of the one and the other and the goodnatured fellow threw himself back in his chair and fairly drew his hand across his eyes  you would not have me be made to ride the skimmington then said the dame or parade me in a cart with all the brass basins of the ward beating the march to bridewell before me  i would sooner be carted to tyburn myself replied the penitent  why then sit up like a man and wipe thine eyes and if thou art pleased with what i have done i will show thee how thou mayst requite me in the highest degree  how said jenkin vincent sitting straight up in his chairyou would have me then do you some service for this friendship of yours  ay marry would i said dame ursley for you are to know that though i am right glad to stead you with it this gold is not mine but was placed in my hands in order to find a trusty agent for a certain purpose and sobut whats the matter with youare you fool enough to be angry because you cannot get a purse of gold for nothing i would i knew where such were to come by i never could find them lying in my road i promise you  no no dame said poor jenkin it is not for that for look you i would rather work these ten bones to the knuckles and live by my labour but and here he paused  but what man said dame ursley you are willing to work for what you want and yet when i offer you gold for the winning you look on me as the devil looks over lincoln  it is ill talking of the devil mother said jenkin i had him even now in my headfor look you i am at that pass when they say he will appear to wretched ruined creatures and proffer them gold for the feesimple of their salvation but i have been trying these two days to bring my mind strongly up to the thought that i will rather sit down in shame and sin and sorrow as i am like to do than hold on in ill courses to get rid of my present straits and so take care dame ursula how you tempt me to break such a good resolution  i tempt you to nothing young man answered ursula and as i perceive you are too wilful to be wise i will een put my purse in my pocket and look out for some one that will work my turn with better will and more thankfulness and you may go your own coursebreak your indenture ruin your father lose your character and bid pretty mistress margaret farewell for ever and a day  stay stay said jenkin the woman is in as great a hurry as a brown baker when his oven is overheated first let me hear that which you have to propose to me  why after all it is but to get a gentleman of rank and fortune who is in trouble carried in secret down the river as far as the isle of dogs or somewhere thereabout where he may lie concealed until he can escape aboard i know thou knowest every place by the rivers side as well as the devil knows an usurer or the beggar knows his dish  a plague of your similes dame replied the apprentice for the devil gave me that knowledge and beggary may be the end ontbut what has this gentleman done that he should need to be under hiding no papist i hopeno catesby and piercy businessno gunpowder plot  fy fywhat do you take me for said dame ursula i am as good a churchwoman as the parsons wife save that necessary business will not allow me to go there oftener than on christmasday heaven help meno nothis is no popish matter the gentleman hath but struck another in the park  ha what said vincent interrupting her with a start  ay ay i see you guess whom i mean it is even he we have spoken of so oftenjust lord glenvarloch and no one else  vincent sprung from his seat and traversed the room with rapid and disorderly steps  there there it is nowyou are always ice or gunpowder you sit in the great leathern armchair as quiet as a rocket hangs upon the frame in a rejoicingnight till the match be fired and then whizz you are in the third heaven beyond the reach of the human voice eye or brainwhen you have wearied yourself with padding to and fro across the room will you tell me your determination for time presses will you aid me in this matter or not  nononoa thousand times no replied jenkin have you not confessed to me that margaret loves him  ay answered the dame that she thinks she does but that will not last long  and have i not told you but this instant replied jenkin that it was this same glenvarloch that rooked me at the ordinary of every penny i had and made a knave of me to boot by gaining more than was my owno that cursed gold which shortyard the mercer paid me that morning on accompt for mending the clock of saint stephens if i had not by ill chance had that about me i could but have beggared my purse without blemishing my honesty and after i had been rooked of all the rest amongst them i must needs risk the last five pieces with that shark among the minnows  granted said dame ursula all this i know and i own that as lord glenvarloch was the last you played with you have a right to charge your ruin on his head moreover i admit as already said that margaret has made him your rival yet surely now he is in danger to lose his hand it is not a time to remember all this  by my faith but it is though said the young citizen lose his hand indeed they may take his head for what i care head and hand have made me a miserable wretch  now were it not better my prince of flatcaps said dame ursula that matters were squared between you and that through means of the same scottish lord who has as you say deprived you of your money and your mistress you should in a short time recover both  and how can your wisdom come to that conclusion dame said the apprentice my money indeed i can conceivethat is if i comply with your proposal butmy pretty margethow serving this lord whom she has set her nonsensical head upon can do me good with her is far beyond my conception  that is because in simple phrase said dame ursula thou knowest no more of a womans heart than doth a norfolk gosling look you man were i to report to mistress margaret that the young lord has miscarried through thy lack of courtesy in refusing to help him why then thou wert odious to her for ever she will loathe thee as she will loathe the very cook who is to strike off glenvarlochs hand with his cleaverand then she will be yet more fixed in her affections towards this lord london will hear of nothing but himspeak of nothing but himthink of nothing but him for three weeks at least and all that outcry will serve to keep him uppermost in her mind for nothing pleases a girl so much as to bear relation to any one who is the talk of the whole world around her then if he suffer this sentence of the law it is a chance if she ever forgets him i saw that handsome proper young gentleman babington suffer in the queens time myself and though i was then but a girl he was in my head for a year after he was hanged but above all pardoned or punished glenvarloch will probably remain in london and his presence will keep up the silly girls nonsensical fancy about him whereas if he escapes  ay show me how that is to avail me said jenkin if he escapes said the dame resuming her argument he must resign the court for years if not for life and you know the old saying out of sight and out of mind  truemost true said jenkin spoken like an oracle most wise ursula ay ay i knew you would hear reason at last said the wily dame and then when this same lord is off and away for once and for ever who i pray you is to be pretty pets confidential person and who is to fill up the void in her affectionswhy who but thou thou pearl of prentices and then you will have overcome your own inclinations to comply with hers and every woman is sensible of that and you will have run some risk too in carrying her desires into effectand what is it that woman likes better than bravery and devotion to her will then you have her secret and she must treat you with favour and observance and repose confidence in you and hold private intercourse with you till she weeps with one eye for the absent lover whom she is never to see again and blinks with the other blithely upon him who is in presence and then if you know not how to improve the relation in which you stand with her you are not the brisk lively lad that all the world takes you forsaid i well  you have spoken like an empress most mighty ursula said jenkin vincent and your will shall be obeyed  you know alsatia well continued his tutoress  well enough well enough replied he with a nod i have heard the dice rattle there in my day before i must set up for gentleman and go among the gallants at the shavaleer bojos as they call himthe worse rookery of the two though the feathers are the gayest  and they will have a respect for thee yonder i warrant  ay ay replied vin when i am got into my fustian doublet again with my bit of a trunnion under my arm i can walk alsatia at midnight as i could do that there fleet street in middaythey will not one of them swagger with the prince of prentices and the king of clubs they know i could bring every tall boy in the ward down upon them  and you know all the watermen and so forth  can converse with every sculler in his own language from richmond to gravesend and know all the watercocks from john taylor the poet to little grigg the grinner who never pulls but he shows all his teeth from ear to ear as if he were grimacing through a horsecollar  and you can take any dress or character upon you well such as a watermans a butchers a footsoldiers continued ursula or the like  not such a mummer as i am within the walls and thou knowest that well enough dame replied the apprentice i can touch the players themselves at the ball and at the fortune for presenting any thing except a gentleman take but this dd skin of frippery off me which i think the devil stuck me into and you shall put me into nothing else that i will not become as if i were born to it  well we will talk of your transmutation by and by said the dame and find you clothes withal and money besides for it will take a good deal to carry the thing handsomely through  but where is that money to come from dame said jenkin there is a question i would fain have answered before i touch it  why what a fool art thou to ask such a question suppose i am content to advance it to please young madam what is the harm then  i will suppose no such thing said jenkin hastily i know that you dame have no gold to spare and maybe would not spare it if you hadso that cock will not crow it must be from margaret herself  well thou suspicious animal and what if it were said ursula  only this replied jenkin that i will presently to her and learn if she has come fairly by so much ready money for sooner than connive at her getting it by any indirection i would hang myself at once it is enough what i have done myself no need to engage poor margaret in such villainyill to her and tell her of the dangeri will by heaven  you are mad to think of it said dame suddlechop considerably alarmedhear me but a moment i know not precisely from whom she got the money but sure i am that she obtained it at her godfathers  why master george heriot is not returned from france said jenkin  no replied ursula but dame judith is at homeand the strange lady whom they call master heriots ghostshe never goes abroad  it is very true dame suddlechop said jenkin and i believe you have guessed rightthey say that lady has coin at will and if marget can get a handful of fairygold why she is free to throw it away at will  ah jin vin said the dame reducing her voice almost to a whisper we should not want gold at will neither could we but read the riddle of that lady  they may read it that list said jenkin ill never pry into what concerns me notmaster george heriot is a worthy and brave citizen and an honour to london and has a right to manage his own household as he likes bestthere was once a talk of rabbling him the fifth of november before the last because they said he kept a nunnery in his house like old lady foljambe but master george is well loved among the prentices and we got so many brisk boys of us together as should have rabbled the rabble had they had but the heart to rise  well let that pass said ursula and now tell me how you will manage to be absent from shop a day or two for you must think that this matter will not be ended sooner  why as to that i can say nothing said jenkin i have always served duly and truly i have no heart to play truant and cheat my master of his time as well as his money  nay but the point is to get back his money for him said ursula which he is not likely to see on other conditions could you not ask leave to go down to your uncle in essex for two or three days he may be ill you know  why if i must i must said jenkin with a heavy sigh but i will not be lightly caught treading these dark and crooked paths again  hush thee then said the dame and get leave for this very evening and come back hither and i will introduce you to another implement who must be employed in the matterstay staythe lad is mazedyou would not go into your masters shop in that guise surely your trunk is in the matted chamber with your prentice thingsgo and put them on as fast as you can  i think i am bewitched said jenkin giving a glance towards his dress or that these fools trappings have made as great an ass of me as of many i have seen wear them but let line once be rid of the harness and if you catch me putting it on again i will give you leave to sell me to a gipsy to carry pots pans and beggars bantlings all the rest of my life so saying he retired to change his apparel     chapter xxii     chance will not do the workchance sends the breeze   but if the pilot slumber at the helm   the very wind that wafts us towards the port   may dash us on the shelvesthe steersmans part is vigilance   blow it or rough or smooth                                old play  we left nigel whose fortunes we are bound to trace by the engagement contracted in our titlepage sad and solitary in the mansion of trapbois the usurer having just received a letter instead of a visit from his friend the templar stating reasons why he could not at that time come to see him in alsatia so that it appeared that his intercourse with the better and more respectable class of society was for the present entirely cut off this was a melancholy and to a proud mind like that of nigel a degrading reflection  he went to the window of his apartment and found the street enveloped in one of those thick dingy yellowcoloured fogs which often invest the lower part of london and westminster amid the darkness dense and palpable were seen to wander like phantoms a reveller or two whom the morning had surprised where the evening left them and who now with tottering steps and by an instinct which intoxication could not wholly overcome were groping the way to their own homes to convert day into night for the purpose of sleeping off the debauch which had turned night into day although it was broad day in the other parts of the city it was scarce dawn yet in alsatia and none of the sounds of industry or occupation were there heard which had long before aroused the slumberers in any other quarter the prospect was too tiresome and disagreeable to detain lord glenvarloch at his station so turning from the window he examined with more interest the furniture and appearance of the apartment which he tenanted  much of it had been in its time rich and curiousthere was a huge fourpost bed with as much carved oak about it as would have made the head of a manofwar and tapestry hangings ample enough to have been her sails there was a huge mirror with a massy frame of gilt brass work which was of venetian manufacture and must have been worth a considerable sum before it received the tremendous crack which traversing it from one corner to the other bore the same proportion to the surface that the nile bears to the map of egypt the chairs were of different forms and shapes some had been carved some gilded some covered with damasked leather some with embroidered work but all were damaged and wormeaten there was a picture of susanna and the elders over the chimneypiece which might have been accounted a choice piece had not the rats made free with the chaste fair ones nose and with the beard of one of her reverend admirers  in a word all that lord glenvarloch saw seemed to have been articles carried off by appraisement or distress or bought as pennyworths at some obscure brokers and huddled together in the apartment as in a saleroom without regard to taste or congruity  the place appeared to nigel to resemble the houses near the seacoast which are too often furnished with the spoils of wrecked vessels as this was probably fitted up with the relics of ruined profligates my own skiff is among the breakers thought lord glenvarloch though my wreck will add little to the profits of the spoiler  he was chiefly interested in the state of the grate a huge assemblage of rusted iron bars which stood in the chimney unequally supported by three brazen feet moulded into the form of lions claws while the fourth which had been bent by an accident seemed proudly uplifted as if to paw the ground or as if the whole article had nourished the ambitious purpose of pacing forth into the middle of the apartment and had one foot ready raised for the journey a smile passed over nigels face as this fantastic idea presented itself to his fancyi must stop its march however he thought for this morning is chill and raw enough to demand some fire  he called accordingly from the top of a large staircase with a heavy oaken balustrade which gave access to his own and other apartments for the house was old and of considerable size but receiving no answer to his repeated summons he was compelled to go in search of some one who might accommodate him with what he wanted  nigel had according to the fashion of the old world in scotland received an education which might in most particulars be termed simple hardy and unostentatious but he had nevertheless been accustomed to much personal deference and to the constant attendance and ministry of one or more domestics this was the universal custom in scotland where wages were next to nothing and where indeed a man of title or influence might have as many attendants as he pleased for the mere expense of food clothes and countenance nigel was therefore mortified and displeased when he found himself without notice or attendance and the more dissatisfied because he was at the same time angry with himself for suffering such a trifle to trouble him at all amongst matters of more deep concernment there must surely be some servants in so large a house as this said he as he wandered over the place through which he was conducted by a passage which branched off from the gallery as he went on he tried the entrance to several apartments some of which he found were locked and others unfurnished all apparently unoccupied so that at length he returned to the staircase and resolved to make his way down to the lower part of the house where he supposed he must at least find the old gentleman and his illfavoured daughter with this purpose he first made his entrance into a little low dark parlour containing a wellworn leathern easychair before which stood a pair of slippers while on the left side rested a crutchhandled staff an oaken table stood before it and supported a huge desk clamped with iron and a massive pewter inkstand around the apartment were shelves cabinets and other places convenient for depositing papers a sword musketoon and a pair of pistols hung over the chimney in ostentatious display as if to intimate that the proprietor would be prompt in the defence of his premises  this must be the usurers den thought nigel and he was about to call aloud when the old man awakened even by the slightest noise for avarice seldom sleeps sound soon was heard from the inner room speaking in a voice of irritability rendered more tremulous by his morning cough  ugh ugh ughwho is there i sayugh ughwho is there why marthaugh ughmartha trapboishere be thieves in the house and they will not speak to mewhy marthathieves thievesugh ugh ugh  nigel endeavoured to explain but the idea of thieves had taken possession of the old mans pineal gland and he kept coughing and screaming and screaming and coughing until the gracious martha entered the apartment and having first outscreamed her father in order to convince him that there was no danger and to assure him that the intruder was their new lodger and having as often heard her sire ejaculatehold him fastugh ughhold him fast till i come she at length succeeded in silencing his fears and his clamour and then coldly and dryly asked lord glenvarloch what he wanted in her fathers apartment  her lodger had in the meantime leisure to contemplate her appearance which did not by any means improve the idea he had formed of it by candlelight on the preceding evening she was dressed in what was called a queen marys ruff and farthingale not the falling ruff with which the unfortunate mary of scotland is usually painted but that which with more than spanish stiffness surrounded the throat and set off the morose head of her fierce namesake of smithfield memory this antiquated dress assorted well with the faded complexion grey eyes thin lips and austere visage of the antiquated maiden which was moreover enhanced by a black hood worn as her headgear carefully disposed so as to prevent any of her hair from escaping to view probably because the simplicity of the period knew no art of disguising the colour with which time had begun to grizzle her tresses her figure was tall thin and flat with skinny arms and hands and feet of the larger size cased in huge highheeled shoes which added height to a stature already ungainly apparently some art had been used by the tailor to conceal a slight defect of shape occasioned by the accidental elevation of one shoulder above the other but the praiseworthy efforts of the ingenious mechanic had only succeeded in calling the attention of the observer to his benevolent purpose without demonstrating that he had been able to achieve it  such was mrs martha trapbois whose dry what were you seeking here sir fell again and with reiterated sharpness on the ear of nigel as he gazed upon her presence and compared it internally to one of the faded and grim figures in the old tapestry which adorned his bedstead it was however necessary to reply and he answered that he came in search of the servants as he desired to have a fire kindled in his apartment on account of the rawness of the morning  the woman who does our charwork answered mistress martha comes at eight oclockif you want fire sooner there are fagots and a bucket of seacoal in the stonecloset at the head of the stairand there is a flint and steel on the upper shelfyou can light fire for yourself if you will  nonono martha ejaculated her father who having donned his rustic tunic with his hose all ungirt and his feet slipshod hastily came out of the inner apartment with his mind probably full of robbers for he had a naked rapier in his hand which still looked formidable though rust had somewhat marred its shinewhat he had heard at entrance about lighting a fire had changed however the current of his ideas nonono he cried and each negative was more emphatic than its predecessorthe gentleman shall not have the trouble to put on a fireughugh ill put it on myself for a con sideration  this last word was a favourite expression with the old gentleman which he pronounced in a peculiar manner gasping it out syllable by syllable and laying a strong emphasis upon the last it was indeed a sort of protecting clause by which he guarded himself against all inconveniences attendant on the rash habit of offering service or civility of any kind the which when hastily snapped at by those to whom they are uttered give the profferer sometimes room to repent his promptitude  for shame father said martha that must not be master grahame will kindle his own fire or wait till the charwoman comes to do it for him just as likes him best  no childno child child martha no reiterated the old miser no charwoman shall ever touch a grate in my house they putugh ughthe faggot uppermost and so the coal kindles not and the flame goes up the chimney and wood and heat are both thrown away now i will lay it properly for the gentleman for a consideration so that it shall lastugh ughlast the whole day here his vehemence increased his cough so violently that nigel could only from a scattered word here and there comprehend that it was a recommendation to his daughter to remove the poker and tongs from the strangers fireside with an assurance that when necessary his landlord would be in attendance to adjust it himself for a consideration  martha paid as little attention to the old mans injunctions as a predominant dame gives to those of a henpecked husband she only repeated in a deeper and more emphatic tone of censurefor shame fatherfor shame then turning to her guest said with her usual ungraciousness of mannermaster grahameit is best to be plain with you at first my father is an old a very old man and his wits as you may see are somewhat weakenedthough i would not advise you to make a bargain with him else you may find them too sharp for your own for myself i am a lone woman and to say truth care little to see or converse with any one if you can be satisfied with houseroom shelter and safety it will be your own fault if you have them not and they are not always to be found in this unhappy quarter but if you seek deferential observance and attendance i tell you at once you will not find them here  i am not wont either to thrust myself upon acquaintance madam or to give trouble said the guest nevertheless i shall need the assistance of a domestic to assist me to dressperhaps you can recommend me to such  yes to twenty answered mistress martha who will pick your purse while they tie your points and cut your throat while they smooth your pillow  i will be his servant myself said the old man whose intellect for a moment distanced had again in some measure got up with the conversation i will brush his cloakugh ughand tie his points ugh ughand clean his shoesughand run on his errands with speed and safetyugh ugh ugh ughfor a consideration  goodmorrow to you sir said martha to nigel in a tone of direct and positive dismissal it cannot be agreeable to a daughter that a stranger should hear her father speak thus if you be really a gentleman you will retire to your own apartment  i will not delay a moment said nigel respectfully for he was sensible that circumstances palliated the womans rudeness i would but ask you if seriously there can be danger in procuring the assistance of a servingman in this place  young gentleman said martha you must know little of whitefriars to ask the question we live alone in this house and seldom has a stranger entered it nor should you to be plain had my will been consulted look at the doorsee if that of a castle can be better secured the windows of the first floor are grated on the outside and within look to these shutters  she pulled one of them aside and showed a ponderous apparatus of bolts and chains for securing the windowshutters while her father pressing to her side seized her gown with a trembling hand and said in a low whisper show not the trick of locking and undoing them show him not the trick ont marthaugh ughon no consideration martha went on without paying him any attention  and yet young gentleman we have been more than once like to find all these defences too weak to protect our lives such an evil effect on the wicked generation around us hath been made by the unhappy report of my poor fathers wealth  say nothing of that housewife said the miser his irritability increased by the very supposition of his being wealthysay nothing of that or i will beat thee housewifebeat thee with my staff for fetching and carrying lies that will procure our throats to be cut at lastugh ughi am but a poor man he continued turning to nigel a very poor man that am willing to do any honest turn upon earth for a modest consideration  i therefore warn you of the life you must lead young gentleman said martha the poor woman who does the charwork will assist you so far as in her power but the wise man is his own best servant and assistant  it is a lesson you have taught me madam and i thank you for iti will assuredly study it at leisure  you will do well said martha and as you seem thankful for advice i though i am no professed counsellor of others will give you more make no intimacy with any one in whitefriarsborrow no money on any score especially from my father for dotard as he seems he will make an ass of you last and best of all stay here not an instant longer than you can help it farewell sir  a gnarled tree may bear good fruit and a harsh nature may give good counsel thought the lord of glenvarloch as he retreated to his own apartment where the same reflection occurred to him again and again while unable as yet to reconcile himself to the thoughts of becoming his own firemaker he walked up and down his bedroom to warm himself by exercise  at length his meditations arranged themselves in the following soliloquyby which expression i beg leave to observe once for all that i do not mean that nigel literally said aloud with his bodily organs the words which follow in inverted commas while pacing the room by himself but that i myself choose to present to my dearest reader the picture of my heros mind his reflections and resolutions in the form of a speech rather than in that of a narrative in other words i have put his thoughts into language and this i conceive to be the purpose of the soliloquy upon the stage as well as in the closet being at once the most natural and perhaps the only way of communicating to the spectator what is supposed to be passing in the bosom of the scenic personage there are no such soliloquies in nature it is true but unless they were received as a conventional medium of communication betwixt the poet and the audience we should reduce dramatic authors to the recipe of master puff who makes lord burleigh intimate a long train of political reasoning to the audience by one comprehensive shake of his noddle in narrative no doubt the writer has the alternative of telling that his personages thought so and so inferred thus and thus and arrived at such and such a conclusion but the soliloquy is a more concise and spirited mode of communicating the same information and therefore thus communed or thus might have communed the lord of glenvarloch with his own mind  she is right and has taught me a lesson i will profit by i have been through my whole life one who leant upon others for that assistance which it is more truly noble to derive from my own exertions i am ashamed of feeling the paltry inconvenience which long habit had led me to annex to the want of a servants assistancei am ashamed of that but far far more am i ashamed to have suffered the same habit of throwing my own burden on others to render me since i came to this city a mere victim of those events which i have never even attempted to influencea thing never acting but perpetually acted uponprotected by one friend deceived by another but in the advantage which i received from the one and the evil i have sustained from the other as passive and helpless as a boat that drifts without oar or rudder at the mercy of the winds and waves i became a courtier because heriot so advised ita gamester because dalgarno so contrived itan alsatian because lowestoffe so willed it whatever of good or bad has befallen me has arisen out of the agency of others not from my own my fathers son must no longer hold this facile and puerile course live or die sink or swim nigel olifaunt from this moment shall owe his safety success and honour to his own exertions or shall fall with the credit of having at least exerted his own free agency i will write it down in my tablets in her very wordsthe wise man is his own best assistant  he had just put his tablets in his pocket when the old charwoman who to add to her efficiency was sadly crippled by rheumatism hobbled into the room to try if she could gain a small gratification by waiting on the stranger she readily undertook to get lord glenvarlochs breakfast and as there was an eatinghouse at the next door she succeeded in a shorter time than nigel had augured  as his solitary meal was finished one of the temple porters or inferior officers was announced as seeking master grahame on the part of his friend master lowestoffe and being admitted by the old woman to his apartment he delivered to nigel a small mailtrunk with the clothes he had desired should be sent to him and then with more mystery put into his hand a casket or strongboy which he carefully concealed beneath his cloak i am glad to be rid ont said the fellow as he placed it on the table  why it is surely not so very heavy answered nigel and you are a stout young man  ay sir replied the fellow but samson himself would not have carried such a matter safely through alsatia had the lads of the huff known what it was please to look into it sir and see all is right i am an honest fellow and it comes safe out of my hands how long it may remain so afterwards will depend on your own care i would not my good name were to suffer by any afterclap  to satisfy the scruples of the messenger lord glenvarloch opened the casket in his presence and saw that his small stock of money with two or three valuable papers which it contained and particularly the original signmanual which the king had granted in his favour were in the same order in which he had left them at the mans further instance he availed himself of the writing materials which were in the casket in order to send a line to master lowestoffe declaring that his property had reached him in safety he added some grateful acknowledgments for lowestoffes services and just as he was sealing and delivering his billet to the messenger his aged landlord entered the apartment his threadbare suit of black clothes was now somewhat better arranged than they had been in the dishabille of his first appearance and his nerves and intellects seemed to be less fluttered for without much coughing or hesitation he invited nigel to partake of a morning draught of wholesome single ale which he brought in a large leathern tankard or blackjack carried in the one hand while the other stirred it round with a sprig of rosemary to give it as the old man said a flavour  nigel declined the courteous proffer and intimated by his manner while he did so that he desired no intrusion on the privacy of his own apartment which indeed he was the more entitled to maintain considering the cold reception he had that morning met with when straying from its precincts into those of his landlord but the open casket contained matter or rather metal so attractive to old trapbois that he remained fixed like a settingdog at a dead point his nose advanced and one hand expanded like the lifted forepaw by which that sagacious quadruped sometimes indicates that it is a hare which he has in the wind nigel was about to break the charm which had thus arrested old trapbois by shutting the lid of the casket when his attention was withdrawn from him by the question of the messenger who holding out the letter asked whether he was to leave it at mr lowestoffes chambers in the temple or carry it to the marshalsea  the marshalsea repeated lord glenvarloch what of the marshalsea  why sir said the man the poor gentleman is laid up there in lavender because they say his own kind heart led him to scald his fingers with another mans broth  nigel hastily snatched back the letter broke the seal joined to the contents his earnest entreaty that he might be instantly acquainted with the cause of his confinement and added that if it arose out of his own unhappy affair it would be of a brief duration since he had even before hearing of a reason which so peremptorily demanded that he should surrender himself adopted the resolution to do so as the manliest and most proper course which his ill fortune and imprudence had left in his own power he therefore conjured mr lowestoffe to have no delicacy upon this score but since his surrender was what he had determined upon as a sacrifice due to his own character that he would have the frankness to mention in what manner it could be best arranged so as to extricate him lowestoffe from the restraint to which the writer could not but fear his friend had been subjected on account of the generous interest which he had taken in his concerns the letter concluded that the writer would suffer twentyfour hours to elapse in expectation of hearing from him and at the end of that period was determined to put his purpose in execution he delivered the billet to the messenger and enforcing his request with a piece of money urged him without a moments delay to convey it to the hands of master lowestoffe  iiiwill carry it to him myself said the old usurer for half the consideration  the man who heard this attempt to take his duty and perquisites over his head lost no time in pocketing the money and departed on his errand as fast as he could  master trapbois said nigel addressing the old man somewhat impatiently had you any particular commands for me  iicame to see if you rested well answered the old man andif i could do anything to serve you on any consideration  sir i thank you said lord glenvarlochi thank you and ere he could say more a heavy footstep was heard on the stair  my god exclaimed the old man starting upwhy dorothychar womanwhy daughterdraw bolt i say housewivesthe door hath been left alatch  the door of the chamber opened

will dose the mongrels or in plain terms ill use the private knife stead of the brandishd falchion                                 old play  the noble captain colepepper or peppercull for he was known by both these names and some others besides had a martial and a swashing exterior which on the present occasion was rendered yet more peculiar by a patch covering his left eye and a part of the cheek the sleeves of his thickset velvet jerkin were polished and shone with greasehis buff gloves had huge tops which reached almost to the elbow his swordbelt of the same materials extended its breadth from his haunchbone to his small ribs and supported on the one side his large blackhilted backsword on the other a dagger of like proportions he paid his compliments to nigel with that air of predetermined effrontery which announces that it will not be repelled by any coldness of reception asked trapbois how he did by the familiar title of old peter pillory and then seizing upon the black jack emptied it off at a draught to the health of the last and youngest freeman of alsatia the noble and loving master nigel grahame  when he had set down the empty pitcher and drawn his breath he began to criticise the liquor which it had lately containedsufficient single beer old pilloryand as i take it brewed at the rate of a nutshell of malt to a butt of thamesas dead as a corpse too and yet it went hissing down my throatbubbling by jove like water upon hot ironyou left us early noble master grahame but good faith we had a carouse to your honourwe heard butt ring hollow ere we parted

its mark and reached my left eye the man of god bears my signmanual too but the duke made us friends again and it cost me more sack than i could carry and all the rhenish to boot to pledge the seer in the way of love and reconciliationbut caracco tis a vile old canting slave for all that whom i will one day beat out of his devils livery into all the colours of the rainbowbastasaid i well old trapbois where is thy daughter manwhat says she to my suittis an honest onewilt have a soldier for thy soninlaw old pillory to mingle the soul of martial honour with thy thieving miching pettylarceny blood as men put bold brandy into muddy ale  my daughter receives not company so early noble captain said the usurer and concluded his speech with a dry emphatical ugh ugh  what upon no consideration said the captain and wherefore not old truepenny she has not much time to lose in driving her bargain methinks  captain said trapbois i was upon some little business with our noble friend here master nigel greenugh ugh ugh  and you would have me gone i warrant you answered the bully but patience old pillory thine hour is not yet come manyou see he said pointing to the casket that noble master grahame whom you call green has got the decuses and the smelt  which you would willingly rid him of ha haugh ugh answered the usurer if you knew howbut lackaday thou art one of those that come out for wool and art sure to go home shorn why now but that i am sworn against laying of wagers i would risk some consideration that this honest guest of mine sends thee home penniless if thou darest venture with himugh ughat any game which gentlemen play at  marry thou hast me on the hip there thou old miserly conycatcher answered the captain taking a bale of dice from the sleeve of his coat i must always keep company with these damnable doctors and they have made me every babys cully and purged my purse into an atrophy but never mind it passes the time as well as aught elsehow say you master grahame  the fellow paused but even the extremity of his impudence could scarcely hardly withstand the cold look of utter contempt with which nigel received his proposal returning it with a simple i only play where i know my company and never in the morning  cards may be more agreeable said captain colepepper and for knowing your company here is honest old pillory will tell you jack colepepper plays as truly on the square as eer a man that trowled a diemen talk of high and low dice fulhams and bristles topping knapping slurring stabbing and a hundred ways of rooking besides but broil me like a rasher of bacon if i could ever learn the trick on em  you have got the vocabulary perfect sir at the least said nigel in the same cold tone  yes by mine honour have i returned the hector they are phrases that a gentleman learns about townbut perhaps you would like a set at tennis or a game at balloonwe have an indifferent good court hard by here and a set of as gentlemanlike blades as ever banged leather against brick and mortar  i beg to be excused at present said lord glenvarloch and to be plain among the valuable privileges your society has conferred on me i hope i may reckon that of being private in my own apartment when i have a mind  your humble servant sir said the captain and i thank you for your civilityjack colepepper can have enough of company and thrusts himself on no onebut perhaps you will like to make a match at skittles  i am by no means that way disposed replied the young nobleman  or to leap a flearun a snailmatch a wherry eh  noi will do none of these answered nigel  here the old man who had been watching with his little peery eyes pulled the bulky hector by the skirt and whispered do not vapour him the huff it will not passlet the trout play he will rise to the hook presently  but the bully confiding in his own strength and probably mistaking for timidity the patient scorn with which nigel received his proposals incited also by the open casket began to assume a louder and more threatening tone he drew himself up bent his brows assumed a look of professional ferocity and continued in alsatia look ye a man must be neighbourly and companionable zouns sir we would slit any nose that was turned up at us honest fellowsay sir we would slit it up to the gristle though it had smelt nothing all its life but musk ambergris and courtscented waterrabbit me i am a soldier and care no more for a lord than a lamplighter  are you seeking a quarrel sir said nigel calmly having in truth no desire to engage himself in a discreditable broil in such a place and with such a character  quarrel sir said the captain i am not seeking a quarrel though i care not how soon i find one only i wish you to understand you must be neighbourly thats all what if we should go over the water to the garden and see a bull hanked this fine morningsdeath will you do nothing  something i am strangely tempted to do at this moment said nigel  videlicet said colepepper with a swaggering air let us hear the temptation  i am tempted to throw you headlong from the window unless you presently make the best of your way down stairs  throw me from the windowhell and furies exclaimed the captain i have confronted twenty crooked sabres at buda with my single rapier and shall a chittyfaced beggarly scots lordling speak of me and a window in the same breathstand off old pillory let me make scotch collops of himhe dies the death  for the love of heaven gentlemen exclaimed the old miser throwing himself between them do not break the peace on any consideration noble guest forbear the captainhe is a very hector of troytrusty hector forbear my guest he is like to prove a very achillesughugh   here he was interrupted by his asthma but nevertheless continued to interpose his person between colepepper who had unsheathed his whinyard and was making vain passes at his antagonist and nigel who had stepped back to take his sword and now held it undrawn in his left hand  make an end of this foolery you scoundrel said nigeldo you come hither to vent your noisy oaths and your bottledup valour on me you seem to know me and i am half ashamed to say i have at length been able to recollect youremember the garden behind the ordinaryyou dastardly ruffian and the speed with which fifty men saw you run from a drawn swordget you gone sir and do not put me to the vile labour of cudgelling such a cowardly rascal down stairs  the bullys countenance grew dark as night at this unexpected recognition for he had undoubtedly thought himself secure in his change of dress and his black patch from being discovered by a person who had seen him but once he set his teeth clenched his hands and it seemed as if he was seeking for a moments courage to fly upon his antagonist but his heart failed he sheathed his sword turned his back in gloomy silence and spoke not until he reached the door when turning round he said with a deep oath if i be not avenged of you for this insolence ere many days go by i would the gallows had my body and the devil my spirit  so saying and with a look where determined spite and malice made his features savagely fierce though they could not overcome his fear he turned and left the house nigel followed him as far as the gallery at the head of the staircase with the purpose of seeing him depart and ere he returned was met by mistress martha trapbois whom the noise of the quarrel had summoned from her own apartment he could not resist saying to her in his natural displeasurei would madam you could teach your father and his friends the lesson which you had the goodness to bestow on me this morning and prevail on them to leave me the unmolested privacy of my own apartment  if you came hither for quiet or retirement young man answered she you have been advised to an evil retreat you might seek mercy in the starchamber or holiness in hell with better success than quiet in alsatia but my father shall trouble you no longer  so saying she entered the apartment and fixing her eyes on the casket she said with emphasisif you display such a loadstone it will draw many a steel knife to your throat  while nigel hastily shut the casket she addressed her father upbraiding him with small reverence for keeping company with the cowardly hectoring murdering villain john colepepper  ay ay child said the old man with the cunning leer which intimated perfect satisfaction with his own superior addressi know i knowughbut ill crossbite himi know them all and i can manage themay ayi have the trick ontughugh  you manage father said the austere damsel you will manage to have your throat cut and that ere long you cannot hide from them your gains and your gold as formerly  my gains wench my gold said the usurer alackaday few of these and hard gotfew and hard got  this will not serve you father any longer said she and had not served you thus long but that bully colepepper had contrived a cheaper way of plundering your house even by means of my miserable selfbut why do i speak to him of all this she said checking herself and shrugging her shoulders with an expression of pity which did not fall much short of scorn he hears me nothe thinks not of meis it not strange that the love of gathering gold should survive the care to preserve both property and life  your father said lord glenvarloch who could not help respecting the strong sense and feeling shown by this poor woman even amidst all her rudeness and severity your father seems to have his faculties sufficiently alert when he is in the exercise of his ordinary pursuits and functions i wonder he is not sensible of the weight of your arguments  nature made him a man senseless of danger and that insensibility is the best thing i have derived from him said she age has left him shrewdness enough to tread his old beaten paths but not to seek new courses the old blind horse will long continue to go its rounds in the mill when it would stumble in the open meadow  daughterwhy wenchwhy housewife said the old man awakening out of some dream in which he had been sneering and chuckling in imagination probably over a successful piece of roguerygo to chamber wenchgo to chamberdraw bolts and chainlook sharp to doorlet none in or out but worshipful master grahamei must take my cloak and go to duke hildebroday ay time has been my own warrant was enough but the lower we lie the more are we under the wind  and with his wonted chorus of muttering and coughing the old man left the apartment his daughter stood for a moment looking after him with her usual expression of discontent and sorrow  you ought to persuade your father said nigel to leave this evil neighbourhood if you are in reality apprehensive for his safety  he would be safe in no other quarter said the daughter i would rather the old man were dead than publicly dishonoured in other quarters he would be pelted and pursued like an owl which ventures into sunshine here he was safe while his comrades could avail themselves of his talents he is now squeezed and fleeced by them on every pretence they consider him as a vessel on the strand from which each may snatch a prey and the very jealousy which they entertain respecting him as a common property may perhaps induce them to guard him from more private and daring assaults  still methinks you ought to leave this place answered nigel since you might find a safe retreat in some distant country  in scotland doubtless said she looking at him with a sharp and suspicious eye and enrich strangers with our rescued wealthha young man  madam if you knew me said lord glenvarloch you would spare the suspicion implied in your words  who shall assure me of that said martha sharply they say you are a brawler and a gamester and i know how far these are to be trusted by the unhappy  they do me wrong by heaven said lord glenvarloch  it may be so said martha i am little interested in the degree of your vice or your folly but it is plain that the one or the other has conducted you hither and that your best hope of peace safety and happiness is to be gone with the least possible delay from a place which is always a sty for swine and often a shambles so saying she left the apartment  there was something in the ungracious manner of this female amounting almost to contempt of him she spoke toan indignity to which glenvarloch notwithstanding his poverty had not as yet been personally exposed and which therefore gave him a transitory feeling of painful surprise neither did the dark hints which martha threw out concerning the danger of his place of refuge sound by any means agreeably to his ears the bravest man placed in a situation in which he is surrounded by suspicious persons and removed from all counsel and assistance except those afforded by a valiant heart and a strong arm experiences a sinking of the spirit a consciousness of abandonment which for a moment chills his blood and depresses his natural gallantry of disposition  but if sad reflections arose in nigels mind he had not time to indulge them and if he saw little prospect of finding friends in alsatia he found that he was not likely to be solitary for lack of visitors  he had scarcely paced his apartment for ten minutes endeavouring to arrange his ideas on the course which he was to pursue on quitting alsatia when he was interrupted by the sovereign of the quarter the great duke hildebrod himself before whose approach the bolts and chains of the misers dwelling fell or withdrew as of their own accord and both the folding leaves of the door were opened that he might roll himself into the house like a huge butt of liquor a vessel to which he bore a considerable outward resemblance both in size shape complexion and contents  goodmorrow to your lordship said the greasy puncheon cocking his single eye and rolling it upon nigel with a singular expression of familiar impudence whilst his grim bulldog which was close at his heels made a kind of gurgling in his throat as if saluting in similar fashion a starved cat the only living thing in trapbois house which we have not yet enumerated and which had flown up to the top of the tester where she stood clutching and grinning at the mastiff whose greeting she accepted with as much goodwill as nigel bestowed on that of the dogs master  peace belziedn thee peace said duke hildebrod beasts and fools will be meddling my lord  i thought sir answered nigel with as much haughtiness as was consistent with the cool distance which he desired to preserve i thought i had told you my name at present was nigel grahame  his eminence of whitefriars on this burst out into a loud  chuckling impudent laugh repeating the word till his voice was almost inarticulateniggle greenniggle greenniggle greenwhy my lord you would be queered in the drinking of a penny pot of malmsey if you cry before you are touched why you have told me the secret even now had i not had a shrewd guess of it before why master nigel since that is the word i only called you my lord because we made you a peer of alsatia last night when the sack was predominant  how you look nowha ha ha  nigel indeed conscious that he had unnecessarily betrayed himself replied hastilyhe was much obliged to him for the honours conferred but did not propose to remain in the sanctuary long enough to enjoy them  why that may be as you will an you will walk by wise counsel answered the ducal porpoise and although nigel remained standing in hopes to accelerate his guests departure he threw himself into one of the old tapestrybacked easychairs which cracked under his weight and began to call for old trapbois  the crone of all work appearing instead of her master the duke cursed her for a careless jade to let a strange gentleman and a brave guest go without his mornings draught  i never take one sir said glenvarloch  time to begintime to begin answered the dukehere you old refuse of sathan go to our palace and fetch lord greens morning draught let us seewhat shall it be my lorda humming double pot of ale with a roasted crab dancing in it like a wherry above bridge or humay young men are sweettootheda quart of burnt sack with sugar and spicegood against the fogs or what say you to sipping a gill of right distilled waters come we will have them all and you shall take your choicehere you jezebel let tim send the ale and the sack and the nipperkin of doubledistilled with a bit of diet loaf or some such trinket and score it to the new comer  glenvarloch bethinking himself that it might be as well to endure this fellows insolence for a brief season as to get into farther discreditable quarrels suffered him to take his own way without interruption only observing you make yourself at home sir in my apartment but for the time you may use your pleasure meanwhile i would fain know what has procured me the honour of this unexpected visit  you shall know that when old deb has brought the liquori never speak of business drylipped why how she drumblesi warrant she stops to take a sip on the road and then you will think you have had unchristian measurein the meanwhile look at that dog therelook belzebub in the face and tell me if you ever saw a sweeter beast never flew but at head in his life  and after this congenial panegyric he was proceeding with a tale of a dog and a bull which threatened to be somewhat of the longest when he was interrupted by the return of the old crone and two of his own tapsters bearing the various kinds of drinkables which he had demanded and which probably was the only species of interruption he would have endured with equanimity  when the cups and cans were duly arranged upon the table and when deborah whom the ducal generosity honoured with a penny farthing in the way of gratuity had withdrawn with her satellites the worthy potentate having first slightly invited lord glenvarloch to partake of the liquor which he was to pay for and after having observed that excepting three poached eggs a pint of bastard and a cup of clary he was fasting from every thing but sin set himself seriously to reinforce the radical moisture glenvarloch had seen scottish lairds and dutch burgomasters at their potations but their exploits though each might be termed a thirsty generation were nothing to those of duke hildebrod who seemed an absolute sandbed capable of absorbing any given quantity of liquid without being either vivified or overflowed he drank off the ale to quench a thirst which as he said kept him in a fever from morning to night and night to morning tippled off the sack to correct the crudity of the ale sent the spirits after the sack to keep all quiet and then declared that probably he should not taste liquor till post meridiem unless it was in compliment to some especial friend finally he intimated that he was ready to proceed on the business which brought him from home so early a proposition which nigel readily received though he could not help suspecting that the most important purpose of duke hildebrods visit was already transacted  in this however lord glenvarloch proved to be mistaken hildebrod before opening what he had to say made an accurate survey of the apartment laying from time to time his finger on his nose and winking on nigel with his single eye while he opened and shut the doors lifted the tapestry which concealed in one or two places the dilapidation of time upon the wainscoted walls peeped into closets and finally looked under the bed to assure himself that the coast was clear of listeners and interlopers he then resumed his seat and beckoned confidentially to nigel to draw his chair close to him  i am well as i am master hildebrod replied the young lord little disposed to encourage the familiarity which the man endeavoured to fix on him but the undismayed duke proceeded as follows  you shall pardon me my lordand i now give you the title right seriouslyif i remind you that our waters may be watched for though old trapbois be as deaf as saint pauls yet his daughter has sharp ears and sharp eyes enough and it is of them that it is my business to speak  say away then sir said nigel edging his chair somewhat closer to the quicksand although i cannot conceive what business i have either with mine host or his daughter  we will see that in the twinkling of a quartpot answered the gracious duke and first my lord you must not think to dance in a net before old jack hildebrod that has thrice your years oer his head and was born like king richard with all his eyeteeth ready cut  well sir go on said nigel  why then my lord i presume to say that if you are as i believe you are that lord glenvarloch whom all the world talk ofthe scotch gallant that has spent all to a thin cloak and a light pursebe not moved my lord it is so noised of youmen call you the sparrowhawk who will fly at allay were it in the very parkbe not moved my lord  i am ashamed sirrah replied glenvarloch that you should have power to move me by your insolencebut bewareand if you indeed guess who i am consider how long i may be able to endure your tone of insolent familiarity  i crave pardon my lord said hildebrod with a sullen yet apologetic look i meant no harm in speaking my poor mind i know not what honour there may be in being familiar with your lordship but i judge there is little safety for lowestoffe is laid up in lavender only for having shown you the way into alsatia and so what is to come of those who maintain you when you are here or whether they will get most honour or most trouble by doing so i leave with your lordships better judgment  i will bring no one into trouble on my account said lord glenvarloch i will leave whitefriars tomorrow nay by heaven i will leave it this day  you will have more wit in your anger i trust said duke hildebrod listen first to what i have to say to you and if honest jack hildebrod puts you not in the way of nicking them all may he never cast doublets or dull a greenhorn again and so my lord in plain words you must wap and win  your words must be still plainer before i can understand them said nigel  what the devila gamester one who deals with the devils bones and the doctors and not understand pedlars french nay then i must speak plain english and thats the simpletons tongue  speak then sir said nigel and i pray you be brief for i have little more time to bestow on you  well then my lord to be brief as you and the lawyers call iti understand you have an estate in the north which changes masters for want of the redeeming readyay you start but you cannot dance in a net before me as i said before and so the king runs the frowning humour on you and the court vapours you the goby and the prince scowls at you from under his cap and the favourite serves you out the puckered brow and the cold shoulder and the favourites favourite  to go no further sir interrupted nigel suppose all this true and what follows  what follows returned duke hildebrod marry this follows that you will owe good deed as well as good will to him who shall put you in the way to walk with your beaver cocked in the presence as an ye were earl of kildare bully the courtiers meet the princes blighting look with a bold brow confront the favourite baffle his deputy and   this is all well said nigel but how is it to be accomplished  by making thee a prince of peru my lord of the northern latitudes propping thine old castle with ingotsfertilizing thy failing fortunes with gold dustit shall but cost thee to put thy barons coronet for a day or so on the brows of an old caduca here the mans daughter of the house and thou art master of a mass of treasure that shall do all i have said for thee and  what you would have me marry this old gentlewoman here the daughter of mine host said nigel surprised and angry yet unable to suppress some desire to laugh  nay my lord i would have you marry fifty thousand good sterling pounds for that and better hath old trapbois hoarded and thou shall do a deed of mercy in it to the old man who will lose his golden smelts in some worse wayfor now that he is wellnigh past his day of work his day of payment is like to follow  truly this is a most courteous offer said lord glenvarloch but may i pray of your candour most noble duke to tell me why you dispose of a ward of so much wealth on a stranger like me who may leave you tomorrow  in sooth my lord said the duke that question smacks more of the wit of beaujeus ordinary than any word i have yet heard your lordship speak and reason it is you should be answered touching my peers it is but necessary to say that mistress martha trapbois will none of them whether clerical or laic the captain hath asked her so hath the parson but she will none of themshe looks higher than either and is to say truth a woman of sense and so forth too profound and of spirit something too high to put up with greasy buff or rusty prunella for ourselves we need but hint that we have a consort in the land of the living and what is more to purpose mrs martha knows it so as she will not lace her kersey hood save with a quality binding you my lord must be the man and must carry off fifty thousand decuses the spoils of five thousand bullies cutters and spendthriftsalways deducting from the main sum some five thousand pounds for our princely advice and countenance without which as matters stand in alsatia you would find it hard to win the plate  but has your wisdom considered sir replied glenvarloch how this wedlock can serve me in my present emergence  as for that my lord said duke hildebrod if with forty or fifty thousand pounds in your pouch you cannot save yourself you will deserve to lose your head for your folly and your hand for being closefisted  but since your goodness has taken my matters into such serious consideration continued nigel who conceived there was no prudence in breaking with a man who in his way meant him favour rather than offence perhaps you may be able to tell me how my kindred will be likely to receive such a bride as you recommend to me  touching that matter my lord i have always heard your countrymen knew as well as other folks on which side their bread was buttered and truly speaking from report i know no place where fifty thousand poundsfifty thousand pounds i saywill make a woman more welcome than it is likely to do in your ancient kingdom and truly saving the slight twist in her shoulder mrs martha trapbois is a person of very awful and majestic appearance and may for aught i know be come of better blood than any one wots of for old trapbois looks not over like to be her father and her mother was a generous liberal sort of a woman  i am afraid answered nigel that chance is rather too vague to assure her a gracious reception into an honourable house  why then my lord replied hildebrod i think it like she will be even with them for i will venture to say she has as much illnature as will make her a match for your whole clan  that may inconvenience me a little replied nigel  not a whitnot a whit said the duke fertile in expedients if she should become rather intolerable which is not unlikely your honourable house which i presume to be a castle hath doubtless both turrets and dungeons and ye may bestow your bonny bride in either the one or the other and then you know you will be out of hearing of her tongue and she will be either above or below the contempt of your friends  it is sagely counselled most equitable sir replied nigel and such restraint would be a fit meed for her folly that gave me any power over her  you entertain the project then my lord said duke hildebrod  i must turn it in my mind for twentyfour hours said nigel and i will pray you so to order matters that i be not further interrupted by any visitors  we will utter an edict to secure your privacy said the duke and you do not think he added lowering his voice to a confidential whisper that ten thousand is too much to pay to the sovereign in name of wardship  ten thousand said lord glenvarloch why you said five thousand but now  aha art avised of that said the duke touching the side of his nose with his finger nay if you have marked me so closely you are thinking on the case more nearly than i believed till you trapped me well well we will not quarrel about the consideration as old trapbois would call itdo you win and wear the dame it will be no hard matter with your face and figure and i will take care that no one interrupts you i will have an edict from the senate as soon as they meet for their meridiem  so saying duke hildebrod took his leave     chapter xxiv     this is the timeheavens maiden sentinel   hath quitted her high watchthe lesser spangles   are paling one by one give me the ladder   and the short leverbid anthony   keep with his carabine the wicketgate   and do thou bare thy knife and follow me   for we will in and do itdarkness like this   is dawning of our fortunes                            old play  when duke hildebrod had withdrawn nigels first impulse was an irresistible feeling to laugh at the sage adviser who would have thus connected him with age ugliness and illtemper but his next thought was pity for the unfortunate father and daughter who being the only persons possessed of wealth in this unhappy district seemed like a wreck on the seashore of a barbarous country only secured from plunder for the moment by the jealousy of the tribes among whom it had been cast neither could he help being conscious that his own residence here was upon conditions equally precarious and that he was considered by the alsatians in the same light of a godsend on the cornish coast or a sickly but wealthy caravan travelling through the wilds of africa and emphatically termed by the nations of despoilers through whose regions it passes dummalafong which signifies a thing given to be devoureda common prey to all men  nigel had already formed his own plan to extricate himself at whatever risk from his perilous and degrading situation and in order that he might carry it into instant execution he only awaited the return of lowestoffes messenger he expected him however in vain and could only amuse himself by looking through such parts of his baggage as had been sent to him from his former lodgings in order to select a small packet of the most necessary articles to take with him in the event of his quitting his lodgings secretly and suddenly as speed and privacy would he foresaw be particularly necessary if he meant to obtain an interview with the king which was the course his spirit and his interest alike determined him to pursue  while he was thus engaged he found greatly to his satisfaction that master lowestoffe had transmitted not only his rapier and poniard but a pair of pistols which he had used in travelling of a smaller and more convenient size than the large petronels or horse pistols which were then in common use as being made for wearing at the girdle or in the pockets next to having stout and friendly comrades a man is chiefly emboldened by finding himself well armed in case of need and nigel who had thought with some anxiety on the hazard of trusting his life if attacked to the protection of the clumsy weapon with which lowestoffe had equipped him in order to complete his disguise felt an emotion of confidence approaching to triumph as drawing his own good and welltried rapier he wiped it with his handkerchief examined its point bent it once or twice against the ground to prove its wellknown metal and finally replaced it in the scabbard the more hastily that he heard a tap at the door of his chamber and had no mind to be found vapouring in the apartment with his sword drawn  it was his old host who entered to tell him with many cringes that the price of his apartment was to be a crown per diem and that according to the custom of whitefriars the rent was always payable per advance although he never scrupled to let the money lie till a week or fortnight or even a month in the hands of any honourable guest like master grahame always upon some reasonable consideration for the use nigel got rid of the old dotards intrusion by throwing down two pieces of gold and requesting the accommodation of his present apartment for eight days adding however he did not think he should tarry so long  the miser with a sparkling eye and a trembling hand clutched fast the proffered coin and having balanced the pieces with exquisite pleasure on the extremity of his withered finger began almost instantly to show that not even the possession of gold can gratify for more than an instant the very heart that is most eager in the pursuit of it first the pieces might be lightwith hasty hand he drew a small pair of scales from his bosom and weighed them first together then separately and smiled with glee as he saw them attain the due depression in the balancea circumstance which might add to his profits if it were true as was currently reported that little of the gold coinage was current in alsatia in a perfect state and that none ever left the sanctuary in that condition  another fear then occurred to trouble the old misers pleasure he had been just able to comprehend that nigel intended to leave the friars sooner than the arrival of the term for which he had deposited the rent this might imply an expectation of refunding which as a scotch wag said of all species of funding jumped least with the old gentlemans humour he was beginning to enter a hypothetical caveat on this subject and to quote several reasons why no part of the money once consigned as roomrent could be repaid back on any pretence without great hardship to the landlord when nigel growing impatient told him that the money was his absolutely and without any intention on his part of resuming any of itall he asked in return was the liberty of enjoying in private the apartment he had paid for old trapbois who had still at his tongues end much of the smooth language by which in his time he had hastened the ruin of many a young spendthrift began to launch out upon the noble and generous disposition of his new guest until nigel growing impatient took the old gentleman by the hand and gently yet irresistibly leading him to the door of the chamber put him out but with such decent and moderate exertion of his superior strength as to render the action in no shape indecorous and fastening the door began to do that for his pistols which he had done for his favourite sword examining with care the flints and locks and reviewing the state of his small provision of ammunition  in this operation he was a second time interrupted by a knocking at the doorhe called upon the person to enter having no doubt that it was lowestoffes messenger at length arrived it was however the ungracious daughter of old trapbois who muttering something about her fathers mistake laid down upon the table one of the pieces of gold which nigel had just given to him saying that what she retained was the full rent for the term he had specified nigel replied he had paid the money and had no desire to receive it again  do as you will with it then replied his hostess for there it lies and shall lie for me if you are fool enough to pay more than is reason my father shall not be knave enough to take it  but your father mistress said nigel your father told me  oh my father my father said she interrupting himmy father managed these affairs while he was ablei manage them now and that may in the long run be as well for both of us  she then looked on the table and observed the weapons  you have arms i see she said do you know how to use them  i should do so mistress replied nigel for it has been my occupation  you are a soldier then she demanded  no farther as yet than as every gentleman of my country is a soldier  ay that is your point of honourto cut the throats of the poora proper gentlemanlike occupation for those who should protect them  i do not deal in cutting throats mistress replied nigel but i carry arms to defend myself and my country if it needs me  ay replied martha it is fairly worded but men say you are as prompt as others in petty brawls where neither your safety nor your country is in hazard and that had it not been so you would not have been in the sanctuary today  mistress returned nigel i should labour in vain to make you understand that a mans honour which is or should be dearer to him than his life may often call on and compel us to hazard our own lives or those of others on what would otherwise seem trifling contingencies  gods law says nought of that said the female i have only read there that thou shall not kill but i have neither time nor inclination to preach to youyou will find enough of fighting here if you like it and well if it come not to seek you when you are least prepared farewell for the presentthe charwoman will execute your commands for your meals  she left the room just as nigel provoked at her assuming a superior tone of judgment and of censure was about to be so superfluous as to enter into a dispute with an old pawnbrokers daughter on the subject of the point of honour he smiled at himself for the folly into which the spirit of selfvindication had so nearly hurried him  lord glenvarloch then applied to old deborah the charwoman by whose intermediation he was provided with a tolerably decent dinner and the only embarrassment which he experienced was from the almost forcible entry of the old dotard his landlord who insisted upon giving his assistance at laying the cloth nigel had some difficulty to prevent him from displacing his arms and some papers which were lying on a small table at which he had been sitting and nothing short of a stern and positive injunction to the contrary could compel him to use another board though there were two in the room for the purpose of laying the cloth  having at length obliged him to relinquish his purpose he could not help observing that the eyes of the old dotard seemed still anxiously fixed upon the small table on which lay his sword and pistols and that amidst all the little duties which he seemed officiously anxious to render to his guest he took every opportunity of looking towards and approaching these objects of his attention at length when trapbois thought he had completely avoided the notice of his guest nigel through the observation of one of the cracked mirrors oh which channel of communication the old man had not calculated beheld him actually extend his hand towards the table in question he thought it unnecessary to use further ceremony but telling his landlord in a stern voice that he permitted no one to touch his arms he commanded him to leave the apartment the old usurer commenced a maundering sort of apology in which all that nigel distinctly apprehended was a frequent repetition of the word consideration and which did not seem to him to require any other answer than a reiteration of his command to him to leave the apartment upon pain of worse consequences  the ancient hebe who acted as lord glenvarlochs cupbearer took his part against the intrusion of the still more antiquated ganymede and insisted on old trapbois leaving the room instantly menacing him at the same time with her mistresss displeasure if he remained there any longer the old man seemed more under petticoat government than any other for the threat of the charwoman produced greater effect upon him than the more formidable displeasure of nigel he withdrew grumbling and muttering and lord glenvarloch heard him bar a large door at the nearer end of the gallery which served as a division betwixt the other parts of the extensive mansion and the apartment occupied by his guest which as the reader is aware had its access from the landingplace at the head of the grand staircase  nigel accepted the careful sound of the bolts and bars as they were severally drawn by the trembling hand of old trapbois as an omen that the senior did not mean again to revisit him in the course of the evening and heartily rejoiced that he was at length to be left to uninterrupted solitude  the old woman asked if there was aught else to be done for his accommodation and indeed it had hitherto seemed as if the pleasure of serving him or more properly the reward which she expected had renewed her youth and activity nigel desired to have candles to have a fire lighted in his apartment and a few fagots placed beside it that he might feed it from time to time as he began to feel the chilly effects of the damp and low situation of the house close as it was to the thames but while the old woman was absent upon his errand he began to think in what way he should pass the long solitary evening with which he was threatened  his own reflections promised to nigel little amusement and less applause he had considered his own perilous situation in every light in which it could be viewed and foresaw as little utility as comfort in resuming the survey to divert the current of his ideas books were of course the readiest resource and although like most of us nigel had in his time sauntered through large libraries and even spent a long time there without greatly disturbing their learned contents he was now in a situation where the possession of a volume even of very inferior merit becomes a real treasure the old housewife returned shortly afterwards with fagots and some pieces of halfburnt waxcandles the perquisites probably real or usurped of some experienced groom of the chambers two of which she placed in large brass candlesticks of different shapes and patterns and laid the others on the table that nigel might renew them from time to time as they burnt to the socket she heard with interest lord glenvarlochs request to have a bookany sort of bookto pass away the night withal and returned for answer that she knew of no other books in the house than her young mistresss as she always denominated mistress martha trapbois bible which the owner would not lend and her masters whetstone of witte being the second part of arithmetic by robert record with the cossike practice and rule of equation which promising volume nigel declined to borrow she offered however to bring him some books from duke hildebrodwho sometimes good gentleman gave a glance at a book when the state affairs of alsatia left him as much leisure  nigfil embraced the proposal and his unwearied iris scuttled away on this second embassy she returned in a short time with a tattered quarto volume under her arm and a bottle of sack in her hand for the duke judging that mere reading was dry work had sent the wine by way of sauce to help it down not forgetting to add the price to the mornings score which he had already run up against the stranger in the sanctuary  nigel seized on the book and did not refuse the wine thinking that a glass or two as it really proved to be of good quality would be no bad interlude to his studies he dismissed with thanks and assurance of reward the poor old drudge who had been so zealous in his service trimmed his fire and candles and placed the easiest of the old arm chairs in a convenient posture betwixt the fire and the table at which he had dined and which now supported the measure of sack and the lights and thus accompanying his studies with such luxurious appliances as were in his power he began to examine the only volume with which the ducal library of alsatia had been able to supply him  the contents though of a kind generally interesting were not well calculated to dispel the gloom by which he was surrounded the book was entitled gods revenge against murther not as the bibliomaniacal reader may easily conjecture the work which reynolds published under that imposing name but one of a much earlier date printed and sold by old wolfe and which could a copy now be found would sell for much more than its weight in goldfootnote only three copies are known to exist one in the library at kennaquhair and two one foxed and cropped the other tall and in good conditionboth in the possession of an eminent member of the roxburghe clubnote by captain clutterbuck nigel had soon enough of the doleful tales which the book contains and attempted one or two other modes of killing the evening he looked out at window but the night was rainy with gusts of wind he tried to coax the fire but the fagots were green and smoked without burning and as he was naturally temperate he felt his blood somewhat heated by the canary sack which he had already drank and had no farther inclination to that pastime he next attempted to compose a memorial addressed to the king in which he set forth his case and his grievances but speedily stung with the idea that his supplication would be treated with scorn he flung the scroll into the fire and in a sort of desperation resumed the book which he had laid aside  nigel became more interested in the volume at the second than at the first attempt which he made to peruse it the narratives strange and shocking as they were to human feeling possessed yet the interest of sorcery or of fascination which rivets the attention by its awakening horrors much was told of the strange and horrible acts of blood by which men setting nature and humanity alike at defiance had for the thirst of revenge the lust of gold or the cravings of irregular ambition broken into the tabernacle of life yet more surprising and mysterious tales were recounted of the mode in which such deeds of blood had come to be discovered and revenged animals irrational animals had told the secret and birds of the air had carried the matter the elements had seemed to betray the deed which had polluted themearth had ceased to support the murderers steps fire to warm his frozen limbs water to refresh his parched lips air to relieve his gasping lungs all in short bore evidence to the homicides guilt in other circumstances the criminals own awakened conscience pursued and brought him to justice and in some narratives the grave was said to have yawned that the ghost of the sufferer might call for revenge  it was now wearing late in the night and the book was still in nigels hands when the tapestry which hung behind him flapped against the wall and the wind produced by its motion waved the flame of the candles by which he was reading nigel started and turned round in that excited and irritated state of mind which arose from the nature of his studies especially at a period when a certain degree of superstition was inculcated as a point of religious faith it was not without emotion that he saw the bloodless countenance meagre form and ghastly aspect of old trapbois once more in the very act of extending his withered hand towards the table which supported his arms convinced by this untimely apparition that something evil was meditated towards him nigel sprung up seized his sword drew it and placing it at the old mans breast demanded of him what he did in his apartment at so untimely an hour trapbois showed neither fear nor surprise and only answered by some imperfect expressions intimating he would part with his life rather than with his property and lord glenvarloch strangely embarrassed knew not what to think of the intruders motives and still less how to get rid of him as he again tried the means of intimidation he was surprised by a second apparition from behind the tapestry in the person of the daughter of trapbois bearing a lamp in her hand she also seemed to possess her fathers insensibility to danger for coming close to nigel she pushed aside impetuously his naked sword and even attempted to take it out of his hand  for shame she said your sword on a man of eighty years and more this the honour of a scottish gentlemangive it to me to make a spindle of  stand back said nigel i mean your father no injurybut i will know what has caused him to prowl this whole day and even at this late hour of night around my arms  your arms repeated she alas young man the whole arms in the tower of london are of little value to him in comparison of this miserable piece of gold which i left this morning on the table of a young spendthrift too careless to put what belonged to him into his own purse  so saying she showed the piece of gold which still remaining on the table where she left it had been the bait that attracted old trapbois so frequently to the spot and which even in the silence of the night had so dwelt on his imagination that he had made use of a private passage long disused to enter his guests apartment in order to possess himself of the treasure during his slumbers he now exclaimed at the highest tones of his cracked and feeble voice  it is mineit is minehe gave it to me for a considerationi will die ere i part with my property  it is indeed his own mistress said nigel and i do entreat you to restore it to the person on whom i have bestowed it and let me have my apartment in quiet  i will account with you for it thensaid the maiden reluctantly giving to her father the morsel of mammon on which he darted as if his bony fingers had been the talons of a hawk seizing its prey and then making a contented muttering and mumbling like an old dog after he has been fed and just when he is wheeling himself thrice round for the purpose of lying down he followed his daughter behind the tapestry through a little slidingdoor which was perceived when the hangings were drawn apart  this shall be properly fastened tomorrow said the daughter to nigel speaking in such a tone that her father deaf and engrossed by his acquisition could not hear her tonight i will continue to watch him closelyi wish you good repose  these few words pronounced in a tone of more civility than she had yet made use of towards her lodger contained a wish which was not to be accomplished although her guest presently after her departure retired to bed  there was a slight fever in nigels blood occasioned by the various events of the evening which put him as the phrase is beside his rest perplexing and painful thoughts rolled on his mind like a troubled stream and the more he laboured to lull himself to slumber the farther he seemed from attaining his object he tried all the resources common in such cases kept counting from one to a thousand until his head was giddyhe watched the embers of the wood fire till his eyes were dazzledhe listened to the dull moaning of the wind the swinging and creaking of signs which projected from the houses and the baying of here and there a homeless dog till his very ear was weary  suddenly however amid this monotony came a sound which startled him at once it was a female shriek he sat up in his bed to listen then remembered he was in alsatia where brawls of every sort were current among the unruly inhabitants but another scream and another and another succeeded so close that he was certain though the noise was remote and sounded stifled it must be in the same house with himself  nigel jumped up hastily put on a part of his clothes seized his sword and pistols and ran to the door of his chamber here he plainly heard the screams redoubled and as he thought the sounds came from the usurers apartment all access to the gallery was effectually excluded by the intermediate door which the brave young lord shook with eager but vain impatience but the secret passage occurred suddenly to his recollection he hastened back to his room and succeeded with some difficulty in lighting a candle powerfully agitated by hearing the cries repeated yet still more afraid lest they should sink into silence  he rushed along the narrow and winding entrance guided by the noise which now burst more wildly on his ear and while he descended a narrow staircase which terminated the passage he heard the stifled voices of men encouraging as it seemed each other dn her strike her downsilence herbeat her brains outwhile the voice of his hostess though now almost exhausted was repeating the cry of murder and help at the bottom of the staircase was a small door which gave way before nigel as he precipitated himself upon the scene of actiona cocked pistol in one hand a candle in the other and his naked sword under his arm  two ruffians had with great difficulty overpowered or rather were on the point of overpowering the daughter of trapbois whose resistance appeared to have been most desperate for the floor was covered with fragments of her clothes and handfuls of her hair it appeared that her life was about to be the price of her defence for one villain had drawn a long claspknife when they were surprised by the entrance of nigel who as they turned towards him shot the fellow with the knife dead on the spot and when the other advanced to him hurled the candlestick at his head and then attacked him with his sword it was dark save some pale moonlight from the window and the ruffian after firing a pistol without effect and fighting a traverse or two with his sword lost heart made for the window leaped over it and escaped nigel fired his remaining pistol after him at a venture and then called for light  there is light in the kitchen answered martha trapbois with more presence of mind than could have been expected stay you know not the way i will fetch it myselfoh my fathermy poor fatheri knew it would come to thisand all along of the accursed goldthey have murdered him     chapter xxv     death finds us mid our playthingssnatches us   as a cross nurse might do a wayward child   from all our toys and baubles his rough call   unlooses all our favourite ties on earth   and well if they are such as may be answerd   in yonder world where all is judged of truly                                    old play  it was a ghastly scene which opened upon martha trapboiss return with a light her own haggard and austere features were exaggerated by all the desperation of grief fear and passionbut the latter was predominant on the floor lay the body of the robber who had expired without a groan while his blood flowing plentifully had crimsoned all around another body lay also there on which the unfortunate woman precipitated herself in agony for it was that of her unhappy father in the next moment she started up and exclaimingthere may be life yet strove to raise the body nigel went to her assistance but not without a glance at the open window which martha as acute as if undisturbed either by passion or terror failed not to interpret justly  fear not she cried fear not they are base cowards to whom courage is as much unknown as mercy if i had had weapons i could have defended myself against them without assistance or protection oh my poor father protection comes too late for this cold and stiff corpsehe is deaddead  while she spoke they were attempting to raise the dead body of the old miser but it was evident even from the feeling of the inactive weight and rigid joints that life had forsaken her station nigel looked for a wound but saw none the daughter of the deceased with more presence of mind than a daughter could at the time have been supposed capable of exerting discovered the instrument of his murder a sort of scarf which had been drawn so tight round his throat as to stifle his cries for assistance in the first instance and afterwards to extinguish life  she undid the fatal noose and laying the old mans body in the arms of lord glenvarloch she ran for water for spirits for essences in the vain hope that life might be only suspended that hope proved indeed vain she chafed his temples raised his head loosened his nightgown for it seemed as if he had arisen from bed upon hearing the entrance of the villains and finally opened with difficulty his fixed and closelyclenched hands from one of which dropped a key from the other the very piece of gold about which the unhappy man had been a little before so anxious and which probably in the impaired state of his mental faculties he was disposed to defend with as desperate energy as if its amount had been necessary to his actual existence  it is in vainit is in vain said the daughter desisting from her fruitless attempts to recall the spirit which had been effectually dislodged for the neck had been twisted by the violence of the murderers it is in vainhe is murderedi always knew it would be thus and now i witness it  she then snatched up the key and the piece of money but it was only to dash them again on the floor as she exclaimed accursed be ye both for you are the causes of this deed  nigel would have spokenwould have reminded her that measures should be instantly taken for the pursuit of the murderer who had escaped as well as for her own security against his return but she interrupted him sharply  be silent she said be silent think you the thoughts of my own heart are not enough to distract me and with such a sight as this before me i say be silent she said again and in a yet sterner tonecan a daughter listen and her fathers murdered corpse lying on her knees  lord glenvarloch however overpowered by the energy of her grief felt not the less the embarrassment of his own situation he had discharged both his pistolsthe robber might returnhe had probably other assistants besides the man who had fallen and it seemed to him indeed as if he had heard a muttering beneath the windows he explained hastily to his companion the necessity of procuring ammunition  you are right she said somewhat contemptuously and have ventured already more than ever i expected of man go and shift for yourself since that is your purposeleave me to my fate  without stopping for needless expostulation nigel hastened to his own room through the secret passage furnished himself with the ammunition he sought for and returned with the same celerity wondering himself at the accuracy with which he achieved in the dark all the meanderings of the passage which he had traversed only once and that in a moment of such violent agitation  he found on his return the unfortunate woman standing like a statue by the body of her father which she had laid straight on the floor having covered the face with the skirt of his gown she testified neither surprise nor pleasure at nigels return but said to him calmlymy moan is mademy sorrowall the sorrow at least that man shall ever have noting of is gone past but i will have justice and the base villain who murdered this poor defenceless old man when he had not by the course of nature a twelvemonths life in him shall not cumber the earth long after him stranger whom heaven has sent to forward the revenge reserved for this action go to hildebrodsthere they are awake all night in their revelsbid him come hitherhe is bound by his duty and dare not and shall not refuse his assistance which he knows well i can reward why do ye tarrygo instantly i would said nigel but i am fearful of leaving you alone the villains may return and  true most true answered martha he may return and though i care little for his murdering me he may possess himself of what has most tempted him keep this key and this piece of gold they are both of importancedefend your life if assailed and if you kill the villain i will make you rich i go myself to call for aid  nigel would have remonstrated with her but she had departed and in a moment he heard the housedoor clank behind her for an instant he thought of following her but upon recollection that the distance was but short betwixt the tavern of hildebrod and the house of trapbois he concluded that she knew it better than heincurred little danger in passing it and that he would do well in the meanwhile to remain on the watch as she recommended  it was no pleasant situation for one unused to such scenes to remain in the apartment with two dead bodies recently those of living and breathing men who had both within the space of less than half an hour suffered violent death one of them by the hand of the assassin the other whose blood still continued to flow from the wound in his throat and to flood all around him by the spectators own deed of violence though of justice he turned his face from those wretched relics of mortality with a feeling of disgust mingled with superstition and he found when he had done so that the consciousness of the presence of these ghastly objects though unseen by him rendered him more uncomfortable than even when he had his eyes fixed upon and reflected by the cold staring lifeless eyeballs of the deceased fancy also played her usual sport with him he now thought he heard the wellworn damask nightgown of the deceased usurer rustle anon that he heard the slaughtered bravo draw up his leg the boot scratching the floor as if he was about to rise and again he deemed he heard the footsteps and the whisper of the returned ruffian under the window from which he had lately escaped to face the last and most real danger and to parry the terrors which the other class of feelings were like to impress upon him nigel went to the window and was much cheered to observe the light of several torches illuminating the street and followed as the murmur of voices denoted by a number of persons armed it would seem with firelocks and halberds and attendant on hildebrod who not in his fantastic office of duke but in that which he really possessed of bailiff of the liberty and sanctuary of whitefriars was on his way to inquire into the crime and its circumstances  it was a strange and melancholy contrast to see these debauchees disturbed in the very depth of their midnight revel on their arrival at such a scene as this they stared on each other and on the bloody work before them with lacklustre eyes staggered with uncertain steps over boards slippery with blood their noisy brawling voices sunk into stammering whispers and with spirits quelled by what they saw while their brains were still stupefied by the liquor which they had drunk they seemed like men walking in their sleep  old hildebrod was an exception to the general condition that seasoned cask however full was at all times capable of motion when there occurred a motive sufficiently strong to set him arolling he seemed much shocked at what he beheld and his proceedings in consequence had more in them of regularity and propriety than he might have been supposed capable of exhibiting upon any occasion whatever the daughter was first examined and stated with wonderful accuracy and distinctness the manner in which she had been alarmed with a noise of struggling and violence in her fathers apartment and that the more readily because she was watching him on account of some alarm concerning his health on her entrance she had seen her father sinking under the strength of two men upon whom she rushed with all the fury she was capable of as their faces were blackened and their figures disguised she could not pretend in the hurry of a moment so dreadfully agitating to distinguish either of them as persons whom she had seen before she remembered little more except the firing of shots until she found herself alone with her guest and saw that the ruffians had escaped lord glenvarloch told his story as we have given it to the reader the direct evidence thus received hildebrod examined the premises he found that the villains had made their entrance by the window out of which the survivor had made his escape yet it seemed singular that they should have done so as it was secured with strong iron bars which old trapbois was in the habit of shutting with his own hand at nightfall he minuted down with great accuracy the state of every thing in the apartment and examined carefully the features of the slain robber he was dressed like a seaman of the lowest order but his face was known to none present hildebrod next sent for an alsatian surgeon whose vices undoing what his skill might have done for him had consigned him to the wretched practice of this place he made him examine the dead bodies and make a proper declaration of the manner in which the sufferers seemed to have come by their end the circumstances of the sash did not escape the learned judge and having listened to all that could be heard or conjectured on the subject and collected all particulars of evidence which appeared to bear on the bloody transaction he commanded the door of the apartment to be locked until next morning and carrying the unfortunate daughter of the murdered man into the kitchen where there was no one in presence but lord glenvarloch he asked her gravely whether she suspected no one in particular of having committed the deed  do you suspect no one answered martha looking fixedly on him  perhaps i may mistress but it is my part to ask questions yours to answer them thats the rule of the game  then i suspect him who wore yonder sash do not you know whom i mean  why if you call on me for honours i must needs say i have seen captain peppercull have one of such a fashion and he was not a man to change his suits often  send out then said martha and have him apprehended  if it is he he will be far by this time but i will communicate with the higher powers answered the judge  you would have him escape resumed she fixing her eyes on him sternly  by cock and pie replied hildebrod did it depend on me the murdering cutthroat should hang as high as ever haman didbut let me take my time he has friends among us that you wot well and all that should assist me are as drunk as fiddlers  i will have revengei will have it repeated she and take heed you trifle not with me  trifle i would sooner trifle with a shebear the minute after they had baited her i tell you mistress be but patient and we will have him i know all his haunts and he cannot forbear them long and i will have trapdoors open for him you cannot want justice mistress for you have the means to get it  they who help me in my revenge said martha shall share those means  enough said replied hildebrod and now i would have you go to my house and get something hotyou will be but dreary here by yourself  i will send for the old charwoman replied martha and we have the stranger gentleman besides  umph umphthe stranger gentleman said hildebrod to nigel whom he drew a little apart i fancy the captain has made the stranger gentlemans fortune when he was making a bold dash for his own i can tell your honouri must not say lordshipthat i think my having chanced to give the greasy buffandiron scoundrel some hint of what i recommended to you today has put him on this rough game the better for youyou will get the cash without the fatherinlawyou will keep conditions i trust  i wish you had said nothing to any one of a scheme so absurd said nigel  absurdwhy think you she will not have thee take her with the tear in her eye mantake her with the tear in her eye let me hear from you tomorrow goodnight goodnighta nod is as good as a wink i must to my business of sealing and locking up by the way this horrid work has put all out of my headhere is a fellow from mr lowestoffe has been asking to see you as he said his business was express the senate only made him drink a couple of flagons and he was just coming to beat up your quarters when this breeze blew up ahey friend there is master nigel grahame  a young man dressed in a green plush jerkin with a badge on the sleeve and having the appearance of a waterman approached and took nigel aside while duke hildebrod went from place to place to exercise his authority and to see the windows fastened and the doors of the apartment locked up the news communicated by lowestoffes messenger were not the most pleasant they were intimated in a courteous whisper to nigel to the following effectthat master lowestoffe prayed him to consult his safety by instantly leaving whitefriars for that a warrant from the lord chiefjustice had been issued out for apprehending him and would be put in force tomorrow by the assistance of a party of musketeers a force which the alsatians neither would nor dared to resist  and so squire said the aquatic emissary my wherry is to wait you at the temple stairs yonder at five this morning and if you would give the bloodhounds the slip why you may  why did not master lowestoffe write to me said nigel  alas the good gentleman lies up in lavender for it himself and has as little to do with pen and ink as if he were a parson  did he send any token to me said nigel  tokenay marry did hetoken enough an i have not forgot it said the fellow then giving a hoist to the waistband of his breeches he said ay i have ityou were to believe me because your name was written with an o for grahame ay that was it i thinkwell shall we meet in two hours when tide turns and go down the river like a twelveoared barge  where is the king just now knowest thou answered lord glenvarloch  the king why he went down to greenwich yesterday by water like a noble sovereign as he is who will always float where he can he was to have hunted this week but that purpose is broken they say and the prince and the duke and all of them at greenwich are as merry as minnows  well replied nigel i will be ready to go at five do thou come hither to carry my baggage  ay ay master replied the fellow and left the house mixing himself with the disorderly attendants of duke hildebrod who were now retiring that potentate entreated nigel to make fast the doors behind him and pointing to the female who sat by the expiring fire with her limbs outstretched like one whom the hand of death had already arrested he whispered mind your hits and mind your bargain or i will cut your bowstring for you before you can draw it  feeling deeply the ineffable brutality which could recommend the prosecuting such views over a wretch in such a condition lord glenvarloch yet commanded his temper so far as to receive the advice in silence and attend to the former part of it by barring the door carefully behind duke hildebrod and his suite with the tacit hope that he should never again see or hear of them he then returned to the kitchen in which the unhappy woman remained her hands still clenched her eyes fixed and her limbs extended like those of a person in a trance much moved by her situation and with the prospect which lay before her he endeavoured to awaken her to existence by every means in his power and at length apparently succeeded in dispelling her stupor and attracting her attention he then explained to her that he was in the act of leaving whitefriars in a few hours that his future destination was uncertain but that he desired anxiously to know whether he could contribute to her protection by apprizing any friend of her situation or otherwise with some difficulty she seemed to comprehend his meaning and thanked him with her usual short ungracious manner he might mean well she said but he ought to know that the miserable had no friends  nigel said he would not willingly be importunate but as he was about to leave the friars she interrupted him  you are about to leave the friars i will go with you  you go with me exclaimed lord glenvarloch  yes she said i will persuade my father to leave this murdering den but as she spoke the more perfect recollection of what had passed crowded on her mind she hid her face in her hands and burst out into a dreadful fit of sobs moans and lamentations which terminated in hysterics violent in proportion to the uncommon strength of her body and mind  lord glenvarloch shocked confused and inexperienced was about to leave the house in quest of medical or at least female assistance but the patient when the paroxysm had somewhat spent its force held him fast by the sleeve with one hand covering her face with the other while a copious flood of tears came to relieve the emotions of grief by which she had been so violently agitated  do not leave me she saiddo not leave me and call no one i have never been in this way before and would not now she said sitting upright and wiping her eyes with her apronwould not nowbut thatbut that he loved me if he loved nothing else that was human to die so and by such hands  and again the unhappy woman gave way to a paroxysm of sorrow mingling her tears with sobbing wailing and all the abandonment of female grief when at its utmost height at length she gradually recovered the austerity of her natural composure and maintained it as if by a forcible exertion of resolution repelling as she spoke the repeated returns of the hysterical affection by such an effort as that by which epileptic patients are known to suspend the recurrence of their fits yet her mind however resolved could not so absolutely overcome the affection of her nerves but that she was agitated by strong fits of trembling which for a minute or two at a time shook her whole frame in a manner frightful to witness nigel forgot his own situation and indeed every thing else in the interest inspired by the unhappy woman before himan interest which affected a proud spirit the more deeply that she herself with correspondent highness of mind seemed determined to owe as little as possible either to the humanity or the pity of others  i am not wont to be in this way she saidbutbutnature will have power over the frail beings it has made over you sir i have some right for without you i had not survived this awful night i wish your aid had been either earlier or laterbut you have saved my life and you are bound to assist in making it endurable to me  if you will show me how it is possible answered nigel  you are going hence you say instantlycarry me with you said the unhappy woman by my own efforts i shall never escape from this wilderness of guilt and misery  alas what can i do for you replied nigel my own way and i must not deviate from it leads me in all probability to a dungeon i might indeed transport you from hence with me if you could afterwards bestow yourself with any friend  friend she exclaimedi have no friendthey have long since discarded us a spectre arising from the dead were more welcome than i should be at the doors of those who have disclaimed us and if they were willing to restore their friendship to me now i would despise it because they withdrew it from himfrom himhere she underwent strong but suppressed agitation and then added firmlyfrom him who lies yonderi have no friend here she paused and then suddenly as if recollecting herself added i have no friend but i have that will purchase manyi have that which will purchase both friends and avengersit is well thought of i must not leave it for a prey to cheats and ruffiansstranger you must return to yonder room pass through it boldly to histhat is to the sleeping apartment push the bedstead aside beneath each of the posts is a brass plate as if to support the weight but it is that upon the left nearest to the wall which must serve your turnpress the corner of the plate and it will spring up and show a keyhole which this key will open you will then lift a concealed trapdoor and in a cavity of the floor you will discover a small chest bring it hither it shall accompany our journey and it will be hard if the contents cannot purchase me a place of refuge  but the door communicating with the kitchen has been locked by these people said nigel  true i had forgot they had their reasons for that doubtless answered she but the secret passage from your apartment is open and you may go that way  lord glenvarloch took the key and as he lighted a lamp to show him the way she read in his countenance some unwillingness to the task imposed  you fear said shethere is no cause the murderer and his victim are both at rest take courage i will go with you myselfyou cannot know the trick of the spring and the chest will be too heavy for you  no fear no fear answered lord glenvarloch ashamed of the construction she put upon a momentary hesitation arising from a dislike to look upon what is horrible often connected with those highwrought minds which are the last to fear what is merely dangerousi will do your errand as you desire but for you you must notcannot go yonder  i cani will she said i am composed you shall see that i am so she took from the table a piece of unfinished sewingwork and with steadiness and composure passed a silken thread into the eye of a fine needlecould i have done that she said with a smile yet more ghastly than her previous look of fixed despair had not my heart and hand been both steady  she then led the way rapidly up stairs to nigels chamber and proceeded through the secret passage with the same haste as if she had feared her resolution might have failed her ere her purpose was executed at the bottom of the stairs she paused a moment before entering the fatal apartment then hurried through with a rapid step to the sleeping chamber beyond followed closely by lord glenvarloch whose reluctance to approach the scene of butchery was altogether lost in the anxiety which he felt on account of the survivor of the tragedy  her first action was to pull aside the curtains of her fathers bed the bedclothes were thrown aside in confusion doubtless in the action of his starting from sleep to oppose the entrance of the villains into the next apartment the hard mattress scarcely showed the slight pressure where the emaciated body of the old miser had been deposited his daughter sank beside the bed clasped her hands and prayed to heaven in a short and affectionate manner for support in her affliction and for vengeance on the villains who had made her fatherless a lowmuttered and still more brief petition recommended to heaven the soul of the sufferer and invoked pardon for his sins in virtue of the great christian atonement  this duty of piety performed she signed to nigel to aid her and having pushed aside the heavy bedstead they saw the brass plate which martha had described she pressed the spring and at once the plate starting up showed the keyhole and a large iron ring used in lifting the trapdoor which when raised displayed the strong box or small chest she had mentioned and which proved indeed so very weighty that it might perhaps have been scarcely possible for nigel though a very strong man to have raised it without assistance  having replaced everything as they had found it nigel with such help as his companion was able to afford assumed his load and made a shift to carry it into the next apartment where lay the miserable owner insensible to sounds and circumstances which if any thing could have broken his long last slumber would certainly have done so his unfortunate daughter went up to his body and had even the courage to remove the sheet which had been decently disposed over it she put her hand on the heart but there was no throbheld a feather to the lips but there was no motionthen kissed with deep reverence the starting veins of the pale forehead and then the emaciated hand  i would you could hear me she saidfather i would you could hear me swear that if i now save what you most valued on earth it is only to assist me in obtaining vengeance for your death  she replaced the covering and without a tear a sigh or an additional word of any kind renewed her efforts until they conveyed the strongbox betwixt them into lord glenvarlochs sleeping apartment it must pass she said as part of your baggage i will be in readiness so soon as the waterman calls  she retired and lord glenvarloch who saw the hour of their departure approach tore down a part of the old hanging to make a covering which he corded upon the trunk lest the peculiarity of its shape and the care with which it was banded and counterbanded with bars of steel might afford suspicions respecting the treasure which it contained having taken this measure of precaution he changed the rascally disguise which he had assumed on entering whitefriars into a suit becoming his quality and then unable to sleep though exhausted with the events of the night he threw himself on his bed to await the summons of the waterman     chapter xxvi     give us good voyage gentle streamwe stun not   thy sober ear with sounds of revelry   wake not the slumbering echoes of thy banks   with voice of flute and hornwe do but seek   on the broad pathway of thy swelling bosom   to glide in silent safety                              the double bridal  grey or rather yellow light was beginning to twinkle through the fogs of whitefriars when a low tap at the door of the unhappy miser announced to lord glenvarloch the summons of the boatman he found at the door the man whom he had seen the night before with a companion  come come master let us get afloat said one of them in a rough impressive whisper time and tide wait for no man they shall not wait for me said lord glenvarloch but i have some things to carry with me  ay ayno man will take a pair of oars now jack unless he means to load the wherry like a sixhorse waggon when they dont want to shift the whole kitt they take a sculler and be dd to them come come where be your rattletraps  one of the men was soon sufficiently loaded in his own estimation at least with lord glenvarlochs mail and its accompaniments with which burden he began to trudge towards the temple stairs his comrade who seemed the principal began to handle the trunk which contained the misers treasure but pitched it down again in an instant declaring with a great oath that it was as reasonable to expect a man to carry pauls on his back the daughter of trapbois who had by this time joined them muffled up in a long dark hood and mantle exclaimed to lord glenvarlochlet them leave it if they will let them leave it all let us but escape from this horrible place  we have mentioned elsewhere that nigel was a very athletic young man and impelled by a strong feeling of compassion and indignation he showed his bodily strength singularly on this occasion by seizing on the ponderous strongbox and by means of the rope he had cast around it throwing it on his shoulders and marching resolutely forward under a weight which would have sunk to the earth three young gallants at the least of our degenerate day the waterman followed him in amazement calling out why master master you might as well gie me tother end ont and anon offered his assistance to support it in some degree behind which after the first minute or two nigel was fain to accept his strength was almost exhausted when he reached the wherry which was lying at the temple stairs according to appointment and when he pitched the trunk into it the weight sank the bow of the boat so low in the water as wellnigh to overset it  we shall have as hard a fare of it said the waterman to his companion as if we were ferrying over an honest bankrupt with all his secreted goodsho ho good woman what are you stepping in forour gunwale lies deep enough in the water without live lumber to boot  this person comes with me said lord glenvarloch she is for the present under my protection  come come master rejoined the fellow that is out of my commission you must not double my freight on meshe may go by land and as for protection her face will protect her from berwick to the lands end  you will not except at my doubling the loading if i double the fare said nigel determined on no account to relinquish the protection of this unhappy woman for which he had already devised some sort of plan likely now to be baffled by the characteristic rudeness of the thames watermen  ay by g but i will except though said the fellow with the green plush jacket i will overload my wherry neither for love nor moneyi love my boat as well as my wife and a thought better  nay nay comrade said his mate that is speaking no true water language for double fare we are bound to row a witch in her eggshell if she bid us and so pull away jack and let us have no more prating  they got into the streamway accordingly and although heavily laden began to move down the river with reasonable speed  the lighter vessels which passed overtook or crossed them in their course failed not to assail them with their boisterous raillery which was then called waterwit for which the extreme plainness of mistress marthas features contrasted with the youth handsome figure and good looks of nigel furnished the principal topics while the circumstance of the boat being somewhat overloaded did not escape their notice they were hailed successively as a grocers wife upon a party of pleasure with her eldest apprenticeas an old woman carrying her grandson to schooland as a young strapping irishman conveying an ancient maiden to dr rigmaroles at redriffe who buckles beggars for a tester and a dram of geneva all this abuse was retorted in a similar strain of humour by greenjacket and his companion who maintained the war of wit with the same alacrity with which they were assailed  meanwhile lord glenvarloch asked his desolate companion if she had thought on any place where she could remain in safety with her property she confessed in more detail than formerly that her fathers character had left her no friends and that from the time he had betaken himself to whitefriars to escape certain legal consequences of his eager pursuit of gain she had lived a life of total seclusion not associating with the society which the place afforded and by her residence there as well as her fathers parsimony effectually cut off from all other company what she now wished was in the first place to obtain the shelter of a decent lodging and the countenance of honest people however low in life until she should obtain legal advice as to the mode of obtaining justice on her fathers murderer she had no hesitation to charge the guilt upon colepepper commonly called peppercull whom she knew to be as capable of any act of treacherous cruelty as he was cowardly where actual manhood was required he had been strongly suspected of two robberies before one of which was coupled with an atrocious murder he had she intimated made pretensions to her hand as the easiest and safest way of obtaining possession of her fathers wealth and on her refusing his addresses if they could be termed so in the most positive terms he had thrown out such obscure hints of vengeance as joined with some imperfect assaults upon the house had kept her in frequent alarm both on her fathers account and her own  nigel but that his feeling of respectful delicacy to the unfortunate woman forebade him to do so could here have communicated a circumstance corroborative of her suspicions which had already occurred to his own mind he recollected the hint that old hildebrod threw forth on the preceding night that some communication betwixt himself and colepepper had hastened the catastrophe as this communication related to the plan which hildebrod had been pleased to form of promoting a marriage betwixt nigel himself and the rich heiress of trapbois the fear of losing an opportunity not to be regained together with the mean malignity of a lowbred ruffian disappointed in a favourite scheme was most likely to instigate the bravo to the deed of violence which had been committed the reflection that his own name was in some degree implicated with the causes of this horrid tragedy doubled lord glenvarlochs anxiety in behalf of the victim whom he had rescued while at the same time he formed the tacit resolution that so soon as his own affairs were put upon some footing he would contribute all in his power towards the investigation of this bloody affair  after ascertaining from his companion that she could form no better plan of her own he recommended to her to take up her lodging for the time at the house of his old landlord christie the shipchandler at pauls wharf describing the decency and honesty of that worthy couple and expressing his hopes that they would receive her into their own house or recommend her at least to that of some person for whom they would be responsible until she should have time to enter upon other arrangements for herself  the poor woman received advice so grateful to her in her desolate condition with an expression of thanks brief indeed but deeper than any thing had yet extracted from the austerity of her natural disposition  lord glenvarloch then proceeded to inform martha that certain reasons connected with his personal safety called him immediately to greenwich and therefore it would not be in his power to accompany her to christies house which he would otherwise have done with pleasure but tearing a leaf from his tablet he wrote on it a few lines addressed to his landlord as a man of honesty and humanity in which he described the bearer as a person who stood in singular necessity of temporary protection and good advice for which her circumstances enabled her to make ample acknowledgment he therefore requested john christie as his old and good friend to afford her the shelter of his roof for a short time or if that might not be consistent with his convenience at least to direct her to a proper lodgingand finally he imposed on him the additional and somewhat more difficult commission to recommend her to the counsel and services of an honest at least a reputable and skilful attorney for the transacting some law business of importance the note he subscribed with his real name and delivering it to his protegee who received it with another deeply uttered i thank you which spoke the sterling feelings of her gratitude better than a thousand combined phrases he commanded the watermen to pull in for pauls wharf which they were now approaching  we have not time said greenjacket we cannot be stopping every instant  but upon nigel insisting upon his commands being obeyed and adding that it was for the purpose of putting the lady ashore the waterman declared that he would rather have her room than her company and put the wherry alongside the wharf accordingly here two of the porters who ply in such places were easily induced to undertake the charge of the ponderous strongbox and at the same time to guide the owner to the wellknown mansion of john christie with whom all who lived in that neighbourhood were perfectly acquainted  the boat much lightened of its load went down the thames at a rate increased in proportion but we must forbear to pursue her in her voyage for a few minutes since we have previously to mention the issue of lord glenvarlochs recommendation  mistress martha trapbois reached the shop in perfect safety and was about to enter it when a sickening sense of the uncertainty of her situation and of the singularly painful task of telling her story came over her so strongly that she paused a moment at the very threshold of her proposed place of refuge to think in what manner she could best second the recommendation of the friend whom providence had raised up to her had she possessed that knowledge of the world from which her habits of life had completely excluded her she might have known that the large sum of money which she brought along with her might judiciously managed have been a passport to her into the mansions of nobles and the palaces of princes but however conscious of its general power which assumes so many forms and complexions she was so inexperienced as to be most unnecessarily afraid that the means by which the wealth had been acquired might exclude its inheretrix from shelter even in the house of a humble tradesman  while she thus delayed a more reasonable cause for hesitation arose in a considerable noise and altercation within the house which grew louder and louder as the disputants issued forth upon the street or lane before the door  the first who entered upon the scene was a tall rawboned hard favoured man who stalked out of the shop hastily with a gait like that of a spaniard in a passion who disdaining to add speed to his locomotion by running only condescends in the utmost extremity of his angry haste to add length to his stride he faced about so soon as he was out of the house upon his pursuer a decentlooking elderly plain tradesmanno other than john christie himself the owner of the shop and tenement by whom he seemed to be followed and who was in a state of agitation more than is usually expressed by such a person  ill hear no more ont said the personage who first appeared on the scenesir i will hear no more on it besides being a most false and impudent figment as i can testifyit is scandaalum magnaatum sirscandaalum magnaatum he reiterated with a broad accentuation of the first vowel well known in the colleges of edinburgh and glasgow which we can only express in print by doubling the said first of letters and of vowels and which would have cheered the cockles of the reigning monarch had he been within hearingas he was a severer stickler for what he deemed the genuine pronunciation of the roman tongue than for any of the royal prerogatives for which he was at times disposed to insist so strenuously in his speeches to parliament  i care not an ounce of rotten cheese said john christie in reply what you call itbut it is true and i am a free englishman and have right to speak the truth in my own concerns and your master is little better than a villain and you no more than a swaggering coxcomb whose head i will presently break as i have known it well broken before on lighter occasion  and so saying he flourished the paringshovel which usually made clean the steps of his little shop and which he had caught up as the readiest weapon of working his foeman damage and advanced therewith upon him the cautious scot for such our readers must have already pronounced him from his language and pedantry drew back as the enraged shipchandler approached but in a surly manner and bearing his hand on his swordhilt rather in the act of one who was losing habitual forbearance and caution of deportment than as alarmed by the attack of an antagonist inferior to himself in youth strength and weapons  bide back he said maister christiei say bide back and consult your safety man i have evited striking you in your ain house under muckle provocation because i am ignorant how the laws here may pronounce respecting burglary and hamesucken and such matters and besides i would not willingly hurt ye man een on the causeway that is free to us baith because i mind your kindness of lang syne and partly consider ye as a poor deceived creature but deil dn me sir and i am not wont to swear but if you touch my scotch shouther with that shule of yours i will make six inches of my andrew ferrara deevilish intimate with your guts neighbour  and therewithal though still retreating from the brandished shovel he made onethird of the baskethilled broadsword which he wore visible from the sheath the wrath of john christie was abated either by his natural temperance of disposition or perhaps in part by the glimmer of cold steel which flashed on him from his adversarys last action  i would do well to cry clubs on thee and have thee ducked at the wharf he said grounding his shovel however at the same time for a paltry swaggerer that would draw thy bit of iron there on an honest citizen before his own door but get thee gone and reckon on a salt eel for thy supper if thou shouldst ever come near my house again i wish it had been at the bottom of the thames when it first gave the use of its roof to smoothfaced oilytongued doubleminded scots thieves  its an ill bird that fouls its own nest replied his adversary not perhaps the less bold that he saw matters were taking the turn of a pacific debate and a pity it is that a kindly scot should ever have married in foreign parts and given life to a purseproud pudding headed fatgutted leanbrained southron een such as you maister christie but fare ye weelfare ye weel for ever and a day and if you quarrel wi a scot again man say as mickle ill o himsell as ye like but say nane of his patron or of his countrymen or it will scarce be your flat cap that will keep your lang lugs from the sharp abridgement of a highland whinger man  and if you continue your insolence to me before my own door were it but two minutes longer retorted john christie i will call the constable and make your scottish ankles acquainted with an english pair of stocks  so saying he turned to retire into his shop with some show of victory for his enemy whatever might be his innate valour manifested no desire to drive matters to extremityconscious perhaps that whatever advantage he might gain in single combat with jonn christie would be more than overbalanced by incurring an affair with the constituted authorities of old england not at that time apt to be particularly favourable to their new fellowsubjects in the various successive broils which were then constantly taking place between the individuals of two proud nations who still retained a stronger sense of their national animosity during centuries than of their late union for a few years under the government of the same prince  mrs martha trapbois had dwelt too long in alsatia to be either surprised or terrified at the altercation she had witnessed indeed she only wondered that the debate did not end in some of those acts of violence by which they were usually terminated in the sanctuary as the disputants separated from each other she who had no idea that the cause of the quarrel was more deeply rooted than in the daily scenes of the same nature which she had heard of or witnessed did not hesitate to stop master christie in his return to his shop and present to him the letter which lord glenvarloch had given to her had she been better acquainted with life and its business she would certainly have waited for a more temperate moment and she had reason to repent of her precipitation when without saying a single word or taking the trouble to gather more of the information contained in the letter than was expressed in the subscription the incensed ship chandler threw it down on the ground trampled it in high disdain and without addressing a single word to the bearer except indeed something much more like a hearty curse than was perfectly consistent with his own grave appearance he retired into his shop and shut the hatchdoor  it was with the most inexpressible anguish that the desolate friendless and unhappy female thus beheld her sole hope of succour countenance and protection vanish at once without being able to conceive a reason for to do her justice the idea that her friend whom she knew by the name of nigel grahame had imposed on her a solution which might readily have occurred to many in her situation never once entered her mind although it was not her temper easily to bend her mind to entreaty she could not help exclaiming after the ireful and retreating shipchandlergood master hear me but a moment for mercys sake for honestys sake  mercy and honesty from him mistress said the scot who though he essayed not to interrupt the retreat of his antagonist still kept stout possession of the field of actionye might as weel expect brandy from beanstalks or milk from a craig of blue whunstane the man is mad bom mad to boot  i must have mistaken the person to whom the letter was addressed then and as she spoke mistress martha trapbois was in the act of stooping to lift the paper which had been so uncourteously received her companion with natural civility anticipated her purpose but what was not quite so much in etiquette he took a sly glance at it as he was about to hand it to her and his eye having caught the subscription he said with surprise glenvarlochnigel olifaunt of glenvarloch do you know the lord glenvarloch mistress  i know not of whom you speak said mrs martha peevishly i had that paper from one master nigel gram  nigel grahameumpho ay very truei had forgot said the scotsman a tall wellset young man about my height bright blue eyes like a hawks a pleasant speech something leaning to the kindly northcountry accentuation but not much in respect of his having been resident abroad  all this is trueand what of it all said the daughter of the miser  hair of my complexion  yours is red replied she  i pray you peace said the scotsman i was going to sayof my complexion but with a deeper shade of the chestnut weel mistress if i have guessed the man aright he is one with whom i am and have been intimate and familiarnayi may truly say i have done him much service in my time and may live to do him more i had indeed a sincere goodwill for him and i doubt he has been much at a loss since we parted but the fault is not mine wherefore as this letter will not avail you with him to whom it is directed you may believe that heaven hath sent it to me who have a special regard for the writeri have besides as much mercy and honesty within me as man can weel make his bread with and am willing to aid any distressed creature that is my friends friend with my counsel and otherwise so that i am not put to much charges being in a strange country like a poor lamb that has wandered from its ain native hirsel and leaves a tait of its woo in every dd southron bramble that comes across it while he spoke thus he read the contents of the letter without waiting for permission and then continuedand so this is all that you are wanting my dove nothing more than safe and honourable lodging and sustenance upon your own charges  nothing more said she if you are a man and a christian you will help me to what i need so much  a man i am replied the formal caledonian een sic as ye see me and a christian i may call myself though unworthy and though i have heard little pure doctrine since i came hithera polluted with mens devicesahem weel and if ye be an honest woman here he peeped under her muffler as an honest woman ye seem likely to bethough let me tell you they are a kind of cattle not so rife in the streets of this city as i would desire themi was almost strangled with my own band by twa rampallians wha wanted yestreen nae farther gane to harle me into a changehousehowever if ye be a decent honest woman here he took another peep at features certainly bearing no beauty which could infer suspicion as decent and honest ye seem to be why i will advise you to a decent house where you will get douce quiet entertainment on reasonable terms and the occasional benefit of my own counsel and directionthat is from time to time as my other avocations may permit  may i venture to accept of such an offer from a stranger said martha with natural hesitation  troth i see nothing to hinder you mistress replied the bonny scot ye can but see the place and do after as ye think best besides we are nae such strangers neither for i know your friend and you its like know mine whilk knowledge on either hand is a medium of communication between us even as the middle of the string connecteth its twa ends or extremities but i will enlarge on this farther as we pass along gin ye list to bid your twa lazy loons of porters there lift up your little kist between them whilk ae true scotsman might carry under his arm let me tell you mistress ye will soon make a toom pockend of it in lonon if you hire twa knaves to do the work of ane  so saying he led the way followed by mistress martha trapbois whose singular destiny though it had heaped her with wealth had left her for the moment no wiser counsellor or more distinguished protector than honest richie moniplies a discarded servingman     chapter xxvii     this way lie safety and a sure retreat   yonder lie danger shame and punishment   most welcome danger thennay let me say   though spoke with swelling heartwelcome een shame   and welcome punishmentfor call me guilty   i do but pay the tax thats due to justice   and call me guiltless then that punishment   is shame to those alone who do inflict it                               the tribunal  we left lord glenvarloch to whose fortunes our story chiefly attaches itself gliding swiftly down the thames he was not as the reader may have observed very affable in his disposition or apt to enter into conversation with those into whose company he was casually thrown this was indeed an error in his conduct arising less from pride though of that feeling we do not pretend to exculpate him than from a sort of bashful reluctance to mix in the conversation of those with whom he was not familiar it is a fault only to be cured by experience and knowledge of the world which soon teaches every sensible and acute person the important lesson that amusement and what is of more consequence that information and increase of knowledge are to be derived from the conversation of every individual whatever with whom he is thrown into a natural train of communication for ourselves we can assure the readerand perhaps if we have ever been able to afford him amusement it is owing in a great degree to this causethat we never found ourselves in company with the stupidest of all possible companions in a postchaise or with the most arrant cumbercorner that ever occupied a place in the mailcoach without finding that in the course of our conversation with him we had some ideas suggested to us either grave orgay or some information communicated in the course of our journey which we should have regretted not to have learned and which we should be sorry to have immediately forgotten but nigel was somewhat immured within the bastile of his rank as some philosopher tom paine we think has happily enough expressed that sort of shyness which men of dignified situations are apt to be beset with rather from not exactly knowing how far or with whom they ought to be familiar than from any real touch of aristocratic pride besides the immediate pressure of our adventurers own affairs was such as exclusively to engross his attention  he sat therefore wrapt in his cloak in the stern of the boat with his mind entirely bent upon the probable issue of the interview with his sovereign which it was his purpose to seek for which abstraction of mind he may be fully justified although perhaps by questioning the watermen who were transporting him down the river he might have discovered matters of high concernment to him  at any rate nigel remained silent till the wherry approached the town of greenwich when he commanded the men to put in for the nearest landingplace as it was his purpose to go ashore there and dismiss them from further attendance  that is not possible said the fellow with the green jacket who as we have already said seemed to take on himself the charge of pilotage we must go he continued to gravesend where a scottish vessel which dropped down the river last tide for the very purpose lies with her anchor apeak waiting to carry you to your own dear northern country your hammock is slung and all is ready for you and you talk of going ashore at greenwich as seriously as if such a thing were possible  i see no impossibility said nigel in your landing me where i desire to be landed but very little possibility of your carrying me anywhere i am not desirous of going  why whether do you manage the wherry or we master asked green jacket in a tone betwixt jest and earnest i take it she will go the way we row her  ay retorted nigel but i take it you will row her on the course i direct you otherwise your chance of payment is but a poor one  suppose we are content to risk that said the undaunted waterman i wish to know how you who talk so bigi mean no offence master but you do talk bigwould help yourself in such a case  simply thus answered lord glenvarlochyou saw me an hour since bring down to the boat a trunk that neither of you could lift if we are to contest the destination of our voyage the same strength which tossed that chest into the wherry will suffice to fling you out of it wherefore before we begin the scuffle i pray you to remember that whither i would go there i will oblige you to carry me  gramercy for your kindness said greenjacket and now mark me in return my comrade and i are two menand you were you as stout as georgeagreen can pass but for one and two you will allow are more than a match for one you mistake in your reckoning my friend  it is you who mistake answered nigel who began to grow warm it is i who am three to two sirrahi carry two mens lives at my girdle  so saying he opened his cloak and showed the two pistols which he had disposed at his girdle greenjacket was unmoved at the display  i have got said he a pair of barkers that will match yours and he showed that he also was armed with pistols so you may begin as soon as you list  then said lord glenvarloch drawing forth and cocking a pistol the sooner the better take notice i hold you as a ruffian who have declared you will put force on my person and that i will shoot you through the head if you do not instantly put me ashore at greenwich  the other waterman alarmed at nigels gesture lay upon his oar but greenjacket replied coollylook you master i should not care a tester to venture a life with you on this matter but the truth is i am employed to do you good and not to do you harm  by whom are you employed said the lord glenvarloch or who dare concern themselves in me or my affairs without my authority  as to that answered the waterman in the same tone of indifference i shall not show my commission for myself i care not as i said whether you land at greenwich to get yourself hanged or go down to get aboard the royal thistle to make your escape to your own country you will be equally out of my reach either way but it is fair to put the choice before you  my choice is made said nigel i have told you thrice already it is my pleasure to be landed at greenwich  write it on a piece of paper said the waterman that such is your positive will i must have something to show to my employers that the transgression of their orders lies with yourself not with me  i choose to hold this trinket in my hand for the present said nigel showing his pistol and will write you the acquittance when i go ashore  i would not go ashore with you for a hundred pieces said the waterman 111 luck has ever attended you except in small gaming do me fair justice and give me the testimony i desire if you are afraid of foul play while you write it you may hold my pistols if you will he offered the weapons to nigel accordingly who while they were under his control and all possibility of his being taken at disadvantage was excluded no longer hesitated to give the waterman an acknowledgment in the following terms  jack in the green with his mate belonging to the wherry called the jolly raven have done their duty faithfully by me landing me at greenwich by my express command and being themselves willing and desirous to carry me on board the royal thistle presently lying at gravesend having finished this acknowledgment which he signed with the letters n o g as indicating his name and title he again requested to know of the waterman to whom he delivered it the name of his employers  sir replied jack in the green i have respected your secret do not you seek to pry into mine it would do you no good to know for whom i am taking this present trouble and to be brief you shall not know itand if you will fight in the quarrel as you said even now the sooner we begin the better only this you may be cocksure of that we designed you no harm and that if you fall into any it will be of your own wilful seeking as he spoke they approached the landingplace where nigel instantly jumped ashore the waterman placed his small mailtrunk on the stairs observing that there were plenty of spare hands about to carry it where he would  we part friends i hope my lads said the young nobleman offering at the same time a piece of money more than double the usual fare to the boatmen  we part as we met answered greenjacket and for your money i am paid sufficiently with this bit of paper only if you owe me any love for the cast i have given you i pray you not to dive so deep into the pockets of the next apprentice that you find fool enough to play the cavalierand you you greedy swine said he to his companion who still had a longing eye fixed on the money which nigel continued to offer push off or if i take a stretcher in hand ill break the knaves pate of thee the fellow pushed off as he was commanded but still could not help muttering this was entirely out of watermans rules  glenvarloch though without the devotion of the injured thales of the moralist to the memory of that great princess had now attained  the hallowd soil which gave eliza birth  whose halls were now less respectably occupied by her successor it was not as has been well shown by a late author that james was void either of parts or of good intentions and his predecessor was at least as arbitrary in effect as he was in theory but while elizabeth possessed a sternness of masculine sense and determination which rendered even her weaknesses some of which were in themselves sufficiently ridiculous in a certain degree respectable james on the other hand was so utterly devoid of firm resolve so well called by the scottish bard  the stalk of carlehemp in man  that even his virtues and his good meaning became laughable from the whimsical uncertainty of his conduct so that the wisest things he ever said and the best actions he ever did were often touched with a strain of the ludicrous and fidgety character of the man accordingly though at different periods of his reign he contrived to acquire with his people a certain degree of temporary popularity it never long outlived the occasion which produced it so true it is that the mass of mankind will respect a monarch stained with actual guilt more than one whose foibles render him only ridiculous  to return from this digression lord glenvarloch soon received as greenjacket had assured him the offer of an idle bargeman to transport his baggage where he listed but that where was a question of momentary doubt at length recollecting the necessity that his hair and beard should be properly arranged before he attempted to enter the royal presence and desirous at the same time of obtaining some information of the motions of the sovereign and of the court he desired to be guided to the next barbers shop which we have already mentioned as the place where news of every kind circled and centred he was speedily shown the way to such an emporium of intelligence and soon found he was likely to hear all he desired to know and much more while his head was subjected to the art of a nimble tonsor the glibness of whose tongue kept pace with the nimbleness of his fingers while he ran on without stint or stop in the following excursive manner  the court here masteryes mastermuch to the advantage of trade good custom stirring his majesty loves greenwichhunts every morning in the parkall decent persons admitted that have the

quarters of black taffeta already cut into patches for the courtiers  but sir mungo malagrowther again interjected nigel with difficulty  ay ay sirsir munko as you say a pleasant goodhumoured

kings most sacred majestyfootnote the scots till within the last generation disliked swines flesh as an article of food as much as the highlanders do at present it was remarked as extraordinary rapacity when the border depredators condescended to make prey of the accursed race whom the fiend made his habitation ben jonson in drawing jamess character says he loved no part of a swine nor my

himself sirworth a thousand pounds they saybetter singeing pigs faces than trimming courtiersbut ours is the less mechanical vocationfarewell sir hope your custom so saying he at length permitted nigel to depart whose ears so long tormented with continued babble tingled when it had ceased as if a bell had been rung close to them for the same space of time  upon his arrival at the eatinghouse where he proposed to meet with sir mungo malagrowther from whom in despair of better advice he trusted to receive some information as to the best mode of introducing himself into the royal presence lord glenvarloch found in the host with whom he communed the consequential taciturnity of an englishman well to pass in the world ned kilderkin spoke as a banker writes only touching the needful being asked if sir mungo malagrowther was there he replied no being interrogated whether he was expected he said yes and being again required to say when he was expected he answered presently as lord glenvarloch next inquired whether he himself could have any breakfast the landlord wasted not even a syllable in reply but ushering him into a neat room where there were several tables he placed one of them before an armchair and beckoning lord glenvarloch to take possession he set before him in a very few minutes a substantial repast of roastbeef together with a foaming tankard to which refreshment the keen air of the river disposed him notwithstanding his mental embarrassments to do much honour  while nigel was thus engaged in discussing his commons but raising his head at the same time whenever he heard the door of the apartment open eagerly desiring the arrival of sir mungo malagrowther an event which had seldom been expected by any one with so much anxious interest a personage as it seemed of at least equal importance with the knight entered into the apartment and began to hold earnest colloquy with the publican who thought proper to carry on the conference on his side unbonneted this important gentlemans occupation might be guessed from his dress a milkwhite jerkin and hose of white kersey a white apron twisted around his body in the manner of a sash in which instead of a warlike dagger was stuck a longbladed knife hilted with buckshorn a white nightcap on his head under which his hair was neatly tucked sufficiently pourtrayed him as one of those priests of comus whom the vulgar call cooks and the air with which he rated the publican for having neglected to send some provisions to the palace showed that he ministered to royalty itself  this will never answer he said master kilderkinthe king twice asked for sweetbreads and fricasseed coxcombs which are a favourite dish of his most sacred majesty and they were not to be had because master kilderkin had not supplied them to the clerk of the kitchen as by bargain bound here kilderkin made some apology brief according to his own nature and muttered in a lowly tone after the fashion of all who find themselves in a scrape his superior replied in a lofty strain of voice do not tell me of the carrier and his wain and of the hencoops coming from norfolk with the poultry a loyal man would have sent an expresshe would have gone upon his stumps like widdrington what if the king had lost his appetite master kilderkin what if his most sacred majesty had lost his dinner o master kilderkin if you had but the just sense of the dignity of our profession which is told of by the witty african slave for so the kings most excellent majesty designates him publius terentius tanguam in speculain patinas inspicerejubeo  you are learned master linklater replied the english publican compelling as it were with difficulty his mouth to utter three or four words consecutively  a poor smatterer said mr linklater but it would be a shame to us who are his most excellent majestys countrymen not in some sort to have cherished those arts wherewith he is so deeply embuedregis ad exemplar master kilderkin totus componitur orbiswhich is as much as to say as the king quotes the cook learns in brief master kilderkin having had the luck to be bred where humanities may be had at the matter of an english five groats by the quarter i like others have acquiredahemhem here the speakers eye having fallen upon lord glenvarloch he suddenly stopped in his learned harangue with such symptoms of embarrassment as induced ned kilderkin to stretch his taciturnity so far as not only to ask him what he ailed but whether he would take any thing  ail nothing replied the learned rival of the philosophical syrus nothingand yet i do feel a little giddy i could taste a glass of your dames aqua mirabilis  i will fetch it said ned giving a nod and his back was no sooner turned than the cook walked near the table where lord glenvarloch was seated and regarding him with a look of significance where more was meant than met the ear saidyou are a stranger in greenwich sir i advise you to take the opportunity to step into the parkthe western wicket was ajar when i came hither i think it will be locked presently so you had better make the best of your waythat is if you have any curiosity the venison are coming into season just now sir and there is a pleasure in looking at a hart of grease i always think when they are bounding so blithely past what a pleasure it would be to broach their plump haunches on a spit and to embattle their breasts in a noble fortification of puffpaste with plenty of black pepper  he said no more as kilderkin reentered with the cordial but edged off from nigel without waiting any reply only repeating the same look of intelligence with which he had accosted him  nothing makes mens wits so alert as personal danger nigel took the first opportunity which his hosts attention to the yeoman of the royal kitchen permitted to discharge his reckoning and readily obtained a direction to the wicket in question he found it upon the latch as he had been taught to expect and perceived that it admitted him to a narrow footpath which traversed a close and tangled thicket designed for the cover of the does and the young fawns here he conjectured it would be proper to wait nor had he been stationary above five minutes when the cook scalded as much with heat of motion as ever he had been by his huge fireplace arrived almost breathless and with his passkey hastily locked the wicket behind him  ere lord glenvarloch had time to speculate upon this action the man approached with anxiety and saidgood lord my lord glenvarloch why will you endanger yourself thus  you know me then my friend said nigel  not much of that my lordbut i know your honours noble house wellmy name is laurie linklater my lord  linklater repeated nigel i should recollect  under your lordships favour he continued i was prentice my lord to old mungo moniplies the flesher at the wanton westport of edinburgh which i wish i saw again before i died and your honours noble father having taken richie moniplies into his house to wait on your lordship there was a sort of connexion your lordship sees  ah said lord glenvarloch i had almost forgot your name but not your kind purpose you tried to put richie in the way of presenting a supplication to his majesty  most true my lord replied the kings cook i had like to have come by mischief in the job for richie who was always wilful wadna be guided by me as the sang says but nobody amongst these brave english cooks can kittle up his majestys most sacred palate with our own gusty scottish dishes so i een betook myself to my craft and concocted a mess of friars chicken for the soup and a savoury hachis that made the whole cabal coup the crans and instead of disgrace i came by preferment i am one of the clerks of the kitchen now make me thankfulwith a finger in the purveyors office and may get my whole hand in by and by  i am truly glad said nigel to hear that you have not suffered on my accountstill more so at your good fortune  you bear a kind heart my lord said linklater and do not forget poor people and troth i see not why they should be forgotten since the kings errand may sometimes fall in the cadgers gate i have followed your lordship in the street just to look at such a stately shoot of the old oaktree and my heart jumped into my throat when i saw you sitting openly in the eatinghouse yonder and knew there was such danger to your person  what there are warrants against me then said nigel  it is even true my lord and there are those who are willing to blacken you as much as they cangod forgive them that would sacrifice an honourable house for their own base ends  amen said nigel  for say your lordship may have been a little wild like other young gentlemen  we have little time to talk of it my friend said nigel the point in question is how am i to get speech of the king  the king my lord said linklater in astonishment why will not that be rushing wilfully into dangerscalding yourself as i may say with your own ladle  my good friend answered nigel my experience of the court and my knowledge of the circumstances in which i stand tell me that the manliest and most direct road is in my case the surest and the safest the king has both a head to apprehend what is just and a heart to do what is kind  it is een true my lord and so we his old servants know added linklater but woes me if you knew how many folks make it their daily and nightly purpose to set his head against his heart and his heart against his headto make him do hard things because they are called just and unjust things because they are represented as kind woes me it is with his sacred majesty and the favourites who work upon him even according to the homely proverb that men taunt my calling withgod sends good meat but the devil sends cooks  it signifies not talking of it my good friend said nigel i must take my risk my honour peremptorily demands it they may maim me or beggar me but they shall not say i fled from my accusers my peers shall hear my vindication  your peers exclaimed the cookalackaday my lord we are not in scotland where the nobles can bang it out bravely were it even with the king himself now and then this mess must be cooked in the star chamber and that is an oven seven times heated my lordand yet if you are determined to see the king i will not say but you may find some favour for he likes well any thing that is appealed directly to his own wisdom and sometimes in the like cases i have known him stick by his own opinion which is always a fair one only mind if you will forgive me my lordmind to spice high with latin a curn or two of greek would not be amiss and if you can bring in any thing about the judgment of solomon in the original hebrew and season with a merry jest or so the dish will be the more palatabletruly i think that besides my skill in art i owe much to the stripes of the rector of the high school who imprinted on my mind that cooking scene in the heautontimorumenos leaving that aside my friend said lord glenvarloch can you inform me which way i shall most readily get to the sight and speech of the king  to the sight of him readily enough said linklater he is galloping about these alleys to see them strike the hart to get him an appetite for a nooningand that reminds me i should be in the kitchen to the speech of the king you will not come so easily unless you could either meet him alone which rarely chances or wait for him among the crowd that go to see him alight and now farewell my lord and god speedif i could do more for you i would offer it  you have done enough perhaps to endanger yourself said lord glenvarloch i pray you to be gone and leave me to my fate  the honest cook lingered but a nearer burst of the horns apprized him that there was no time to lose and acquainting nigel that he would leave the posterndoor on the latch to secure his retreat in that direction he bade god bless him and farewell  in the kindness of this humble countryman flowing partly from national partiality partly from a sense of longremembered benefits which had been scarce thought on by those who had bestowed them lord glenvarloch thought he saw the last touch of sympathy which he was to receive in this cold and courtly region and felt that he must now be sufficient to himself or be utterly lost  he traversed more than one alley guided by the sounds of the chase and met several of the inferior attendants upon the kings sport who regarded him only as one of the spectators who were sometimes permitted to enter the park by the concurrence of the officers about the court still there was no appearance of james or any of his principal courtiers and nigel began to think whether at the risk of incurring disgrace similar to that which had attended the rash exploit of richie moniplies he should not repair to the palacegate in order to address the king on his return when fortune presented him the opportunity of doing so in her own way  he was in one of those long walks by which the park was traversed when he heard first a distant rustling then the rapid approach of hoofs shaking the firm earth on which he stood then a distant halloo warned by which he stood up by the side of the avenue leaving free room for the passage of the chase the stag reeling covered with foam and blackened with sweat his nostrils extended as he gasped for breath made a shift to come up as far as where nigel stood and without turning to bay was there pulled down by two tall greyhounds of the breed still used by the hardy deerstalkers of the scottish highlands but which has been long unknown in england one dog struck at the bucks throat another dashed his sharp nose and fangs i might almost say into the animals bowels it would have been natural for lord glenvarloch himself persecuted as if by hunters to have thought upon the occasion like the melancholy jacques but habit is a strange matter and i fear that his feelings on the occasion were rather those of the practised huntsman than of the moralist he had no time however to indulge them for mark what befell  a single horseman followed the chase upon a steed so thoroughly subjected to the rein that it obeyed the touch of the bridle as if it had been a mechanical impulse operating on the nicest piece of machinery so that seated deep in his demipique saddle and so trussed up there as to make falling almost impossible the rider without either fear or hesitation might increase or diminish the speed at which he rode which even on the most animating occasions of the chase seldom exceeded threefourths of a gallop the horse keeping his haunches under him and never stretching forward beyond the managed pace of the academy the security with which he chose to prosecute even this favourite and in the ordinary case somewhat dangerous amusement as well as the rest of his equipage marked king james no attendant was within sight indeed it was often a nice strain of flattery to permit the sovereign to suppose he had outridden and distanced all the rest of the chase  weel dune bashweel dune battie he exclaimed as he came up by the honour of a king ye are a credit to the braes of balwhither haud my horse man he called out to nigel without stopping to see to whom he had addressed himselfhaud my naig and help me doun out o the saddledeil ding your saul sirrah canna ye mak haste before these lazy smaiks come uphaud the rein easydinna let him swerve now haud the stirrupthat will do man and now we are on terra firma so saying without casting an eye on his assistant gentle king jamie unsheathing the short sharp hanger couteau de chasse which was the only thing approaching to a sword that he could willingly endure the sight of drew the blade with great satisfaction across the throat of the buck and put an end at once to its struggles and its agonies  lord glenvarloch who knew well the silvan duty which the occasion demanded hung the bridle of the kings palfrey on the branch of a tree and kneeling duteously down turned the slaughtered deer upon its back and kept the quarree in that position while the king too intent upon his sport to observe any thing else drew his couteau down the breast of the animal secundum artem and having made a cross cut so as to ascertain the depth of the fat upon the chest exclaimed in a sort of rapture three inches of white fat on the brisketprimeprimeas i am a crowned sinnerand deil ane o the lazy loons in but mysell sevenaughtaught tines on the antlers by gd a hart of aught tines and the first of the season bash and battie blessings on the heartsroot of ye buss me my bairns buss me the dogs accordingly fawned upon him licked him with bloody jaws and soon put him in such a state that it might have seemed treason had been doing its full work upon his anointed body bide doun with a mischief to yebide doun with a wanion cried the king almost overturned by the obstreperous caresses of the large staghounds but ye are just like ither folks gie ye an inch and ye take an elland wha may ye be friend he said now finding leisure to take a nearer view of nigel and observing what in his first emotion of silvan delight had escaped him ye are nane of our train man in the name of god what the devil are ye  an unfortunate man sire replied nigel  i dare say that answered the king snappishly or i wad have seen naething of you my lieges keep a their happiness to themselves but let bowls row wrang wi them and i am sure to hear of it  and to whom else can we carry our complaints but to your majesty who is heavens vicegerent over us answered nigel  right man rightvery weel spoken said the king but you should leave heavens vicegerent some quiet on earth too  if your majesty will look on me for hitherto the king had been so busy first with the dogs and then with the mystic operation of breaking in vulgar phrase cutting up the deer that he had scarce given his assistant above a transient glance you will see whom necessity makes bold to avail himself of an opportunity which may never again occur  king james looked his blood left his cheek though it continued stained with that of the animal which lay at his feet he dropped the knife from his hand cast behind him a faltering eye as if he either meditated flight or looked out for assistance and then exclaimed glenvarlochides as sure as i was christened james stewart here is a bonny spot of work and me alone and on foot too he added bustling to get upon his horse  forgive me that i interrupt you my liege said nigel placing himself between the king and his steed hear me but a moment  ill hear ye best on horseback said the king i canna hear a word on foot man not a word and it is not seemly to stand cheekfor chowl confronting us that gate bide out of our gate sir we charge you on your allegiancethe deils in them a what can they be doing  by the crown that you wear my liege said nigel and for which my ancestors have worthily fought i conjure you to be composed and to hear me but a moment  that which he asked was entirely out of the monarchs power to grant the timidity which he showed was not the plain downright cowardice which like a natural impulse compels a man to flight and which can excite little but pity or contempt but a much more ludicrous as well as more mingled sensation the poor king was frightened at once and angry desirous of securing his safety and at the same time ashamed to compromise his dignity so that without attending to what lord glenvarloch endeavoured to explain he kept making at his horse and repeating we are a free king manwe are a free kingwe will not be controlled by a subjectin the name of god what keeps steenie and praised be his name they are cominghillo hohere here steenie steenie  the duke of buckingham galloped up followed by several courtiers and attendants of the royal chase and commenced with his usual familiarityi see fortune has graced our dear dad as usualbut whats this  what is it it is treason for what i ken said the king and a your wyte steenie your dear dad and gossip might have been murdered for what you care  murdered secure the villain exclaimed the duke by heaven it is olifaunt himself a dozen of the hunters dismounted at once letting their horses run wild through the park some seized roughly on lord glenvarloch who thought it folly to offer resistance while others busied themselves with the king are you wounded my liegeare you wounded  not that i ken of said the king in the paroxysm of his apprehension which by the way might be pardoned in one of so timorous a temper and who in his time had been exposed to so many strange attemptsnot that i ken ofbut search himsearch him i am sure i saw firearms under his cloak i am sure i smelled powderi am dooms sure of that  lord glenvarlochs cloak being stripped off and his pistols discovered a shout of wonder and of execration on the supposed criminal purpose arose from the crowd now thickening every moment not that celebrated pistol which though resting on a bosom as gallant and as loyal as nigels spread such cause less alarm among knights and dames at a late high solemnitynot that very pistol caused more temporary consternation than was so groundlessly excited by the arms which were taken from lord glenvarlochs person and not mhicallastarmore himself could repel with greater scorn and indignation the insinuations that they were worn for any sinister purposes  away with the wretchthe parricidethe bloodyminded villain was echoed on all hands and the king who naturally enough set the same value on his own life at which it was or seemed to be rated by others cried out louder than all the rest ay ayaway with him i have had enough of him and so has the country but do him no bodily harmand for gods sake sirs if ye are sure ye have thoroughly disarmed him put up your swords dirks and skenes for you will certainly do each other a mischief  there was a speedy sheathing of weapons at the kings command for those who had hitherto been brandishing them in loyal bravado began thereby to call to mind the extreme dislike which his majesty nourished against naked steel a foible which seemed to be as constitutional as his timidity and was usually ascribed to the brutal murder of rizzio having been perpetrated in his unfortunate mothers presence before he yet saw the light  at this moment the prince who had been hunting in a different part of the then extensive park and had received some hasty and confused information of what was going forward came rapidly up with one or two noblemen in his train and amongst others lord dalgarno he sprung from his horse and asked eagerly if his father were wounded  not that i am sensible of baby charlesbut a wee matter exhausted with struggling singlehanded with the assassinsteenie fill up a cup of winethe leathern bottle is hanging at our pommelbuss me then baby charles continued the monarch after he had taken this cup of comfort o man the commonwealth and you have had a fair escape from the heavy and bloody loss of a dear father for we are pater patriae as weel as pater familiasquis desiderio sit pudor aut modus tarn cari capitiswoe is me black cloth would have been dear in england and dry een scarce  and at the very idea of the general grief which must have attended his death the goodnatured monarch cried heartily himself  is this possible said charles sternly for his pride was hurt at his fathers demeanour on the one hand while on the other he felt the resentment of a son and a subject at the supposed attempt on the kings life let some one speak who has seen what happenedmy lord of buckingham  i cannot say my lord replied the duke that i saw any actual violence offered to his majesty else i should have avenged him on the spot  you would have done wrong then in your zeal george answered the prince such offenders were better left to be dealt with by the laws but was the villain not struggling with his majesty  i cannot term it so my lord said the duke who with many faults would have disdained an untruth he seemed to desire to detain his majesty who on the contrary appeared to wish to mount his horse but they have found pistols on his person contrary to the proclamation and as it proves to be by nigel olifaunt of whose ungoverned disposition your royal highness has seen some samples we seem to be justified in apprehending the worst  nigel olifaunt said the prince can that unhappy man so soon have engaged in a new trespass let me see those pistols  ye are not so unwise as to meddle with such snaphaunces baby charles said jamesdo not give him them steeniei command you on your allegiance they may go off of their own accord whilk often befallsyou will do it thensaw ever a man sic wilful bairns as we are cumbered withhavena we guardsmen and soldiers enow but you must unload the weapons yoursellyou the heir of our body and dignities and sae mony men around that are paid for venturing life in our cause  but without regarding his fathers exclamations prince charles with the obstinacy which characterised him in trifles as well as matters of consequence persisted in unloading the pistols with his own hand of the double bullets with which each was charged the hands of all around were held up in astonishment at the horror of the crime supposed to have been intended and the escape which was presumed so narrow  nigel had not yet spoken a wordhe now calmly desired to be heard  to what purpose answered the prince coldly you knew yourself accused of a heavy offence and instead of rendering yourself up to justice in terms of the proclamation you are here found intruding yourself on his majestys presence and armed with unlawful weapons  may it please you sir answered nigel i wore these unhappy weapons for my own defence and not very many hours since they were necessary to protect the lives of others  doubtless my lord answered the prince still calm and unmoved your late mode of life and the associates with whom you have lived have made you familiar with scenes and weapons of violence but it is not to me you are to plead your cause  hear mehear me noble prince said nigel eagerly hear me you even you yourselfmay one day ask to be heard and in vain  how sir said the prince haughtilyhow am i to construe that my lord  if not on earth sir replied the prisoner yet to heaven we must all pray for patient and favourable audience  true my lord said the prince bending his head with haughty acquiescence nor would i now refuse such audience to you could it avail you but you shall suffer no wrong we will ourselves look into your case  ay ay answered the king he hath made appellatio ad casaremwe will interrogate glenvarlochides ourselves time and place fitting and in the meanwhile have him and his weapons away for i am weary of the sight of them  in consequence of directions hastily given nigel was accordingly removed from the presence where however his words had not altogether fallen to the ground this is a most strange matter george said the prince to the favourite this gentleman hath a good countenance a happy presence and much calm firmness in his look and speech i cannot think he would attempt a crime so desperate and useless  i profess neither love nor favour to the young man answered buckingham whose highspirited ambition bore always an open character but i cannot but agree with your highness that our dear gossip hath been something hasty in apprehending personal danger from him  by my saul steenie ye are not blate to say so said the king do i not ken the smell of pouther think ye who else nosed out the fifth of november save our royal selves cecil and suffolk and all of them were at fault like sae mony mongrel tikes when i puzzled it out and trow ye that i cannot smell pouther why sblood man joannes barclaius thought my ingine was in some measure inspiration and terms his history of the plot series patefacti divinitus parricidii and spondanus in like manner saith of us divinitus evasit  the land was happy in your majestys escape said the duke of buckingham and not less in the quick wit which tracked that labyrinth of treason by so fine and almost invisible a clew  saul man steenie ye are right there are few youths have sic true judgment as you respecting the wisdom of their elders and as for this fause traitorous smaik i doubt he is a hawk of the same nest saw ye not something papistical about him let them look that he bears not a crucifix or some sic roman trinket about him  it would ill become me to attempt the exculpation of this unhappy man said lord dalgarno considering the height of his present attempt which has made all true mens blood curdle in their veins yet i cannot avoid intimating with all due submission to his majestys infallible judgment in justice to one who showed himself formerly only my enemy though he now displays himself in much blacker colours that this olifaunt always appeared to me more as a puritan than as a papist  ah dalgarno art thou there man said the king and ye behoved to keep back too and leave us to our own natural strength and the care of providence when we were in grips with the villain  providence may it please your most gracious majesty would not fail to aid in such a strait the care of three weeping kingdoms said lord dalgarno  surely mansurely replied the kingbut a sight of your father with his long whinyard would have been a blithe matter a short while syne and in future we will aid the ends of providence in our favour by keeping near us two stout beefeaters of the guardand so this olifaunt is a puritannot the less like to be a papist for all thatfor extremities meet as the scholiast proveth there are as i have proved in my book puritans of papistical principlesit is just a new tout on an old horn  here the king was reminded by the prince who dreaded perhaps that he was going to recite the whole basilicon doron that it would be best to move towards the palace and consider what was to be done for satisfying the public mind in whom the mornings adventure was likely to excite much speculation as they entered the gate of the palace a female bowed and presented a paper which the king received and with a sort of groan thrust it into his side pocket the prince expressed some curiosity to know its contents the valet in waiting will tell you them said the king when i strip off my cassock dye think baby that i can read all that is thrust into my hands see to me manhe pointed to the pockets of his

pray god they bearna their armed harvest in your day if i suld not live to see it god forbid i should for there will be an awful days kemping at the shearing of them  i shall know how to stifle the crop in the bladeha george said the prince turning to the favourite with a look expressive of some contempt for his fathers apprehensions and full of confidence in the superior firmness and decision of his own counsels  while this discourse was passing nigel in charge of a pursuivantat arms was pushed and dragged through the small town all the inhabitants of which having been alarmed by the report of an attack on the kings life now pressed forward to see the supposed traitor amid the confusion of the moment he could descry the face of the victualler arrested into a stare of stolid wonder and that of the barber grinning betwixt horror and eager curiosity he thought that he also had a glimpse of his waterman in the green jacket  he had no time for remarks being placed in a boat with the pursuivant and two yeomen of the guard and rowed up the river as fast as the arms of six stout watermen could pull against the tide they passed the groves of masts which even then astonished the stranger with the extended commerce of london and now approached those low and blackened walls of curtain and bastion which exhibit here and there a piece of ordnance and here and there a solitary sentinel under arms but have otherwise so little of the military terrors of a citadel a projecting lowbrowed arch which had loured over many an innocent and many a guilty head in similar circumstances now spread its dark frowns over that of nigel the boat was put close up to the broad steps against which the tide was lapping its lazy wave the warder on duty looked from the wicket and spoke to the pursuivant in whispers in a few minutes the lieutenant of the tower appeared received and granted an acknowledgment for the body of nigel lord glenvarloch     chapter xxviii     ye towers of julius londons lasting shame   with many a foul and midnight murder fed                            gray  such is the exclamation of gray bandello long before him has said something like it and the same sentiment must in some shape or other have frequently occurred to those who remembering the fate of other captives in that memorable stateprison may have had but too much reason to anticipate their own the dark and low arch which seemed like the entrance to dantes hell to forbid hope of regress the muttered sounds of the warders and petty formalities observed in opening and shutting the grated wicketthe cold and constrained salutation of the lieutenant of the fortress who showed his prisoner that distant and measured respect which authority pays as a tax to decorum all struck upon nigels heart impressing on him the cruel consciousness of captivity  i am a prisoner he said the words escaping from him almost unawares i am a prisoner and in the tower   the lieutenant bowedand it is my duty he said to show your lordship your chamber where i am compelled to say my orders are to place you under some restraint i will make it as easy as my duty permits  nigel only bowed in return to this compliment and followed the lieutenant to the ancient buildings on the western side of the parade and adjoining to the chapel used in those days as a stateprison but in ours as the messroom of the officers of the guard upon duty at the fortress the double doors were unlocked the prisoner ascended a few steps followed by the lieutenant and a warder of the higher class they entered a large but irregular lowroofed and dark apartment exhibiting a very scanty proportion of furniture the warder had orders to light a fire and attend to lord glenvarlochs commands in all things consistent with his duty and the lieutenant having made his reverence with the customary compliment that he trusted his lordship would not long remain under his guardianship took his leave  nigel would have asked some questions of the warder who remained to put the apartment into order but the man had caught the spirit of his office he seemed not to hear some of the prisoners questions though of the most ordinary kind did not reply to others and when he did speak it was in a short and sullen tone which though not positively disrespectful was such as at least to encourage no farther communication  nigel left him therefore to do his work in silence and proceeded to amuse himself with the melancholy task of deciphering the names mottoes verses and hieroglyphics with which his predecessors in captivity had covered the walls of their prisonhouse there he saw the names of many a forgotten sufferer mingled with others which will continue in remembrance until english history shall perish there were the pious effusions of the devout catholic poured forth on the eve of his sealing his profession at tyburn mingled with those of the firm protestant about to feed the fires of smithfield there the slender hand of the unfortunate jane grey whose fate was to draw tears from future generations might be contrasted with the bolder touch which impressed deep on the walls the bear and ragged staff the proud emblem of the proud dudleys it was like the roll of the prophet a record of lamentation and mourning and yet not unmixed with brief interjections of resignation and sentences expressive of the firmest resolutionfootnote these memorials of illustrious criminals or of innocent persons who had the fate of such are still preserved though at one time in the course of repairing the rooms they were in some danger of being whitewashed they are preserved at present with becoming respect and have most of them been engravedsee bayleys history and antiquities of the tower of london  in the sad task of examining the miseries of his predecessors in captivity lord glenvarloch was interrupted by the sudden opening of the door of his prisonroom it was the warder who came to inform him that by order of the lieutenant of the tower his lordship was to have the society and attendance of a fellowprisoner in his place of confinement nigel replied hastily that he wished no attendance and would rather be left alone but the warder gave him to understand with a kind of grumbling civility that the lieutenant was the best judge how his prisoners should be accommodated and that he would have no trouble with the boy who was such a slip of a thing as was scarce worth turning a key uponthere giles he said bring the child in  another warder put the lad before him into the room and both withdrawing bolt crashed and chain clanged as they replaced these ponderous obstacles to freedom the boy was clad in a grey suit of the finest cloth laid down with silver lace with a buffcoloured cloak of the same pattern his cap which was a montero of black velvet was pulled over his brows and with the profusion of his long ringlets almost concealed his face he stood on the very spot where the warder had quitted his collar about two steps from the door of the apartment his eyes fixed on the ground and every joint trembling with confusion and terror nigel could well have dispensed with his society but it was not in his nature to behold distress whether of body or mind without endeavouring to relieve it  cheer up he said my pretty lad we are to be companions it seems for a little timeat least i trust your confinement will be short since you are too young to have done aught to deserve long restraint come comedo not be discouraged your hand is cold and trembles the air is warm toobut it may be the damp of this darksome room place you by the firewhat weepingripe my little man i pray you do not be a child you have no beard yet to be dishonoured by your tears but yet you should not cry like a girl think you are only shut up for playing truant and you can pass a day without weeping surely  the boy suffered himself to be led and seated by the fire but after retaining for a long time the very posture which he assumed in sitting down he suddenly changed it in order to wring his hands with an air of the bitterest distress and then spreading them before his face wept so plentifully that the tears found their way in floods through his slender fingers  nigel was in some degree rendered insensible to his own situation by his feelings for the intense agony by which so young and beautiful a creature seemed to be utterly overwhelmed and sitting down close beside the boy he applied the most soothing terms which occurred to endeavour to alleviate his distress and with an action which the difference of their age rendered natural drew his hand kindly along the long hair of the disconsolate child the lad appeared so shy as even to shrink from this slight approach to familiarityyet when lord glenvarloch perceiving and allowing for his timidity sat down on the farther side of the fire he appeared to be more at his ease and to hearken with some apparent interest to the arguments which from time to time nigel used to induce him to moderate at least the violence of his grief as the boy listened his tears though they continued to flow freely seemed to escape from their source more easily his sobs were less convulsive and became gradually changed into low sighs which succeeded each other indicating as much sorrow perhaps but less alarm than his first transports had shown  tell me who and what you are my pretty boy said nigelconsider me child as a companion who wishes to be kind to you would you but teach him how he can be so  sirmy lord i mean answered the boy very timidly and in a voice which could scarce be heard even across the brief distance which divided them you are very goodand iam very unhappy  a second fit of tears interrupted what else he had intended to say and it required a renewal of lord glenvarlochs goodnatured expostulations and encouragements to bring him once more to such composure as rendered the lad capable of expressing himself intelligibly at length however he was able to sayi am sensible of your goodness my lordand grateful for itbut i am a poor unhappy creature and what is worse have myself only to thank for my misfortunes  we are seldom absolutely miserable my young acquaintance said nigel without being ourselves more or less responsible for iti may well say so otherwise i had not been here todaybut you are very young and can have but little to answer for  o sir i wish i could say soi have been selfwilled and obstinate and rash and ungovernableand nownow how dearly do i pay the price of it  pshaw my boy replied nigel this must be some childish frolic some breaking out of boundssome truant trickand yet how should any of these have brought you to the towerthere is something mysterious about you young man which i must inquire into  indeed indeed my lord there is no harm about me said the boy more moved it would seem to confession by the last words by which he seemed considerably alarmed than by all the kind expostulations and arguments which nigel had previously used i am innocentthat is i have done wrong but nothing to deserve being in this frightful place  tell me the truth then said nigel in a tone in which command mingled with encouragement you have nothing to fear from me and as little to hope perhapsyet placed as i am i would know with whom i speak  with an unhappyboy sirand idle and truantly disposed as your lordship said answered the lad looking up and showing a countenance in which paleness and blushes succeeded each other as fear and shamefacedness alternately had influence i left my fathers house without leave to see the king hunt in the park at greenwich there came a cry of treason and all the gates were shuti was frightened and hid myself in a thicket and i was found by some of the rangers and examinedand they said i gave no good account of myselfand so i was sent hither  i am an unhappy a most unhappy being said lord glenvarloch rising and walking through the apartment nothing approaches me but shares my own bad fate death and imprisonment dog my steps and involve all who are found near me yet this boys story sounds strangelyyou say you were examined my young friendlet me pray you to say whether you told your name and your means of gaining admission into the parkif so they surely would not have detained you  o my lord said the boy i took care not to tell them the name of the friend that let me in and as to my fatheri would not he knew where i now am for all the wealth in london  but do you not expect said nigel that they will dismiss you till you let them know who and what you are  what good will it do them to keep so useless a creature as myself said the boy they must let me go were it but out of shame  do not trust to thattell me your name and stationi will communicate them to the lieutenanthe is a man of quality and honour and will not only be willing to procure your liberation but also i have no doubt will intercede with your father i am partly answerable for such poor aid as i can afford to get you out of this embarrassment since i occasioned the alarm owing to which you were arrested so tell me your name and your fathers name  my name to you o never never answered the boy in a tone of deep emotion the cause of which nigel could not comprehend  are you so much afraid of me young man he replied because i am here accused and a prisoner consider a man may be both and deserve neither suspicion nor restraint why should you distrust me you seem friendless and i am myself so much in the same circumstances that i cannot but pity your situation when i reflect on my own be wise i have spoken kindly to youi mean as kindly as i speak  o i doubt it not i doubt it not my lord said the boy and i could tell you allthat is almost all  tell me nothing my young friend excepting what may assist me in being useful to you said nigel  you are generous my lord said the boy and i am sureo sure i might safely trust to your honourbut yetbut yeti am so sore beseti have been so rash so unguardedi can never tell you of my folly besides i have already told too much to one whose heart i thought i had movedyet i find myself here  to whom did you make this disclosure said nigel  i dare not tell replied the youth  there is something singular about you my young friend said lord glenvarloch withdrawing with a gentle degree of compulsion the hand with which the boy had again covered his eyes do not pain yourself with thinking on your situation just at presentyour pulse is high and your hand feverishlay yourself on yonder pallet and try to compose yourself to sleep it is the readiest and best remedy for the fancies with which you are worrying yourself  i thank you for your considerate kindness my lord said the boy with your leave i will remain for a little space quiet in this chair i am better thus than on the couch i can think undisturbedly on what i have done and have still to do and if god sends slumber to a creature so exhausted it shall be most welcome  so saying the boy drew his hand from lord nigels and drawing around him and partly over his face the folds of his ample cloak he resigned himself to sleep or meditation while his companion notwithstanding the exhausting scenes of this and the preceding day continued his pensive walk up and down the apartment  every reader has experienced that times occur when far from being lord of external circumstances man is unable to rule even the wayward realm of his own thoughts it was nigels natural wish to consider his own situation coolly and fix on the course which it became him as a man of sense and courage to adopt and yet in spite of himself and notwithstanding the deep interest of the critical state in which he was placed it did so happen that his fellowprisoners situation occupied more of his thoughts than did his own there was no accounting for this wandering of the imagination but also there was no striving with it the pleading tones of one of the sweetest voices he had ever heard still rung in his ear though it seemed that sleep had now fettered the tongue of the speaker he drew near on tiptoe to satisfy himself whether it were so the folds of the cloak hid the lower part of his face entirely but the bonnet which had fallen a little aside permitted him to see the forehead streaked with blue veins the closed eyes and the long silken eyelashes  poor child said nigel to himself as he looked on him nestled up as it were in the folds of his mantle the dew is yet on thy eyelashes and thou hast fairly wept thyself asleep sorrow is a rough nurse to one so young and delicate as thou art peace be to thy slumbers i will not disturb them my own misfortunes require my attention and it is to their contemplation that i must resign myself  he attempted to do so but was crossed at every turn by conjectures which intruded themselves as before and which all regarded the sleeper rather than himself he was angry and vexed and expostulated with himself concerning the overweening interest which he took in the concerns of one of whom he knew nothing saving that the boy was forced into his company perhaps as a spy by those to whose custody he was committedbut the spell could not be broken and the thoughts which he struggled to dismiss continued to haunt him  thus passed half an hour or more at the conclusion of which the harsh sound of the revolving bolts was again heard and the voice of the warder announced that a man desired to speak with lord glenvarloch a man to speak with me under my present circumstances who can it be and john christie his landlord of pauls wharf resolved his doubts by entering the apartment welcomemost welcome mine honest landlord said lord glenvarloch how could i have dreamt of seeing you in my present close lodgings and at the same time with the frankness of old kindness he walked up to christie and offered his hand but john started back as from the look of a basilisk  keep your courtesies to yourself my lord said he gruffly i have had as many of them already as may serve me for my life  why master christie said nigel what means this i trust i have not offended you  ask me no questions my lord said christie bluntly i am a man of peacei came not hither to wrangle with you at this place and season just suppose that i am well informed of all the obligements from your honours nobleness and then acquaint me in as few words as may be where is the unhappy womanwhat have you done with her  what have i done with her said lord glenvarlochdone with whom i know not what you are speaking of  oh yes my lord said christie play surprise as well as you will you must have some guess that i am speaking of the poor fool that was my wife till she became your lordships lightolove  your wife has your wife left you and if she has do you come to ask her of me  yes my lord singular as it may seem returned christie in a tone of bitter irony and with a sort of grin widely discording from the discomposure of his features the gleam of his eye and the froth which stood on his lip i do come to make that demand of your lordship doubtless you are surprised i should take the trouble but i cannot tell great men and little men think differently she has lain in my bosom and drunk of my cup and such as she is i cannot forget thatthough i will never see her againshe must not starve my lord or do worse to gain bread though i reckon your lordship may think i am robbing the public in trying to change her courses  by my faith as a christian by my honour as a gentleman said lord glenvarloch if aught amiss has chanced with your wife i know nothing of it i trust in heaven you are as much mistaken in imputing guilt to her as in supposing me her partner in it  fie fie my lord said christie why will you make it so tough she is but the wife of a clodpated old chandler who was idiot enough to marry a wench twenty years younger than himself your lordship cannot have more glory by it than you have had already and as for advantage and solace i take it dame nelly is now unnecessary to your gratification i should be sorry to interrupt the course of your pleasure an old wittol should have more consideration of his condition but your precious lordship being mewed up here among other choice jewels of the kingdom dame nelly cannot i take it be admitted to share the hours of dalliance whichhere the incensed husband stammered broke off his tone of irony and proceeded striking his staff against the groundo that these false limbs of yours which i wish had been hamstrung when they first crossed my honest threshold were free from the fetters they have well deserved i would give you the odds of your youth and your weapon and would bequeath my soul to the foul fiend if i with this piece of oak did not make you such an example to all ungrateful pickthank courtiers that it should be a proverb to the end of time how john christie swaddled his wifes fine leman  i understand not your insolence said nigel but i forgive it because you labour under some strange delusion in so far as i can comprehend your vehement charge it is entirely undeserved on my part you seem to impute to me the seduction of your wifei trust she is innocent for me at least she is as innocent as an angel in bliss i never thought of hernever touched her hand or cheek save in honourable courtesy  o aycourtesythat is the very word she always praised your lordships honourable courtesy ye have cozened me between ye with your courtesy my lordmy lord you came to us no very wealthy man you know it it was for no lucre of gain i took you and your swash buckler your don diego yonder under my poor roof i never cared if the little room were let or no i could live without it if you could not have paid for it you should never have been asked all the wharf knows john christie has the means and spirit to do a kindness when you first darkened my honest doorway i was as happy as a man need to be who is no youngster and has the rheumatism nelly was the kindest and besthumoured wenchwe might have a word now and then about a gown or a ribbon but a kinder soul on the whole and a more careful considering her years till you comeand what is she nowbut i will not be a fool to cry if i can help it what she is is not the question but where she is and that i must learn sir of you  how can you when i tell you replied nigel that i am as ignorant as yourself or rather much more so till this moment i never heard of any disagreement betwixt your dame and you  that is a lie said john christie bluntly  how you base villain said lord glenvarlochdo you presume on my situation if it were not that i hold you mad and perhaps made so by some wrong sustained you should find my being weaponless were no protection i would beat your brains out against the wall  ay ay answered christie bully as ye list ye have been at the ordinaries and in alsatia and learned the ruffians rant i doubt not but i repeat you have spoken an untruth when you said you knew not of my wifes falsehood for when you were twitted with it among your gay mates it was a common jest among you and your lordship took all the credit they would give you for your gallantry and gratitude  there was a mixture of truth in this part of the charge which disconcerted lord glenvarloch exceedingly for he could not as a man of honour deny that lord dalgarno and others had occasionally jested with him on the subject of dame nelly and that though he had not played exactly le fanfaron des vices quil navoit pas he had not at least been sufficiently anxious to clear himself of the suspicion of such a crime to men who considered it as a merit it was therefore with some hesitation and in a sort of qualifying tone that he admitted that some idle jests had passed upon such a supposition although without the least foundation in truth john christie would not listen to his vindication any longer by your own account he said you permitted lies to be told of you injest how do i know you are speaking truth now you are serious you thought it i suppose a fine thing to wear the reputation of having dishonoured an honest familywho will not think that you had real grounds for your base bravado to rest upon i will not believe otherwise for one and therefore my lord mark what i have to say you are now yourself in troubleas you hope to come through it safely and without loss of life and property tell me where this unhappy woman is tell me if you hope for heaventell me if you fear helltell me as you would not have the curse of an utterly ruined woman and a brokenhearted man attend you through life and bear witness against you at the great day which shall come after death you are moved my lord i see it i cannot forget the wrong you have done me i cannot even promise to forgive itbuttell me and you shall never see me again or hear more of my reproaches  unfortunate man said lord glenvarloch you have said more far more than enough to move me deeply were i at liberty i would lend you my best aid to search out him who has wronged you the rather that i do suspect my having been your lodger has been in some degree the remote cause of bringing the spoiler into the sheepfold  i am glad your lordship grants me so much said john christie resuming the tone of embittered irony with which he had opened the singular conversation i will spare you farther reproach and remonstranceyour mind is made up and so is mineso ho warder the warder entered and john went oni want to get out brother look well to your chargeit were better that half the wild beasts in their dens yonder were turned loose upon tower hill than that this same smoothfaced civilspoken gentleman were again returned to honest mens company  so saying he hastily left the apartment and nigel had full leisure to lament the waywardness of his fate which seemed never to tire of persecuting him for crimes of which he was innocent and investing him with the appearances of guilt which his mind abhorred he could not however help acknowledging to himself that all the pain which he might sustain from the present accusation of john christie was so far deserved from his having suffered himself out of vanity or rather an unwillingness to encounter ridicule to be supposed capable of a base inhospitable crime merely because fools called it an affair of gallantry and it was no balsam to the wound when he recollected what richie had told him of his having been ridiculed behind his back by the gallants of the ordinary for affecting the reputation of an intrigue which he had not in reality spirit enough to have carried on his simulation had in a word placed him in the unlucky predicament of being rallied as a braggart amongst the dissipated youths with whom the reality of the amour would have given him credit whilst on the other hand he was branded as an inhospitable seducer by the injured husband who was obstinately persuaded of his guilt     chapter xxix     how fares the man on whom good men would look   with eyes where scorn and censure combated   but that kind christian love hath taught the lesson   that they who merit most contempt and hate   do most deserve our pity                               old play  it might have seemed natural that the visit of john christie should have entirely diverted nigels attention from his slumbering companion and for a time such was the immediate effect of the chain of new ideas which the incident introduced yet soon after the injured man had departed lord glenvarloch began to think it extraordinary that the boy should have slept so soundly while they talked loudly in his vicinity yet he certainly did not appear to have stirred was he wellwas he only feigning sleep he went close to him to make his observations and perceived that he had wept and was still weeping though his eyes were closed he touched him gently on the shoulderthe boy shrunk from his touch but did not awake he pulled him harder and asked him if he was sleeping  do they waken folk in your country to know whether they are asleep or no said the boy in a peevish tone  no my young sir answered nigel but when they weep in the manner you do in your sleep they awaken them to see what ails them  it signifies little to any one what ails me said the boy  true replied lord glenvarloch but you knew before you went to sleep how little i could assist you in your difficulties and you seemed disposed notwithstanding to put some confidence in me  if i did i have changed my mind said the lad  and what may have occasioned this change of mind i trow said lord glenvarloch some men speak through their sleepperhaps you have the gift of hearing in it  no but the patriarch joseph never dreamt truer dreams than i do  indeed said lord glenvarloch and pray what dream have you had that has deprived me of your good opinion for that i think seems the moral of the matter  you shall judge yourself answered the boy i dreamed i was in a wild forest where there was a cry of hounds and winding of horns exactly as i heard in greenwich park  that was because you were in the park this morning you simple child said nigel  stay my lord said the youth i went on in my dream till at the top of a broad green alley i saw a noble stag which had fallen into the toils and methought i knew that he was the very stag which the whole party were hunting and that if the chase came up the dogs would tear him to pieces or the hunters would cut his throat and i had pity on the gallant stag and though i was of a different kind from him and though i was somewhat afraid of him i thought i would venture something to free so stately a creature and i pulled out my knife and just as i was beginning to cut the meshes of the net the animal started up in my face in the likeness of a tiger much larger and fiercer than any you may have seen in the ward of the wild beasts yonder and was just about to tear me limb from limb when you awaked me  methinks said nigel i deserve more thanks than i have got for rescuing you from such a danger by waking you but my pretty master methinks all this tale of a tiger and a stag has little to do with your change of temper towards me  i know not whether it has or no said the lad but i will not tell you who i am  you will keep your secret to yourself then peevish boy said nigel turning from him and resuming his walk through the room then stopping suddenly he saidand yet you shall not escape from me without knowing that i penetrate your mystery  my mystery said the youth at once alarmed and irritatedwhat mean you my lord  only that i can read your dream without the assistance of a chaldean interpreter and my exposition isthat my fair companion does not wear the dress of her sex  and if i do not my lord said his companion hastily starting up and folding her cloak tight around her my dress such as it is covers one who will not disgrace it  many would call that speech a fair challenge said lord glenvarloch looking on her fixedly women do not masquerade in mens clothes to make use of mens weapons  i have no such purpose said the seeming boy i have other means of protection and powerfulbut i would first know what is your purpose  an honourable and a most respectful one said lord glenvarloch whatever you arewhatever motive may have brought you into this ambiguous situation i am sensibleevery look word and action of yours makes me sensible that you are no proper subject of importunity far less of ill usage what circumstances can have forced you into so doubtful a situation i know not but i feel assured there is and can be nothing in them of premeditated wrong which should expose you to coldblooded insult from me you have nothing to dread  i expected nothing less from your nobleness my lord answered the female my adventure though i feel it was both desperate and foolish is not so very foolish nor my safety here so utterly unprotected as at first sightand in this strange dress it may appear to be i have suffered enough and more than enough by the degradation of having been seen in this unfeminine attire and the comments you must necessarily have made on my conductbut i thank god that i am so far protected that i could not have been subjected to insult unavenged when this extraordinary explanation had proceeded thus far the warder appeared to place before lord glenvarloch a meal which for his present situation might be called comfortable and which if not equal to the cookery of the celebrated chevalier beaujeu was much superior in neatness and cleanliness to that of alsatia a warder attended to do the honours of the table and made a sign to the disguised female to rise and assist him in his functions but nigel declaring that he knew the youths parents interfered and caused his companion to eat along with him she consented with a sort of embarrassment which rendered her pretty features yet more interesting yet she maintained with a natural grace that sort of goodbreeding which belongs to the table and it seemed to nigel whether already prejudiced in her favour by the extraordinary circumstances of their meeting or whether really judging from what was actually the fact that he had seldom seen a young person comport herself with more decorous propriety mixed with ingenuous simplicity while the consciousness of the peculiarity of her situation threw a singular colouring over her whole demeanour which could be neither said to be formal nor easy nor embarrassed but was compounded of and shaded with an interchange of all these three characteristics wine was placed on the table of which she could not be prevailed on to taste a glass their conversation was of course limited by the presence of the warder to the business of the table but nigel had long ere the cloth was removed formed the resolution if possible of making himself master of this young persons history the more especially as he now began to think that the tones of her voice and her features were not so strange to him as he had originally supposed this however was a conviction which he adopted slowly and only as it dawned upon him from particular circumstances during the course of the repast  at length the prisonmeal was finished and lord glenvarloch began to think how he might most easily enter upon the topic he meditated when the warder announced a visitor  soh said nigel something displeased i find even a prison does not save one from importunate visitations  he prepared to receive his guest however while his alarmed companion flew to the large cradleshaped chair which had first served her as a place of refuge drew her cloak around her and disposed herself as much as she could to avoid observation she had scarce made her arrangements for that purpose when the door opened and the worthy citizen george heriot entered the prisonchamber  he cast around the apartment his usual sharp quick glance of observation and advancing to nigel saidmy lord i wish i could say i was happy to see you  the sight of those who are unhappy themselves master heriot seldom produces happiness to their friendsi however am glad to see you  he extended his hand but heriot bowed with much formal complaisance instead of accepting the courtesy which in those times when the distinction of ranks was much guarded by etiquette and ceremony was considered as a distinguished favour  you are displeased with me master heriot said lord glenvarloch reddening for he was not deceived by the worthy citizens affectation of extreme reverence and respect  by no means my lord replied heriot but i have been in france and have thought it is well to import along with other more substantial articles a small sample of that goodbreeding which the french are so renowned for  it is not kind of you said nigel to bestow the first use of it on an old and obliged friend  heriot only answered to this observation with a short dry cough and then proceeded  hem hem i say ahem my lord as my french politeness may not carry me far i would willingly know whether i am to speak as a friend since your lordship is pleased to term me such or whether i am as befits my condition to confine myself to the needful business which must be treated of between us  speak as a friend by all means master heriot said nigel i perceive you have adopted some of the numerous prejudices against me if not all of them speak out and franklywhat i cannot deny i will at least confess  and i trust my lord redress said heriot  so far as in my power certainly answered nigel  ah i my lord continued heriot that is a melancholy though a necessary restriction for how lightly may any one do an hundred times more than the degree of evil which it may be within his power to repair to the sufferers and to society but we are not alone here he said stopping and darting his shrewd eye towards the muffled figure of the disguised maiden whose utmost efforts had not enabled her so to adjust her position as altogether to escape observation more anxious to prevent her being discovered than to keep his own affairs private nigel hastily answered  tis a page of mine you may speak freely before him he is of france and knows no english  i am then to speak freely said heriot after a second glance at the chair perhaps my words may be more free than welcome  go on sir said nigel i have told you i can bear reproof  in one word then my lordwhy do i find you in this place and whelmed with charges which must blacken a name rendered famous by ages of virtue  simply then you find me here said nigel because to begin from my original error i would be wiser than my father  it was a difficult task my lord replied heriot your father was voiced generally as the wisest and one of the bravest men of scotland  he commanded me continued nigel to avoid all gambling and i took upon me to modify this injunction into regulating my play according to my skill means and the course of my luck  ay self opinion acting on a desire of acquisition my lordyou hoped to touch pitch and not to be defiled answered heriot well my lord you need not say for i have heard with much regret how far this conduct diminished your reputation your next error i may without scruple remind you ofmy lord my lord in whatever degree lord dalgarno may have failed towards you the son of his father should have been sacred from your violence  you speak in cold blood master heriot and i was smarting under a thousand wrongs inflicted on me under the mask of friendship  that is he gave your lordship bad advice and you said heriot  was fool enough to follow his counsel answered nigelbut we will pass this master heriot if you please old men and young men men of the sword and men of peaceful occupation always have thought always will think differently on such subjects  i grant answered heriot the distinction between the old goldsmith and the young noblemanstill you should have had patience for lord huntinglens sake and prudence for your own supposing your quarrel just  i pray you to pass on to some other charge said lord glenvarloch  i am not your accuser my lord but i trust in heaven that your own heart has already accused you bitterly on the inhospitable wrong which your late landlord has sustained at your hand  had i been guilty of what you allude to said lord glenvarloch had a moment of temptation hurried me away i had long ere now most bitterly repented it but whoever may have wronged the unhappy woman it was not ii never heard of her folly until within this hour  come my lord said heriot with some severity this sounds too much like affectation i know there is among our modern youth a new creed respecting adultery as well as homicidei would rather hear you speak of a revision of the decalogue with mitigated penalties in favour of the privileged ordersi would rather hear you do this than deny a fact in which you have been known to glory  gloryi never did never would have taken honour to myself from such a cause said lord glenvarloch i could not prevent other idle tongues and idle brains from making false inferences  you would have known well enough how to stop their mouths my lord replied heriot had they spoke of you what was unpleasing to your ears and what the truth did not warrantcome my lord remember your promise to confess and indeed to confess is in this case in some slight sort to redress i will grant you are youngthe woman handsomeand as i myself have observed lightheaded enough let me know where she is her foolish husband has still some compassion for herwill save her from infamyperhaps in time receive her back for we are a goodnatured generation we traders do not my lord emulate those who work mischief merely for the pleasure of doing so it is the very devils worst quality  your grave remonstrances will drive me mad said nigel there is a show of sense and reason in what you say and yet it is positively insisting on my telling the retreat of a fugitive of whom i know nothing earthly  it is well my lord answered heriot coldly you have a right such as it is to keep your own secrets but since my discourse on these points seems so totally unavailing we had better proceed to business yet your fathers image rises before me and seems to plead that i should go on  be it as you will sir said glenvarloch he who doubts my word shall have no additional security for it  well my lordin the sanctuary at whitefriarsa place of refuge so unsuitable to a young man of quality and characteri am told a murder was committed  and you believe that i did the deed i suppose  god forbid my lord said heriot the coroners inquest hath sat and it appeared that your lordship under your assumed name of grahame behaved with the utmost bravery  no compliment i pray you said nigel i am only too happy to find that i did not murder or am not believed to have murdered the old man  true my lord said heriot but even in this affair there lacks explanation your lordship embarked this morning in a wherry with a female and it is said an immense sum of money in specie and other valuablesbut the woman has not since been heard of  i parted with her at pauls wharf said nigel where she went ashore with her charge i gave her a letter to that very man john christie  ay that is the watermans story but john christie denies that he remembers anything of the matter  i am sorry to hear this said the young nobleman i hope in heaven she has not been trepanned for the treasure she had with her  i hope not my lord replied heriot but mens minds are much disturbed about it our national character suffers on all hands men remember the fatal case of lord sanquhar hanged for the murder of a fencingmaster and exclaim they will not have their wives whored and their property stolen by the nobility of scotland  and all this is laid to my door said nigel my exculpation is easy  i trust so my lord said heriotnay in this particular i do not doubt itbut why did you leave whitefriars under such circumstances  master reginald lowestoffe sent a boat for me with intimation to provide for my safety  i am sorry to say replied heriot that he denies all knowledge of your lordships motions after having dispatched a messenger to you with some baggage  the watermen told me they were employed by him  watermen said heriot one of these proves to be an idle apprentice an old acquaintance of minethe other has escaped but the fellow who is in custody persists in saying he was employed by your lordship and you only  he lies said lord glenvarloch hastilyhe told me master lowestoffe had sent himi hope that kindhearted gentleman is at liberty  he is answered heriot and has escaped with a rebuke from the benchers for interfering in such a matter as your lordships the court desire to keep well with the young templars in these times of commotion or he had not come off so well  that is the only word of comfort i have heard from you replied nigel but this poor womanshe and her trunk were committed to the charge of two porters  so said the pretended waterman but none of the fellows who ply at the wharf will acknowledge the employmenti see the idea makes you uneasy my lord but every effort is made to discover the poor womans place of retreatif indeed she yet livesand now my lord my errand is spoken so far as it relates exclusively to your lordship what remains is matter of business of a more formal kind  let us proceed to it without delay said lord glenvarloch i would hear of the affairs of any one rather than of my own  you cannot have forgotten my lord said heriot the transaction which took place some weeks since at lord huntinglensby which a large sum of money was advanced for the redemption of your lordships estate  i remember it perfectly said nigel and your present austerity cannot make me forget your kindness on the occasion  heriot bowed gravely and went onthat money was advanced under the expectation and hope that it might be replaced by the contents of a grant to your lordship under the royal signmanual in payment of certain monies due by the crown to your fatheri trust your lordship understood the transaction at the timei trust you now understand my resumption of its import and hold it to be correct  undeniably correct answered lord glenvarloch if the sums contained in the warrant cannot be recovered my lands become the property of those who paid off the original holders of the mortgage and now stand in their right  even so my lord said heriot and your lordships unhappy circumstances having it would seem alarmed these creditors they are now i am sorry to say pressing for one or other of these alternativespossession of the land or payment of their debt  they have a right to one or other answered lord glenvarloch and as i cannot do the last in my present condition i suppose they must enter on possession  stay my lord replied heriot if you have ceased to call me a friend to your person at least you shall see i am willing to be such to your fathers house were it but for the sake of your fathers memory if you will trust me with the warrant under the signmanual i believe circumstances do now so stand at court that i may be able to recover the money for you  i would do so gladly said lord glenvarloch but the casket which contains it is not in my possession it was seized when i was arrested at greenwich  it will be no longer withheld from you said heriot for i understand my masters natural good sense and some information which he has procured i know not how has induced him to contradict the whole charge of the attempt on his person it is entirely hushed up and you will only be proceeded against for your violence on lord dalgarno committed within the verge of the palaceand that you will find heavy enough to answer  i will not shrink under the weight said lord glenvarloch but that is not the present pointif i had that casket  your baggage stood in the little anteroom as i passed said the citizen the casket caught my eye i think you had it of me it was my old friend sir faithful frugals ay he too had a son  here he stopped short  a son who like lord glenvarlochs did no credit to his fatherwas it not so you would have ended the sentence master heriot asked the young nobleman  my lord it was a word spoken rashly answered heriot god may mend all in his own good time this however i will say that i have sometimes envied my friends their fair and flourishing families and yet have i seen such changes when death has removed the head so many rich mens sons penniless the heirs of so many knights and nobles acreless that i think mine own estate and memory as i shall order it has a fair chance of outliving those of greater men though god has given me no heir of my name but this is from the purposeho warder bring in lord glenvarlochs baggage the officer obeyed seals had been placed upon the trunk and casket but were now removed the warder said in consequence of the subsequent orders from court and the whole was placed at the prisoners free disposal  desirous to bring this painful visit to a conclusion lord glenvarloch opened the casket and looked through the papers which it contained first hastily and then more slowly and accurately but it was all in vain the sovereigns signed warrant had disappeared  i thought and expected nothing better said george heriot bitterly the beginning of evil is the letting out of water here is a fair heritage lost i dare say on a foul cast at dice or a conjuring trick at cardsmy lord your surprise is well played i give you full joy of your accomplishments i have seen many as young brawlers and spendthrifts but never as young and accomplished a dissembler nay man never bend your angry brows on me i speak in bitterness of heart from what i remember of your worthy father and if his son hears of his degeneracy from no one else he shall hear it from the old goldsmith  this new suspicion drove nigel to the very extremity of his patience yet the motives and zeal of the good old man as well as the circumstances of suspicion which created his displeasure were so excellent an excuse for it that they formed an absolute curb on the resentment of lord glenvarloch and constrained him after two or three hasty exclamations to observe a proud and sullen silence at length master heriot resumed his lecture  hark you my lord he said it is scarce possible that this most important paper can be absolutely assigned away let me know in what obscure corner and for what petty sum it lies pledgedsomething may yet be done  your efforts in my favour are the more generous said lord glenvarloch as you offer them to one whom you believe you have cause to think hardly ofbut they are altogether unavailing fortune has taken the field against me at every point even let her win the battle  zouns exclaimed heriot impatientlyyou would make a saint swear why i tell you if this paper the loss of which seems to sit so light on you be not found farewell to the fair lordship of glenvarlochfirth and forestlea and furrowlake and streamall that has been in the house of olifaunt since the days of william the lion  farewell to them then said nigeland that moan is soon made  sdeath my lord you will make more moan for it ere you die said heriot in the same tone of angry impatience  not i my old friend said nigel if i mourn master heriot it will be for having lost the good opinion of a worthy man and lost it as i must say most undeservedly  ay ay young man said heriot shaking his head make me believe that if you canto sum the matter up he said rising from his seat and walking towards that occupied by the disguised female for our matters are now drawn into small compass you shall as soon make me believe that this masquerading mummer on whom i now lay the hand of paternal authority is a french page who understands no english  so saying he took hold of the supposed pages cloak and not without some gentle degree of violence led into the middle of the apartment the disguised fair one who in vain attempted to cover her face first with her mantle and afterwards with her hands both which impediments master heriot removed something unceremoniously and gave to view the detected daughter of the old chronologist his own fair goddaughter margaret ramsay  here is goodly gear he said and as he spoke he could not prevent himself from giving her a slight shake for we have elsewhere noticed that he was a severe disciplinarianhow comes it minion that i find you in so shameless a dress and so unworthy a situation nay your modesty is now mistimedit should have come sooner speak or i will  master heriot said lord glenvarloch whatever right you may have over this maiden elsewhere while in my apartment she is under my protection  your protection my lorda proper protectorand how long mistress have you been under my lords protection speak out forsooth  for the matter of two hours godfather answered the maiden with a countenance bent to the ground and covered with blushes but it was against my will  two hours repeated heriotspace enough for mischiefmy lord this is i suppose another victim offered to your character of gallantryanother adventure to be boasted of at beaujeus ordinary methinks the roof under which you first met this silly maiden should have secured her at least from such a fate  on my honour master heriot said lord glenvarloch you remind me now for the first time that i saw this young lady in your family her features are not easily forgotten and yet i was trying in vain to recollect where i had last looked on them for your suspicions they are as false as they are injurious both to her and me i had but discovered her disguise as you entered i am satisfied from her whole behaviour that her presence here in this dress was involuntary and god forbid that i have been capable of taking advantage of it to her prejudice  it is well mouthed my lord said master heriot but a cunning clerk can read the apocrypha as loud as the scripture frankly my lord you are come to that pass where your words will not be received without a warrant  i should not speak perhaps said margaret the natural vivacity of whose temper could never be long suppressed by any situation however disadvantageous but i cannot be silent godfather you do me wrong and no less wrong to this young nobleman you say his words want a warrant i know where to find a warrant for some of them and the rest i deeply and devoutly believe without one  and i thank you maiden replied nigel for the good opinion you have expressed i am at that point it seems though how i have been driven to it i know not where every fair construction of my actions and motives is refused me i am the more obliged to her who grants me that right which the world denies me for you lady were i at liberty i have a sword and arm should know how to guard your reputation  upon my word a perfect amadis and oriana said george heriot i should soon get my throat cut betwixt the knight and the princess i suppose but that the beefeaters are happily within halloocome come lady lightoloveif you mean to make your way with me it must be by plain facts not by speeches from romaunts and playbooks how in heavens name came you here  sir answered margaret since i must speak i went to greenwich this morning with monna paula to present a petition to the king on the part of the lady hermione  mercyagad exclaimed heriot is she in the dance too could she not have waited my return to stir in her affairs but i suppose the intelligence i sent her had rendered her restless ah woman woman he that goes partner with you had need of a double share of patience for you will bring none into the common stockwell but what on earth had this embassy of monna paulas to do with your absurd disguise speak out  monna paula was frightened answered margaret and did not know how to set about the errand for you know she scarce ever goes out of doorsand soand soi agreed to go with her to give her courage and for the dress i am sure you remember i wore it at a christmas mumming and you thought it not unbeseeming  yes for a christmas parlour said heriot but not to go amasking through the country in i do remember it minion and i knew it even now that and your little shoe there linked with a hint i had in the morning from a friend or one who called himself such led to your detectionhere lord glenvarloch could not help giving a glance at the pretty foot which even the staid citizen thought worth recollectionit was but a glance for he saw how much the least degree of observation added to margarets distress and confusion and tell me maiden continued master heriot for what we have observed was byplaydid the lady hermione know of this fair work  i dared not have told her for the world said margaretshe thought one of our apprentices went with monna paula  it may be here noticed that the words our apprentices seemed to have in them something of a charm to break the fascination with which lord glenvarloch had hitherto listened to the broken yet interesting details of margarets history  and wherefore went he nothe had been a fitter companion for monna paula than you i wot said the citizen  he was otherwise employed said margaret in a voice scarce audible  master george darted a hasty glance at nigel and when he saw his features betoken no consciousness he muttered to himselfit must be better than i fearedand so this cursed spaniard with her head full as they all have of disguises trapdoors ropeladders and masks was jade and fool enough to take you with her on this wild goose errandand how sped you i pray  just as we reached the gate of the park replied margaret the cry of treason was raised i know not what became of monna but i ran till i fell into the arms of a very decent servingman called linklater and i was fain to tell him i was your goddaughter and so he kept the rest of them from me and got me to speech of his majesty as i entreated him to do  it is the only sign you showed in the whole matter that common sense had not utterly deserted your little skull said heriot  his majesty continued the damsel was so gracious as to receive me alone though the courtiers cried out against the danger to his person and would have searched me for arms god help me but the king forbade it i fancy he had a hint from linklater how the truth stood with me  well maiden i ask not what passed said heriot it becomes not me to pry into my masters secrets had you been closeted with his grandfather the red tod of saint andrews as davie lindsay used to call him by my faith i should have had my own thoughts of the matter but our master god bless him is douce and temperate and solomon in every thing save in the chapter of wives and concubines  i know not what you mean sir answered margaret his majesty was most kind and compassionate but said i must be sent hither and that the lieutenants lady the lady mansel would have a charge of me and see that i sustained no wrong and the king promised to send me in a tilted barge and under conduct of a person well known to you and thus i come to be in the tower  but how or why in this apartment nymph said george heriot expound that to me for i think the riddle needs reading  i cannot explain it sir further than that the lady mansel sent me here in spite of my earnest prayers tears and entreaties i was not afraid of any thing for i knew i should be protected but i could have died thencould die nowfor very shame and confusion  well well if your tears are genuine said heriot they may the sooner wash out the memory of your faultknows your father aught of this escape of yours  i would not for the world he did replied she he believes me with the lady hermione  ay honest davy can regulate his horologes better than his family come damsel now i will escort you back to the lady mansel and pray her of her kindness that when she is again trusted with a goose she will not give it to the fox to keepthe warders will let us pass to my ladys lodgings i trust  stay but one moment said lord glenvarloch whatever hard opinion you may have formed of me i forgive you for time will show that you do me wrong and you yourself i think will be the first to regret the injustice you have done me but involve not in your suspicions this young person for whose purity of thought angels themselves should be vouchers i have marked every look every gesture and whilst i can draw breath i shall ever think of her with  think not at all of her my lord answered george heriot interrupting him it is i have a notion the best favour you can do heror think of her as the daughter of davy ramsay the clockmaker no proper subject for fine speeches romantic adventures or high flown arcadian compliments i give you godden my lord i think not altogether so harshly as my speech may have spoken if i can help that is if i saw my way clearly through this labyrinthbut it avails not talking now i give your lordship goddenhere warder permit us to pass to the lady hansels apartment the warder said he must have orders from the lieutenant and as he retired to procure them the parties remained standing near each other but without speaking and scarce looking at each other save by stealth a situation which in two of the party at least was sufficiently embarrassing the difference of rank though in that age a consideration so serious could not prevent lord glenvarloch from seeing that margaret ramsay was one of the prettiest young women he had ever beheldfrom suspecting he could scarce tell why that he himself was not indifferent to herfrom feeling assured that he had been the cause of much of her present distressadmiration selflove and generosity acting in favour of the same object and when the yeoman returned with permission to his guests to withdraw nigels obeisance to the beautiful daughter of the mechanic was marked with an expression which called up in her cheeks as much colour as any incident of the eventful day had hitherto excited she returned the courtesy timidly and irresolutelyclung to her godfathers arm and left the apartment which dark as it was had never yet appeared so obscure to nigel as when the door closed behind her     chapter xxx     yet though thou shouldst be draggd in scorn   to yonder ignominious tree   thou shall not want one faithful friend   to share the cruel fates decree                    ballad of jemmy dawson  master george heriot and his ward as she might justly be termed for his affection to margaret imposed on him all the cares of a guardian were ushered by the yeoman of the guard to the lodging of the lieutenant where they found him seated with his lady they were received by both with that decorous civility which master heriots character and supposed influence demanded even at the hand of a punctilious old soldier and courtier like sir edward mansel lady mansel received margaret with like courtesy and informed master george that she was now only her guest and no longer her prisoner  she is at liberty she said to return to her friends under your chargesuch is his majestys pleasure  i am glad of it madam answered heriot but only i could have wished her freedom had taken place before her foolish interview with that singular young man and i marvel your ladyship permitted it  my good master heriot said sir edward we act according to the commands of one better and wiser than ourselvesour orders from his majesty must be strictly and literally obeyed and i need not say that the wisdom of his majesty doth more than ensure  i know his majestys wisdom well said heriot yet there is an old proverb about fire and flaxwell let it pass  i see sir mungo malagrowther stalking towards the door of the lodging said the lady mansel with the gait of a lame craneit is his second visit this morning  he brought the warrant for discharging lord glenvarloch of the charge of treason said sir edward  and from him said heriot i heard much of what had befallen for i came from france only late last evening and somewhat unexpectedly  as they spoke sir mungo entered the apartmentsaluted the lieutenant of the tower and his lady with ceremonious civilityhonoured george heriot with a patronising nod of acknowledgment and accosted margaret withhey my young charge you have not doffed your masculine attire yet  she does not mean to lay it aside sir mungo said heriot speaking loud until she has had satisfaction from you for betraying her disguise to me like a false knightand in very deed sir mungo i think when you told me she was rambling about in so strange a dress you might have said also that she was under lady mansels protection  that was the kings secret master heriot said sir mungo throwing himself into a chair with an air of atrabilarious importance the other was a wellmeaning hint to yourself as the girls friend  yes replied heriot it was done like yourselfenough told to make me unhappy about hernot a word which could relieve my uneasiness  sir mungo will not hear that remark said the lady we must change the subjectis there any news from court sir mungo you have been to greenwich  you might as well ask me madam answered the knight whether there is any news from hell  how sir mungo how said sir edward measure your words something betteryou speak of the court of king james  sir edward if i spoke of the court of the twelve kaisers i would say it is as confused for the present as the infernal regions courtiers of forty years standing and such i may write myself are as far to seek in the matter as a minnow in the maelstrom some folk say the king has frowned on the princesome that the prince has looked grave on the dukesome that lord glenvarloch will be hanged for high treasonand some that there is matter against lord dalgarno that may cost him as much as his heads worth  and what do you that are a courtier of forty years standing think of it all said sir edward mansel  nay nay do not ask him sir edward said the lady with an expressive look to her husband  sir mungo is too witty added master heriot to remember that he who says aught that may be repeated to his own prejudice does but load a piece for any of the company to shoot him dead with at their pleasure and convenience  what said the bold knight you think i am afraid of the trepan why now what if i should say that dalgarno has more wit than honestythe duke more sail than ballastthe prince more pride than prudenceand that the king the lady mansel held up her finger in a warning mannerthat the king is my very good master who has given me for forty years and more dogs wages videlicit bones and beatingwhy now all this is said and archie armstrong footnote the celebrated court jester says worse than this of the best of them every day  the more fool he said george heriot yet he is not so utterly wrong for folly is his best wisdom but do not you sir mungo set your wit against a fools though he be a court fool  a fool said you replied sir mungo not having fully heard what master heriot said or not choosing to have it thought soi have been a fool indeed to hang on at a closefisted court here when men of understanding and men of action have been making fortunes in every other place of europe but here a man comes indifferently off unless he gets a great key to turn looking at sir edward or can beat tattoo with a hammer on a pewter platewell sirs i must make as much haste back on mine errand as if i were a feed messengersir edward and my lady i leave my commendations with youand my good will with you master heriotand for this breaker of bounds if you will act by my counsel some maceration by fasting and a gentle use of the rod is the best cure for her giddy fits  if you propose for greenwich sir mungo said the lieutenant i can spare you the labourthe king comes immediately to whitehall  and that must be the reason the council are summoned to meet in such hurry said sir mungo welli will with your permission go to the poor lad glenvarloch and bestow some comfort on him  the lieutenant seemed to look up and pause for a moment as if in doubt  the lad will want a pleasant companion who can tell him the nature of the punishment which he is to suffer and other matters of concernment i will not leave him until i show him how absolutely he hath ruined himself from feather to spur how deplorable is his present state and how small his chance of mending it  well sir mungo replied the lieutenant if you really think all this likely to be very consolatory to the party concerned i will send a warder to conduct you  and i said george heriot will humbly pray of lady mansel that she will lend some of her handmaidens apparel to this giddybrained girl for i shall forfeit my reputation if i walk up tower hill with her in that mad guiseand yet the silly lassie looks not so ill in it neither  i will send my coach with you instantly said the obliging lady  faith madam and if you will honour us by such courtesy i will gladly accept it at your hands said the citizen for business presses hard on me and the forenoon is already lost to little purpose  the coach being ordered accordingly transported the worthy citizen and his charge to his mansion in lombard street there he found his presence was anxiously expected by the lady hermione who had just received an order to be in readiness to attend upon the royal privy council in the course of an hour and upon whom in her inexperience of business and long retirement from society and the world the intimation had made as deep an impression as if it had not been the necessary consequence of the petition which she had presented to the king by monna paula george heriot gently blamed her for taking any steps in an affair so important until his return from france especially as he had requested her to remain quiet in a letter which accompanied the evidence he had transmitted to her from paris she could only plead in answer the influence which her immediately stirring in the matter was likely to have on the affair of her kinsman lord glenvarloch for she was ashamed to acknowledge how much she had been gained on by the eager importunity of her youthful companion the motive of margarets eagerness was of course the safety of nigel but we must leave it to time to show in what particulars that came to be connected with the petition of the lady hermione meanwhile we return to the visit with which sir mungo malagrowther favoured the afflicted young nobleman in his place of captivity  the knight after the usual salutations and having prefaced his discourse with a great deal of professed regret for nigels situation sat down beside him and composing his grotesque features into the most lugubrious despondence began his raven song as follows  i bless god my lord that i was the person who had the pleasure to bring his majestys mild message to the lieutenant discharging the higher prosecution against ye for any thing meditated against his majestys sacred person for admit you be prosecuted on the lesser offence or breach of privilege of the palace and its precincts usque ad mutilationem even to dismemberation as it is most likely you will yet the loss of a member is nothing to being hanged and drawn quick after the fashion of a traitor  i should feel the shame of having deserved such a punishment answered nigel more than the pain of undergoing it  doubtless my lord the having as you say deserved it must be an excruciation to your own mind replied his tormentor a kind of mental and metaphysical hanging drawing and quartering which may be in some measure equipollent with the external application of hemp iron fire and the like to the outer man  i say sir mungo repeated nigel and beg you to understand my words that i am unconscious of any error save that of having arms on my person when i chanced to approach that of my sovereign  ye are right my lord to acknowledge nothing said sir mungo we have an old proverbconfess andso forth and indeed as to the weapons his majesty has a special illwill at all arms whatsoever and more especially pistols but as i said there is an end of that matter footnote wilson informs us that when colonel grey a scotsman who affected the buff dress even in the time of peace appeared in that military garb at court the king seeing him with a case of pistols at his girdle which he never greatly liked told him merrily he was now so fortified that if he were but well victualled he would be impregnablewilsons life and reign of james vi apud kennets history of england vol ii p 389 in 1612 the tenth year of jamess reign there was a rumour abroad that a shipload of pocketpistols had been exported from spain with a view to a general massacre of the protestants proclamations were of consequence sent forth prohibiting all persons from carrying pistols under a foot long in the barrel ibid p 690 i wish you as well through the next which is altogether unlikely  surely sir mungo answered nigel you yourself might say something in my favour concerning the affair in the park none knows better than you that i was at that moment urged by wrongs of the most heinous nature offered to me by lord dalgarno many of which were reported to me by yourself much to the inflammation of my passion  alackadayalackaday replied sir mungo i remember but too well how much your choler was inflamed in spite of the various remonstrances which i made to you respecting the sacred nature of the place alas alas you cannot say you leaped into the mire for want of warning  i see sir mungo you are determined to remember nothing which can do me service said nigel  blithely would i do ye service said the knight and the best whilk i can think of is to tell you the process of the punishment to the whilk you will be indubitably subjected i having had the good fortune to behold it performed in the queens time on a chield that had written a pasquinado i was then in my lord grays train who lay leaguer here and being always covetous of pleasing and profitable sights i could not dispense with being present on the occasion  i should be surprised indeed said lord glenvarloch if you had so far put restraint upon your benevolence as to stay away from such an exhibition  hey was your lordship praying me to be present at your own execution answered the knight troth my lord it will be a painful sight to a friend but i will rather punish myself than baulk you it is a pretty pageant in the maina very pretty pageant the fallow came on with such a bold face it was a pleasure to look on him he was dressed all in white to signify harmlessness and innocence the thing was done on a scaffold at westminstermost likely yours will be at the charing there were the sheriffs and the marshals men and what notthe executioner with his cleaver and mallet and his man with a pan of hot charcoal and the irons for cautery he was a dexterous fallow that derrick this man gregory is not fit to jipper a joint with him it might be worth your lordships while to have the loon sent to a barbersurgeons to learn some needful scantling of anatomyit may be for the benefit of yourself and other unhappy sufferers and also a kindness to gregory  i will not take the trouble said nigelif the laws will demand my hand the executioner may get it off as he best can if the king leaves it where it is it may chance to do him better service  vera noblevera grand indeed my lord said sir mungo it is pleasant to see a brave man suffer this fallow whom i spoke ofthis tubbs or stubbs or whatever the plebeian was called came forward as bold as an emperor and said to the people good friends i come to leave here the hand of a true englishman and clapped it on the dressingblock with as much ease as if he had laid it on his sweethearts shoulder whereupon derrick the hangman adjusting dye mind me the edge of his cleaver on the very joint hit it with the mallet with such force that the hand flew off as far from the owner as a gauntlet which the challenger casts down in the tiltyard well sir stubbs or tubbs lost no whit of countenance until the fallow clapped the hissinghot iron on his raw stump my lord it fizzed like a rasher of bacon and the fallow set up an elritch screech which made some think his courage was abated but not a whit for he plucked off his hat with his left hand and waved it crying god save the queen and confound all evil counsellors the people gave him three cheers which he deserved for his stout heart and truly i hope to see your lordship suffer with the same magnanimity  i thank you sir mungo said nigel who had not been able to forbear some natural feelings of an unpleasant nature during this lively detaili have no doubt the exhibition will be a very engaging one to you and the other spectators whatever it may prove to the party principally concerned  vera engaging answered sir mungo vera interestingvera interesting indeed though not altogether so much so as an execution for high treason i saw digby the winters fawkes and the rest of the gunpowder gang suffer for that treason whilk was a vera grand spectacle as well in regard to their sufferings as to their constancy in enduring  i am the more obliged to your goodness sir mungo replied nigel that has induced you although you have lost the sight to congratulate me on my escape from the hazard of making the same edifying appearance  as you say my lord answered sir mungo the loss is chiefly in appearance nature has been very bountiful to us and has given duplicates of some organs that we may endure the loss of one of them should some such circumstance chance in our pilgrimage see my poor dexter abridged to one thumb one finger and a stumpby the blow of my adversarys weapon however and not by any carnificial knife weel sir this poor maimed hand doth me in some sort as much service as ever and admit yours to be taken off by the wrist you have still your left hand for your service and are better off than the little dutch dwarf here about town who threads a needle limns writes and tosses a pike merely by means of his feet without ever a hand to help him  well sir mungo said lord glenvarloch this is all no doubt very consolatory but i hope the king will spare my hand to fight for him in battle where notwithstanding all your kind encouragement i could spend my blood much more cheerfully than on a scaffold  it is even a sad truth replied sir mungo that your lordship was but too like to have died on a scaffoldnot a soul to speak for you but that deluded lassie maggie ramsay  whom mean you said nigel with more interest than he had hitherto shown in the knights communications  nay who should i mean but that travestied lassie whom we dined with when we honoured heriot the goldsmith ye ken best how you have made interest with her but i saw her on her knees to the king for you she was committed to my charge to bring her up hither in honour and safety had i had my own will i would have had her to bridewell to flog the wild blood out of hera cutty quean to think of wearing the breeches and not so much as married yet  hark ye sir mungo malagrowther answered nigel i would have you talk of that young person with fitting respect  with all the respect that befits your lordships paramour and davy ramsays daughter i shall certainly speak of her my lord said sir mungo assuming a dry tone of irony  nigel was greatly disposed to have made a serious quarrel of it but with sir mungo such an affair would have been ridiculous he smothered his resentment therefore and conjured him to tell what he had heard and seen respecting this young person  simply that i was in the anteroom when she had audience and heard the king say to my great perplexity pulchra sane puella and maxwell who hath but indifferent latin ears thought that his majesty called on him by his own name of sawney and thrust into the presence and there i saw our sovereign james with his own hand raising up the lassie who as i said heretofore was travestied in mans attire i should have had my own thoughts of it but our gracious master is auld and was nae great gillravager amang the queans even in his youth and he was comforting her in his own way and sayingye needna greet about it my bonnie woman glenvarlochides shall have fair play and indeed when the hurry was off our spirits we could not believe that he had any design on our person and touching his other offences we will look wisely and closely into the matter so i got charge to take the young fencelouper to the tower here and deliver her to the charge of lady mansel and his majesty charged me to say not a word to her about your offences for said he the poor thing is breaking her heart for him  and on this you have charitably founded the opinion to the prejudice of this young lady which you have now thought proper to express said lord glenvarloch  in honest truth my lord replied sir mungo what opinion would you have me form of a wench who gets into male habiliments and goes on her knees to the king for a wild young nobleman i wot not what the fashionable word may be for the phrase changes though the custom abides but truly i must needs think this young leddyif you call watchie ramsays daughter a young leddydemeans herself more like a leddy of pleasure than a leddy of honour  you do her egregious wrong sir mungo said nigel or rather you have been misled by appearances  so will all the world be misled my lord replied the satirist unless you were doing that to disabuse them which your fathers son will hardly judge it fit to do  and what may that be i pray you  een marry the lassmake her leddy glenvarlochay ay ye may startbut its the course you are driving on rather marry than do worse if the worst be not done already  sir mungo said nigel i pray you to forbear this subject and rather return to that of the mutilation upon which it pleased you to enlarge a short while since  i have not time at present said sir mungo hearing the clock strike four but so soon as you shall have received sentence my lord you may rely on my giving you the fullest detail of the whole solemnity and i give you my word as a knight and a gentleman that i will myself attend you on the scaffold whoever may cast sour looks on me for doing so i bear a heart to stand by a friend in the worst of times  so saying he wished lord glenvarloch farewell who felt as heartily rejoiced at his departure though it may be a bold word as any person who had ever undergone his society  but when left to his own reflections nigel could not help feeling solitude nearly as irksome as the company of sir mungo malagrowther the total wreck of his fortunewhich seemed now to be rendered unavoidable by the loss of the royal warrant that had afforded him the means of redeeming his paternal estatewas an unexpected and additional blow when he had seen the warrant he could not precisely remember but was inclined to think it was in the casket when he took out money to pay the miser for his lodgings at whitefriars since then the casket had been almost constantly under his own eye except during the short time he was separated from his baggage by the arrest in greenwich park it might indeed have been taken out at that time for he had no reason to think either his person or his property was in the hands of those who wished him well but on the other hand the locks of the strongbox had sustained no violence that he could observe and being of a particular and complicated construction he thought they could scarce be opened without an instrument made on purpose adapted to their peculiarities and for this there had been no time but speculate as he would on the matter it was clear that this important document was gone and probable that it had passed into no friendly hands let it be so said nigel to himself i am scarcely worse off respecting my prospects of fortune than when i first reached this accursed city but to be hampered with cruel accusations and stained with foul suspicionsto be the object of pity of the most degrading kind to yonder honest citizen and of the malignity of that envious and atrabilarious courtier who can endure the good fortune and good qualities of another no more than the mole can brook sunshinethis is indeed a deplorable reflection and the consequences must stick to my future life and impede whatever my head or my hand if it is left me might be able to execute in my favour  the feeling that he is the object of general dislike and dereliction seems to be one of the most unendurably painful to which a human being can be subjected the most atrocious criminals whose nerves have not shrunk from perpetrating the most horrid cruelty endure more from the consciousness that no man will sympathise with their sufferings than from apprehension of the personal agony of their impending punishment and are known often to attempt to palliate their enormities and sometimes altogether to deny what is established by the clearest proof rather than to leave life under the general ban of humanity it was no wonder that nigel labouring under the sense of general though unjust suspicion should while pondering on so painful a theme recollect that one at least had not only believed him innocent but hazarded herself with all her feeble power to interpose in his behalf  poor girl he repeated poor rash but generous maiden your fate is that of her in scottish story who thrust her arm into the staple of the door to oppose it as a bar against the assassins who threatened the murder of her sovereign the deed of devotion was useless save to give an immortal name to her by whom it was done and whose blood flows it is said in the veins of my house  i cannot explain to the reader whether the recollection of this historical deed of devotion and the lively effect which the comparison a little overstrained perhaps was likely to produce in favour of margaret ramsay was not qualified by the concomitant ideas of ancestry and ancient descent with which that recollection was mingled but the contending feelings suggested a new train of ideas ancestry he thought and ancient descent what are they to memy patrimony alienatedmy title become a reproachfor what can be so absurd as titled beggarymy character subjected to suspicioni will not remain in this country and should i at leaving it procure the society of one so lovely so brave and so faithful who should say that i derogated from the rank which i am virtually renouncing  there was something romantic and pleasing as he pursued this picture of an attached and faithful pair becoming all the world to each other and stemming the tide of fate arm in arm and to be linked thus with a creature so beautiful and who had taken such devoted and disinterested concern in his fortunes formed itself into such a vision as romantic youth loves best to dwell upon  suddenly his dream was painfully dispelled by the recollection that its very basis rested upon the most selfish ingratitude on his own part lord of his castle and his towers his forests and fields his fair patrimony and noble name his mind would have rejected as a sort of impossibility the idea of elevating to his rank the daughter of a mechanic but when degraded from his nobility and plunged into poverty and difficulties he was ashamed to feel himself not unwilling that this poor girl in the blindness of her affection should abandon all the better prospects of her own settled condition to embrace the precarious and doubtful course which he himself was condemned to the generosity of nigels mind recoiled from the selfishness of the plan of happiness which he projected and he made a strong effort to expel from his thoughts for the rest of the evening this fascinating female or at least not to permit them to dwell upon the perilous circumstance that she was at present the only creature living who seemed to consider him as an object of kindness  he could not however succeed in banishing her from his slumbers when after having spent a weary day he betook himself to a perturbed couch the form of margaret mingled with the wild mass of dreams which his late adventures had suggested and even when copying the lively narrative of sir mungo fancy presented to him the blood bubbling and hissing on the heated iron margaret stood behind him like a spirit of light to breathe healing on the wound at length nature was exhausted by these fantastic creations and nigel slept and slept soundly until awakened in the morning by the sound of a wellknown voice which had often broken his slumbers about the same hour     chapter xxxi     many come up sir with your gentle blood   heres a red stream beneath this coarse blue doublet   that warms the heart as kindly as if drawn   from the far source of old assyrian kings   who first made mankind subject to their sway                            old play  the sounds to which we alluded in our last were no other than the grumbling tones of richie monipliess voice  this worthy like some other persons who rank high in their own opinion was very apt when he could have no other auditor to hold conversation with one who was sure to be a willing listeneri mean with himself he was now brushing and arranging lord glenvarlochs clothes with as much composure and quiet assiduity as if he had never been out of his service and grumbling betwixt whiles to the following purposehumpay time cloak and jerkin were through my handsi question if horsehair has been passed over them since they and i last parted the embroidery finely frayed tooand the gold buttons of the cloakby my conscience and as i am an honest man there is a round dozen of them gane this comes of alsatian frolicsgod keep us with his grace and not give us over to our own devicesi see no sword but that will be in respect of present circumstances  nigel for some time could not help believing that he was still in a dream so improbable did it seem that his domestic whom he supposed to be in scotland should have found him out and obtained access to him in his present circumstances looking through the curtains however he became well assured of the fact when he beheld the stiff and bony length of richie with a visage charged with nearly double its ordinary degree of importance employed sedulously in brushing his masters cloak and refreshing himself with whistling or humming from interval to interval some snatch of an old melancholy scottish balladtune although sufficiently convinced of the identity of the party lord glenvarloch could not help expressing his surprise in the superfluous questionin the name of heaven richie is this you  and wha else suld it be my lord answered richie i dreamna that your lordships levee in this place is like to be attended by ony that are not bounded thereto by duty  i am rather surprised answered nigel that it should be attended by any one at allespecially by you richie for you know that we parted and i thought you had reached scotland long since  i crave your lordships pardon but we have not parted yet nor are soon likely so to do for there gang twa folks votes to the unmaking of a bargain as to the making of ane though it was your lordships pleasure so to conduct yourself that we were like to have parted yet it was not on reflection my will to be gone to be plain if your lordship does not ken when you have a good servant i ken when i have a kind master and to say truth you will be easier served now than ever for there is not much chance of your getting out of bounds  i am indeed bound over to good behaviour said lord glenvarloch with a smile but i hope you will not take advantage of my situation to be too severe on my follies richie  god forbid my lordgod forbid replied richie with an expression betwixt a conceited consciousness of superior wisdom and real feeling especially in consideration of your lordships having a due sense of them i did indeed remonstrate as was my humble duty but i scorn to cast that up to your lordship nowna na i am myself an erring creaturevery conscious of some small weaknessesthere is no perfection in man  but richie said lord glenvarloch although i am much obliged to you for your proffered service it can be of little use to me here and may be of prejudice to yourself  your lordship shall pardon me again said richie whom the relative situation of the parties had invested with ten times his ordinary dogmatism but as i will manage the matter your lordship shall be greatly benefited by my service and i myself no whit prejudiced  i see not how that can be my friend said lord glenvarloch since even as to your pecuniary affairs  touching my pecuniars my lord replied richie i am indifferently weel provided and as it chances my living here will be no burden to your lordship or distress to myself only i crave permission to annex certain conditions to my servitude with your lordship  annex what you will said lord glenvarloch for you are pretty sure to take your own way whether you make any conditions or not since you will not leave me which were i think your wisest course you must and i suppose will serve me only on such terms as you like yourself  all that i ask my lord said richie gravely and with a tone of great moderation is to have the uninterrupted command of my own motions for certain important purposes which i have now in hand always giving your lordship the solace of my company and attendance at such times as may be at once convenient for me and necessary for your service  of which i suppose you constitute yourself sole judge replied nigel smiling  unquestionably my lord answered richie gravely for your lordship can only know what yourself want whereas i who see both sides of the picture ken both what is the best for your affairs and what is the most needful for my own  richie my good friend said nigel i fear this arrangement which places the master much under the disposal of the servant would scarce suit us if we were both at large but a prisoner as i am i may be as well at your disposal as i am at that of so many other persons and so you may come and go as you list for i suppose you will not take my advice to return to your own country and leave me to my fate  the deil be in my feet if i do said monipliesi am not the lad to leave your lordship in foul weather when i followed you and fed upon you through the whole summer day and besides there may be brave days behind for a that has come and gane yet for  its hame and its hame and its hame we fain would be though the cloud is in the lift and the wind is on the lea for the sun through the mirk blinks blithe on mine ee saysill shine on ye yet in our ain country  having sung this stanza in the manner of a balladsinger whose voice has been cracked by matching his windpipe against the bugle of the north blast richie moniplies aided lord glenvarloch to rise attended his toilet with every possible mark of the most solemn and deferential respect then waited upon him at breakfast and finally withdrew pleading that he had business of importance which would detain him for some hours  although lord glenvarloch necessarily expected to be occasionally annoyed by the selfconceit and dogmatism of richie monipliess character yet he could not but feel the greatest pleasure from the firm and devoted attachment which this faithful follower had displayed in the present instance and indeed promised himself an alleviation of the ennui of his imprisonment in having the advantage of his services it was therefore with pleasure that he learned from the warder that his servants attendance would be allowed at all times when the general rules of the fortress permitted the entrance of strangers  in the meanwhile the magnanimous richie moniplies had already reached tower wharf here after looking with contempt on several scullers by whom he was plied and whose services he rejected with a wave of his hand he called with dignity first oars and stirred into activity several lounging tritons of the higher order who had not on his first appearance thought it worth while to accost him with proffers of service he now took possession of a wherry folded his arms within his ample cloak and sitting down in the stern with an air of importance commanded them to row to whitehall stairs having reached the palace in safety he demanded to see master linklater the under clerk of his majestys kitchen the reply was that he was not to be spoken withal being then employed in cooking a mess of cockaleekie for the kings own mouth  tell him said moniplies that it is a dear countryman of his who seeks to converse with him on matter of high import  a dear countryman said linklater when this pressing message was delivered to him well let him come in and be dd that i should say sae this now is some redheaded longlegged gilliewhitefoot frae the west port that hearing of my promotion is come up to be a turnbroche or deputy scullion through my interest it is a great hinderance to any man who would rise in the world to have such friends to hang by his skirts in hope of being towed up along with himha richie moniplies man is it thou and what has brought ye here if they should ken thee for the loon that scared the horse the other day  no more o that neighbour said richiei am just here on the auld errandi maun speak with the king  the king ye are red wud said linklater then shouted to his assistant in the kitchen look to the broches ye knavespisces purgasalsamenta fac macerentur pulchrei will make you understand latin ye knaves as becomes the scullions of king james then in a cautious tone to richies private ear he continued know ye not how ill your master came off the other dayi can tell you that job made some folk shake for their office  weel but laurie ye maun befriend me this time and get this wee bit sifflication slipped into his majestys ain most gracious hand i promise you the contents will be most grateful to him  richie answered linklater you have certainly sworn to say your prayers in the porters lodge with your back bare and twa grooms with dogwhips to cry amen to you  na na laurie lad said richie i ken better what belangs to sifflications than i did yon day and ye will say that yoursell if ye will but get that bit note to the kings hand  i will have neither hand nor foot in the matter said the cautious clerk of the kitchen but there is his majestys mess of cocka leekie just going to be served to him in his closeti cannot prevent you from putting the letter between the gilt bowl and the platter his sacred majesty will see it when he lifts the bowl for he aye drinks out the broth  enough said replied richie and deposited the paper accordingly just before a page entered to carry away the mess to his majesty  aweel aweel neighbour said laurence when the mess was taken away if ye have done ony thing to bring yoursell to the withy or the scourging post it is your ain wilful deed  i will blame no other for it said richie and with that undismayed pertinacity of conceit which made a fundamental part of his character he abode the issue which was not long of arriving  in a few minutes maxwell himself arrived in the apartment and demanded hastily who had placed a writing on the kings trencher linklater denied all knowledge of it but richie moniplies stepping boldly forth pronounced the emphatical confession i am the man  follow me then said maxwell after regarding him with a look of great curiosity  they went up a private staircaseeven that private staircase the privilege of which at court is accounted a nearer road to power than the grandes entrees themselves arriving in what richie described as an ill reddup anteroom the usher made a sign to him to stop while he went into the kings closet their conference was short and as maxwell opened the door to retire richie heard the conclusion of it  ye are sure he is not dangerousi was caught oncebide within call but not nearer the door than within three geometrical cubits if i speak loud start to me like a falconif i speak loun keep your lang lugs out of earshotand now let him come in  richie passed forward at maxwells mute signal and in a moment found himself in the presence of the king most men of richies birth and breeding and many others would have been abashed at finding themselves alone with their sovereign but richie moniplies had an opinion of himself too high to be controlled by any such ideas and having made his stiff reverence he arose once more into his perpendicular height and stood before james as stiff as a hedge stake  have ye gotten them man have ye gotten them said the king in a fluttered state betwixt hope and eagerness and some touch of suspicious fear gie me themgie me thembefore ye speak a word i charge you on your allegiance  richie took a box from his bosom and stooping on one knee presented it to his majesty who hastily opened it and having ascertained that it contained a certain carcanet of rubies with which the reader was formerly made acquainted he could not resist falling into a sort of rapture kissing the gems as if they had been capable of feeling and repeating again and again with childish delight onyx cum prole silexqueonyx cum prole ah my bright and bonny sparklers my heart loups light to see you again he then turned to richie upon whose stoical countenance his majestys demeanour had excited something like a grim smile which james interrupted his rejoicing to reprehend saying take heed sir you are not to laugh at uswe are your anointed sovereign  god forbid that i should laugh said richie composing his countenance into its natural rigidity i did but smile to bring my visage into coincidence and conformity with your majestys physiognomy  ye speak as a dutiful subject and an honest man said the king but what deils your name man  even richie moniplies the son of auld mungo moniplies at the west port of edinburgh who had the honour to supply your majestys mothers royal table as weel as your majestys with flesh and other vivers when time was  aha said the king laughingfor he possessed as a useful attribute of his situation a tenacious memory which recollected every one with whom he was brought into casual contactye are the selfsame traitor who had weelnigh coupit us endlang on the causey of our ain courtyard but we stuck by our mare equam memento rebus in arduis servare weel be not dismayed richie for as many men have turned traitors it is but fair that a traitor now and then suld prove to be contra expectanda a true man how cam ye by our jewels mancam ye on the part of george heriot  in no sort said richie may it please your majesty i come as harry wynd fought utterly for my own hand and on no mans errand as indeed i call no one master save him that made me your most gracious majesty who governs me and the noble nigel olifaunt lord of glenvarloch who maintained me as lang as he could maintain himself poor nobleman  glenvarlochides again exclaimed the king by my honour he lies in ambush for us at every cornermaxwell knocks at the door it is george heriot come to tell us he cannot find these jewelsget thee behind the arras richiestand close mansneeze notcough not breathe notjingling geordie is so damnably ready with his goldends of wisdom and sae accursedly backward with his goldends of siller that by our royal saul we are glad to get a hair in his neck  richie got behind the arras in obedience to the commands of the good natured king while the monarch who never allowed his dignity to stand in the way of a frolic having adjusted with his own hand the tapestry so as to complete the ambush commanded maxwell to tell him what was the matter without maxwells reply was so low as to be lost by richie moniplies the peculiarity of whose situation by no means abated his curiosity and desire to gratify it to the uttermost  let geordie heriot come in said the king and as richie could observe through a slit in the tapestry the honest citizen if not actually agitated was at least discomposed the king whose talent for wit or humour was precisely of a kind to be gratified by such a scene as ensued received his homage with coldness and began to talk to him with an air of serious dignity very different from the usual indecorous levity of his behaviour master heriot he said if we aright remember we opignorated in your hands certain jewels of the crown for a certain sum of moneydid we or did we not  my most gracious sovereign said heriot indisputably your majesty was pleased to do so  the property of which jewels and cimelia remained with us continued the king in the same solemn tone subject only to your claim of advance thereupon which advance being repaid gives us right to repossession of the thing opignorated or pledged or laid in wad voetius vinnius groenwigeneus pagenstecherusall who have treated de contractu opignerationis consentiunt in eundemgree on the same point the roman law the english common law and the municipal law of our ain ancient kingdom of scotland though they split in mair particulars than i could desire unite as strictly in this as the three strands of a twisted rope  may it please your majesty replied heriot it requires not so many learned authorities to prove to any honest man that his interest in a pledge is determined when the money lent is restored  weel sir i proffer restoration of the sum lent and i demand to be repossessed of the jewels pledged with you i gave ye a hint brief while since that this would be essential to my service for as approaching events are like to call us into public it would seem strange if we did not appear with those ornaments which are heirlooms of the crown and the absence whereof is like to place us in contempt and suspicion with our liege subjects  master george heriot seemed much moved by this address of his sovereign and replied with emotion i call heaven to witness that i am totally harmless in this matter and that i would willingly lose the sum advanced so that i could restore those jewels the absence of which your majesty so justly laments had the jewels remained with me the account of them would be easily rendered but your majesty will do me the justice to remember that by your express order i transferred them to another person who advanced a large sum just about the time of my departure for paris the money was pressingly wanted and no other means to come by it occurred to me i told your majesty when i brought the needful supply that the man from whom the monies were obtained was of no good repute and your most princely answer was smelling to the goldnon olet it smells not of the means that have gotten it  weel man said the king but what needs a this din if ye gave my jewels in pledge to such a one suld ye not as a liege subject have taken care that the redemption was in our power and are we to suffer the loss of our cimelia by your neglect besides being exposed to the scorn and censure of our lieges and of the foreign ambassadors  my lord and liege king said heriot god knows if my bearing blame or shame in this matter would keep it from your majesty it were my duty to endure both as a servant grateful for many benefits but when your majesty considers the violent death of the man himself the disappearance of his daughter and of his wealth i trust you will remember that i warned your majesty in humble duty of the possibility of such casualties and prayed you not to urge me to deal with him on your behalf  but you brought me nae better means said the kinggeordie ye brought me nae better means i was like a deserted man what could i do but grip to the first siller that offered as a drowning man grasps to the willowwand that comes readiestand now man what for have ye not brought back the jewels they are surely above ground if ye wad make strict search  all strict search has been made may it please your majesty replied the citizen hue and cry has been sent out everywhere and it has been found impossible to recover them  difficult ye mean geordie not impossible replied the king for that whilk is impossible is either naturally so exempli gratia to make two into three or morally so as to make what is truth falsehood but what is only difficult may come to pass with assistance of wisdom and patience as for example jingling geordie look here and he displayed the recovered treasure to the eyes of the astonished jeweller exclaiming with great triumph what say ye to that jinglerby my sceptre and crown the man stares as if he took his native prince for a warlock us that are the very malleus maleficarum the contunding and contriturating hammer of all witches sorcerers magicians and the like he thinks we are taking a touch of the black art outsellsbut gang thy way honest geordie thou art a good plain man but nane of the seven sages of greece gang thy way and mind the soothfast word which you spoke small time syne that there is one in this land that comes near to solomon king of israel in all his gifts except in his love to strange women forby the daughter of pharaoh  if heriot was surprised at seeing the jewels so unexpectedly produced at the moment the king was upbraiding him for the loss of them this allusion to the reflection which had escaped him while conversing with lord glenvarloch altogether completed his astonishment and the king was so delighted with the superiority which it gave him at the moment that he rubbed his hands chuckled and finally his sense of dignity giving way to the full feeling of triumph he threw himself into his easychair and laughed with unconstrained violence till he lost his breath and the tears ran plentifully down his cheeks as he strove to recover it meanwhile the royal cachinnation was echoed out by a discordant and portentous laugh from behind the arras like that of one who little accustomed to give way to such emotions feels himself at some particular impulse unable either to control or to modify his obstreperous mirth heriot turned his head with new surprise towards the place from which sounds so unfitting the presence of a monarch seemed to burst with such emphatic clamour  the king too somewhat sensible of the indecorum rose up wiped his eyes and callingtodlowrie come out o your den he produced from behind the arras the length of richie moniplies still laughing with as unrestrained mirth as ever did gossip at a country christening whisht man whisht man said the king ye needna nicher that gait like a cusser at a caup o corn

and silver gems rubies and the like of that and yet ye kenna how to come by them when they are lostay aylook at them manlook at them they are a right and tight sound and round not a doublet crept in amongst them  george heriot when his first surprise was over was too old a courtier to interrupt the kings imaginary triumph although he darted a look of some displeasure at honest richie who still continued on what is usually termed the broad grin he quietly examined the stones and finding them all perfect he honestly and sincerely congratulated his majesty on the recovery of a treasure which could not have been lost without some dishonour to the crown and asked to whom he himself was to pay the sums for which they had been pledged observing that he had the money by him in readiness  ye are in a deevil of a hurry when there is paying in the case geordie said the kingwhats a the haste man the jewels were restored by an honest kindly countryman of ours there he stands and wha kens if he wants the money on the nail or if he might not be as weel pleased wi a bit rescript on our treasury some six months hence ye ken that our exchequer is even at a low ebb just now and ye cry pay pay pay as if we had all the mines of ophir  please your majesty said heriot if this man has the real right to these monies it is doubtless at his will to grant forbearance if he will but when i remember the guise in which i first saw him with a tattered cloak and a broken head i can hardly conceive itare not you richie moniplies with the kings favour  even sae master heriotof the ancient and honourable house of castle collop near to the west port of edinburgh answered richie  why please your majesty he is a poor servingman said heriot this money can never be honestly at his disposal  what for no said the king wad ye have naebody spraickle up the brae but yoursell geordie your ain cloak was thin enough when ye cam here though ye have lined it gay and weel and for servingmen there has mony a redshank cam over the tweed wi his masters wallet on his shoulders that now rustles it wi his six followers behind him there stands the man himsell speer at him geordie  his may not be the best

reasonable unless ye propose to advance more money for our present occasions  my liege answered richie moniplies the owner of these monies places them at your majestys command free of all pledge or usage as long as it is your royal pleasure providing your majesty will condescend to show some favour to the noble lord glenvarloch presently prisoner in your royal tower of london  how manhowmanhow man exclaimed the king reddening and stammering but with emotions more noble than those by which he was sometimes agitatedwhat is that you dare to say to ussell our justicesell our mercyand we a crowned king sworn to do justice to our subjects in the gate and responsible for our stewardship to him that is over all kingshere he reverently looked up touched his bonnet and continued with some

tongue in terrorem of othersawa with him geordiepay him plack and bawbee out of our monies in your hands and let them care that come ahint  richie who had counted with the utmost certainty upon the success of this masterstroke of policy was like an architect whose whole scaffolding at once gives way under him he caught however at what he thought might break his fall not only the sum for which the jewels were pledged he said but the double of it if required should be placed at his majestys command and even without hope or condition of repayment if only  but the king did not allow him to complete the sentence crying out with greater vehemence than before as if he dreaded the stability of his own good resolutionsawa wi himswith awa wi him it is time he were gane if he doubles his bode that gate and for your life letna steenie or ony of them hear a word from his mouth for wha kens what trouble that might bring me into ne inducas in tentationemvade retro sathanasamen  in obedience to the royal mandate george heriot hurried the abashed petitioner out of the presence and out of the palace and when they were in the palaceyard the citizen remembering with some resentment the airs of equality which richie had assumed towards him in the commencement of the scene which had just taken place could not forbear to retaliate by congratulating him with an ironical smile on his favour at court and his improved grace in presenting a supplication  never fash your beard about that master george heriot said richie totally undismayed but tell me when and where i am to sifflicate you for eight hundred pounds sterling for which these jewels stood engaged  the instant that you bring with you the real owner of the money replied heriot whom it is important that i should see on more accounts than one  then will i back to his majesty said richie moniplies stoutly and get either the money or the pledge back again i am fully commissionate to act in that matter  it may be so richie said the citizen and perchance it may not be so neither for your tales are not all gospel and therefore be assured i will see that it is so ere i pay you that large sum of money i shall give you an acknowledgment for it and i will keep it prestable at a moments warning but my good richard moniplies of castle collop near the west port of edinburgh in the meantime i am bound to return to his majesty on matters of weight so speaking and mounting the stair to reenter the palace he added by way of summing up the wholegeorge heriot is over old a cock to be caught with chaff  richie stood petrified when he beheld him reenter the palace and found himself as he supposed left in the lurchnow plague on ye he muttered for a cunning auld skinflint that because ye are an honest man yoursell forsooth must needs deal with all the world as if they were knaves but deil be in me if ye beat me yetgude guide us yonder comes laurie linklater next and he will be on me about the sifflicationi winna stand him by saint andrew  so saying and changing the haughty stride with which he had that morning entered the precincts of the palace into a skulking shamble he retreated for his wherry which was in attendance with speed which to use the approved phrase on such occasions greatly resembled a flight     chapter xxxii   benedict this looks not like a nuptial                     much ado about nothing  master george heriot had no sooner returned to the kings apartment than james inquired of maxwell if the earl of huntinglen was in attendance and receiving an answer in the affirmative desired that he should be admitted the old scottish lord having made his reverence in the usual manner the king extended his hand to be kissed and then began to address him in a tone of great sympathy  we told your lordship in our secret epistle of this morning written with our ain hand in testimony we have neither pretermitted nor forgotten your faithful service that we had that to communicate to you that would require both patience and fortitude to endure and therefore exhorted you to peruse some of the most pithy passages of seneca and of boethius de consolatione that the back may be as we say fitted for the burdenthis we commend to you from our ain experience  non ignara mail miseris succurrere disco  sayeth dido and i might say in my own person non ignarus but to change the gender would affect the prosody whereof our southern subjects are tenacious so my lord of huntinglen i trust you have acted by our advice and studied patience before ye need itvenienti occurrite morbomix the medicament when the disease is coming on  may it please your majesty answered lord huntinglen i am more of an old soldier than a scholarand if my own rough nature will not bear me out in any calamity i hope i shall have grace to try a text of scripture to boot  ay man are you there with your bears said the king the bible man touching his cap is indeed principium et fonsbut it is pity your lordship cannot peruse it in the original for although we did ourselves promote that work of translationsince ye may read at the beginning of every bible that when some palpable clouds of darkness were thought like to have overshadowed the land after the setting of that bright occidental star queen elizabeth yet our appearance like that of the sun in his strength instantly dispelled these surmised mistsi say that although as therein mentioned we countenanced the preaching of the gospel and especially the translation of the scriptures out of the original sacred tongues yet nevertheless we ourselves confess to have found a comfort in consulting them in the original hebrew whilk we do not perceive even in the latin version of the septuagint much less in the english traduction  please your majesty said lord huntinglen if your majesty delays communicating the bad news with which your honoured letter threatens me until i am capable to read hebrew like your majesty i fear i shall die in ignorance of the misfortune which hath befallen or is about to befall my house  you will learn it but too soon my lord replied the king i grieve to say it but your son dalgarno whom i thought a very saint as he was so much with steenie and baby charles hath turned out a very villain  villain repeated lord huntinglen and though he instantly checked himself and added but it is your majesty speaks the word the effect of his first tone made the king step back as if he had received a blow he also recovered himself again and said in the pettish way which usually indicated his displeasureyes my lord it was we that said itnon surdo caniswe are not deafwe pray you not to raise your voice in speech with usthere is the bonny memorialread and judge for yourself  the king then thrust into the old noblemans hand a paper containing the story of the lady hermione with the evidence by which it was supported detailed so briefly and clearly that the infamy of lord dalgarno the lover by whom she had been so shamefully deceived seemed undeniable but a father yields not up so easily the cause of his son  may it please your majesty he said why was this tale not sooner told this woman hath been here for yearswherefore was the claim on my son not made the instant she touched english ground  tell him how that came about geordie said the king dressing heriot  i grieve to distress my lord huntinglen said heriot but i must speak the truth for a long time the lady hermione could not brook the idea of making her situation public and when her mind became changed in that particular it was necessary to recover the evidence of the false marriage and letters and papers connected with it which when she came to paris and just before i saw her she had deposited with a correspondent of her father in that city he became afterwards bankrupt and in consequence of that misfortune the ladys papers passed into other hands and it was only a few days since i traced and recovered them without these documents of evidence it would have been imprudent for her to have preferred her complaint favoured as lord dalgarno is by powerful friends  ye are saucy to say sae said the king i ken what ye mean weel eneughye think steenie wad hae putten the weight of his foot into the scales of justice and garrd them whomle the bucketye forget geordie wha it is whose hand uphaulds them and ye do poor steenie the mair wrang for he confessed it ance before us and our privy council that dalgarno would have put the quean aff on him the puir simple bairn making him trow that she was a lightolove in whilk mind he remained assured even when he parted from her albeit steenie might hae weel thought ane of thae cattle wadna hae resisted the like of him  the lady hermione said george heriot has always done the utmost justice to the conduct of the duke who although strongly possessed with prejudice against her character yet scorned to avail himself of her distress and on the contrary supplied her with the means of extricating herself from her difficulties  it was een like himsellblessings on his bonny face said the king and i believed this ladys tale the mair readily my lord huntinglen that she spake nae ill of steenieand to make a lang tale short my lord it is the opinion of our council and ourself as weel as of baby charles and steenie that your son maun amend his wrong by wedding this lady or undergo such disgrace and discountenance as we can bestow  the person to whom he spoke was incapable of answering him he stood before the king motionless and glaring with eyes of which even the lids seemed immovable as if suddenly converted into an ancient statue of the times of chivalry so instantly had his hard features and strong limbs been arrested into rigidity by the blow he had received and in a second afterwards like the same statue when the lightning breaks upon it he sunk at once to the ground with a heavy groan the king was in the utmost alarm called upon heriot and maxwell for help and presence of mind not being his forte ran to and fro in his cabinet exclaimingmy ancient and beloved servantwho saved our anointed self vae atque dolor my lord of huntinglen look uplook up man and your son may marry the queen of sheba if he will  by this time maxwell and heriot had raised the old nobleman and placed him on a chair while the king observing that he began to recover himself continued his consolations more methodically  haud up your headhaud up your head and listen to your ain kind native prince if there is shame man it comesna emptyhandedthere is siller to gild ita gude tocher and no that bad a pedigreeif she has been a loon it was your son made her sae and he can make her an honest woman again  these suggestions however reasonable in the common case gave no comfort to lord huntinglen if indeed he fully comprehended them but the blubbering of his goodnatured old master which began to accompany and interrupt his royal speech produced more rapid effect the large tear gushed reluctantly from his eye as he kissed the withered hands which the king weeping with less dignity and restraint abandoned to him first alternately and then both together until the feelings of the man getting entirely the better of the sovereigns sense of dignity he grasped and shook lord huntinglens hands with the sympathy of an equal and a familiar friend  compone lachrymas said the monarch be patient man be patient the council and baby charles and steenie may a gang to the deevil he shall not marry her since it moves you so deeply  he shall marry her by god answered the earl drawing himself up dashing the tear from his eyes and endeavouring to recover his composure i pray your majestys pardon but he shall marry her with her dishonour for her dowry were she the veriest courtezan in all spainif he gave his word he shall make his word good were it to the meanest creature that haunts the streetshe shall do it or my own dagger shall take the life that i gave him if he could stoop to use so base a fraud though to deceive infamy let him wed infamy  no no the monarch continued to insinuate things are not so bad as thatsteenie himself never thought of her being a streetwalker even when he thought the worst of her  if it can at all console my lord of huntinglen said the citizen i can assure him of this ladys good birth and most fair and unspotted fame  i am sorry for it said lord huntinglenthen interrupting himself he saidheaven forgive me for being ungrateful for such comfort but i am wellnigh sorry she should be as you represent her so much better than the villain deserves to be condemned to wed beauty and innocence and honest birth  ay and wealth my lordwealth insinuated the king is a better sentence than his perfidy has deserved  it is long said the embittered father since i saw he was selfish and hardhearted but to be a perjured liari never dreaded that such a blot would have fallen on my race i will never look on him again  hoot ay my lord hoot ay said the king ye maun tak him to task roundly i grant you should speak more in the vein of demea than mitio vi nempe et via pervulgata patrum but as for not seeing him again and he your only son that is altogether out of reason i tell ye man but i would not for a boddle that baby charles heard me that he might gie the glaiks to half the lasses of lonnun ere i could find in my heart speak such harsh words as you have said of this deil of a dalgarno of yours  may it please your majesty to permit me to retire said lord huntinglen and dispose of the case according to your own royal sense of justice for i desire no favour for him  aweel my lord so be it and if your lordship can think added the monarch of any thing in our power which might comfort you  your majestys gracious sympathy said lord huntinglen has already comforted me as far as earth can the rest must be from the king of kings  to him i commend you my auld and faithful servant said james with emotion as the earl withdrew from his presence the king remained fixed in thought for some time and then said to heriot jingling geordie ye ken all the privy doings of our court and have dune so these thirty years though like a wise man ye hear and see and say nothing now there is a thing i fain wad ken in the way of philosophical inquirydid you ever hear of the umquhile lady huntinglen the departed countess of this noble earl ganging a wee bit gleed in her walk through the world i mean in the way of slipping a foot casting a leglingirth or the like ye understand me  footnote a leglingirth is the lowest hoop upon a leglin or milk pail allan ramsay applies the phrase in the same metaphorical sense  or bairns can read they first maun spell  i learnd this frae my mammy  and cast a leglingirth mysell  lang ere i married tammy                               christs kirk on the green  on my word as an honest man said george heriot somewhat surprised at the question i never heard her wronged by the slightest breath of suspicion she was a worthy lady very circumspect in her walk and lived in great concord with her husband save that the good countess was something of a puritan and kept more company with ministers than was altogether agreeable to lord huntinglen who is as your majesty well knows a man of the old rough world that will drink and swear  o geordie exclaimed the king these are auldwarld frailties of whilk we dare not pronounce even ourselves absolutely free but the warld grows worse from day to day geordie the juveniles of this age may weel say with the poet  aetas parentum pejor avis tulit  nos nequiores  this dalgarno does not drink so much or swear so much as his father but he wenches geordie and he breaks his word and oath baith as to what you say of the leddy and the ministers we are a fallible creatures geordie priests and kings as weel as others and wha kens but what that may account for the difference between this dalgarno and his father the earl is the vera soul of honour and cares nae mair for warlds gear than a noble hound for the quest of a foulmart but as for his son he was like to brazen us a outourselves steenie baby charles and our counciltill he heard of the tocher and then by my kingly crown he lap like a cock at a grossart these are discrepancies betwixt parent and son not to be accounted for naturally according to baptista porta michael scott de secretis and othersah jingling geordie if your clouting the caldron and jingling on pots pans and veshels of all manner of metal hadna jingled a your grammar out of your head i could have touched on that matter to you at mair length  heriot was too plainspoken to express much concern for the loss of his grammar learning on this occasion but after modestly hinting that he had seen many men who could not fill their fathers bonnet though no one had been suspected of wearing their fathers nightcap he inquired whether lord dalgarno had consented to do the lady hermione justice  troth man i have small doubt that he will quoth the king i gave him the schedule of her worldly substance which you delivered to us in the council and we allowed him halfanhour to chew the cud upon that it is rare reading for bringing him to reason i left baby charles and steenie laying his duty before him and if he can resist doing what they desire himwhy i wish he would teach me the gate of it o geordie jingling geordie it was grand to hear baby charles laying down the guilt of dissimulation and steenie lecturing on the turpitude of incontinence  i am afraid said george heriot more hastily than prudently i might have thought of the old proverb of satan reproving sin  deil hae our saul neighbour said the king reddening but ye are not blate i gie ye license to speak freely and by our saul ye do not let the privilege become lost non utendoit will suffer no negative prescription in your hands is it fit think ye that baby charles should let his thoughts be publicly seennonoprinces thoughts are arcana imperiiqui nescit dissimulare nescit regnare every liege subject is bound to speak the whole truth to the king but there is nae reciprocity of obligationand for steenie having been whiles a dikelouper at a time is it for you who are his goldsmith and to whom i doubt he awes an uncomatable sum to cast that up to him  heriot did not feel himself called on to play the part of zeno and sacrifice himself for upholding the cause of moral truth he did not desert it however by disavowing his words but simply expressed sorrow for having offended his majesty with which the placable king was sufficiently satisfied  and now geordie man quoth he we will to this culprit and hear what he has to say for himself for i will see the job cleared this blessed day ye maun come wi me for your evidence may be wanted  the king led the way accordingly into a larger apartment where the prince the duke of buckingham and one or two privy counsellors were seated at a table before which stood lord dalgarno in an attitude of as much elegant ease and indifference as could be expressed considering the stiff dress and manners of the times  all rose and bowed reverently while the king to use a north country word expressive of his mode of locomotion toddled to his chair or throne making a sign to heriot to stand behind him  we hope said his majesty that lord dalgarno stands prepared to do justice to this unfortunate lady and to his own character and honour  may i humbly inquire the penalty said lord dalgarno  in case i should unhappily find compliance with your majestys demands impossible  banishment frae our court my lord said the king frae our court and our countenance  unhappy exile that i may be said lord dalgarno in a tone of subdued ironyi will at least carry your majestys picture with me for i shall never see such another king and banishment my lord said the prince sternly from these our dominions  that must be by form of law please your royal highness said dalgarno with an affectation of deep respect and i have not heard that there is a statute compelling us under such penalty to marry every woman we may play the fool with perhaps his grace of buckingham can tell me  you are a villain dalgarno said the haughty and vehement favourite  fie my lord fieto a prisoner and in presence of your royal and paternal gossip said lord dalgarno but i will cut this deliberation short i have looked over this schedule of the goods and effects of erminia pauletti daughter of the late nobleyes he is called the noble or i read wrong giovanni pauletti of the houee of sansovino in genoa and of the no less noble lady maud olifaunt of the house of glenvarlochwell i declare that i was precontracted in spain to this noble lady and there has passed betwixt us some certain proelibatio matrimonii and now what more does this grave assembly require of me  that you should repair the gross and infamous wrong you have done the lady by marrying her within this hour said the prince  o may it please your royal highness answered dalgarno i have a trifling relationship with an old earl who calls himself my father who may claim some vote in the matter alas every son is not blessed with an obedient parent he hazarded a slight glance towards the throne to give meaning to his last words  we have spoken ourselves with lord huntinglen said the king and are authorised to consent in his name  i could never have expected this intervention of a proxaneta which the vulgar translate blackfoot of such eminent dignity said dalgarno scarce concealing a sneer and my father hath consented he was wont to say ere we left scotland that the blood of huntinglen and of glenvarloch would not mingle were they poured into the same basin perhaps he has a mind to try the experiment  my lord said james we will not be longer trifled withwill you instantly and sine mora take this lady to your wife in our chapel  statim atque instanter answered lord dalgarno for i perceive by doing so i shall obtain power to render great services to the commonwealthi shall have acquired wealth to supply the wants of your majesty and a fair wife to be at the command of his grace of buckingham  the duke rose passed to the end of the table where lord dalgarno was standing and whispered in his ear you have placed a fair sister at my command ere now  this taunt cut deep through lord dalgarnos assumed composure he started as if an adder had stung him but instantly composed himself and fixing on the dukes still smiling countenance an eye which spoke unutterable hatred he pointed the forefinger of his left hand to the hilt of his sword but in a manner which could scarce be observed by any one save buckingham the duke gave him another smile of bitter scorn and returned to his seat in obedience to the commands of the king who continued calling out sit down steenie sit down i command yewe will hae nae harnsbreaking here  your majesty needs not fear my patience said lord dalgarno and that i may keep it the better i will not utter another word in this presence save those enjoined to me in that happy portion of the prayerbook which begins with dearly beloved and ends with amazement  you are a hardened villain dalgarno said the king and were i the lass by my fathers saul i would rather brook the stain of having been your concubine than run the risk of becoming your wife but she shall be under our special protectioncome my lords we will ourselves see this blithesome bridal he gave the signal by rising and moved towards the door followed by the train lord dalgarno attended speaking to none and spoken to by no one yet seeming as easy and unembarrassed in his gait and manner as if in reality a happy bridegroom  they reached the chapel by a private entrance which communicated from the royal apartment the bishop of winchester in his pontifical dress stood beside the altar on the other side supported by monna paula the colourless faded halflifeless form of the lady hermione or erminia pauletti lord dalgarno bowed profoundly to her and the prince observing the horror with which she regarded him walked up and said to her with much dignitymadam ere you put yourself under the authority of this man let me inform you he hath in the fullest degree vindicated your honour so far as concerns your former intercourse it is for you to consider whether you will put your fortune and happiness into the hands of one who has shown himself unworthy of all trust  the lady with much difficulty found words to make reply i owe to his majestys goodness she said the care of providing me some reservation out of my own fortune for my decent sustenance the rest cannot be better disposed than in buying back the fair fame of which i am deprived and the liberty of ending my life in peace and seclusion  the contract has been drawn up said the king under our own eye specially discharging the potestas maritalis and agreeing they shall live separate so buckle them my lord bishop as fast as you can that they may sunder again the sooner  the bishop accordingly opened his book and commenced the marriage ceremony under circumstances so novel and so inauspicious the responses of the bride were only expressed by inclinations of the head and body while those of the bridegroom were spoken boldly and distinctly with a tone resembling levity if not scorn when it was concluded lord dalgarno advanced as if to salute the bride but seeing that she drew back in fear and abhorrence he contented himself with making her a low bow he then drew up his form to its height and stretched himself as if examining the power of his limbs but elegantly and without any forcible change of attitude i could caper yet he said though i am in fettersbut they are of gold and lightly wornwell i see all eyes look cold on me and it is time i should withdraw the sun shines elsewhere than in england but first i must ask how this fair lady dalgarno is to be bestowed methinks it is but decent i should know is she to be sent to the harem of my lord duke or is this worthy citizen as before  hold thy base ribald tongue said his father lord huntinglen who had kept in the background during the ceremony and now stepping suddenly forward caught the lady by the arm and confronted her unworthy husbandthe lady dalgarno he continued shall remain as a widow in my house a widow i esteem her as much as if the grave had closed over her dishonoured husband  lord dalgarno exhibited momentary symptoms of extreme confusion and said in a submissive tone if you my lord can wish me dead i cannot though your heir return the compliment few of the firstborn of israel he added recovering himself from the single touch of emotion he had displayed can say so much with truth but i will convince you ere i go that i am a true descendant of a house famed for its memory of injuries  i marvel your majesty will listen to him longer said prince charles methinks we have heard enough of his daring insolence  but james who took the interest of a true gossip in such a scene as was now passing could not bear to cut the controversy short but imposed silence on his son with whisht baby charlesthere is a good bairn whishti want to hear what the frontless loon can say  only sir said dalgarno that but for one single line in this schedule all else that it contains could not have bribed me to take that womans hand into mine  that line maun have been the summa totalis said the king  not so sire replied dalgarno the sum total might indeed have been an object for consideration even to a scottish king at no very distant period but it would have had little charms for me save that i see here an entry which gives me the power of vengeance over the family of glenvarloch and learn from it that yonder pale bride when she put the weddingtorch into my hand gave me the power of burning her mothers house to ashes  how is that said the king what is he speaking about jingling geordie  this friendly citizen my liege said lord dalgarno hath expended a sum belonging to my lady and now i thank heaven to me in acquiring a certain mortgage or wanset over the estate of glenvarloch which if it be not redeemed before tomorrow at noon will put me in possession of the fair demesnes of those who once called themselves our houses rivals  can this be true said the king  it is even but too true please your majesty answered the citizen the lady hermione having advanced the money for the original creditor i was obliged in honour and honesty to take the rights to her and doubtless they pass to her husband  but the warrant man said the kingthe warrant on our exchequer couldna that supply the lad wi the means of redemption  unhappily my liege he has lost it or disposed of itit is not to be found he is the most unlucky youth  this is a proper spot of work said the king beginning to amble about and play with the points of his doublet and hose in expression of dismay we cannot aid him without paying our debts twice over and we have in the present state of our exchequer scarce the means of paying them once  you have told me news said lord dalgarno but i will take no advantage  do not said his father be a bold villain since thou must be one and seek revenge with arms and not with the usurers weapons  pardon me my lord said lord dalgarno pen and ink are now my surest means of vengeance and more land is won by the lawyer with the ramskin than by the andrea ferrara with his sheepshead handle but as i said before i will take no advantages i will await in town to morrow near covent garden if any one will pay the redemptionmoney to my scrivener with whom the deeds lie the better for lord glenvarloch if not i will go forward on the next day and travel with all dispatch to the north to take possession  take a fathers malison with you unhappy wretch said lord huntinglen  and a kings who is pater patriae said james  i trust to bear both lightly said lord dalgarno and bowing around him he withdrew while all present oppressed and as it were overawed by his determined effrontery found they could draw breath more freely when he at length relieved them of his society lord huntinglen applying himself to comfort his new daughterinlaw withdrew with her also and the king with his privycouncil whom he had not dismissed again returned to his councilchamber though the hour was unusually late heriots attendance was still commanded but for what reason was not explained to him     chapter xxxiii   ill play the eavesdropper                 richard iii act v scene 3  james had no sooner resumed his seat at the councilboard than he began to hitch in his chair cough use his handkerchief and make other intimations that he meditated a long speech the council composed themselves to the beseeming degree of attention charles as strict in his notions of decorum as his father was indifferent to it fixed himself in an attitude of rigid and respectful attention while the haughty favourite conscious of his power over both father and son stretched himself more easily on his seat and in assuming an appearance of listening seemed to pay a debt to ceremonial rather than to duty  i doubt not my lords said the monarch that some of you may be thinking the hour of refection is past and that it is time to ask with the slave in the comedyquid de symbolonevertheless to do justice and exercise judgment is our meat and drink and now we are to pray your wisdom to consider the case of this unhappy youth lord glenvarloch and see whether consistently with our honour any thing can be done in his favour  i am surprised at your majestys wisdom making the inquiry said the duke it is plain this dalgarno hath proved one of the most insolent villains on earth and it must therefore be clear that if lord glenvarloch had run him through the body there would but have been out of the world a knave who had lived in it too long i think lord glenvarloch hath had much wrong and i regret that by the persuasions of this false fellow i have myself had some hand in it  ye speak like a child steeniei mean my lord of buckingham answered the king and as one that does not understand the logic of the schools for an action may be inconsequential or even meritorious quoad hominem that is as touching him upon whom it is acted and yet most criminal quoad locum or considering the place wherein it is done as a man may lawfully dance chrighty beardie or any other dance in a tavern but not inter parietes ecclesiae so that though it may have been a good deed to have sticked lord dalgarno being such as he has shown himself anywhere else yet it fell under the plain statute when violence was offered within the verge of the court for let me tell you my lords the statute against striking would be of no small use in our court if it could be eluded by justifying the person stricken to be a knave it is much to be lamented that i ken nae court in christendom where knaves are not to be found and if men are to break the peace under pretence of beating them why it will rain jeddart staves footnote the oldfashioned weapon called the jeddart staff was a species of battleaxe of a very great tempest it is said in the south of scotland that it rains jeddart staffs as in england the common people talk of its raining cats and dogs in our very antechamber  what your majesty says replied prince charles is marked with your usual wisdomthe precincts of palaces must be sacred as well as the persons of kings which are respected even in the most barbarous nations as being one step only beneath their divinities but your majestys will can control the severity of this and every other law and it is in your power on consideration of his case to grant the rash young man a free pardon  rem acu tetigisti carole mi puerule answered the king and know my lords that we have by a shrewd device and gift of our own already sounded the very depth of this lord glenvarlochs disposition i trow there be among you some that remember my handling in the curious case of my lady lake and how i trimmed them about the story of hearkening behind the arras now this put me to cogitation and i remembered me of having read that dionysius king of syracuse whom historians call tyrannos which signifieth not in the greek tongue as in ours a truculent usurper but a royal king who governs it may be something more strictly than we and other lawful monarchs whom the ancients termed basileisnow this dionysius of syracuse caused cunning workmen to build for himself a luggdye ken what that is my lord bishop  a cathedral i presume to guess answered the bishop  what the deil mani crave your lordships pardon for swearingbut it was no cathedralonly a lurkingplace called the kings lugg or ear where he could sit undescried and hear the converse of his prisoners now sirs in imitation of this dionysius whom i took for my pattern the rather that he was a great linguist and grammarian and taught a school with good applause after his abdication either he or his successor of the same name it matters not whilki have caused them to make a lugg up at the stateprison of the tower yonder more like a pulpit than a cathedral my lord bishopand communicating with the arras behind the lieutenants chamber where we may sit and privily hear the discourse of such prisoners as are pent up there for stateoffences and so creep into the very secrets of our enemies  the prince cast a glance towards the duke expressive of great vexation and disgust buckingham shrugged his shoulders but the motion was so slight as to be almost imperceptible  weel my lords ye ken the fray at the hunting this morningi shall not get out of the trembling exies until i have a sound nights sleep just after that they bring ye in a pretty page that had been found in the park we were warned against examining him ourselves by the anxious care of those around us nevertheless holding our life ever at the service of these kingdoms we commanded all to avoid the room the rather that we suspected this boy to be a girl what think ye my lordsfew of you would have thought i had a hawks eye for sic gear but we thank god that though we are old we know so much of such toys as may beseem a man of decent gravity weel my lords we questioned this maiden in male attire ourselves and i profess it was a very pretty interrogatory and well followed for though she at first professed that she assumed this disguise in order to countenance the woman who should present us with the lady hermiones petition for whom she professed entire affection yet when we suspecting anguis in herba did put her to the very question she was compelled to own a virtuous attachment for glenvarlochides in such a pretty passion of shame and fear that we had much ado to keep our own eyes from keeping company with hers in weeping also she laid before us the false practices of this dalgarno towards glenvarlochides inveigling him into houses of ill resort and giving him evil counsel under pretext of sincere friendship whereby the inexperienced lad was led to do what was prejudicial to himself and offensive to us but however prettily she told her tale we determined not altogether to trust to her narration but rather to try the experiment whilk we had devised for such occasions and having ourselves speedily passed from greenwich to the tower we constituted ourselves eavesdropper as it is called to observe what should pass between glenvarlochides and his page whom we caused to be admitted to his apartment well judging that if they were of counsel together to deceive us it could not be but something of it would spunk outand what think ye we saw my lordsnaething for you to sniggle and laugh at steeniefor i question if you could have played the temperate and christianlike part of this poor lad glenvarloch he might be a father of the church in comparison of you manand then to try his patience yet farther we loosed on him a courtier and a citizen that is sir mungo malagrowther and our servant george heriot here wha dang the poor lad about and didna greatly spare our royal selvesyou mind geordie what you said about the wives and concubines but i forgie ye man nae need of kneeling i forgie yethe readier that it regards a certain particular whilk as it added not much to solomons credit the lack of it cannot be said to impinge on ours aweel my lords for all temptation of sore distress and evil ensample this poor lad never loosed his tongue on us to say one unbecoming wordwhich inclines us the rather acting always by your wise advice to treat this affair of the park as a thing done in the heat of blood and under strong provocation and therefore to confer our free pardon on lord glenvarloch  i am happy your gracious majesty said the duke of buckingham has arrived at that conclusion though i could never have guessed at the road by which you attained it  i trust said prince charles that it is not a path which your majesty will think it consistent with your high dignity to tread frequently  never while i live again baby charles that i give you my royal word on they say that hearkeners hear ill tales of themselvesby my saul my very ears are tingling wi that auld sorrow sir mungos sarcasms he called us closefisted steeniei am sure you can contradict that but it is mere envy in the auld mutilated sinner because he himself has neither a noble to hold in his loof nor fingers to close on it if he had here the king lost recollection of sir mungos irreverence in chuckling over his own wit and only farther alluded to it by saying we must give the old maunderer bos in linguamsomething to stop his mouth or he will rail at us from dan to beershebaand now my lords let our warrant of mercy to lord glenvarloch be presently expedited and he put to his freedom and as his estate is likely to go so sleaveless a gate we will consider what means of favour we can show himmy lords i wish you an appetite to an early supperfor our labours have approached that termbaby charles and steenie you will remain till our coucheemy lord bishop you will be pleased to stay to bless our meatgeordie heriot a word with you apart  his majesty then drew the citizen into a corner while the counsellors those excepted who had been commanded to remain made their obeisance and withdrew geordie said the king my good and trusty servanthere he busied his fingers much with the points and ribbons of his dressye see that we have granted from our own natural sense of right and justice that which yon longbacked fallow moniplies i think they ca him proffered to purchase from us with a mighty bribe whilk we refused as being a crowned king who wad neither sell our justice nor our mercy for pecuniar consideration now what think ye should be the upshot of this  my lord glenvarlochs freedom and his restoration to your majestys favour said heriot  i ken that said the king peevishly ye are very dull today i mean what do you think this fallow moniplies should think about the matter  surely that your majesty is a most good and gracious sovereign answered heriot  we had need to be gude and gracious baith said the king still more pettishly that have idiots about us that cannot understand what we mint at unless we speak it out in braid lowlands see this chield moniplies sir and tell him what we have done for lord glenvarloch in whom he takes such part out of our own gracious motion though we refused to do it on ony proffer of private advantage now you may put it till him as if of your own mind whether it will be a gracious or a dutiful part in him to press us for present payment of the two or three hundred miserable pounds for whilk we were obliged to opignorate our jewels indeed mony men may think ye wad do the part of a good citizen if you took it on yourself to refuse him payment seeing he hath had what he professed to esteem full satisfaction and considering moreover that it is evident he hath no pressing need of the money whereof we have much necessity  george heriot sighed internally o my master thought hemy dear master is it then fated you are never to indulge any kingly or noble sentiment without its being sullied by some afterthought of interested selfishness  the king troubled himself not about what he thought but taking him by the collar saidye ken my meaning now jinglerawa wi ye you are a wise manmanage it your ain gatebut forget not our present straits the citizen made his obeisance and withdrew  and now bairns said the king what do you look upon each other forand what have you got to ask of your dear dad and gossip  only said the prince that it would please your majesty to command the lurkingplace at the prison to be presently built upthe groans of a captive should not be brought in evidence against him  what build up my lugg baby charles and yet better deaf than hear ill tales of oneself so let them build it up hard and fast without delay the rather that my back is sair with sitting in it for a whole hourand now let us see what the cooks have been doing for us bonny bairns     chapter xxxiv     to this brave man the knight repairs   for counsel in his law affairs   and found him mounted in his pew   with books and money placed for show   like nesteggs to make clients lay   and for his false opinion pay                         hudibras  our readers may recollect a certain smoothtongued lankhaired buckramsuited scottish scrivener who in the earlier part of this history appeared in the character of a protege of george heriot it is to his house we are about to remove but times have changed with him the petty booth hath become a chamber of importancethe buckram suit is changed into black velvet and although the wearer retains his puritanical humility and politeness to clients of consequence he can now look others broad in the face and treat them with a full allowance of superior opulence and the insolence arising from it it was but a short period that had achieved these alterations nor was the party himself as yet entirely accustomed to them but the change was becoming less embarrassing to him with every days practice among other acquisitions of wealth you may see one of davy ramsays best timepieces on the table and his eye is frequently observing its revolutions while a boy whom he employs as a scribe is occasionally sent out to compare its progress with the clock of saint dunstan  the scrivener himself seemed considerably agitated he took from a strongbox a bundle of parchments and read passages of them with great attention then began to soliloquizethere is no outlet which law can suggestno backdoor of evasionnoneif the lands of glenvarloch are not redeemed before it rings noon lord dalgarno has them a cheap pennyworth strange that he should have been at last able to set his patron at defiance and achieve for himself the fair estate with the prospect of which he so long flattered the powerful buckinghammight not andrew skurliewhitter nick him as neatly he hath been my patrontruenot more than buckingham was his and he can be so no more for he departs presently for scotland i am glad of iti hate him and i fear him he knows too many of my secretsi know too many of his but nononoi need never attempt it there are no means of overreaching himwell willie what oclock  eleen hours just chappit sir  go to your desk without child said the scrivener what to do nexti shall lose the old earls fair business and what is worse his sons foul practice old heriot looks too close into business to permit me more than the paltry and ordinary dues the whitefriars business was profitable but it has become unsafe ever sincepah what brought that in my head just now i can hardly hold my penif men should see me in this waywillie calling aloud to the boy a cup of distilled waterssohnow i could face the devil  he spoke the last words aloud and close by the door of the apartment which was suddenly opened by richie moniplies followed by two gentlemen and attended by two porters bearing moneybags if ye can face the devil maister skurliewhitter said richie ye will be the less likely to turn your back on a sack or twa o siller which i have taen the freedom to bring you sathanas and mammon are near akin the porters at the same time ranged their load on the floor  iistammered the surprised scriveneri cannot guess what you mean sir  only that i have brought you the redemptionmoney on the part of lord glenvarloch in discharge of a certain mortgage over his family inheritance and here in good time comes master reginald lowestoffe and another honourable gentleman of the temple to be witnesses to the transaction  ii incline to think said the scrivener that the term is expired  you will pardon us master scrivener said lowestoffe you will not baffle usit wants threequarters of noon by every clock in the city  i must have time gentlemen said andrew to examine the gold by tale and weight  do so at your leisure master scrivener replied lowestoffe again we have already seen the contents of each sack told and weighed and we have put our seals on them there they stand in a row twenty in number each containing three hundred yellowhammerswe are witnesses to the lawful tender  gentlemen said the scrivener this security now belongs to a mighty lord i pray you abate your haste and let me send for lord dalgarnoor rather i will run for him myself  so saying he took up his hat but lowestoffe called outfriend moniplies keep the door fast an thou best a man he seeks but to put off the timein plain terms andrew you may send for the devil if you will who is the mightiest lord of my acquaintance but from hence you stir not till you have answered our proposition by rejecting or accepting the redemptionmoney fairly tenderedthere it liestake it or leave it as you will i have skill enough to know that the law is mightier than any lord in britaini have learned so much at the temple if i have learned nothing else and see that you trifle not with it lest it make your long ears an inch shorter master skurliewhitter  nay gentlemen if you threaten me said the scrivener i cannot resist compulsion  no threatsno threats at all my little andrew said lowestoffe a little friendly advice onlyforget not honest andrew i have seen you in alsatia  without answering a single word the scrivener sat down and drew in proper form a full receipt for the money proffered  i take it on your report master lowestoffe he said i hope you will remember i have insisted neither upon weight nor talei have been civilif there is deficiency i shall come to loss  fillip his nose with a goldpiece richie quoth the templar take up the papers and now wend we merrily to dine thou wotst where  if i might choose said richie it should not be at yonder roguish ordinary but as it is your pleasure gentlemen the treat shall be given wheresoever you will have it  at the ordinary said the one templar  at beaujeus said the other it is the only house in london for neat wines nimble drawers choice dishes and  and high charges quoth richie moniplies but as i said before gentlemen ye have a right to command me in this thing having so frankly rendered me your service in this small matter of business without other stipulation than that of a slight banquet  the latter part of this discourse passed in the street where immediately afterwards they met lord dalgarno he appeared in haste touched his hat slightly to master lowestoffe who returned his reverence with the same negligence and walked slowly on with his companion while lord dalgarno stopped richie moniplies with a commanding sign which the instinct of education compelled moniplies though indignant to obey  whom do you now follow sirrah demanded the noble  whomsoever goeth before me my lord answered moniplies  no sauciness you knavei desire to know if you still serve nigel olifaunt said dalgarno  i am friend to the noble lord glenvarloch answered moniplies with dignity  true replied lord dalgarno that noble lord has sunk to seek friends among lackeysneverthelesshark thee hithernevertheless if he be of the same mind as when we last met thou mayst show him that on tomorrow at four afternoon i shall pass northward by enfield chasei will be slenderly attended as i design to send my train through barnet it is my purpose to ride an easy pace through the forest and to linger a while by camlet moathe knows the place and if he be aught but an alsatian bully will think it fitter for some purposes than the park he is i understand at liberty or shortly to be so if he fail me at the place nominated he must seek me in scotland where he will find me possessed of his fathers estate and lands  humph muttered richie there go twa words to that bargain  he even meditated a joke on the means which he was conscious he possessed of baffling lord dalgarnos expectations but there was something of keen and dangerous excitement in the eyes of the young nobleman which prompted his discretion for once to rule his vit and he only answered  god grant your lordship may well brook your new conquestwhen you get it i shall do your errand to my lordwhilk is to say he added internally he shall never hear a word of it from richie i am not the lad to put him in such hazard  lord dalgarno looked at him sharply for a moment as if to penetrate the meaning of the dry ironical tone which in spite of richies awe mingled with his answer and then waved his hand in signal he should pass on he himself walked slowly till the trio were out of sight then turned back with hasty steps to the door of the scrivener which he had passed in his progress knocked and was admitted  lord dalgarno found the man of law with the moneybags still standing before him and it escaped not his penetrating glance that skurliewhitter was disconcerted and alarmed at his approach  how now man he said what hast thou not a word of oily compliment to me on my happy marriagenot a word of most philosophical consolation on my disgrace at courtor has my mien as a wittol and discarded favourite the properties of the gorgons head the turbatae palladis arma as majesty might say  my lord i am gladmy lord i am sorryanswered the trembling scrivener who aware of the vivacity of lord dalgarnos temper dreaded the consequence of the communication he had to make to him  glad and sorry answered lord dalgarno that is blowing hot and cold with a witness hark ye you picture of pettylarceny personifiedif you are sorry i am a cuckold remember i am only mine own you knavethere is too little blood in her cheeks to have sent her astray elsewhere well i will bear mine antlerd honours as i maygold shall gild them and for my disgrace revenge shall sweeten it ay revengeand there strikes the happy hour  the hour of noon was accordingly heard to peal from saint dunstans well banged brave hammers said lord dalgarno in triumphthe estate and lands of glenvarloch are crushed beneath these clanging blows if my steel tomorrow prove but as true as your iron maces to day the poor landless lord will little miss what your peal hath cut him out fromthe papersthe papers thou varlet i am tomorrow northward ho at four afternoon i am bound to be at camlet moat in the enfield chase tonight most of my retinue set forward the paperscome dispatch  my lord thethe papers of the glenvarloch mortgageii have them not  have them not echoed lord dalgarnohast thou sent them to my lodgings thou varlet did i not say i was coming hitherwhat mean you by pointing to that money what villainy have you done for it it is too large to be come honestly by  your lordship knows best answered the scrivener in great perturbation the gold is your own it isit is  not the redemptionmoney of the glenvarloch estate said dalgarno dare not say it is or i will upon the spot divorce your pettifogging soul from your carrion carcass so saying he seized the scrivener by the collar and shook him so vehemently that he tore it from the cassock  my lord i must call for help said the trembling caitiff who felt at that moment all the bitterness of the mortal agonyit was the laws act not mine what could i do  dost askwhy thou snivelling dribblet of damnation were all thy oaths tricks and lies spent or do you hold yourself too good to utter them in my service thou shouldst have lied cozened outsworn truth itself rather than stood betwixt me and my revenge but mark me he continued i know more of your pranks than would hang thee a line from me to the attorneygeneral and thou art sped  what would you have me to do my lord said the scrivener all that art and law can accomplish i will try  ah are you converted do so or pity of your life said the lord and remember i never fail my wordthen keep that accursed gold he continued or stay i will not trust yousend me this gold home presently to my lodging i will still forward to scotland and it shall go hard but that i hold out glenvarloch castle against the owner by means of the ammunition he has himself furnished thou art ready to serve me the scrivener professed the most implicit obedience  then remember the hour was past ere payment was tenderedand see thou hast witnesses of trusty memory to prove that point  tush my lord i will do more said andrew revivingi will prove that lord glenvarlochs friends threatened swaggered and drew swords on medid your lordship think i was ungrateful enough to have suffered them to prejudice your lordship save that they had bare swords at my throat  enough said replied dalgarno you are perfectmind that you continue so as you would avoid my fury i leave my page belowget porters and let them follow me instantly with the gold  so saying lord dalgarno left the scriveners habitation  skurliewhitter having dispatched his boy to get porters of trust for transporting the money remained alone and in dismay meditating by what means he could shake himself free of the vindictive and ferocious nobleman who possessed at once a dangerous knowledge of his character and the power of exposing him where exposure would be ruin he had indeed acquiesced in the plan rapidly sketched for obtaining possession of the ransomed estate but his experience foresaw that this would be impossible while on the other hand he could not anticipate the various consequences of lord dalgarnos resentment without fears from which his sordid soul recoiled to be in the power and subject both to the humours and the extortions of a spendthrift young lord just when his industry had shaped out the means of fortuneit was the most cruel trick which fate could have played the incipient usurer  while the scrivener was in this fit of anxious anticipation one knocked at the door of the apartment and being desired to enter appeared in the coarse ridingcloak of uncut wiltshire cloth fastened by a broad leather belt and brass buckle which was then generally worn by graziers and countrymen skurliewhitter believing he saw in his visitor a country client who might prove profitable had opened his mouth to request him to be seated when the stranger throwing back his frieze hood which he had drawn over his face showed the scrivener features well imprinted in his recollection but which he never saw without a disposition to swoon  is it you he said faintly as the stranger replaced the hood which concealed his features  who else should it be said his visitor  thou son of parchment got betwixt the inkhorn  and the stuffd processbagthat mayest call  the pen thy father and the ink thy mother  the wax thy brother and the sand thy sister  and the good pillory thy cousin allied  rise and do reverence unto me thy better  not yet down to the country said the scrivener after every warning do not think your graziers cloak will bear you out captain no nor your scraps of stageplays  why what would you have me to do said the captainwould you have me starve if i am to fly you must eke my wings with a few feathers you can spare them i think  you had means alreadyyou have had ten pieceswhat is become of them  gone answered captain colepeppergone no matter wherei had a mind to bite and i was bitten thats alli think my hand shook at the thought of tother nights work for i trowled the doctors like a very baby  and you have lost all thenwell take this and be gone said the scrivener  what two poor smelts marry plague of your bountybut remember you are as deep in as i  not so by heaven answered the scrivener i only thought of easing the old man of some papers and a trifle of his gold and you took his life  were he living answered colepepper he would rather have lost it than his moneybut that is not the question master skurliewhitter you undid the private bolts of the window when you visited him about some affairs on the day ere he diedso satisfy yourself that if i am taken i will not swing alone pity jack hempsfield is dead it spoils the old catch  and three merry men and three merry men  and three merry men are we  as ever did sing three parts in a string  all under the triple tree  for gods sake speak lower said the scrivener is this a place or time to make your midnight catches heardbut how much will serve your turn i tell you i am but ill provided  you tell me a lie then said the bullya most palpable and gross liehow much dye say will serve my turn why one of these bags will do for the present  i swear to you that these bags of money are not at my disposal  not honestly perhaps said the captain but that makes little difference betwixt us  i swear to you continued the scrivener they are in no way at my disposalthey have been delivered to me by talei am to pay them over to lord dalgarno whose boy waits for them and i could not skelder one piece out of them without risk of hue and cry  can you not put off the delivery said the bravo his huge hand still fumbling with one of the bags as if his fingers longed to close on it  impossible said the scrivener he sets forward to scotland to morrow  ay said the bully after a moments thoughttravels he the north road with such a charge  he is well accompanied added the scrivener but yet  but yetbut what said the bravo  nay i meant nothing said the scrivener  thou didstthou hadst the wind of some good thing replied colepepper i saw thee pause like a setting dog thou wilt say as little and make as sure a sign as a wellbred spaniel  all i meant to say captain was that his servants go by barnet and he himself with his page pass through enfield chase and he spoke to me yesterday of riding a soft pace  ahacomest thou to me there my boy  and of restingcontinued the scrivenerresting a space at camlet moat  why this is better than cockfighting said the captain  i see not how it can advantage you captain said the scrivener but however they cannot ride fast for his page rides the sumpter horse which carries all that weight pointing to the money on the table lord dalgarno looks sharp to the worlds gear  that horse will be obliged to those who may ease him of his burden said the bravo and egad he may be met withhe hath still that pagethat same lutinthat goblin well the boy hath set game for me ere now i will be revenged too for i owe him a grudge for an old score at the ordinary let me seeblack feltham and dick shakebag we shall want a fourthi love to make sure and the booty will stand parting besides what i can bucket them out of well scrivener lend me two piecesbravely donenobly imparted give ye goodden and wrapping his disguise closer around him away he went  when he had left the room the scrivener wrung his hands and exclaimed more bloodmore blood i thought to have had done with it but this time there was no fault with menoneand then i shall have all the advantage if this ruffian falls there is truce with his tugs at my pursestrings and if lord dalgarno diesas is most likely for though as much afraid of cold steel as a debtor of a dun this fellow is a deadly shot from behind a bushthen am i in a thousand ways safesafesafe  we willingly drop the curtain over him and his reflections     chapter xxxv     we are not worst at oncethe course of evil   begins so slowly and from such slight source   an infants hand might stem its breach with clay   but let the stream get deeper and philosophy   ay and religion tooshall strive in vain   to turn the headlong torrent                             old play  the templars had been regaled by our friend richie moniplies in a private chamber at beaujeus where he might be considered as good company for he had exchanged his servingmans cloak and jerkin for a grave yet handsome suit of clothes in the fashion of the times but such as might have befitted an older man than himself he had positively declined presenting himself at the ordinary a point to which his companions were very desirous to have brought him for it will be easily believed that such wags as lowestoffe and his companion were not indisposed to a little merriment at the expense of the raw and pedantic scotsman besides the chance of easing him of a few pieces of which he appeared to have acquired considerable command but not even a succession of measures of sparkling sack in which the little brilliant atoms circulated like motes in the suns rays had the least effect on richies sense of decorum he retained the gravity of a judge even while he drank like a fish partly from his own natural inclination to good liquor partly in the way of good fellowship towards his guests when the wine began to make some innovation on their heads master lowestoffe tired perhaps of the humours of richie who began to become yet more stoically contradictory and dogmatical than even in the earlier part of the entertainment proposed to his friend to break up their debauch and join the gamesters  the drawer was called accordingly and richie discharged the reckoning of the party with a generous remuneration to the attendants which was received with cap and knee and many assurances ofkindly welcome gentlemen  i grieve we should part so soon gentlemen said richie to his companionsand i would you had cracked another quart ere you went or stayed to take some slight matter of supper and a glass of rhenish i thank you however for having graced my poor collation thus far and i commend you to fortune in your own courses for the ordinary neither was is nor shall be an element of mine  fare thee well then said lowestoffe most sapient and sententious master moniplies may you soon have another mortgage to redeem and may i be there to witness it and may you play the good fellow as heartily as you have done this day  nay gentlemen it is merely of your grace to say sobut if you would but hear me speak a few words of admonition respecting this wicked ordinary  reserve the lesson most honourable richie said lowestoffe until i have lost all my money showing at the same time a purse indifferently well provided and then the lecture is likely to have some weight  and keep my share of it richie said the other templar showing an almost empty purse in his turn till this be full again and then i will promise to hear you with some patience  ay ay gallants said richie the full and the empty gang a ae gate and that is a grey onebut the time will come  nay it is come already said lowestoffe they have set out the hazard table since you will peremptorily not go with us why farewell richie  and farewell gentlemen said richie and left the house into which they had returned  moniplies was not many steps from the door when a person whom lost in his reflections on gaming ordinaries and the manners of the age he had not observed and who had been as negligent on his part ran full against him and when richie desired to know whether he meant ony incivility replied by a curse on scotland and all that belonged to it a less round reflection on his country would at any time have provoked richie but more especially when he had a double quart of canary and better in his pate he was about to give a very rough answer and to second his word by action when a closer view of his antagonist changed his purpose  you are the vera lad in the warld said richie whom i most wished to meet  and you answered the stranger or any of your beggarly countrymen are the last sight i should ever wish to see you scots are ever fair and false and an honest man cannot thrive within eyeshot of you  as to our poverty friend replied richie that is as heaven pleases but touching our falset ill prove to you that a scotsman bears as leal and true a heart to his friend as ever beat in english doublet  i care not whether he does or not said the gallant let me gowhy keep you hold of my cloak let me go or i will thrust you into the kennel  i believe i could forgie ye for you did me a good turn once in plucking me out of it said the scot  beshrew my fingers then if they did so replied the stranger i would your whole country lay there along with you and heavens curse blight the hand that helped to raise themwhy do you stop my way he added fiercely  because it is a bad one master jenkin said richie nay never start about it manyou see you are known alackaday that an honest mans son should live to start at hearing himself called by his own name jenkin struck his brow violently with his clenched fist  come come said richie this passion availeth nothing tell me what gate go you  to the devil answered jin vin  that is a black gate if you speak according to the letter answered richie but if metaphorically there are worse places in this great city than the devil tavern and i care not if i go thither with you and bestow a pottle of burnt sack on youit will correct the crudities of my stomach and form a gentle preparative for the leg of a cold pullet  i pray you in good fashion to let me go said jenkin you may mean me kindly and i wish you to have no wrong at my hand but i am in the humour to be dangerous to myself or any one  i will abide the risk said the scot if you will but come with me and here is a place convenient a howff nearer than the devil whilk is but an illomened drouthy name for a tavern this other of the saint andrew is a quiet place where i have taen my whetter now and then when i lodged in the neighbourhood of the temple with lord glenvarlochwhat the deils the matter wi the man garrd him gie sic a spang as that and almaist brought himself and me on the causeway  do not name that false scots name to me said jin vin if you would not have me go madi was happy before i saw himhe has been the cause of all the ill that has befallen mehe has made a knave and a madman of me  if you are a knave said richie you have met an officerif you are daft you have met a keeper but a gentle officer and a kind keeper look you my gude friend there has been twenty things said about this same lord in which there is no more truth than in the leasings of mahound the warst they can say of him is that he is not always so amenable to good advice as i would pray him you and every young man to be come wi mejust come ye wi me and if a little spell of siller and a great deal of excellent counsel can relieve your occasions all i can say is you have had the luck to meet one capable of giving you both and maist willing to bestow them  the pertinacity of the scot prevailed over the sullenness of vincent who was indeed in a state of agitation and incapacity to think for himself which led him to yield the more readily to the suggestions of another he suffered himself to be dragged into the small tavern which richie recommended and where they soon found themselves seated in a snug niche with a reeking pottle of burnt sack and a paper of sugar betwixt them pipes and tobacco were also provided but were only used by richie who had adopted the custom of late as adding considerably to the gravity and importance of his manner and affording as it were a bland and pleasant accompaniment to the words of wisdom which flowed from his tongue after they had filled their glasses and drank them in silence richie repeated the question whither his guest was going when they met so fortunately  i told you said jenkin i was going to destructioni mean to the gaminghouse i am resolved to hazard these two or three pieces to get as much as will pay for a passage with captain sharker whose ship lies at gravesend bound for americaand so eastward hoi met one devil in the way already who would have tempted me from my purpose but i spurned him from meyou may be another for what i knowwhat degree of damnation do you propose for me he added wildly and what is the price of it  i would have you to know answered richie that i deal in no such commodities whether as buyer or seller but if you will tell me honestly the cause of your distress i will do what is in my power to help you out of itnot being however prodigal of promises until i know the case as a learned physician only gives advice when he has observed the diagnostics  no one has any thing to do with my affairs said the poor lad and folding his arms on the table he laid his head upon them with the sullen dejection of the overburdened lama when it throws itself down to die in desperation  richard moniplies like most folk who have a good opinion of themselves was fond of the task of consolation which at once displayed his superiority for the consoler is necessarily for the time at least superior to the afflicted person and indulged his love of talking he inflicted on the poor penitenta harangue of pitiless length stuffed full of the usual topics of the mutability of human affairsthe eminent advantages of patience under affliction the folly of grieving for what hath no remedythe necessity of taking more care for the future and some gentle rebukes on account of the past which acid he threw in to assist in subduing the patients obstinacy as hannibal used vinegar in cutting his way through rocks it was not in human nature to endure this flood of commonplace eloquence in silence and jin vin whether desirous of stopping the flow of wordscrammed thus into his ear against the stomach of his sense or whether confiding in richies protestations of friendship which the wretched says fielding are ever so ready to believe or whether merely to give his sorrows vent in words raised his head and turning his red and swollen eyes to richie  cocksbones man only hold thy tongue and thou shall know all about itand then all i ask of thee is to shake hands and partthis margaret ramsayyou have seen her man  once said richie once at master george heriots in lombard streeti was in the room when they dined  ay you helped to shift their trenchers i remember said jin vin well that same pretty girland i will uphold her the prettiest betwixt pauls and the barshe is to be wedded to your lord glenvarloch with a pestilence on him  that is impossible said richie it is raving nonsense manthey make april gouks of you cockneys every month in the yearthe lord glenvarloch marry the daughter of a lonnon mechanic i would as soon believe the great prester john would marry the daughter of a jew packman  hark ye brother said jin vin i will allow no one to speak disregardfully of the city for all i am in trouble  i crave your pardon mani meant no offence said richie but as to the marriage it is a thing simply impossible  it is a thing that will take place though for the duke and the prince and all of them have a finger in it and especially the old fool of a king that makes her out to be some great woman in her own country as all the scots pretend to be you know  master vincent but that you are under affliction said the consoler offended on his part i would hear no national reflections  the afflicted youth apologised in his turns but asserted it  was true that the king said pegaramsay was some faroff sort of noblewoman and that he had taken a great interest in the match and had run about like an old gander cackling about peggie ever since he had seen her in hose and doubletand no wonder added poor vin with a deep sigh  this may be all true said richie though it sounds strange in my ears but man you should not speak evil of dignitiescurse not the king jenkin not even in thy bedchamberstone walls have earsno one has a right to know better than i  i do not curse the foolish old man said jenkin but i would have them carry things a peg lowerif they were to see on a plain field thirty thousand such pikes as i have seen in the artillery gardens it would not be their longhaired courtiers would help them i trow footnote clarendon remarks that the importance of the military exercise of the citizens was severely felt by the cavaliers during the civil war notwithstanding the ridicule that had been showered upon it by the dramatic poets of the day nothing less than habitual practice could at the battle of newbury and elsewhere have enabled the londoners to keep their ranks as pikemen in spite of the repeated charge of the fiery prince rupert and his gallant cavaliers  hout tout man said richie mind where the stewarts come frae and never think they would want spears or claymores either but leaving sic matters whilk are perilous to speak on i say once more what is your concern in all this matter  what is it said jenkin why have i not fixed on pegaramsay to be my true love from the day i came to her old fathers shop and have i not carried her pattens and her chopines for three years and borne her prayerbook to church and brushed the cushion for her to kneel down upon and did she ever say me nay  i see no cause she had said richie if the like of such small services were all that ye proffered ah man there are fewvery few either of fools or of wise men ken how to guide a woman  why did i not serve her at the risk of my freedom and very nigh at the risk of my neck did she notno it was not her neither but that accursed beldam whom she caused to work upon mepersuade me like a fool to turn myself into a waterman to help my lord and a plague to him down to scotland and instead of going peaceably down to the ship at gravesend did not he rant and bully and show his pistols and make me land him at greenwich where he played some swaggering pranks that helped both him and me into the tower  aha said richie throwing more than his usual wisdom into his looks so you were the greenjacketed waterman that rowed lord glenvarloch down the river  the more fool i that did not souse him in the thames said jenkin and i was the lad who would not confess one word of who and what i was though they threatened to make me hug the duke of exeters daughterfootnote a particular species of rack used at the tower of london was so called  wha is she man said richie she must be an illfashioned piece if youre so much afraid of her and she come of such high kin  i mean the rackthe rack man said jenkin where were you bred that never heard of the duke of exeters daughter but all the dukes and duchesses in england could have got nothing out of meso the truth came out some other way and i was set freehome i ran thinking myself one of the cleverest and happiest fellows in the ward and shesheshe wanted to pay me with money for all my true service and she spoke so sweetly and so coldly at the same time i wished myself in the deepest dungeon of the toweri wish they had racked me to death before i heard this scottishman was to chouse me out of my sweetheart  but are ye sure ye have lost her said richie it sounds strange in my ears that my lord glenvarloch should marry the daughter of a dealerthough there are uncouth marriages made in london ill allow that  why i tell you this lord was no sooner clear of the tower than he and master george heriot comes to make proposals for her with the kings assent and what not and fine fairday prospects of court favour for this lord for he hath not an acre of land  well and what said the auld watchmaker said richie was he not as might weel beseem him ready to loop out of his skincase for very joy  he multiplied six figures progressively and reported the product then gave his consent  and what did you do  i rushed into the streets said the poor lad with a burning heart and a bloodshot eyeand where did i first find myself but with that beldam mother suddlechopand what did she propose to me but to take the road  take the road man in what sense said richie  even as a clerk to saint nicholasas a highwayman like poins and peto and the good fellows in the playand who think you was to be my captainfor she had the whole out ere i could speak to heri fancy she took silence for consent and thought me damned too unutterably to have one thought left that savoured of redemptionwho was to be my captain but the knave that you saw me cudgel at the ordinary when you waited on lord glenvarloch a cowardly sharking thievish bully about town here whom they call colepepper  colepepperumphi know somewhat of that smaik said richie ken ye by ony chance where he may be heard of master jenkinye wad do me a sincere service to tell me  why he lives something obscurely answered the apprentice on account of suspicion of some villainyi believe that horrid murder in whitefriars or some such matter but i might have heard all about him from dame suddlechop for she spoke of my meeting him at enfield chase with some other good fellows to do a robbery on one that goes northward with a store of treasure  and you did not agree to this fine project said moniplies  i cursed her for a hag and came away about my business answered jenkin  ay and what said she to that man that would startle her said richie  not a whit she laughed and said she was in jest answered jenkin but i know the shedevils jest from her earnest too well to be taken in that way but she knows i would never betray her  betray her no replied richie but are ye in any shape bound to this birkie peppercull or colepepper or whatever they call him that ye suld let him do a robbery on the honest gentleman that is travelling to the north and may be a kindly scot for what we know  aygoing home with a load of english money said jenkin but be he who he will they may rob the whole world an they list for i am robbed and ruined  richie filled his friends cup up to the brim and insisted that he should drink what he called clean caup out this love he said is but a bairnly matter for a brisk young fellow like yourself master jenkin and if ye must needs have a whimsy though i think it would be safer to venture on a staid womanly body why here be as bonny lasses in london as this pegaramsay you need not sigh sae deeply for it is very truethere is as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it now wherefore should you who are as brisk and trig a young fellow of your inches as the sun needs to shine onwherefore need you sit moping this way and not try some bold way to better your fortune  i tell you master moniplies said jenkin i am as poor as any scot among youi have broke my indenture and i think of running my country  awelladay said richie but that maunna be mani ken weel by sad experience that poortith takes away pith and the man sits full still that has a rent in his breeks footnote this elegant speech was made by the earl of douglas called tineman after being wounded and made prisoner at the battle of shrewsbury where  his well labouring sword  had three times slain the semblance of the king  but courage man you have served me heretofore and i will serve you now if you will but bring me to speech of this same captain it will be the best days work you ever did  i guess where you are master richardyou would save your countrymans long purse said jenkin i cannot see how that should advantage me but i reck not if i should bear a hand i hate that braggart that bloodyminded cowardly bully if you can get me mounted i care not if i show you where the dame told me i should meet himbut you must stand to the risk for though he is a coward himself i know he will have more than one stout fellow with him  well have a warrant man said richie and the hue and cry to boot  we will have no such thing said jenkin if i am to go with you i am not the lad to betray any one to the harmanbeck you must do it by manhood if i am to go with you i am sworn to cutters law and will sell no mans blood  aweel said richie a wilful man must have his way ye must think that i was born and bred where cracked crowns were plentier than whole ones besides i have two noble friends here master lowestoffe of the temple and his cousin master ringwood that will blithely be of so gallant a party  lowestoffe and ringwood said jenkin they are both brave gallants they will be sure company know you where they are to be found  ay marry do i replied richie they are fast at the cards and dice till the sma hours i warrant them  they are gentlemen of trust and honour said jenkin and if they advise it i will try the adventure go try if you can bring them hither since you have so much to say with them we must not be seen abroad togetheri know not how it is master moniplies continued he as his countenance brightened up and while in his turn he filled the cups but i feel my heart something lighter since i have thought of this matter  thus it is to have counsellors master jenkin said richie and truly i hope to hear you say that your heart is as light as a lavrocks and that before you are many days aulder never smile and shake your head but mind what i tell youand bide here in the meanwhile till i go to seek these gallants i warrant you cartropes would not hold them back from such a ploy as i shall propose to them     chapter xxxvi     the thieves have bound the true men   now could thou and i rob the thieves and go    merrily to london                     henry iv part i  the sun was high upon the glades of enfield chase and the deer with which it then abounded were seen sporting in picturesque groups among the ancient oaks of the forest when a cavalier and a lady on foot although in riding apparel sauntered slowly up one of the long alleys which were cut through the park for the convenience of the hunters their only attendant was a page who riding a spanish jennet which seemed to bear a heavy cloakbag followed them at a respectful distance the female attired in all the fantastic finery of the period with more than the usual quantity of bugles flounces and trimmings and holding her fan of ostrich feathers in one hand and her ridingmask of black velvet in the other seemed anxious by all the little coquetry practised on such occasions to secure the notice of her companion who sometimes heard her prattle without seeming to attend to it and at other times interrupted his train of graver reflections to reply to her  nay but my lordmy lord you walk so fast you will leave me behind younay i will have hold of your arm but how to manage with my mask and my fan why would you not let me bring my waiting gentlewoman to follow us and hold my things but see i will put my fan in my girdle sohand now that i have a hand to hold you with you shall not run away from me  come on then answered the gallant and let us walk apace since you would not be persuaded to stay with your gentlewoman as you call her and with the rest of the baggageyou may perhaps see that though you will not like to see  she took hold of his arm accordingly but as he continued to walk at the same pace she shortly let go her hold exclaiming that he had hurt her hand the cavalier stopped and looked at the pretty hand and arm which she showed him with exclamations against his cruelty i dare say she said baring her wrist and a part of her arm it is all black and blue to the very elbow  i dare say you are a silly little fool said the cavalier carelessly kissing the aggrieved arm it is only a pretty incarnate which sets off the blue veins  nay my lord now it is you are silly answered the dame but i am glad i can make you speak and laugh on any terms this morning i am sure if i did insist on following you into the forest it was all for the sake of diverting you i am better company than your page i trowand now tell me these pretty things with horns be they not deer even such they be nelly answered her neglectful attendant  and what can the great folk do with so many of them forsooth  they send them to the city nell where wise men make venison pasties of their flesh and wear their horns for trophies answered lord dalgarno whom our reader has already recognised  nay now you laugh at me my lord answered his companion but i know all about venison whatever you may think i always tasted it once a year when we dined with mr deputy she continued sadly as a sense of her degradation stole across a mind bewildered with vanity and folly though he would not speak to me now if we met together in the narrowest lane in the ward  i warrant he would not said lord dalgarno because thou nell wouldst dash him with a single look for i trust thou hast more spirit than to throw away words on such a fellow as he  who i said dame nelly nay i scorn the proud princox too much for that do you know he made all the folk in the ward stand cap in hand to him my poor old john christie and all here her recollection began to overflow at her eyes  a plague on your whimpering said dalgarno somewhat harshlynay never look pale for the matter nell i am not angry with you you simple fool but what would you have me think when you are eternally looking back upon your dungeon yonder by the river which smelt of pitch and old cheese worse than a welshman does of onions and all this when i am taking you down to a castle as fine as is in fairy land  shall we be there tonight my lord said nelly drying her tears  tonight nellyno nor this night fortnight  now the lord be with us and keep usbut shall we not go by sea my lordi thought everybody came from scotland by sea i am sure lord glenvarloch and richie moniplies came up by sea  there is a wide difference between coming up and going down nelly answered lord dalgarno  and so there is for certain said his simple companion but yet i think i heard people speaking of going down to scotland by sea as well as coming up are you well avised of the waydo you think it possible we can go by land my sweet lord  it is but trying my sweet lady said lord dalgarno men say england and scotland are in the same island so one would hope there may be some road betwixt them by land  i shall never be able to ride so far said the lady  we will have your saddle stuffed softer said the lord i tell you that you shall mew your city slough and change from the caterpillar of a paltry lane into the butterfly of a princes garden you shall have as many tires as there are hours in the dayas many handmaidens as there are days in the weekas many menials as there are weeks in the yearand you shall ride a hunting and hawking with a lord instead of waiting upon an old shipchandler who could do nothing but hawk and spit  ay but will you make me your lady said dame nelly  ay surelywhat else replied the lordmy ladylove  ay but i mean your ladywife said nelly  truly nell in that i cannot promise to oblige you a ladywife continued dalgarno is a very different thing from a ladylove  i heard from mrs suddlechop whom you lodged me with since i left poor old john christie that lord glenvarloch is to marry david ramsay the clockmakers daughter  there is much betwixt the cup and the lip nelly i wear something about me may break the bans of that hopeful alliance before the day is much older answered lord dalgarno  well but my father was as good a man as old davy ramsay and as well to pass in the world my lord and therefore why should you not marry me you have done me harm enough i trowwherefore should you not do me this justice  for two good reasons nelly fate put a husband on you and the king passed a wife upon me answered lord dalgarno  ay my lord said nelly but they remain in england and we go to scotland  thy argument is better than thou art aware of said lord dalgarno i have heard scottish lawyers say the matrimonial tie may be unclasped in our happy country by the gentle hand of the ordinary course of law whereas in england it can only be burst by an act of parliament well nelly we will look into that matter and whether we get married again or no we will at least do our best to get unmarried  shall we indeed my honeysweet lord and then i will think less about john christie for he will marry again i warrant you for he is well to pass and i would be glad to think he had somebody to take care of him as i used to do poor loving old man he was a kind man though he was a score of years older than i and i hope and pray he will never let a young lord cross his honest threshold again  here the dame was once more much inclined to give way to a passion of tears but lord dalgarno conjured down the emotion by saying with some asperityi am weary of these april passions my pretty mistress and i think you will do well to preserve your tears for some more pressing occasion who knows what turn of fortune may in a few minutes call for more of them than you can render  goodness my lord what mean you by such expressions john christie the kind heart used to keep no secrets from me and i hope your lordship will not hide your counsel from me  sit down beside me on this bank said the nobleman i am bound to remain here for a short space and if you can be but silent i should like to spend a part of it in considering how far i can on the present occasion follow the respectable example which you recommend to me  the place at which he stopped was at that time little more than a mound partly surrounded by a ditch from which it derived the name of camlet moat a few hewn stones there were which had escaped the fate of many others that had been used in building different lodges in the forest for the royal keepers these vestiges just sufficient to show that herein former times the hand of man had been marked the ruins of the abode of a once illustrious but longforgotten family the mandevilles earls of essex to whom enfield chase and the extensive domains adjacent had belonged in elder days a wild woodland prospect led the eye at various points through broad and seemingly interminable alleys which meeting at this point as at a common centre diverged from each other as they receded and had therefore been selected by lord dalgarno as the rendezvous for the combat which through the medium of richie moniplies he had offered to his injured friend lord glenvarloch  he will surely come he said to himself cowardice was not wont to be his faultat least he was bold enough in the parkperhaps yonder churl may not have carried my message but nohe is a sturdy knave one of those would prize their masters honour above their lifelook to the palfrey lutin and see thou let him not loose and cast thy falcon glance down every avenue to mark if any one comesbuckingham has undergone my challenge but the proud minion pleads the kings paltry commands for refusing to answer me if i can baffle this glenvarloch or slay himif i can spoil him of his honour or his life i shall go down to scotland with credit sufficient to gild over past mischances i know my dear countrymenthey never quarrel with any one who brings them home either gold or martial glory much more if he has both gold and laurels  as he thus reflected and called to mind the disgrace which he had suffered as well as the causes he imagined for hating lord glenvarloch his countenance altered under the influence of his contending emotions to the terror of nelly who sitting unnoticed at his feet and looking anxiously in his face beheld the cheek kindle the mouth become compressed the eye dilated and the whole countenance express the desperate and deadly resolution of one who awaits an instant and decisive encounter with a mortal enemy the loneliness of the place the scenery so different from that to which alone she had been accustomed the dark and sombre air which crept so suddenly over the countenance of her seducer his command imposing silence upon her and the apparent strangeness of his conduct in idling away so much time without any obvious cause when a journey of such length lay before them brought strange thoughts into her weak brain she had read of women seduced from their matrimonial duties by sorcerers allied to the hellish powers nay by the father of evil himself who after conveying his victim into some desert remote from human kind exchanged the pleasing shape in which he gained her affections for all his natural horrors she chased this wild idea away as it crowded itself upon her weak and bewildered imagination yet she might have lived to see it realised allegorically if not literally but for the accident which presently followed  the page whose eyes were remarkably acute at length called out to his master pointing with his finger at the same time down one of the alleys that horsemen were advancing in that direction lord dalgarno started up and shading his eyes with his hand gazed eagerly down the alley when at the same instant he received a shot which grazing his hand passed right through his brain and laid him a lifeless corpse at the feet or rather across the lap of the unfortunate victim of his profligacy the countenance whose varied expression she had been watching for the last five minutes was convulsed for an instant and then stiffened into rigidity for ever three ruffians rushed from the brake from which the shot had been fired ere the smoke was dispersed one with many imprecations seized on the page another on the female upon whose cries he strove by the most violent threats to impose silence whilst the third began to undo the burden from the pages horse but an instant rescue prevented their availing themselves of the advantage they had obtained  it may easily be supposed that richie moniplies having secured the assistance of the two templars ready enough to join in any thing which promised a fray with jin vin to act as their guide had set off gallantly mounted and well armed under the belief that they would reach camlet moat before the robbers and apprehend them in the fact they had not calculated that according to the custom of robbers in other countries but contrary to that of the english highwayman of those days they meant to ensure robbery by previous murder an accident also happened to delay them a little while on the road in riding through one of the glades of the forest they found a man dismounted and sitting under a tree groaning with such bitterness of spirit that lowestoffe could not forbear asking if he was hurt in answer he said he was an unhappy man in pursuit of his wife who had been carried off by a villain and as he raised his countenance the eyes of richie to his great astonishment encountered the visage of john christie  for the almightys sake help me master moniplies he said i have learned my wife is but a short mile before with that black villain lord dalgarno  have him forward by all means said lowestoffe a second orpheus seeking his eurydicehave him forwardwe will save lord dalgarnos purse and ease him of his mistresshave him with us were it but for the variety of the adventure i owe his lordship a grudge for rooking me we have ten minutes good  but it is dangerous to calculate closely in matters of life and death in all probability the minute or two which was lost in mounting john christie behind one of their party might have saved lord dalgarno from his fate thus his criminal amour became the indirect cause of his losing his life and thus our pleasant vices are made the whips to scourge us  the riders arrived on the field at full gallop the moment after the shot was fired and richie who had his own reasons for attaching himself to colepepper who was bustling to untie the portmanteau from the pages saddle pushed against him with such violence as to overthrow him his own horse at the same time stumbling and dismounting his rider who was none of the first equestrians the undaunted richie immediately arose however and grappled with the ruffian with such goodwill that though a strong fellow and though a coward now rendered desperate moniplies got him under wrenched a long knife from his hand dealt him a desperate stab with his own weapon and leaped on his feet and as the wounded man struggled to follow his example he struck him upon the head with the buttend of a musketoon which last blow proved fatal  bravo richie cried lowestoffe who had himself engaged at sword point with one of the ruffians and soon put him to flightbravo why man there lies sin struck down like an ox and iniquitys throat cut like a calf  i know not why you should upbraid me with my upbringing master lowestoffe answered richie with great composure but i can tell you the shambles is not a bad place for training one to this work  the other templar now shouted loudly to themif ye be men come hitherhere lies lord dalgarno murdered  lowestoffe and richie ran to the spot and the page took the opportunity finding himself now neglected on all hands to ride off in a different direction and neither he nor the considerable sum with which his horse was burdened were ever heard of from that moment  the third ruffian had not waited the attack of the templar and jin vin the latter of whom had put down old christie from behind him that he might ride the lighter and the whole five now stood gazing with horror on the bloody corpse of the young nobleman and the wild sorrow of the female who tore her hair and shrieked in the most disconsolate manner until her agony was at once checked or rather received a new direction by the sudden and unexpected appearance of her husband who fixing on her a cold and severe look said in a tone suited to his manneray woman thou takest on sadly for the loss of thy paramourthen looking on the bloody corpse of him from whom he had received so deep an injury he repeated the solemn words of scripturevengeance is mine saith the lord and i will repay iti whom thou hast injured will be first to render thee the decent offices due to the dead  so saying he covered the dead body with his cloak and then looking on it for a moment seemed to reflect on what he had next to perform as the eye of the injured man slowly passed from the body of the seducer to the partner and victim of his crime who had sunk down to his feet which she clasped without venturing to look up his features naturally coarse and saturnine assumed a dignity of expression which overawed the young templars and repulsed the officious forwardness of richie moniplies who was at first eager to have thrust in his advice and opinion kneel not to me woman he said but kneel to the god thou hast offended more than thou couldst offend such another worm as thyself how often have i told thee when thou wert at the gayest and the lightest that pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall vanity brought folly and folly brought sin and sin hath brought death his original companion thou must needs leave duty and decency and domestic love to revel it gaily with the wild and with the wicked and there thou liest like a crushed worm writhing beside the lifeless body of thy paramour thou hast done me much wrongdishonoured me among friends driven credit from my house and peace from my firesidebut thou wert my first and only love and i will not see thee an utter castaway if it lies with me to prevent itgentlemen i render ye such thanks as a brokenhearted man can giverichard commend me to your honourable master i added gall to the bitterness of his affliction but i was deludedrise up woman and follow me  he raised her up by the arm while with streaming eyes and bitter sobs she endeavoured to express her penitence she kept her hands spread over her face yet suffered him to lead her away and it was only as they turned around a brake which concealed the scene they had left that she turned back and casting one wild and hurried glance towards the corpse of dalgarno uttered a shriek and clinging to her husbands arm exclaimed wildlysave mesave me they have murdered him  lowestoffe was much moved by what he had witnessed but he was ashamed as a towngallant of his own unfashionable emotion and did a force to his feelings when he exclaimeday let them gothe kindhearted believing forgiving husbandthe liberal accommodating spouse o what a generous creature is your true london husbandhorns hath he but tame as a fatted ox he goreth not i should like to see her when she hath exchanged her mask and ridingbeaver for her peaked hat and muffler we will visit them at pauls wharf cozit will be a convenient acquaintance  you had better think of catching the gipsy thief lutin said richie moniplies for by my faith he is off with his masters baggage and the siller  a keeper with his assistants and several other persons had now come to the spot and made hue and cry after lutin but in vain to their custody the templars surrendered the dead bodies and after going through some formal investigation they returned with richard and vincent to london where they received great applause for their gallantryvincents errors were easily expiated in consideration of his having been the means of breaking up this band of villains and there is some reason to think that what would have diminished the credit of the action in other instances rather added to it in the actual circumstances namely that they came too late to save lord dalgarno  george heriot who suspected how matters stood with vincent requested and obtained permission from his master to send the poor young fellow on an important piece of business to paris we are unable to trace his fate farther but believe it was prosperous and that he entered into an advantageous partnership with his fellowapprentice upon old davy ramsay retiring from business in consequence of his daughters marriage that eminent antiquary dr dryasdust is possessed of an antique watch with a silver dialplate the mainspring being a piece of catgut instead of a chain which bears the names of vincent and tunstall memorymonitors  master lowestoffe failed not to vindicate his character as a man of gaiety by inquiring after john christie and dame nelly but greatly to his surprise indeed to his loss for he had wagered ten pieces that he would domesticate himself in the family he found the good will as it was called of the shop was sold the stock auctioned and the late proprietor and his wife gone no one knew whither the prevailing belief was that they had emigrated to one of the new settlements in america  lady dalgarno received the news of her unworthy husbands death with a variety of emotions among which horror that he should have been cut off in the middle career of his profligacy was the most prominent the incident greatly deepened her melancholy and injured her health already shaken by previous circumstances repossessed of her own fortune by her husbands death she was anxious to do justice to lord glenvarloch by treating for the recovery of the mortgage  but the scrivener having taken fright at the late events had left the city and absconded so that it was impossible to discover into whose hands the papers had now passed richard moniplies was silent for his own reasons the templars who had witnessed the transaction kept the secret at his request and it was universally believed that the scrivener had carried off the writings along with him we may here

conducted his hero and heroine not a circumstance was then omitted from the manly ardour of the bridegroom and the modest blushes of the bride to the parsons new surplice and the silk tabinet mantua of the bridesmaid but such descriptions are now discarded for the same reason i suppose that public marriages are no longer fashionable and that instead of calling together their friends to a feast and a dance the happy couple elope in a solitary postchaise as secretly as if they meant to go to gretnagreen or to do worse i am not ungrateful for a change which saves an author the trouble of attempting in vain to give a new colour to the commonplace description of such matters but notwithstanding i find myself forced upon it in the present instance as circumstances sometimes compel a stranger to make use of an old road which has been for some time shut up the experienced reader may have already remarked that the last chapter was employed in sweeping out of the way all the unnecessary and less interesting characters that i might clear the floor for a blithe bridal  in truth it would be unpardonable to pass over slightly what so deeply interested our principal personage king james that learned and goodhumoured monarch made no great figure in the politics of europe but then to make amends he was prodigiously busy when he could find a fair opportunity of intermeddling with the private affairs of his loving subjects and the approaching marriage of lord glenvarloch was matter of great interest to him he had been much struck that is for him who was not very accessible to such emotions with the beauty and embarrassment of the pretty pega ramsay as he called her when he first saw her and he glorified himself greatly on the acuteness which he had displayed in detecting her disguise and in carrying through the whole inquiry which took place in consequence of it  he laboured for several weeks while the courtship was in progress with his own royal eyes so as wellnigh to wear out he declared a pair of her fathers best barnacles in searching through old books and documents for the purpose of establishing the brides pretensions to a noble though remote descent and thereby remove the only objection which envy might conceive against the match in his own opinion at least he was eminently successful for when sir mungo malagrowther one day in the presencechamber took upon him to grieve bitterly for the brides lack of pedigree the monarch cut him short with ye may save your grief for your ain next occasions sir mungo for by our royal saul we will uphauld her father davy ramsay to be a gentleman of nine descents whase great gudesire came of the auld martial stock of the house of dalwolsey than whom better men never did and better never will draw sword for king and country heard ye never of sir william ramsay of dalwolsey man of whom john fordoun saithhe was bellicosissimus nobilissimushis castle stands to witness for itsell not three miles from dalkeith man and within a mile of bannockrig davy ramsay came of that auld and honoured stock and i trust he hath not derogated from his ancestors by his present craft they all wrought wi steel man only the auld knights drilled holes wi their swords in their enemies corslets and he saws nicks in his brass wheels and i hope it is as honourable to give eyes to the blind as to slash them out of the head of those that see and to show us how to value our time as it passes as to fling it away in drinking brawling spearsplintering and suchlike unchristian doings and you maun understand that davy ramsay is no mechanic but follows a liberal art which approacheth almost to the act of creating a living being seeing it may be said of a watch as claudius saith of the sphere of archimedes the syracusan  inclusus variis famulatur spiritus astris  et vivum certis motibus urget opus  your majesty had best give auld davy a coatofarms as well as a pedigree said sir mungo  its done or ye bade sir mungo said the king and i trust we who are the fountain of all earthly honour are free to spirit a few drops of it on one so near our person without offence to the knight of castle girnigo we have already spoken with the learned men of the heralds college and we propose to grant him an augmented coatof arms being his paternal coat charged with the crownwheel of a watch in chief for a difference and we purpose to add time and eternity for supporters as soon as the garter kingatarms shall be able to devise how eternity is to be represented  i would make him twice as muckle as time footnote chaucer says there is nothing new but what it has been old the reader has here the original of an anecdote which has since been fathered on a scottish chief of our own time said archie armstrong the court fool who chanced to be present when the king stated this dilemma peace man ye shall be whippet said the king in return for this hint and you my liege subjects of england may weel take a hint from what we have said and not be in such a hurry to laugh at our scottish pedigrees though they be somewhat long derived and difficult to be deduced ye see that a man of right gentle blood may for a season lay by his gentry and yet ken whare to find it when he has occasion for it it would be as unseemly for a packman or pedlar as ye call a travelling merchant whilk is a trade to which our native subjects of scotland are specially addicted to be blazing his genealogy in the faces of those to whom he sells a bawbees worth of ribbon as it would be to him to have a beaver on his head and a rapier by his side when the pack was on his shoulders na nahe hings his sword on the cleek lays his beaver on the shelf puts his pedigree into his pocket and gangs as doucely and cannily about his peddling craft as if his blood was nae better than ditchwater but let our pedlar be transformed as i have kend it happen mair than ance into a bein thriving merchant then ye shall have a transformation my lords  in nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas  out he pulls his pedigree on he buckles his sword gives his beaver a brush and cocks it in the face of all creation we mention these things at the mair length because we would have you all to know that it is not without due consideration of the circumstances of all parties that we design in a small and private way to honour with our own royal presence the marriage of lord glenvarloch with margaret ramsay daughter and heiress of david ramsay our horologer and a cadet only thrice removed from the ancient house of dalwolsey we are grieved we cannot have the presence of the noble chief of that house at the ceremony but where there is honour to be won abroad the lord dalwolsey is seldom to be found at home sic fuit est et erit jingling geordie as ye stand to the cost of the marriage feast we look for good cheer  heriot bowed as in duty bound in fact the king who was a great politician about trifles had manoeuvred greatly on this occasion and had contrived to get the prince and buckingham dispatched on an expedition to newmarket in order that he might find an opportunity in their absence of indulging himself in his own gossiping coshering habits which were distasteful to charles whose temper inclined to formality and with which even the favourite of late had not thought it worth while to seem to sympathise when the levee was dismissed sir mungo malagrowther seized upon the worthy citizen in the court yard of the palace and detained him in spite of all his efforts for the purpose of subjecting him to the following scrutiny  this is a sair job on you master georgethe king must have had little considerationthis will cost you a bonny penny this wedding dinner  it will not break me sir mungo answered heriot the king hath a right to see the table which his bounty hath supplied for years well covered for a single day  vera true vera truewell have a to pay i doubt less or maira sort of pennywedding it will prove where all men contribute to the young folks maintenance that they may not have just four bare legs in a bed together what do you propose to give master georgewe begin with the city when money is in question footnote the penny wedding of the scots now disused even among the lowest ranks was a peculiar species of merrymaking at which if the wedded pair were popular the guests who convened contributed considerable sums under pretence of paying for the bridal festivity but in reality to set the married folk afloat in the world  only a trifle sir mungoi give my goddaughter the marriage ring it is a curious jeweli bought it in italy it belonged to cosmo de medici the bride will not need my helpshe has an estate which belonged to her maternal grandfather  the auld soapboiler said sir mungo it will need some of his suds to scour the blot out of the glenvarloch shieldi have heard that estate was no great things  it is as good as some posts at court sir mungo which are coveted by persons of high quality replied george heriot  court favour said ye court favour master heriot replied sir mungo choosing then to use his malady of misapprehension moonshine in water poor thing if that is all she is to be tochered withi am truly solicitous about them  i will let you into a secret said the citizen which will relieve your tender anxiety the dowager lady dalgarno gives a competent fortune to the bride and settles the rest of her estate upon her nephew the bridegroom  ay say ye sae said sir mungo just to show her regard to her husband that is in the tomblucky that her nephew did not send him there it was a strange story that death of poor lord dalgarnosome folk think the poor gentleman had much wrong little good comes of marrying the daughter of the house you are at feud with indeed it was less poor dalgarnos fault than theirs that forced the match on him but i am glad the young folk are to have something to live on come how it like whether by charity or inheritance but if the lady dalgarno were to sell all she has even to her very wyliecoat she canna gie them back the fair castle of glenvarlochthat is lost and ganelost and gane  it is but too true said george heriot we cannot discover what has become of the villain andrew skurliewhitter or what lord dalgarno has done with the mortgage  assigned it away to some one that his wife might not get it after he was gane it would have disturbed him in his grave to think glenvarloch should get that land back again said sir mungo depend on it he will have taen sure measures to keep that noble lordship out of her grips or her nevoys either  indeed it is but too probable sir mungo said master heriot but as i am obliged to go and look after many things in consequence of this ceremony i must leave you to comfort yourself with the reflection  the brideday you say is to be on the thirtieth of the instant month said sir mungo holloing after the citizen i will be with you in the hour of cause  the king invites the guests said george heriot without turning back  the baseborn illbred mechanic soliloquised sir mungo if it were not the odd score of pounds he lent me last week i would teach him how to bear himself to a man of quality but i will be at the bridal banquet in spite of him  sir mungo contrived to get invited or commanded to attend on the bridal accordingly at which there were but few persons present for james on such occasions preferred a snug privacy which gave him liberty to lay aside the encumbrance as he felt it to be of his regal dignity the company was very small and indeed there were at least two persons absent whose presence might have been expected the first of these was the lady dalgarno the state of whose health as well as the recent death of her husband precluded her attendance on the ceremony the other absentee was richie moniplies whose conduct for some time past had been extremely mysterious regulating his attendance on lord glenvarloch entirely according to his own will and pleasure he had ever since the rencounter in enfield chase appeared regularly at his bedside in the morning to assist him to dress and at his wardrobe in the evening the rest of the day he disposed of at his own pleasure without control from his lord who had now a complete establishment of attendants yet he was somewhat curious to know how the fellow disposed of so much of his time but on this subject richie showed no desire to be communicative  on the morning of the bridalday richie was particularly attentive in doing all a valetdechambre could so as to set off to advantage the very handsome figure of his master and when he had arranged his dress to the utmost exactness and put to his long curled locks what he called the finishing touch of the reddingkaim he gravely kneeled down kissed his hand and bade him farewell saying that he humbly craved leave to discharge himself of his lordships service  why what humour is this said lord glenvarloch if you mean to discharge yourself of my service richie i suppose you intend to enter my wifes  i wish her good ladyship that shall soon be and your good lordship the blessings of as good a servant as myself in heavens good time said richie but fate hath so ordained it that i can henceforth only be your servant in the way of friendly courtesy  well richie said the young lord if you are tired of service we will seek some better provision for you but you will wait on me to the church and partake of the bridal dinner  under favour my lord answered richie i must remind you of our covenant having presently some pressing business of mine own whilk will detain me during the ceremony but i will not fail to prie master georges good cheer in respect he has made very costly fare whilk it would be unthankful not to partake of  do as you list answered lord glenvarloch and having bestowed a passing thought on the whimsical and pragmatical disposition of his follower he dismissed the subject for others better suited to the day  the reader must fancy the scattered flowers which strewed the path of the happy couple to churchthe loud music which accompanied the processionthe marriage service performed by a bishopthe king who met them at saint pauls giving away the brideto the great relief of her father who had thus time during the ceremony to calculate the just quotient to be laid on the pinion of report in a timepiece which he was then putting together  when the ceremony was finished the company were transported in the royal carriages to george heriots where a splendid collation was provided for the marriageguests in the foljambe apartments the king no sooner found himself in this snug retreat than casting from him his sword and belt with such haste as if they burnt his fingers and flinging his plumed hat on the table as who should say lie there authority he swallowed a hearty cup of wine to the happiness of the married couple and began to amble about the room mumping laughing and cracking jests neither the wittiest nor the most delicate but accompanied and applauded by shouts of his own mirth in order to encourage that of the company whilst his majesty was in the midst of this gay humour and a call to the banquet was anxiously expected a servant whispered master heriot forth of the apartment when he re entered he walked up to the king and in his turn whispered something at which james started  he is not wanting his siller said the king shortly and sharply  by no means my liege answered heriot it is a subject he states himself as quite indifferent about so long as it can pleasure your majesty  body of us man said the king it is the speech of a true man and a loving subject and we will grace him accordinglywhat though he be but a carlea twopenny cat may look at a king swith man have him pundite foresmonipliesthey should have called the chield monypennies though i sall warrant you english think we have not such a name in scotland  it is an ancient and honourable stock the monypennies said sir mungo malagrowther the only loss is there are sae few of the name  the family seems to increase among your countrymen sir mungo said master lowestoffe whom lord glenvarloch had invited to be present since his majestys happy accession brought so many of you here  right sirright said sir mungo nodding and looking at george heriot there have some of ourselves been the better of that great blessing to the english nation  as he spoke the door flew open and in entered to the astonishment of lord glenvarloch his late servingman richie moniplies now sumptuously nay gorgeously attired in a superb brocaded suit and leading in his hand the tall thin withered somewhat distorted form of martha trapbois arrayed in a complete dress of black velvet which suited so strangely with the pallid and severe melancholy of her countenance that the king himself exclaimed in some perturbation what the deil has the fallow brought us here body of our regal selves it is a corpse that has run off with the mortcloth  may i sifflicate your majesty to be gracious unto her said richie being that she is in respect of this mornings wark my ain wedded wife mrs martha moniplies by name  saul of our body man but she looks wondrous grim answered king james art thou sure she has not been in her time maid of honour to queen mary our kinswoman of redhot memory  i am sure an it like your majesty that she has brought me fifty thousand pounds of good siller and better and that has enabled me to pleasure your majesty and other folk  ye need have said naething about that man said the king we ken our obligations in that sma matter and we are glad this rudas spouse of thine hath bestowed her treasure on ane wha kens to put it to the profit of his king and countrybut how the deil did ye come by her man  in the auld scottish fashion my liege she is the captive of my bow and my spear answered moniplies there was a convention that she should wed me when i avenged her fathers deathso i slew and took possession  it is the daughter of old trapbois who has been missed so long said lowestoffewhere the devil could you mew her up so closely friend richie  master richard if it be your will answered richie or master richard moniplies if you like it better for mewing of her up i found her a shelter in all honour and safety under the roof of an honest countryman of my ownand for secrecy it was a point of prudence when wantons like you were abroad master lowestoffe  there was a laugh at richies magnanimous reply on the part of every one but his bride who made to him a signal of impatience and said with her usual brevity and sternnesspeacepeace i pray you peace let us do that which we came for so saying she took out a bundle of parchments and delivering them to lord glenvarloch she said aloudi take this royal presence and all here to witness that i restore the ransomed lordship of glenvarloch to the right owner as free as ever it was held by any of his ancestors  i witnessed the redemption of the mortgage said lowestoffe but i little dreamt by whom it had been redeemed  no need ye should said richie there would have been small wisdom in crying roastmeat  peace said his bride once morethis paper she continued delivering another to lord glenvarloch is also your propertytake it but spare me the question how it came into my custody  the king had bustled forward beside lord glenvarloch and fixing an eager eye on the writing exclaimedbody of ourselves it is our royal signmanual for the money which was so long out of sighthow came you by it mistress bride  it is a secret said martha dryly  a secret which my tongue shall never utter said richie resolutelyunless the king commands me on my allegiance  i doi do command you said james trembling and stammering with the impatient curiosity of a gossip while sir mungo with more malicious anxiety to get at the bottom of the mystery stooped his long thin form forward like a bent fishingrod raised his thin grey locks from his ear and curved his hand behind it to collect every vibration of the expected intelligence martha in the meantime frowned most ominously on richie who went on undauntedly to inform the king that his deceased fatherinlaw a good careful man in the main had a touch of worldly wisdom about him that at times marred the uprightness of his walk he liked to dabble among his neighbours gear and some of it would at times stick to his fingers in the handling  for shame man for shame said martha since the infamy of the deed must be told be it at least brieflyyes my lord she added addressing glenvarloch the piece of gold was not the sole bait which brought the miserable old man to your chamber that dreadful nighthis object and he accomplished it was to purloin this paper the wretched scrivener was with him that morning and i doubt not urged the doting old man to this villainy to offer another bar to the ransom of your estate if there was a yet more powerful agent at the bottom of this conspiracy god forgive it to him at this moment for he is now where the crime must be answered  amen said lord glenvarloch and it was echoed by all present  for my father continued she with her stern features twitched by an involuntary and convulsive movement his guilt and folly cost him his life and my belief is constant that the wretch who counselled him that morning to purloin the paper left open the window for the entrance of the murderers  every body was silent for an instant the king was first to speak commanding search instantly to be made for the guilty scrivener i lictor he concluded colliga manuscaput obnubitoinfelici suspendite arbori  lowestoffe answered with due respect that the scrivener had absconded at the time of lord dalgarnos murder and had not been heard of since  let him be sought for said the king and now let us change the discoursethese stories make ones very blood grew and are altogether unfit for bridal festivity hymen o hymenee added he snapping his fingers lord glenvarloch what say you to mistress moniplies this bonny bride that has brought you back your fathers estate on your bridal day  let him say nothing my liege said martha that will best suit his feelings and mine  there is redemptionmoney at the least to be repaid said lord glenvarloch in that i cannot remain debtor  we will speak of it hereafter said martha my debtor you cannot be and she shut her mouth as if determined to say nothing more on the subject  sir mungo however resolved not to part with the topic and availing himself of the freedom of the moment said to richiea queer story that of your fatherinlaw honest man methinks your bride thanked you little for ripping it up  i make it a rule sir mungo replied richie always to speak any evil i know about my family myself having observed that if i do not it is sure to be told by ither folks  but richie said sir mungo it seems to me that this bride of yours is like to be master and mair in the conjugal state  if she abides by words sir mungo answered richie i thank heaven i can be as deaf as any one and if she comes to dunts i have twa hands to paik her with  weel said richie again said the king you have gotten it on baith haffits sir mungotroth mistress bride for a fule your gudeman has a pretty turn of wit  there are fools sire replied she who have wit and fools who have courageaye and fools who have learning and are great fools notwithstandingi chose this man because he was my protector when i was desolate and neither for his wit nor his wisdom he is truly honest and has a heart and hand that make amends for some folly since i was condemned to seek a protector through the world which is to me a wilderness i may thank god that i have come by no worse  and that is sae sensibly said replied the king that by my saul ill try whether i canna make him better kneel down richiesomebody lend me a rapieryours mr langstaff thats a brave name for a lawyerye need not flash it out that gate templar fashion as if ye were about to pink a bailiff  he took the drawn sword and with averted eyes for it was a sight he loved not to look on endeavoured to lay it on richies shoulder but nearly stuck it into his eye richie starting back attempted to rise but was held down by lowestoffe while sir mungo guiding the royal weapon the honourbestowing blow was given and received surge carnifexrise up sir richard moniplies of castlecollop and my lords and lieges let us all to our dinner for the cocka leekie is cooling     notes   note i p l4david ramsay  david ramsay watchmaker and horologer to james i was a real person though the author has taken the liberty of pressing him into the service of fiction although his profession led him to cultivate the exact sciences like many at this period he mingled them with pursuits which were mystical and fantastic the truth was that the boundaries between truth and falsehood in mathematics astronomy and similar pursuits were not exactly known and there existed a sort of terra incognita between them in which the wisest men bewildered themselves david ramsay risked his money on the success of the vaticinations which his researches led him to form since he sold clocks and watches under condition that their value should not become payable till king james was crowned in the popes chair at rome such wagers were common in that day as may be seen by looking at jonsons every man out of his humour  david ramsay was also an actor in another singular scene in which the notorious astrologer lilly was a performer and had no small expectation on the occasion since he brought with him a halfquartern sack to put the treasure in  david ramsay his majestys clockmaker had been informed that there was a great quantity of treasure buried in the cloister of westminster abbey he acquaints dean withnam therewith who was also then bishop of lincoln the dean gave him liberty to search after it with this proviso that if any was discovered his church should have a share of it davy ramsay finds out one john scott who pretended the use of the mosaical rods to assist him herein footnote the same now called i believe the divining rod and applied to the discovery of water not obvious to the eye i was desired to join with him unto which i consented one winters night davy ramsay with several gentlemen myself and scott entered the cloisters we played the hazel rods round about the cloisters upon the west end of the cloisters the rods turned one over another an argument that the treasure was there the labourers digged at least six feet deep and then we met with a coffin but which in regard it was not heavy we did not open which we afterwards much repented  from the cloisters we went into the abbey church where upon a sudden there being no wind when we began so fierce and so high so blustering and loud a wind did rise that we verily believed the west end of the church would have fallen upon us our rods would not move at all the candles and torches also but one were extinguished or burned very dimly john scott my partner was amazed looked pale knew not what to think or do until i gave directions and command to dismiss the demons which when done all was quiet again and each man returned unto his lodging late about twelve oclock at night i could never since be induced to join with any such like actions  the true miscarriage of the business was by reason of so many people being present at the operation for there was about thirty some laughing others deriding us so that if we had not dismissed the demons i believe most part of the abbey church would have been blown down secrecy and intelligent operators with a strong confidence and knowledge of what they are doing are best for the worklillys life and times p 46  david ramsay had a son called william ramsay who appears to have possessed all his fathers credulity he became an astrologer and in 16512 published vox stellarum an introduction to the judgment of eclipses and the annual revolutions of the world the edition of 1652 is inscribed to his father it would appear as indeed it might be argued from his mode of disposing of his goods that the old horologer had omitted to make hay while the sun shone for his son in his dedication has this exception to the paternal virtues its true your carelessness in laying up while the sun shone for the tempests of a stormy day hath given occasion to some inferior spirited people not to value you according to what you are by nature and in yourself for such look not to a man longer than he is in prosperity esteeming none but for their wealth not wisdom power nor virtue from these expressions it is to be apprehended that while old david ramsay a follower of the stewarts sunk under the parliamentary government his son william had advanced from being a dupe to astrology to the dignity of being himself a cheat  note ii p 27george heriot  this excellent person was but little known by his actions when alive but we may well use in this particular the striking phrase of scripture that being dead he yet speaketh we have already mentioned in the introduction the splendid charity of which he was the founder the few notices of his personal history are slight and meagre  george heriot was born at trabroun in the parish of gladsmuir he was the eldest son of a goldsmith in edinburgh descended from a family of some consequence in east lothian his father enjoyed the confidence of his fellowcitizens and was their representative in parliament he was besides one of the deputies sent by the inhabitants of the city to propitiate the king when he had left edinburgh abruptly after the riot of 17th december 1596  george heriot the son pursued his fathers occupation of a goldsmith then peculiarly lucrative and much connected with that of a moneybroker he enjoyed the favour and protection of james and of his consort anne of denmark he married for his first wife a maiden of his own rank named christian marjoribanks daughter of a respectable burgess this was in 1586 he was afterwards named jeweller to the queen whose account to him for a space of ten years amounted to nearly l40000 george heriot having lost his wife connected himself with the distinguished house of rosebery by marrying a daughter of james primrose clerk to the privy council of this lady he was deprived by her dying in childbirth in 1612 before attaining her twentyfirst year after a life spent in honourable and successful industry george heriot died in london to which city he had followed his royal master on the 12th february 1624 at the age of sixtyone years his picture copied by scougal from a lost original in which he is represented in the prime of life is thus described his fair hair which overshades the thoughtful brow and calm calculating eye with the cast of humour on the lower part of the countenance are all indicative of the genuine scottish character and well distinguish a person fitted to move steadily and wisely through the world with a strength of resolution to ensure success and a disposition to enjoy ithistorical and descriptive account of heriots hospital with a memoir of the founder by messrs james and john johnstone edinburgh 1827  i may add as every thing concerning george heriot is interesting that his second wife alison primrose was interred in saint gregorys church from the register of which parish the rev mr barham rector has in the kindest manner sent me the following extractmrs alison the wife of mr george heriot

edition of stewes survey of london book iii page 228  note iii p 39proclamation against the scots coming to england  the english agreed in nothing more unanimously than in censuring james on account of the beggarly rabble which not only attended the king at his coming first out of scotland but says osborne which through his whole reign like a fluent spring were found still crossing the tweed yet it is certain from the number of proclamations published by the privy council in scotland and bearing marks of the kings own diction that he was sensible of the whole inconveniences and unpopularity attending the importunate crowd of disrespectable suitors and as desirous to get rid of them as his southern subjects could be but it was in vain that his majesty argued with his scottish subjects on the disrespect they were bringing on their native country and sovereign by causing the english to suppose there were no well nurtured or independent gentry in scotland they who presented themselves being in the opinion and conceit of all beholders but idle rascals and poor miserable bodies it was even in vain that the vessels which brought up this unwelcome cargo of petitioners were threatened with fine and confiscation the undaunted suitors continued to press forward and as one of the proclamations says many of them under pretence of requiring payment of auld debts due to them by the king which it is observed with great naivete is of all kinds of importunity most unpleasing to his majesty the expressions in the text are selected from these curious proclamations  note iv p 59king james  the dress of this monarch together with his personal appearance is thus described by a contemporary  he was of a middle stature more corpulent through ie by means of his clothes than in his body yet fat enough his legs were very weak having had as was thought some foul play in his youth or rather before he was born that he was not able to stand at seven years of age that weakness made him ever leaning on other mens shoulders his walk was even circular his hands are in that walk ever fiddling abouta part of dress now laid aside he would make a great deal too bold with god in his passion both with cursing and swearing and a strain higher verging on blasphemy but would in his better temper say he hoped god would not impute them as sins and lay them to his charge seeing they proceeded from passion he had need of great assistance rather than hope that would daily make thus bold with goddalzells sketches of scottish history  p 86  note v p 78sir mungo malagrowther  it will perhaps be recognised by some of my countrymen that the caustic scottish knight as described in the preceding chapter borrowed some of his attributes from a most worthy and respectable baronet who was to be met with in edinburgh society about twentyfive or thirty years ago it is not by any means to be inferred that the living person resembled the imaginary one in the course of life ascribed to him or in his personal attributes but his fortune was little adequate to his rank and the antiquity of his family and to avenge himself of this disparity the worthy baronet lost no opportunity of making the more avowed sons of fortune feel the edge of his satire this he had the art of disguising under the personal infirmity of deafness and usually introduced his most severe things by an affected mistake of what was said around him for example at a public meeting of a certain county this worthy gentleman had chosen to display a laced coat of such a pattern as had not been seen in society for the better part of a century the young men who were present amused themselves with rallying him on his taste when he suddenly singled out one of the partyauld dye think my coat auldfashionedindeed it canna be new but it was the wark of a braw tailor and that was your grandfather who was at the head of the trade in edinburgh about the beginning of last century upon another occasion when this type of sir mungo malagrowther happened to hear a nobleman the high chief of one of those border clans who were accused of paying very little attention in ancient times to the distinctions of meum and tuum addressing a gentleman of the same name as if conjecturing there should be some relationship between them he volunteered to ascertain the nature of the connexion by saying that the chiefs ancestors had stolen the cows and the other gentlemans ancestors had killed themfame ascribing the origin of the latter family to a butcher it may be well imagined that among a people that have been always punctilious about genealogy such a person who had a general acquaintance with all the flaws and specks in the shields of the proud the pretending and the nouveaux riches must have had the same scope for amusement as a monkey in a china shop  note vi p 98mrs anne turner  mrs anne turner was a dame somewhat of the occupation of mrs suddlechop in the text that is half milliner half procuress and secret agent in all manner of proceedings she was a trafficker in the poisoning of sir thomas overbury for which so many subordinate agents lost their lives while to the great scandal of justice the earl of somerset and his countess were suffered to escape upon a threat of somerset to make public some secret which nearly affected his master king james mrs turner introduced into england a french custom of using yellow starch in getting up bands and cuffs and by lord cokes orders she appeared in that fashion at the place of execution she was the widow of a physician and had been eminently beautiful as appears from the description of her in the poem called overburys vision there was produced in court a parcel of dolls or puppets belonging to this lady some naked some dressed and which she used for exhibiting fashions upon but greatly to the horror of the spectators who accounted these figures to be magical devices there was on their being shown heard a crack from the scaffold which caused great fear tumult and confusion among the spectators and throughout the hall every one fearing hurt as if the devil had been present and grown angry to have his workmanship showed to such as were not his own scholars compare this curious passage in the history of king james for the first fourteen years 1651 with the aulicus coquinarius of dr heylin both works are published in the secret history of king james  note vii p 110lord huntinglen  the credit of having rescued james i from the dagger of alexander ruthven is here fictitiously ascribed to an imaginary lord huntinglen in reality as may be read in every history his preserver was john ramsay afterwards created earl of holderness who stabbed the younger ruthven with his dagger while he was struggling with the king sir anthony weldon informs us that upon the annual return of the day the kings deliverance was commemorated by an anniversary feast the time was the fifth of august upon which proceeds the satirical historian sir john ramsay for his good service in that preservation was the principal guest and so did the king grant him any boon he would ask that day but he had such limitation made to his asking as made his suit as unprofitable as the action for which he asked it for was unserviceable to the king  note viii p 115buckingham  buckingham who had a frankness in his high and irascible ambition was always ready to bid defiance to those by whom he was thwarted or opposed he aspired to be created prince of tipperary in ireland and lord high constable of england coventry then lord keeper opposed what seemed such an unreasonable extent of power as was annexed to the office of constable on this opposition according to sir anthony weldon the duke peremptorily accosted coventry who made you lord keeper coventry he replied the king buckingham replied its false twas i did make you and you shall know that i who made you can and will unmake you coventry thus answered him did i conceive that i held my place by your favour i would presently unmake myself by rendering up the seals to his majesty then buckingham in a scorn and fury flung from him saying you shall not keep it long and surely had not felton prevented him he had made good his wordweldons court of king james and charles   note ix p 134pages in the seventeenth century  about this time the ancient customs arising from the long prevalence of chivalry began to be grossly varied from the original purposes of the institution none was more remarkable than the change which took place in the breeding and occupation of pages this peculiar species of menial originally consisted of youths of noble birth who that they might be trained to the exercise of arms were early removed from their paternal homes where too much indulgence might have been expected to be placed in the family of some prince or man of rank and military renown where they served as it were an apprenticeship to the duties of chivalry and courtesy their education was severely moral and pursued with great strictness in respect to useful exercises and what were deemed elegant accomplishments from being pages they were advanced to the next gradation of squires from squires these candidates for the honours of knighthood were frequently made knights  but in the sixteenth century the page had become in many instances a mere domestic who sometimes by the splendour of his address and appearance was expected to make up in show for the absence of a whole band of retainers with swords and bucklers we have sir johns authority when he cashiers part of

second son of the poetical earl of surrey and possessed considerable parts and learning he wrote in the year 1583 a book called a defensative against the poison of supposed prophecies he gained the favour of queen elizabeth by having he says directed his battery against a sect of prophets and pretended soothsayers whom he accounted infesti regibus as he expresses it in the last years of the queen he became jamess most ardent partisan and conducted with great pedantry but much intrigue the correspondence betwixt the scottish king and the younger cecil upon jamess accession he was created earl of northampton and lord privy seal according to de beaumont the french ambassador lord henry howard was one of the greatest flatterers and calumniators that ever lived  note xi p 136skirmishes in the public streets  edinburgh appears to have been one of the most disorderly towns in europe during the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century the diary of the honest citizen birrel repeatedly records such incidents as the following the 24 of november 1567 at two afternoon the laird of airth and the laird of weems met on the high gate of edinburgh and they and their followers fought a very bloody skirmish where there were many hurt on both sides with shot of pistol these skirmishes also took place in london itself in shadwells play of the scowrers an old rake thus boasts of his early exploitsi knew the hectors and before them the muns and the tityretus they were brave fellows indeed in these days a man could not go from the rose garden to the piazza once but he must venture his life twice my dear sir willie but it appears that the affrays which in the scottish capital arose out of hereditary quarrels and ancient feuds were in london the growth of the licentiousness and arrogance of young debauchees  note xii p 144french cookery  the exertion of french ingenuity mentioned in the text is noticed by some authorities of the period the siege of leith was also distinguished by the protracted obstinacy of the besieged in which was displayed all that the age possessed of defensive war so that brantome records that those who witnessed this siege had from that very circumstance a degree of consequence yielded to their persons and opinions he tells a story of strozzi himself from which it appears that his jests lay a good deal in the line of the cuisine he caused a mule to be stolen from one brusquet on whom he wished to play a trick and served up the flesh of that unclean animal so well disguised that it passed with brusquet for venison  note xiii p 145cuckoos nest  the quarrel in this chapter between the pretended captain and the citizen of london is taken from a burlesque poem called the counter scuffle that is the scuffle in the prison at wood street so called it is a piece of low humour which had at the time very considerable vogue the prisoners it seems had fallen into a dispute amongst themselves which calling was of most repute and a lawyer put in his claim to be most highly considered the man of war repelled his pretence with much arrogance     wert not for us thou swad quoth he     where wouldst thou fay to get a fee     but to defend such things as thee             tis pity     for such as you esteem us least     who ever have been ready prest     to guard you and your cuckoos nest             the city  the offence is no sooner given than it is caught up by a gallant citizen a goldsmith named ellis    of london city i am free     and there i first my wife did see     and for that very cause said he             i love it      and he that calls it cuckoos nest     except he say he speaks in jest     he is a villain and a beast             ill prove it      for though i am a man of trade     and free of london city made     yet can i use gun bill and blade             in battle      and citizens if need require     themselves can force the foe retire     whatever this low country squire              may prattle  the dispute terminates in the scuffle which is the subject of the poem the whole may be found in the second edition of drydens miscellany 12mo vol iii 1716  note xiv p 150burbage  burbage whom camden terms another roscius was probably the original representative of richard iii and seems to have been early almost identified with his prototype bishop corbet in his iter boreale tells us that mine host of market bosworth was full of ale and history    hear him see you yon wood there richard lay    with his whole army look the other way    and lo where richmond in a field of gorse    encampd himself in might and all his force    upon this hill they met why he could tell    the inch where richmond stood where richard fell    besides what of his knowledge he could say    he had authentic notice from the play    which i might guess bys mustering up the ghosts    and policies not incident to hosts    but chiefly by that one perspicuous thing    where he mistook a player for a king    for when he would have said that richard died    and calld a horse a horse he burbage cried              richard corbets poems edition 1815 p 193  note xv p 323mhicallastarmore  this is the highland patronymic of the late gallant chief of glengarry the allusion in the text is to an unnecessary alarm taken by some lady at the ceremonial of the coronation of george iv at the sight of the pistols which the chief wore as a part of his highland dress the circumstance produced some confusion which was talked of at the time all who knew glengarry and the author knew him well were aware that his principles were of devoted loyalty to the person of his sovereign  note xvi p 323king jamess hunting bottle  roger coke in his detection of the court and state of england london 1697 p70 observes of james i the king was excessively addicted to hunting and drinking not ordinary french and spanish wines but strong greek wines and thought he would compound his hunting with these wines and to that purpose he was attended by a special officer who was as much as he could be always at hand to fill the kings cup in hunting when he called for it i have heard my father say that hunting with the king after the king had drank of the wine he also drank of it and though he was young and of a healthful disposition it so deranged his head that it spoiled his pleasure and disordered him for three days after whether it was from drinking these wines or from some other cause the king became so lazy and so unwieldy that he was trussed on horseback and as he was set so would he ride without stirring himself in the saddle nay when his hat was set upon his head he would not take the trouble to alter it but it sate as it was put on  the trussing for which the demipique saddle of the day afforded particular facility is alluded to in the text and the author among other nickcnacks of antiquity possesses a leathern flask like those carried by sportsmen which is labelled king jamess hunting bottle with what authenticity is uncertain coke seems to have exaggerated the kings taste for the bottle welldon says james was not intemperate in his drinking however in his old age buckinghams jovial suppers when he had any turn to do with him made him sometimes overtaken which he would the next day remember and repent with tears it is true he drank very often which was rather out of a custom than any delight and his drinks were of that kind for strength as frontiniack canary high country wine tent wine and scottish ale that had he not had a very strong brain he might have been daily overtaken though he seldom drank at any one time above four spoonfuls many times not above one or twosecret history of king james vol ii p 3 edin 1811  note xvii p 325scene in greenwich park  i cannot here omit mentioning that a painting of the old school is in existence having a remarkable resemblance to the scene described in the foregoing chapter although it be nevertheless true that the similarity is in all respects casual and that the author knew not of the existence of the painting till it was sold amongst others with the following description attached to it in a welldrawnup catalogue                               frederigo zucchero     scene as represented in the fortunes of nigel by frederigo zucchero the kings painter  this extraordinary picture which independent of its pictorial merit has been esteemed a great literary curiosity represents most faithfully the meeting in greenwich park between king james and nigel oliphaunt as described in the fortunes of nigel showing that the author must have taken the anecdote from authenticated facts in the centre of the picture sits king james on horseback very erect and stiffly between the king and prince charles who is on the left of the picture the duke of buckingham is represented riding a black horse and pointing eagerly towards the culprit nigel olifaunt who is standing on the right side of the picture he grasps with his right hand a gun or crossbow and looks angrily towards the king who seems somewhat confused and alarmed behind nigel his servant is restraining two dogs which are barking fiercely nigel and his servant are both clothed in red the livery of the oliphaunt family in which to this day the townofficers of perth are clothed there being an old charter granting to the oliphaunt family the privilege of dressing the public officers of perth in their livery the duke of buckingham is in all respects equal in magnificence of dress to the king or the prince the only difference that is marked between him and royalty is that his head is uncovered the king and the prince wear their hats in letitia aikins memoirs of the reign of king james will be found a letter from sir thomas howard to lord l harrington in which he recommends the latter to come to court mentioning that his majesty has spoken favourably of him he then proceeds to give him some advice by which he is likely to find favour in the kings eyes he tells him to wear a bushy ruff well starched and after various other directions as to his dress he concludes but above all things fail not to praise the roan jennet whereon the king doth daily ride in this picture king james is represented on the identical roan jennet in the background of the picture are seen two or three suspiciouslooking figures as if watching the success of some plot these may have been put in by the painter to flatter the king by making it be supposed that he had actually escaped or successfully combated some serious plot the king is attended by a numerous band of courtiers and attendants all of whom seem moving forward to arrest the defaulter the painting of this picture is extremely good but the drawing is very gothic and there is no attempt at the keeping of perspective the picture is very dark and obscure which considerably adds to the interest of the scene  note xviii p 325king jamess timidity  the fears of james for his personal safety were often excited without serious grounds on one occasion having been induced to visit a coal pit on the coast of fife he was conducted a little way under the sea and brought to daylight again on a small island or what was such at full tide down which a shaft had been sunk james who conceived his life or liberty aimed at when he found himself on an islet surrounded by the sea instead of admiring as his cicerone hoped the unexpected change of scene cried treason with all his might and could not be pacified till he was rowed ashore at lockmaben he took an equally causeless alarm from a still slighter circumstance some vendisses a fish peculiar to the loch were presented to the royal table as a delicacy but the king who was not familiar with their appearance concluded they were poisoned and broke up the banquet with most admired disorder  note xix p 328traitors gate  traitors gate which opens from the tower of london to the thames was as its name implies that by which persons accused of state offences were conveyed to their prison when the tide is making and the ancient gate is beheld from within the buildings it used to be a most striking part of the old fortress but it is now much injured in appearance being half built up with masonry to support a steam engine or something of that sort  note xx p 361punishment of stubbs by mutilation  this execution which so captivated the imagination of sir mungo malagrowther was really a striking one the criminal a furious and bigoted puritan had published a book in very violent terms against the match of elizabeth with the duke of alencon which he termed an union of a daughter of god with a son of antichrist queen elizabeth was greatly incensed at the freedom assumed in this work and caused the author stubbs with page the publisher and one singleton the printer to be tried on an act passed by philip and mary against the writers and dispersers of seditious publications they were convicted and although there was an opinion strongly entertained by the lawyers that the act was only temporary and expired with queen mary stubbs and page received sentence to have their right hands struck off they accordingly suffered the punishment the wrist being divided by a cleaver driven through the joint by force of a mallet the printer was pardoned i remember says the historian camden being then present that stubbs when his right hand was cut off plucked off his hat with the left and said with a loud voice god save the queen the multitude standing about was deeply silent either out of horror of this new and unwonted kind of punishment or out of commiseration towards the man as being of an honest and unblamable repute or else out of hatred to the marriage which most men presaged would be the overthrow of religioncamdbns annals for the year 1581  note xxi p 375rlchie moniplies behind the arras  the practical jest of richie moniplies going behind the arras to get an opportunity of teasing heriot was a pleasantry such as james might be supposed to approve of it was customary for those who knew his humour to contrive jests of this kind for his amusement the celebrated archie armstrong and another jester called drummond mounted on other peoples backs used to charge each other like knights in the tiltyard to the monarchs great amusement the following is an instance of the same kind taken from webster upon witchcraft the author is speaking of the faculty called ventriloquism  but to make this more plain and certain we shall add a story of a notable impostor or ventriloquist from the testimony of mr ady which we have had confirmed from the mouth of some courtiers that both saw and knew him and is thisit hath been saith he credibly reported that there was a man in the court of king james his days that could act this imposture so lively that he could call the king by name and cause the king to look round about him wondering who it was that called him whereas he that called him stood before him in his presence with his face towards him but after this imposture was known the king in his merriment would sometimes take occasionally this impostor to make sport upon some of his courtiers as for instance  there was a knight belonging to the court whom the king caused to come before him in his private room where no man was but the king and this knight and the impostor and feigned some occasion of serious discourse with the knight but when the king began to speak and the knight bending his attention to the king suddenly there came a voice as out of another room calling the knight by name sir john sir john come away sir john at which the knight began to frown that any man should be unmannerly as to molest the king and him and still listening to the kings discourse the voice came again sir john sir john come away and drink off your sack at that sir john began to swell with anger and looked into the next room to see who it was that dared to call him so importunately and could not find out who it was and having chid with whomsoever he found he returned again to the king the king had no sooner begun to speak as formerly but the voice came again sir john come away your sack stayeth for you at that sir john began to stamp with madness and looked out and returned several times to the king but could not be quiet in his discourse with the king because of the voice that so often troubled him till the king had sported enoughwebster on witchcraft p 124  note xxii p 393lady lake  whether out of a meddling propensity common to all who have a gossiping disposition or from the love of justice which ought to make part of a princes character james was very fond of enquiring personally into the causes celebres which occurred during his reign in the imposture of the boy of bilson who pretended to be possessed and of one richard haydock a poor scholar who pretended to preach during his sleep the king to use the historian wilsons expression took delight in sounding with the line of his understanding the depths of these brutish impositions and in doing so showed the acuteness with which he was endowed by nature lady lakes story consisted in a clamorous complaint against the countess of exeter whom she accused of a purpose to put to death lady lake herself and her daughter lady ross the wife of the countesss own soninlaw lord ross and a forged letter was produced in which lady exeter was made to acknowledge such a purpose the account given of the occasion of obtaining this letter was that it had been written by the countess at wimbledon in presence of lady lake and her daughter lady ross being designed to procure their forgiveness for her mischievous intention the king remained still unsatisfied the writing in his opinion bearing some marks of forgery lady lake and her daughter then alleged that besides their own attestation and that of a confidential domestic named diego in whose presence lady exeter had written the confession their story might also be supported by the oath of their waitingmaid who had been placed behind the hangings at the time the letter was written and heard the countess of exeter read over the confession after she had signed it determined to be at the bottom of this accusation james while hunting one day near wimbledon the scene of the alleged confession suddenly left his sport and galloping hastily to wimbledon in order to examine personally the room discovered from the size of the apartment that the alleged conversation could not have taken place in the manner sworn to and that the tapestry of the chamber which had remained in the same state for thirty years was too short by two feet and therefore could not have concealed any one behind it this matter was accounted an exclusive discovery of the king by his own spirit of shrewd investigation the parties were punished in the star chamber by fine and imprisonment    a all
