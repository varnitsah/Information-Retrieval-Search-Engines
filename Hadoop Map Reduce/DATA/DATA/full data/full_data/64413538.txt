64413538	pandora  by henry james     chapter i    it has long been the custom of the north german lloyd steamers which convey passengers from bremen to new york to anchor for several hours in the pleasant port of southampton where their human cargo receives many additions  an intelligent young german count otto vogelstein hardly knew a few years ago whether to condemn this custom or approve it  he leaned over the bulwarks of the donau as the american passengers crossed the plankthe travellers who embark at southampton are mainly of that nationalityand curiously indifferently vaguely through the smoke of his cigar saw them absorbed in the huge capacity of the ship where he had the agreeable consciousness that his own nest was comfortably made  to watch from such a point of vantage the struggles of those less fortunate than ourselvesof the uninformed the unprovided the belated the bewilderedis an occupation not devoid of sweetness and there was nothing to mitigate the complacency with which our young friend gave himself up to it nothing that is save a natural benevolence which had not yet been extinguished by the consciousness of official greatness  for count vogelstein was official as i think you would have seen from the straightness of his back the lustre of his light elegant spectacles and something discreet and diplomatic in the curve of his moustache which looked as if it might well contribute to the principal function as cynics say of the lipsthe active concealment of thought  he had been appointed to the secretaryship of the german legation at washington and in these first days of the autumn was about to take possession of his post  he was a model character for such a purposeserious civil ceremonious curious stiff stuffed with knowledge and convinced that as lately rearranged the german empire places in the most striking light the highest of all the possibilities of the greatest of all the peoples  he was quite aware however of the claims to economic and other consideration of the united states and that this quarter of the globe offered a vast field for study  the process of inquiry had already begun for him in spite of his having as yet spoken to none of his fellowpassengers the case being that vogelstein inquired not only with his tongue but with his eyesthat is with his spectacleswith his ears with his nose with his palate with all his senses and organs  he was a highly upright young man whose only fault was that his sense of comedy or of the humour of things had never been specifically disengaged from his several other senses  he vaguely felt that something should be done about this and in a general manner proposed to do it for he was on his way to explore a society abounding in comic aspects this consciousness of a missing measure gave him a certain mistrust of what might be said of him and if circumspection is the essence of diplomacy our young aspirant promised well  his mind contained several millions of facts packed too closely together for the light breeze of the imagination to draw through the mass  he was impatient to report himself to his superior in washington and the loss of time in an english port could only incommode him inasmuch as the study of english institutions was no part of his mission  on the other hand the day was charming the blue sea in southampton water pricked all over with light had no movement but that of its infinite shimmer  moreover he was by no means sure that he should be happy in the united states where doubtless he should find himself soon enough disembarked  he knew that this was not an important question and that happiness was an unscientific term such as a man of his education should be ashamed to use even in the silence of his thoughts  lost none the less in the inconsiderate crowd and feeling himself neither in his own country nor in that to which he was in a manner accredited he was reduced to his mere personality so that during the hour to save his importance he cultivated such ground as lay in sight for a judgement of this delay to which the german steamer was subjected in english waters mightnt it be proved facts figures and documentsor at least watchin hand considerably greater than the occasion demanded  count vogelstein was still young enough in diplomacy to think it necessary to have opinions  he had a good many indeed which had been formed without difficulty they had been received readymade from a line of ancestors who knew what they liked  this was of courseand under pressure being candid he would have admitted it an unscientific way of furnishing ones mind  our young man was a stiff conservative a junker of junkers he thought modern democracy a temporary phase and expected to find many arguments against it in the great republic  in regard to these things it was a pleasure to him to feel that with his complete training he had been taught thoroughly to appreciate the nature of evidence  the ship was heavily laden with german emigrants whose mission in the united states differed considerably from count ottos  they hung over the bulwarks densely grouped they leaned forward on their elbows for hours their shoulders kept on a level with their ears the men in furred caps smoking longbowled pipes the women with babies hidden in remarkably ugly shawls  some were yellow germans and some were black and all looked greasy and matted with the seadamp  they were destined to swell still further the huge current of the western democracy and count vogelstein doubtless said to himself that they wouldnt improve its quality  their numbers however were striking and i know not what he thought of the nature of this particular evidence  the passengers who came on board at southampton were not of the greasy class they were for the most part american families who had been spending the summer or a longer period in europe  they had a great deal of luggage innumerable bags and rugs and hampers and seachairs and were composed largely of ladies of various ages a little pale with anticipation wrapped also in striped shawls though in prettier ones than the nursing mothers of the steerage and crowned with very high hats and feathers  they darted to and fro across the gangway looking for each other and for their scattered parcels they separated and reunited they exclaimed and declared they eyed with dismay the occupants of the forward quarter who seemed numerous enough to sink the vessel and their voices sounded faint and far as they rose to vogelsteins ear over the latters great tarred sides  he noticed that in the new contingent there were many young girls and he remembered what a lady in dresden had once said to himthat america was the country of the madchen  he wondered whether he should like that and reflected that it would be an aspect to study like everything else he had known in dresden an american family in which there were three daughters who used to skate with the officers and some of the ladies now coming on board struck him as of that same habit except that in the dresden days feathers werent worn quite so high  at last the ship began to creak and slowly bridge and the delay at southampton came to an end  the gangway was removed and the vessel indulged in the awkward evolutions that were to detach her from the land  count vogelstein had finished his cigar and he spent a long time in walking up and down the upper deck  the charming english coast passed before him and he felt this to be the last of the old world  the american coast also might be prettyhe hardly knew what one would expect of an american coast but he was sure it would be different  differences however were notoriously half the charm of travel and perhaps even most when they couldnt be expressed in figures numbers diagrams or the other merely useful symbols  as yet indeed there were very few among the objects presented to sight on the steamer  most of his fellowpassengers appeared of one and the same persuasion and that persuasion the least to be mistaken they were jews and commercial to a man  and by this time they had lighted their cigars and put on all manner of seafaring caps some of them with big earlappets which somehow had the effect of bringing out their peculiar facial type  at last the new voyagers began to emerge from below and to look about them vaguely with that suspicious expression of face always to be noted in the newly embarked and which as directed to the receding land resembles that of a person who begins to perceive himself the victim of a trick earth and ocean in such glances are made the subject of a sweeping objection and many travellers in the general plight have an air at once duped and superior which seems to say that they could easily go ashore if they would  it still wanted two hours of dinner and by the time vogelsteins long legs had measured three or four miles on the deck he was ready to settle himself in his seachair and draw from his pocket a tauchnitz novel by an american author whose pages he had been assured would help to prepare him for some of the oddities  on the back of his chair his name was painted in rather large letters this being a precaution taken at the recommendation of a friend who had told him that on the american steamers the passengersespecially the ladiesthought nothing of pilfering ones little comforts  his friend had even hinted at the correct reproduction of his coronet this marked man of the world had added that the americans are greatly impressed by a coronet  i know not whether it was scepticism or modesty but count vogelstein had omitted every pictured plea for his rank there were others of which he might have made use  the precious piece of furniture which on the atlantic voyage is trusted never to flinch among universal concussions was emblazoned simply with his title and name  it happened however that the blazonry was huge the back of the chair was covered with enormous german characters  this time there can be no doubt  it was modesty that caused the secretary of legation in placing himself to turn this portion of his seat outward away from the eyes of his companionsto present it to the balustrade of the deck the ship was passing the needlesthe beautiful uttermost point of the isle of wight  certain tall white cones of rock rose out of the purple sea they flushed in the afternoon light and their vague rosiness gave them a human expression in face of the cold expanse toward which the prow was turned they seemed to say farewell to be the last note of a peopled world  vogelstein saw them very comfortably from his place and after a while turned his eyes to the other quarter where the elements of air and water managed to make between them so comparatively poor an opposition  even his american novelist was more amusing than that and he prepared to return to this author  in the great curve which it described however his glance was arrested by the figure of a young lady who had just ascended to the deck and who paused at the mouth of the companionway  this was not in itself an extraordinary phenomenon but what attracted vogelsteins attention was the fact that the young person appeared to have fixed her eyes on him  she was slim brightly dressed rather pretty vogelstein remembered in a moment that he had noticed her among the people on the wharf at southampton  she was soon aware he had observed her whereupon she began to move along the deck with a step that seemed to indicate a purpose of approaching him  vogelstein had time to wonder whether she could be one of the girls he had known at dresden but he presently reflected that they would now be much older than that  it was true they were apt to advance like this one straight upon their victim  yet the present specimen was no longer looking at him and though she passed near him it was now tolerably clear she had come above but to take a general survey  she was a quick handsome competent girl and she simply wanted to see what one could think of the ship of the weather of the appearance of england from such a position as that possibly even of ones fellowpassengers  she satisfied herself promptly on these points and then she looked about while she walked as if in keen search of a missing object so that vogelstein finally arrived at a conviction of her real motive  she passed near him again and this time almost stopped her eyes bent upon him attentively  he thought her conduct remarkable even after he had gathered that it was not at his face with its yellow moustache she was looking but at the chair on which he was seated  then those words of his friend came back to himthe speech about the tendency of the people especially of the ladies on the american steamers to take to themselves ones little belongings  especially the ladies he might well say for here was one who apparently wished to pull from under him the very chair he was sitting on  he was afraid she would ask him for it so he pretended to read systematically avoiding her eye  he was conscious she hovered near him and was moreover curious to see what she would do  it seemed to him strange that such a nicelooking girlfor her appearance was really charmingshould endeavour by arts so flagrant to work upon the quiet dignity of a secretary of legation  at last it stood out that she was trying to look round a corner as it weretrying to see what was written on the back of his chair  she wants to find out my name she wants to see who i am  this reflexion passed through his mind and caused him to raise his eyes  they rested on her own which for an appreciable moment she didnt withdraw  the latter were brilliant and expressive and surmounted a delicate aquiline nose which though pretty was perhaps just a trifle too hawklike it was the oddest coincidence in the world the story vogelstein had taken up treated of a flighty forward little american girl who plants herself in front of a young man in the garden of an hotel wasnt the conduct of this young lady a testimony to the truthfulness of the tale and wasnt vogelstein himself in the position of the young man in the garden  that young manthough with more in such connexions in general to go uponended by addressing himself to his aggressor as she might be called and after a very short hesitation vogelstein followed his example  if she wants to know who i am shes welcome he said to himself and he got out of the chair seized it by the back and turning it round exhibited the superscription to the girl  she coloured slightly but smiled and read his name while vogelstein raised his hat  im much obliged to you  thats all right she remarked as if the discovery had made her very happy  it affected him indeed as all right that he should be count otto vogelstein this appeared even rather a flippant mode of disposing of the fact  by way of rejoinder he asked her if she desired of him the surrender of his seat  im much obliged to you of course not  i thought you had one of our chairs and i didnt like to ask you  it looks exactly like one of ours not so much now as when you sit in it  please sit down again  i dont want to trouble you  weve lost one of ours and ive been looking for it everywhere  they look so much alike you cant tell till you see the back  of course i see there will be no mistake about yours the young lady went on with a smile of which the serenity matched her other abundance  but weve got such a small nameyou can scarcely see it she added with the same friendly intention  our names just dayyou mightnt think it was a name might you if we didnt make the most of it  if you see that on anything id be so obliged if youd tell me  it isnt for myself its for my mother shes so dependent on her chair and that one im looking for pulls out so beautifully  now that you sit down again and hide the lower part it does look just like ours well it must be somewhere  you must excuse me i wouldnt disturb you  this was a long and even confidential speech for a young woman presumably unmarried to make to a perfect stranger but miss day acquitted herself of it with perfect simplicity and selfpossession she held up her head and stepped away and vogelstein could see that the foot she pressed upon the clean smooth deck was slender and shapely  he watched her disappear through the trap by which she had ascended and he felt more than ever like the young man in his american tale  the girl in the present case was older and not so pretty as he could easily judge for the image of her smiling eyes and speaking lips still hovered before him  he went back to his book with the feeling that it would give him some information about her  this was rather illogical but it indicated a certain amount of curiosity on the part of count vogelstein  the girl in the book had a mother it appeared and so had this young lady the former had also a brother and he now remembered that he had noticed a young man on the wharfa young man in a high hat and a white overcoatwho seemed united to miss day by this natural tie  and there was some one else too as he gradually recollected an older man also in a high hat but in a black overcoatin black altogetherwho completed the group and who was presumably the head of the family  these reflexions would indicate that count vogelstein read his volume of tauchnitz rather interruptedly moreover they represented but the loosest economy of consciousness for wasnt he to be afloat in an oblong box for ten days with such people and could it be doubted he should see at least enough of them  it may as well be written without delay that he saw a great deal of them  i have sketched in some detail the conditions in which he made the acquaintance of miss day because the event had a certain importance for this fair square teuton but i must pass briefly over the incidents that immediately followed it  he wondered what it was open to him after such an introduction to do in relation to her and he determined he would push through his american tale and discover what the hero did  but he satisfied himself in a very short time that miss day had nothing in common with the heroine of that work save certain signs of habitat and climateand save further the fact that the male sex wasnt terrible to her  the local stamp sharply as he gathered impressed upon her he estimated indeed rather in a borrowed than in a natural light for if she was native to a small town in the interior of the american continent one of their fellowpassengers a lady from new york with whom he had a good deal of conversation pronounced her atrociously provincial how the lady arrived at this certitude didnt appear for vogelstein observed that she held no communication with the girl  it was true she gave it the support of her laying down that certain americans could tell immediately who other americans were leaving him to judge whether or no she herself belonged to the critical or only to the criticised half of the nation  mrs dangerfield was a handsome confidential insinuating woman with whom vogelstein felt his talk take a very wide range indeed  she convinced him rather effectually that even in a great democracy there are human differences and that american life was full of social distinctions of delicate shades which foreigners often lack the intelligence to perceive  did he suppose every one knew every one else in the biggest country in the world and that one wasnt as free to choose ones company there as in the most monarchical and most exclusive societies  she laughed such delusions to scorn as vogelstein tucked her beautiful furred coverletthey reclined together a great deal in their elongated chairswell over her feet  how free an american lady was to choose her company she abundantly proved by not knowing any one on the steamer but count otto  he could see for himself that mr and mrs day had not at all her grand air  they were fat plain serious people who sat side by side on the deck for hours and looked straight before them  mrs day had a white face large cheeks and small eyes  her forehead was surrounded with a multitude of little tight black curls her lips moved as if she had always a lozenge in her mouth  she wore entwined about her head an article which mrs dangerfield spoke of as a nuby a knitted pink scarf concealing her hair encircling her neck and having among its convolutions a hole for her perfectly expressionless face  her hands were folded on her stomach and in her still swathed figure her little beadlike eyes which occasionally changed their direction alone represented life  her husband had a stiff grey beard on his chin and a bare spacious upper lip to which constant shaving had imparted a hard glaze  his eyebrows were thick and his nostrils wide and when he was uncovered in the saloon it was visible that his grizzled hair was dense and perpendicular  he might have looked rather grim and truculent hadnt it been for the mild familiar accommodating gaze with which his large lightcoloured pupilsthe leisurely eyes of a silent manappeared to consider surrounding objects  he was evidently more friendly than fierce but he was more diffident than friendly  he liked to have you in sight but wouldnt have pretended to understand you much or to classify you and would have been sorry it should put you under an obligation  he and his wife spoke sometimes but seldom talked and there was something vague and patient in them as if they had become victims of a wrought spell  the spell however was of no sinister cast it was the fascination of prosperity the confidence of security which sometimes makes people arrogant but which had had such a different effect on this simple satisfied pair in whom further development of every kind appeared to have been happily arrested  mrs dangerfield made it known to count otto that every morning after breakfast the hour at which he wrote his journal in his cabin the old couple were guided upstairs and installed in their customary corner by pandora  this she had learned to be the name of their elder daughter and she was immensely amused by her discovery pandorathat was in the highest degree typical it placed them in the social scale if other evidence had been wanting you could tell that a girl was from the interior the mysterious interior about which vogelsteins imagination was now quite excited when she had such a name as that  this young lady managed the whole family even a little the small beflounced sister who with bold pretty innocent eyes a torrent of fair silky hair a crimson fez such as is worn by male turks very much askew on top of it and a way of galloping and straddling about the ship in any company she could pick upshe had long thin legs very short skirts and stockings of every tint was going home in elegant french clothes to resume an interrupted education  pandora overlooked and directed her relatives vogelstein could see this for himself could see she was very active and decided that she had in a high degree the sentiment of responsibility settling on the spot most of the questions that could come up for a family from the interior  the voyage was remarkably fine and day after day it was possible to sit there under the salt sky and feel ones self rounding the great curves of the globe  the long deck made a white spot in the sharp black circle of the ocean and in the intense sealight while the shadow of the smokestreamers trembled on the familiar floor the shoes of fellowpassengers distinctive now and in some cases irritating passed and repassed accompanied in the air so tremendously open that rendered all voices weak and most remarks rather flat by fragments of opinion on the run of the ship vogelstein by this time had finished his little american story and now definitely judged that pandora day was not at all like the heroine  she was of quite another type much more serious and strenuous and not at all keen as he had supposed about making the acquaintance of gentlemen  her speaking to him that first afternoon had been he was bound to believe an incident without importance for herself in spite of her having followed it up the next day by the remark thrown at him as she passed with a smile that was almost fraternal  its all right sir  ive found that old chair  after this she hadnt spoken to him again and had scarcely looked at him  she read a great deal and almost always french books in fresh yellow paper not the lighter forms of that literature but a volume of saintebeuve of renan or at the most in the way of dissipation of alfred de musset  she took frequent exercise and almost always walked alone apparently not having made many friends on the ship and being without the resource of her parents who as has been related never budged out of the cosy corner in which she planted them for the day  her brother was always in the smokingroom where vogelstein observed him in very tight clothes his neck encircled with a collar like a palisade  he had a sharp little face which was not disagreeable he smoked enormous cigars and began his drinking early in the day  but his appearance gave no sign of these excesses  as regards euchre and poker and the other distractions of the place he was guilty of none  he evidently understood such games in perfection for he used to watch the players and even at moments impartially advise them but vogelstein never saw the cards in his hand  he was referred to as regards disputed points and his opinion carried the day  he took little part in the conversation usually much relaxed that prevailed in the smokingroom but from time to time he made in his soft flat youthful voice a remark which every one paused to listen to and which was greeted with roars of laughter  vogelstein well as he knew english could rarely catch the joke but he could see at least that these must be choice specimens of that american humour admired and practised by a whole continent and yet to be rendered accessible to a trained diplomatist clearly but by some special and incalculable revelation  the young man in his way was very remarkable for as vogelstein heard some one say once after the laughter had subsided he was only nineteen  if his sister didnt resemble the dreadful little girl in the tale already mentioned there was for vogelstein at least an analogy between young mr day and a certain small brothera candyloving madison hamilton or jeffersonwho was in the tauchnitz volume attributed to that unfortunate maid  this was what the little madison would have grown up to at nineteen and the improvement was greater than might have been expected  the days were long but the voyage was short and it had almost come to an end before count otto yielded to an attraction peculiar in its nature and finally irresistible and in spite of mrs dangerfields emphatic warning sought occasion for a little continuous talk with miss pandora  to mention that this impulse took effect without mentioning sundry other of his current impressions with which it had nothing to do is perhaps to violate proportion and give a false idea but to pass it by would be still more unjust  the germans as we know are a transcendental people and there was at last an irresistible appeal for vogelstein in this quick bright silent girl who could smile and turn vocal in an instant who imparted a rare originality to the filial character and whose profile was delicate as she bent it over a volume which she cut as she read or presented it in musing attitudes at the side of the ship to the horizon they had left behind  but he felt it to be a pity as regards a possible acquaintance with her that her parents should be heavy little burghers that her brother should not correspond to his conception of a young man of the upper class and that her sister should be a daisy miller en herbe  repeatedly admonished by mrs dangerfield the young diplomatist was doubly careful as to the relations he might form at the beginning of his sojourn in the united states that lady reminded him and he had himself made the observation in other capitals that the first year and even the second is the time for prudence  one was ignorant of proportions and values one was exposed to mistakes and thankful for attention and one might give ones self away to people who would afterwards be as a millstone round ones neck  mrs dangerfield struck and sustained that note which resounded in the young mans imagination  she assured him that if he didnt look out he would be committing himself to some american girl with an impossible family  in america when one committed ones self there was nothing to do but march to the altar and what should he say for instance to finding himself a near relation of mr and mrs p w daysince such were the initials inscribed on the back of the two chairs of that couple count otto felt the peril for he could immediately think of a dozen men he knew who had married american girls  there appeared now to be a constant danger of marrying the american girl it was something one had to reckon with like the railway the telegraph the discovery of dynamite the chassepot rifle the socialistic spirit it was one of the complications of modern life  it would doubtless be too much to say that he feared being carried away by a passion for a young woman who was not strikingly beautiful and with whom he had talked in all but ten minutes  but as we recognise he went so far as to wish that the human belongings of a person whose high spirit appeared to have no taint either of fastness as they said in england or of subversive opinion and whose mouth had charming lines should not be a little more distinguished  there was an effect of drollery in her behaviour to these subjects of her zeal whom she seemed to regard as a care but not as an interest it was as if they had been entrusted to her honour and she had engaged to convey them safe to a certain point she was detached and inadvertent and then suddenly remembered repented and came back to tuck them into their blankets to alter the position of her mothers umbrella to tell them something about the run of the ship  these little offices were usually performed deftly rapidly with the minimum of words and when their daughter drew near them mr and mrs day closed their eyes after the fashion of a pair of household dogs who expect to be scratched  one morning she brought up the captain of the ship to present to them she appeared to have a private and independent acquaintance with this officer and the introduction to her parents had the air of a sudden happy thought  it wasnt so much an introduction as an exhibition as if she were saying to him  this is what they look like see how comfortable i make them  arent they rather queer and rather dear little people  but they leave me perfectly free  oh i can assure you of that  besides you must see it for yourself mr and mrs day looked up at the high functionary who thus unbent to them with very little change of countenance then looked at each other in the same way  he saluted he inclined himself a moment but pandora shook her head she seemed to be answering for them she made little gestures as if in explanation to the good captain of some of their peculiarities as for instance that he neednt expect them to speak  they closed their eyes at last she appeared to have a kind of mesmeric influence on them and miss day walked away with the important friend who treated her with evident consideration bowing very low for all his importance when the two presently after separated  vogelstein could see she was capable of making an impression and the moral of our little matter is that in spite of mrs dangerfield in spite of the resolutions of his prudence in spite of the limits of such acquaintance as he had momentarily made with her in spite of mr and mrs day and the young man in the smokingroom she had fixed his attention  it was in the course of the evening after the scene with the captain that he joined her awkwardly abruptly irresistibly on the deck where she was pacing to and fro alone the hour being auspiciously mild and the stars remarkably fine  there were scattered talkers and smokers and couples unrecognisable that moved quickly through the gloom  the vessel dipped with long regular pulsations vague and spectral under the low stars its swaying pinnacles spotted here and there with lights it seemed to rush through the darkness faster than by day  count otto had come up to walk and as the girl brushed past him he distinguished pandoras facewith mrs dangerfield he always spoke of her as pandoraunder the veil worn to protect it from the seadamp  he stopped turned hurried after her threw away his cigarthen asked her if she would do him the honour to accept his arm  she declined his arm but accepted his company and he allowed her to enjoy it for an hour  they had a great deal of talk and he was to remember afterwards some of the things she had said  there was now a certainty of the ships getting into dock the next morning but one and this prospect afforded an obvious topic  some of miss days expressions struck him as singular but of course as he was aware his knowledge of english was not nice enough to give him a perfect measure  im not in a hurry to arrive im very happy here she said  im afraid i shall have such a time putting my people through  putting them through  through the customhouse  weve made so many purchases  well ive written to a friend to come down and perhaps he can help us hes very well acquainted with the head  once im chalked i dont care  i feel like a kind of blackboard by this time anyway  we found them awful in germany  count otto wondered if the friend she had written to were her lover and if they had plighted their troth especially when she alluded to him again as that gentleman whos coming down  he asked her about her travels her impressions whether she had been long in europe and what she liked best and she put it to him that they had gone abroad she and her family for a little fresh experience  though he found her very intelligent he suspected she gave this as a reason because he was a german and she had heard the germans were rich in culture  he wondered what form of culture mr and mrs day had brought back from italy greece and palestinethey had travelled for two years and been everywhereespecially when their daughter said  i wanted father and mother to see the best things  i kept them three hours on the acropolis  i guess they wont forget that perhaps it was of phidias and pericles they were thinking vogelstein reflected as they sat ruminating in their rugs  pandora remarked also that she wanted to show her little sister everything while she was comparatively unformed comparatively he mutely gasped remarkable sights made so much more impression when the mind was fresh  she had read something of that sort somewhere in goethe  she had wanted to come herself when she was her sisters age but her father was in business then and they couldnt leave utica  the young man thought of the little sister frisking over the parthenon and the mount of olives and sharing for two years the years of the schoolroom this extraordinary pilgrimage of her parents he wondered whether goethes dictum had been justified in this case  he asked pandora if utica were the seat of her family if it were an important or typical place if it would be an interesting city for him as a stranger to see  his companion replied frankly that this was a big question but added that all the same she would ask him to come and visit us at our home if it werent that they should probably soon leave it  ah youre going to live elsewhere vogelstein asked as if that fact too would be typical  well im working for new york  i flatter myself ive loosened them while weve been away the girl went on  they wont find in utica the same charm that was my idea  i want a big place and of course utica  she broke off as before a complex statement  i suppose utica is inferior vogelstein seemed to see his way to suggest  well no i guess i cant have you call utica inferior  it isnt supremethats whats the matter with it and i hate anything middling said pandora day  she gave a light dry laugh tossing back her head a little as she made this declaration  and looking at her askance in the dusk as she trod the deck that vaguely swayed he recognised something in her air and port that matched such a pronouncement  whats her social position he inquired of mrs dangerfield the next day  i cant make it out at allits so contradictory  she strikes me as having much cultivation and much spirit  her appearance too is very neat  yet her parents are complete little burghers  thats easily seen  oh social position and mrs dangerfield nodded two or three times portentously  what big expressions you use  do you think everybody in the world has a social position  thats reserved for an infinitely small majority of mankind  you cant have a social position at utica any more than you can have an operabox  pandora hasnt got one where if you please should she have got it  poor girl it isnt fair of you to make her the subject of such questions as that  well said vogelstein if shes of the lower class it seems to me veryvery  and he paused a moment as he often paused in speaking english looking for his word  very what dear count  very significant very representative  oh dear she isnt of the lower class mrs dangerfield returned with an irritated sense of wasted wisdom  she liked to explain her country but that somehow always required two persons  what is she then  well im bound to admit that since i was at home last shes a novelty  a girl like that with such peopleit is a new type  i like noveltiesand count otto smiled with an air of considerable resolution  he couldnt however be satisfied with a demonstration that only begged the question and when they disembarked in new york he felt even amid the confusion of the wharf and the heaps of disembowelled baggage a certain acuteness of regret at the idea that pandora and her family were about to vanish into the unknown  he had a consolation however  it was apparent that for some reason or otherillness or absence from townthe gentleman to whom she had written had not as she said come down vogelstein was gladhe couldnt have told you whythat this sympathetic person had failed her even though without him pandora had to engage singlehanded with the united states customhouse our young mans first impression of the western world was received on the landingplace of the german steamers at jersey citya huge wooden shed covering a wooden wharf which resounded under the feet an expanse palisaded with roughhewn piles that leaned this way and that and bestrewn with masses of heterogeneous luggage  at one end toward the town was a row of tall painted palings behind which he could distinguish a press of hackneycoachmen who brandished their whips and awaited their victims while their voices rose incessant with a sharp strange sound a challenge at once fierce and familiar  the whole place behind the fence appeared to bristle and resound  out there was america count otto said to himself and he looked toward it with a sense that he should have to muster resolution  on the wharf people were rushing about amid their trunks pulling their things together trying to unite their scattered parcels  they were heated and angry or else quite bewildered and discouraged  the few that had succeeded in collecting their battered boxes had an air of flushed indifference to the efforts of their neighbours not even looking at people with whom they had been fondly intimate on the steamer  a detachment of the officers of the customs was in attendance and energetic passengers were engaged in attempts to drag them toward their luggage or to drag heavy pieces toward them  these functionaries were goodnatured and taciturn except when occasionally they remarked to a passenger whose open trunk stared up at them eloquent imploring that they were afraid the voyage had been rather glassy  they had a friendly leisurely speculative way of discharging their duty and if they perceived a victims name written on the portmanteau they addressed him by it in a tone of old acquaintance  vogelstein found however that if they were familiar they werent indiscreet  he had heard that in america all public functionaries were the same that there wasnt a different tenue as they said in france for different positions and he wondered whether at washington the president and ministers whom he expected to seeto have to seea good deal of would be like that  he was diverted from these speculations by the sight of mr and mrs day seated side by side upon a trunk and encompassed apparently by the accumulations of their tour  their faces expressed more consciousness of surrounding objects than he had hitherto recognised and there was an air of placid expansion in the mysterious couple which suggested that this consciousness was agreeable  mr and mrs day were as they would have said real glad to get back  at a little distance on the edge of the dock our observer remarked their son who had found a place where between the sides of two big ships he could see the ferryboats pass the large pyramidal lowladen ferryboats of american waters he stood there patient and considering with his small neat foot on a coil of rope his back to everything that had been disembarked his neck elongated in its polished cylinder while the fragrance of his big cigar mingled with the odour of the rotting piles and his little sister beside him hugged a huge post and tried to see how far she could crane over the water without falling in  vogelsteins servant was off in search of an examiner count otto himself had got his things together and was waiting to be released fully expecting that for a person of his importance the ceremony would be brief  before it began he said a word to young mr day raising his hat at the same time to the little girl whom he had not yet greeted and who dodged his salute by swinging herself boldly outward to the dangerous side of the pier  she was indeed still unformed but was evidently as light as a feather  i see youre kept waiting like me  its very tiresome count otto said  the young american answered without looking behind him  as soon as were started well go all right  my sister has written to a gentleman to come down  ive looked for miss day to bid her goodbye vogelstein went on but i dont see her  i guess she has gone to meet that gentleman hes a great friend of hers  i guess hes her lover the little girl broke out  she was always writing to him in europe  her brother puffed his cigar in silence a moment  that was only for this  ill tell on you sis he presently added  but the younger miss day gave no heed to his menace she addressed herself only though with all freedom to vogelstein  this is new york i like it better than utica  he had no time to reply for his servant had arrived with one of the dispensers of fortune but as he turned away he wondered in the light of the childs preference about the towns of the interior he was naturally exempt from the common doom  the officer who took him in hand and who had a large straw hat and a diamond breastpin was quite a man of the world and in reply to the counts formal declarations only said well i guess its all right i guess ill just pass you distributing chalkmarks as if they had been so many lovepats  the servant had done some superfluous unlocking and unbuckling and while he closed the pieces the officer stood there wiping his forehead and conversing with vogelstein  first visit to our country sirquite aloneno ladies  of course the ladies are what were most after  it was in this manner he expressed himself while the young diplomatist wondered what he was waiting for and whether he ought to slip something into his palm  but this representative of order left our friend only a moment in suspense he presently turned away with the remark quite paternally uttered that he hoped the count would make quite a stay upon which the young man saw how wrong he should have been to offer a tip  it was simply the american manner which had a finish of its own after all vogelsteins servant had secured a porter with a truck and he was about to leave the place when he saw pandora day dart out of the crowd and address herself with much eagerness to the functionary who had just liberated him  she had an open letter in her hand which she gave him to read and over which he cast his eyes thoughtfully stroking his beard  then she led him away to where her parents sat on their luggage  count otto sent off his servant with the porter and followed pandora to whom he really wished to address a word of farewell  the last thing they had said to each other on the ship was that they should meet again on shore  it seemed improbable however that the meeting would occur anywhere but just here on the dock inasmuch as pandora was decidedly not in society where vogelstein would be of course and as if uticahe had her sharp little sisters word for itwas worse than what was about him there hed be hanged if hed go to utica  he overtook pandora quickly she was in the act of introducing the representative of order to her parents quite in the same manner in which she had introduced the captain of the ship  mr and mrs day got up and shook hands with him and they evidently all prepared to have a little talk  i should like to introduce you to my brother and sister he heard the girl say and he saw her look about for these appendages  he caught her eye as she did so and advanced with his hand outstretched reflecting the while that evidently the americans whom he had always heard described as silent and practical rejoiced to extravagance in the social graces  they dawdled and chattered like so many neapolitans  goodbye count vogelstein said pandora who was a little flushed with her various exertions but didnt look the worse for it  i hope youll have a splendid time and appreciate our country  i hope youll get through all right vogelstein answered smiling and feeling himself already more idiomatic  that gentlemans sick that i wrote to she rejoined isnt it too bad  but he sent me down a letter to a friend of hisone of the examinersand i guess we wont have any trouble  mr lansing let me make you acquainted with count vogelstein she went on presenting to her fellowpassenger the wearer of the straw hat and the breastpin who shook hands with the young german as if he had never seen him before  vogelsteins heart rose for an instant to his throat he thanked his stars he hadnt offered a tip to the friend of a gentleman who had often been mentioned to him and who had also been described by a member of pandoras family as pandoras lover  its a case of ladies this time mr lansing remarked to him with a smile which seemed to confess surreptitiously and as if neither party could be eager to recognition  well mr bellamy says youll do anything for him pandora said smiling very sweetly at mr lansing  we havent got much weve been gone only two years  mr lansing scratched his head a little behind with a movement that sent his straw hat forward in the direction of his nose  i dont know as id do anything for him that i wouldnt do for you he responded with an equal geniality  i guess youd better open that oneand he gave a little affectionate kick to one of the trunks  oh mother isnt he lovely  its only your seathings pandora cried stooping over the coffer with the key in her hand  i dont know as i like showing them mrs day modestly murmured  vogelstein made his german salutation to the company in general and to pandora he offered an audible goodbye which she returned in a bright friendly voice but without looking round as she fumbled at the lock of her trunk  well try another if you like said mr lansing goodhumouredly  oh no it has got to be this one  goodbye count vogelstein  i hope youll judge us correctly  the young man went his way and passed the barrier of the dock  here he was met by his english valet with a face of consternation which led him to ask if a cab werent forthcoming  they call em acks ere sir said the man and theyre beyond everything  he wants thirty shillings to take you to the inn  vogelstein hesitated a moment  couldnt you find a german  by the way he talks he is a german said the man and in a moment count otto began his career in america by discussing the tariff of hackneycoaches in the language of the fatherland    chapter ii    he went wherever he was asked on principle partly to study american society and partly because in washington pastimes seemed to him not so numerous that one could afford to neglect occasions  at the end of two winters he had naturally had a good many of various kindshis study of american society had yielded considerable fruit when however in april during the second year of his residence he presented himself at a large party given by mrs bonnycastle and of which it was believed that it would be the last serious affair of the season his being there and still more his looking very fresh and talkative was not the consequence of a rule of conduct  he went to mrs bonnycastles simply because he liked the lady whose receptions were the pleasantest in washington and because if he didnt go there he didnt know what he should do that absence of alternatives having become familiar to him by the waters of the potomac  there were a great many things he did because if he didnt do them he didnt know what he should do  it must be added that in this case even if there had been an alternative he would still have decided to go to mrs bonnycastles  if her house wasnt the pleasantest there it was at least difficult to say which was pleasanter and the complaint sometimes made of it that it was too limited that it left out on the whole more people than it took in applied with much less force when it was thrown open for a general party  toward the end of the social year in those soft scented days of the washington spring when the air began to show a southern glow and the squares and circles to which the wide empty avenues converged according to a plan so ingenious yet so bewildering to flush with pink blossom and to make one wish to sit on benchesunder this magic of expansion and condonation mrs bonnycastle who during the winter had been a good deal on the defensive relaxed her vigilance a little became whimsically wilful vernally reckless as it were and ceased to calculate the consequences of an hospitality which a reference to the back files or even to the mornings issue of the newspapers might easily prove a mistake  but washington life to count ottos apprehension was paved with mistakes he felt himself in a society founded on fundamental fallacies and triumphant blunders  little addicted as he was to the sportive view of existence he had said to himself at an early stage of his sojourn that the only way to enjoy the great republic would be to burn ones standards and warm ones self at the blaze  such were the reflexions of a theoretic teuton who now walked for the most part amid the ashes of his prejudices  mrs bonnycastle had endeavoured more than once to explain to him the principles on which she received certain people and ignored certain others but it was with difficulty that he entered into her discriminations  american promiscuity goodness knew had been strange to him but it was nothing to the queerness of american criticism  this lady would discourse to him a perte de vue on differences where he only saw resemblances and both the merits and the defects of a good many members of washington society as this society was interpreted to him by mrs bonnycastle he was often at a loss to understand  fortunately she had a fund of good humour which as i have intimated was apt to come uppermost with the april blossoms and which made the people she didnt invite to her house almost as amusing to her as those she did  her husband was not in politics though politics were much in him but the couple had taken upon themselves the responsibilities of an active patriotism they thought it right to live in america differing therein from many of their acquaintances who only with some grimness thought it inevitable  they had that burdensome heritage of foreign reminiscence with which so many americans were saddled but they carried it more easily than most of their countrypeople and one knew they had lived in europe only by their present exultation never in the least by their regrets  their regrets that is were only for their ever having lived there as mrs bonnycastle once told the wife of a foreign minister  they solved all their problems successfully including those of knowing none of the people they didnt wish to and of finding plenty of occupation in a society supposed to be meagrely provided with resources for that body which vogelstein was to hear invoked again and again with the mixture of desire and of deprecation that might have attended the mention of a secret vice under the name of a leisureclass  when as the warm weather approached they opened both the wings of their housedoor it was because they thought it would entertain them and not because they were conscious of a pressure  alfred bonnycastle all winter indeed chafed a little at the definiteness of some of his wifes reserves it struck him that for washington their society was really a little too good  vogelstein still remembered the puzzled feeling it had cleared up somewhat nowwith which more than a year before he had heard mr bonnycastle exclaim one evening after a dinner in his own house when every guest but the german secretary who often sat late with the pair had departed hang it theres only a month left let us be vulgar and have some funlet us invite the president  this was mrs bonnycastles carnival and on the occasion to which i began my chapter by referring the president had not only been invited but had signified his intention of being present  i hasten to add that this was not the same august ruler to whom alfred bonnycastles irreverent allusion had been made  the white house had received a new tenantthe old one was then just leaving itand count otto had had the advantage during the first eighteen months of his stay in america of seeing an electoral campaign a presidential inauguration and a distribution of spoils  he had been bewildered during those first weeks by finding that at the national capital in the houses he supposed to be the best the head of the state was not a coveted guest for this could be the only explanation of mr bonnycastles whimsical suggestion of their inviting him as it were in carnival  his successor went out a good deal for a president  the legislative session was over but this made little difference in the aspect of mrs bonnycastles rooms which even at the height of the congressional season could scarce be said to overflow with the representatives of the people  they were garnished with an occasional senator whose movements and utterances often appeared to be regarded with a mixture of alarm and indulgence as if they would be disappointing if they werent rather odd and yet might be dangerous if not carefully watched  our young man had come to entertain a kindness for these conscript fathers of invisible families who had something of the toga in the voluminous folds of their conversation but were otherwise rather bare and bald with stony wrinkles in their faces like busts and statues of ancient lawgivers  there seemed to him something chill and exposed in their being at once so exalted and so naked there were frequent lonesome glances in their eyes as if in the social world their legislative consciousness longed for the warmth of a few comfortable laws readymade  members of the house were very rare and when washington was new to the inquiring secretary he used sometimes to mistake them in the halls and on the staircases where he met them for the functionaries engaged under stress to usher in guests and wait at supper  it was only a little later that he perceived these latter public characters almost always to be impressive and of that rich racial hue which of itself served as a livery  at present however such confounding figures were much less to be met than during the months of winter and indeed they were never frequent at mrs bonnycastles  at present the social vistas of washington like the vast fresh flatness of the lettered and numbered streets which at this season seemed to vogelstein more spacious and vague than ever suggested but a paucity of political phenomena  count otto that evening knew every one or almost every one  there were often inquiring strangers expecting great things from new york and boston and to them in the friendly washington way the young german was promptly introduced  it was a society in which familiarity reigned and in which people were liable to meet three times a day so that their ultimate essence really became a matter of importance  ive got three new girls mrs bonnycastle said  you must talk to them all  all at once vogelstein asked reversing in fancy a position not at all unknown to him  he had so repeatedly heard himself addressed in even more than triple simultaneity  oh no you must have something different for each you cant get off that way  havent you discovered that the american girl expects something especially adapted to herself  its very well for europe to have a few phrases that will do for any girl  the american girl isnt any girl shes a remarkable specimen in a remarkable species but you must keep the best this evening for miss day  for miss dayand vogelstein had a stare of intelligence  do you mean for pandora  mrs bonnycastle broke on her side into free amusement  one would think you had been looking for her over the globe  so you know her alreadyand you call her by her pet name  oh no i dont know her that is i havent seen her or thought of her from that day to this  we came to america in the same ship  isnt she an american then  oh yes she lives at uticain the interior  in the interior of utica  you cant mean my young woman then who lives in new york where shes a great beauty and a great belle and has been immensely admired this winter  after all said count otto considering and a little disappointed the names not so uncommon its perhaps another  but has she rather strange eyes a little yellow but very pretty and a nose a little arched  i cant tell you all that i havent seen her  shes staying with mrs steuben  she only came a day or two ago and mrs steubens to bring her  when she wrote to me to ask leave she told me what i tell you  they havent come yet  vogelstein felt a quick hope that the subject of this correspondence might indeed be the young lady he had parted from on the dock at new york but the indications seemed to point another way and he had no wish to cherish an illusion  it didnt seem to him probable that the energetic girl who had introduced him to mr lansing would have the entree of the best house in washington besides mrs bonnycastles guest was described as a beauty and belonging to the brilliant city  whats the social position of mrs steuben it occurred to him to ask while he meditated  he had an earnest artless literal way of putting such a question as that you could see from it that he was very thorough  mrs bonnycastle met it however but with mocking laughter  im sure i dont know  whats your ownand she left him to turn to her other guests to several of whom she repeated his question could they tell her what was the social position of mrs steuben there was count vogelstein who wanted to know  he instantly became aware of course that he oughtnt so to have expressed himself wasnt the ladys place in the scale sufficiently indicated by mrs bonnycastles acquaintance with her  still there were fine degrees and he felt a little unduly snubbed  it was perfectly true as he told his hostess that with the quick wave of new impressions that had rolled over him after his arrival in america the image of pandora was almost completely effaced he had seen innumerable things that were quite as remarkable in their way as the heroine of the donau but at the touch of the idea that he might see her and hear her again at any moment she became as vivid in his mind as if they had parted the day before  he remembered the exact shade of the eyes he had described to mrs bonnycastle as yellow the tone of her voice when at the last she expressed the hope he might judge america correctly  had he judged america correctly  if he were to meet her again she doubtless would try to ascertain  it would be going much too far to say that the idea of such an ordeal was terrible to count otto but it may at least be said that the thought of meeting pandora day made him nervous  the fact is certainly singular but i shall not take on myself to explain it there are some things that even the most philosophic historian isnt bound to account for  he wandered into another room and there at the end of five minutes he was introduced by mrs bonnycastle to one of the young ladies of whom she had spoken  this was a very intelligent girl who came from boston and showed much acquaintance with spielhagens novels  do you like them  vogelstein asked rather vaguely not taking much interest in the matter as he read works of fiction only in case of a seavoyage  the young lady from boston looked pensive and concentrated then she answered that she liked some of them very much but that there were others she didnt likeand she enumerated the works that came under each of these heads  spielhagen is a voluminous writer and such a catalogue took some time at the end of it moreover vogelsteins question was not answered for he couldnt have told us whether she liked spielhagen or not  on the next topic however there was no doubt about her feelings they talked about washington as people talk only in the place itself revolving about the subject in widening and narrowing circles perching successively on its many branches considering it from every point of view  our young man had been long enough in america to discover that after half a century of social neglect washington had become the fashion and enjoyed the great advantage of being a new resource in conversation  this was especially the case in the months of spring when the inhabitants of the commercial cities came so far southward to escape after the long winter that final affront  they were all agreed that washington was fascinating and none of them were better prepared to talk it over than the bostonians  vogelstein originally had been rather out of step with them he hadnt seized their point of view hadnt known with what they compared this object of their infatuation  but now he knew everything he had settled down to the pace there wasnt a possible phase of the discussion that could find him at a loss there was a kind of hegelian element in it in the light of these considerations the american capital took on the semblance of a monstrous mystical infinite werden  but they fatigued vogelstein a little and it was his preference as a general thing not to engage the same evening with more than one newcomer one visitor in the freshness of initiation  this was why mrs bonnycastles expression of a wish to introduce him to three young ladies had startled him a little he saw a certain process in which he flattered himself that he had become proficient but which was after all tolerably exhausting repeated for each of the damsels  after separating from his judicious bostonian he rather evaded mrs bonnycastle contenting himself with the conversation of old friends pitched for the most part in a lower and easier key  at last he heard it mentioned that the president had arrived had been some halfhour in the house and he went in search of the illustrious guest whose whereabouts at washington parties was never indicated by a cluster of courtiers  he made it a point whenever he found himself in company with the president to pay him his respects and he had not been discouraged by the fact that there was no association of ideas in the eye of the great man as he put out his hand presidentially and said happy to meet you sir  count otto felt himself taken for a mere loyal subject possibly for an officeseeker and he used to reflect at such moments that the monarchical form had its merits it provided a line of heredity for the faculty of quick recognition  he had now some difficulty in finding the chief magistrate and ended by learning that he was in the tearoom a small apartment devoted to light refection near the entrance of the house  here our young man presently perceived him seated on a sofa and in conversation with a lady  there were a number of people about the table eating drinking talking and the couple on the sofa which was not near it but against the wall in a shallow recess looked a little withdrawn as if they had sought seclusion and were disposed to profit by the diverted attention of the others  the president leaned back his gloved hands resting on either knee made large white spots  he looked eminent but he looked relaxed and the lady beside him ministered freely and without scruple it was clear to this effect of his comfortably unbending  vogelstein caught her voice as he approached  he heard her say well now remember i consider it a promise  she was beautifully dressed in rosecolour her hands were clasped in her lap and her eyes attached to the presidential profile  well madam in that case its about the fiftieth promise ive given today  it was just as he heard these words uttered by her companion in reply that count otto checked himself turned away and pretended to be looking for a cup of tea  it wasnt usual to disturb the president even simply to shake hands when he was sitting on a sofa with a lady and the young secretary felt it in this case less possible than ever to break the rule for the lady on the sofa was none other than pandora day  he had recognised her without her appearing to see him and even with half an eye as they said had taken in that she was now a person to be reckoned with  she had an air of elation of success she shone to intensity in her rose coloured dress she was extracting promises from the ruler of fifty millions of people  what an odd place to meet her her old shipmate thought and how little one could tell after all in america who people were  he didnt want to speak to her yet he wanted to wait a little and learn more but meanwhile there was something attractive in the fact that she was just behind him a few yards off that if he should turn he might see her again  it was she mrs bonnycastle had meant it was she who was so much admired in new york  her face was the same yet he had made out in a moment that she was vaguely prettier he had recognised the arch of her nose which suggested a fine ambition  he took some tea which he hadnt desired in order not to go away  he remembered her entourage on the steamer her father and mother the silent senseless burghers so little of the world her infant sister so much of it her humorous brother with his tall hat and his influence in the smoking room  he remembered mrs dangerfields warningsyet her perplexities tooand the letter from mr bellamy and the introduction to mr lansing and the way pandora had stooped down on the dirty dock laughing and talking mistress of the situation to open her trunk for the customs  he was pretty sure she had paid no duties that day this would naturally have been the purpose of mr bellamys letter  was she still in correspondence with that gentleman and had he got over the sickness interfering with their reunion  these images and these questions coursed through count ottos mind and he saw it must be quite in pandoras line to be mistress of the situation for there was evidently nothing on the present occasion that could call itself her master  he drank his tea and as he put down his cup heard the president behind him say  well i guess my wife will wonder why i dont come home  why didnt you bring her with you pandora benevolently asked  well she doesnt go out much  then she has got her sister staying with hermrs runkle from natchez  shes a good deal of an invalid and my wife doesnt like to leave her  she must be a very kind womanand there was a high mature competence in the way the girl sounded the note of approval  well i guess she isnt spoiledyet  i should like very much to come and see her said pandora  do come round  couldnt you come some night the great man responded  well ill come some time  and i shall remind you of your promise  all right  theres nothing like keeping it up  well said the president i must bid goodbye to these bright folks  vogelstein heard him rise from the sofa with his companion after which he gave the pair time to pass out of the room before him they did it with a certain impressive deliberation people making way for the ruler of fifty millions and looking with a certain curiosity at the striking pink person at his side  when a little later he followed them across the hall into one of the other rooms he saw the host and hostess accompany the president to the door and two foreign ministers and a judge of the supreme court address themselves to pandora day  he resisted the impulse to join this circle  if he should speak to her at all he would somehow wish it to be in more privacy  she continued nevertheless to occupy him and when mrs bonnycastle came back from the hall he immediately approached her with an appeal  i wish youd tell me something more about that girlthat one opposite and in pink  the lovely daythats what they call her i believe  i wanted you to talk with her  i find she is the one ive met  but she seems to be so different here  i cant make it out said count otto  there was something in his expression that again moved mrs bonnycastle to mirth  how we do puzzle you europeans  you look quite bewildered  im sorry i look soi try to hide it  but of course were very simple  let me ask then a simple earnest childlike question  are her parents also in society  parents in society  dou tombezvous  did you ever hear of the parents of a triumphant girl in rosecolour with a nose all her own in society  is she then all alone he went on with a strain of melancholy in his voice  mrs bonnycastle launched at him all her laughter  youre too pathetic  dont you know what she is  i supposed of course you knew  its exactly what im asking you  why shes the new type  it has only come up lately  they have had articles about it in the papers  thats the reason i told mrs steuben to bring her  the new type  what new type mrs bonnycastle he returned pleadinglyso conscious was he that all types in america were new  her laughter checked her reply a moment and by the time she had recovered herself the young lady from boston with whom vogelstein had been talking stood there to take leave  this for an american type was an old one he was sure and the process of parting between the guest and her hostess had an ancient elaboration  count otto waited a little then he turned away and walked up to pandora day whose group of interlocutors had now been reenforced by a gentleman who had held an important place in the cabinet of the late occupant of the presidential chair  he had asked mrs bonnycastle if she were all alone but there was nothing in her present situation to show her for solitary  she wasnt sufficiently alone for our friends taste but he was impatient and he hoped shed give him a few words to himself  she recognised him without a moments hesitation and with the sweetest smile a smile matching to a shade the tone in which she said  i was watching you  i wondered if you werent going to speak to me  miss day was watching him one of the foreign ministers exclaimed and we flattered ourselves that her attention was all with us  i mean before said the girl while i was talking with the president  at which the gentlemen began to laugh one of them remarking that this was the way the absent were sacrificed even the great while another put on record that he hoped vogelstein was duly flattered  oh i was watching the president too said pandora  ive got to watch him  he has promised me something  it must be the mission to england the judge of the supreme court suggested  a good position for a lady theyve got a lady at the head over there  i wish they would send you to my country one of the foreign ministers suggested  id immediately get recalled  why perhaps in your country i wouldnt speak to you  its only because youre here the exheroine of the donau returned with a gay familiarity which evidently ranked with her but as one of the arts of defence  youll see what mission it is when it comes out but ill speak to count vogelstein anywhere she went on  hes an older friend than any right here  ive known him in difficult days  oh yes on the great ocean the young man smiled  on the watery waste in the tempest  oh i dont mean that so much we had a beautiful voyage and there wasnt any tempest  i mean when i was living in utica  thats a watery waste if you like and a tempest there would have been a pleasant variety  your parents seemed to me so peaceful her associate in the other memories sighed with a vague wish to say something sympathetic  oh you havent seen them ashore  at utica they were very lively but thats no longer our natural home  dont you remember i told you i was working for new york  well i workedl had to work hard but weve moved  count otto clung to his interest  and i hope theyre happy  my father and mother  oh they will be in time  i must give them time  theyre very young yet theyve years before them  and youve been always in washington pandora continued  i suppose youve found out everything about everything  oh nothere are some things i cant find out  come and see me and perhaps i can help you  im very different from what i was in that phase  ive advanced a great deal since then  oh how was miss day in that phase asked a cabinet minister of the last administration  she was delightful of course count otto said  hes very flattering i didnt open my mouth pandora cried here comes mrs steuben to take me to some other place  i believe its a literary party near the capitol  everything seems so separate in washington  mrs steubens going to read a poem  i wish shed read it here wouldnt it do as well  this lady arriving signified to her young friend the necessity of their moving on  but miss days companions had various things to say to her before giving her up  she had a vivid answer for each and it was brought home to vogelstein while he listened that this would be indeed in her development as she said another phase daughter of small burghers as she might be she was really brilliant he turned away a little and while mrs steuben waited put her a question  he had made her half an hour before the subject of that inquiry to which mrs bonnycastle returned so ambiguous an answer but this wasnt because he failed of all direct acquaintance with the amiable woman or of any general idea of the esteem in which she was held  he had met her in various places and had been at her house  she was the widow of a commodore was a handsome mild soft swaying person whom every one liked with glossy bands of black hair and a little ringlet depending behind each ear  some one had said that she looked like the vieux jeu idea of the queen in hamlet  she had written verses which were admired in the south wore a fulllength portrait of the commodore on her bosom and spoke with the accent of savannah  she had about her a positive strong odour of washington  it had certainly been very superfluous in our young man to question mrs bonnycastle about her social position  do kindly tell me he said lowering his voice whats the type to which that young lady belongs  mrs bonnycastle tells me its a new one  mrs steuben for a moment fixed her liquid eyes on the secretary of legation  she always seemed to be translating the prose of your speech into the finer rhythms with which her own mind was familiar do you think anythings really new she then began to flute  im very fond of the old you know thats a weakness of we southerners the poor lady it will be observed had another weakness as well what we often take to be the new is simply the old under some novel form  were there not remarkable natures in the past  if you doubt it you should visit the south where the past still lingers  vogelstein had been struck before this with mrs steubens pronunciation of the word by which her native latitudes were designated transcribing it from her lips you would have written it as the nearest approach the sooth  but at present he scarce heeded this peculiarity he was wondering rather how a woman could be at once so copious and so uninforming  what did he care about the past or even about the sooth  he was afraid of starting her again  he looked at her discouraged and helpless as bewildered almost as mrs bonnycastle had found him half an hour before looked also at the commodore who on her bosom seemed to breathe again with his widows respirations  call it an old type then if you like he said in a moment  all i want to know is what type it is it seems impossible he gasped to find out  you can find out in the newspapers  theyve had articles about it they write about everything now  but it isnt true about miss day its one of the first families  her greatgrandfather was in the revolution  pandora by this time had given her attention again to mrs steuben  she seemed to signify that she was ready to move on wasnt your greatgrandfather in the revolution the elder lady asked  im telling count vogelstein about him  why are you asking about my ancestors the girl demanded of the young german with untempered brightness  is that the thing you said just now that you cant find out  well if mrs steuben will only be quiet you never will  mrs steuben shook her head rather dreamily  well its no trouble for we of the sooth to be quiet  theres a kind of languor in our blood  besides we have to be today  but ive got to show some energy tonight  ive got to get you to the end of pennsylvania avenue  pandora gave her hand to count otto and asked him if he thought they should meet again  he answered that in washington people were always meeting again and that at any rate he shouldnt fail to wait upon her  hereupon just as the two ladies were detaching themselves mrs steuben remarked that if the count and miss day wished to meet again the picnic would be a good chancethe picnic she was getting up for the following thursday  it was to consist of about twenty bright people and theyd go down the potomac to mount vernon  the count answered that if mrs steuben thought him bright enough he should be delighted to join the party and he was told the hour for which the tryst was taken  he remained at mrs bonnycastles after every one had gone and then he informed this lady of his reason for waiting  would she have mercy on him and let him know in a single word before he went to restfor without it rest would be impossiblewhat was this famous type to which pandora day belonged  gracious you dont mean to say youve not found out that type yet mrs bonnycastle exclaimed with a return of her hilarity what have you been doing all the evening  you germans may be thorough but you certainly are not quick  it was alfred bonnycastle who at last took pity on him  my dear vogelstein shes the latest freshest fruit of our great american evolution  shes the selfmade girl  count otto gazed a moment  the fruit of the great american revolution  yes mrs steuben told me her greatgrandfather but the rest of his sentence was lost in a renewed explosion of mrs bonnycastles sense of the ridiculous  he bravely pushed his advantage such as it was however and desiring his hosts definition to be defined inquired what the selfmade girl might be  sit down and well tell you all about it mrs bonnycastle said i like talking this way after a partys over  you can smoke if you like and alfred will open another window  well to begin with the selfmade girls a new feature  that however you know  in the second place she isnt selfmade at all  we all help to make herwe take such an interest in her  thats only after shes made alfred bonnycastle broke in  but its vogelstein that takes an interest  what on earth has started you up so on the subject of miss day  the visitor explained as well as he could that it was merely the accident of his having crossed the ocean in the steamer with her but he felt the inadequacy of this account of the matter felt it more than his hosts who could know neither how little actual contact he had had with her on the ship how much he had been affected by mrs dangerfields warnings nor how much observation at the same time he had lavished on her  he sat there half an hour and the warm dead stillness of the washington nightnowhere are the nights so silentcame in at the open window mingled with a soft sweet earthy smell the smell of growing things and in particular as he thought of mrs steubens sooth  before he went away he had heard all about the selfmade girl and there was something in the picture that strongly impressed him  she was possible doubtless only in america american life had smoothed the way for her  she was not fast nor emancipated nor crude nor loud and there wasnt in her of necessity at least a grain of the stuff of which the adventuress is made  she was simply very successful and her success was entirely personal  she hadnt been born with the silver spoon of social opportunity she had grasped it by honest exertion you knew her by many different signs but chiefly infallibly by the appearance of her parents  it was her parents who told her story you always saw how little her parents could have made her her attitude with regard to them might vary in different ways  as the great fact on her own side was that she had lifted herself from a lower social plane done it all herself and done it by the simple lever of her personality it was naturally to be expected that she would leave the authors of her mere material being in the shade sometimes she had them in her wake lost in the bubbles and the foam that showed where she had passed sometimes as alfred bonnycastle said she let them slide altogether sometimes she kept them in close confinement resorting to them under cover of night and with every precaution sometimes she exhibited them to the public in discreet glimpses in prearranged attitudes  but the general characteristic of the selfmade girl was that though it was frequently understood that she was privately devoted to her kindred she never attempted to impose them on society and it was striking that though in some of her manifestations a bore she was at her worst less of a bore than they  they were almost always solemn and portentous and they were for the most part of a deathly respectability  she wasnt necessarily snobbish unless it was snobbish to want the best  she didnt cringe she didnt make herself smaller than she was she took on the contrary a stand of her own and attracted things to herself  naturally she was possible only in americaonly in a country where whole ranges of competition and comparison were absent  the natural history of this interesting creature was at last completely laid bare to the earnest stranger who as he sat there in the animated stillness with the fragrant breath of the western world in his nostrils was convinced of what he had already suspected that conversation in the great republic was more yearningly not to say gropingly psychological than elsewhere  another thing as he learned that you knew the self made girl by was her culture which was perhaps a little too restless and obvious  she had usually got into society more or less by reading and her conversation was apt to be garnished with literary allusions even with familiar quotations  vogelstein hadnt had time to observe this element as a developed form in pandora day but alfred bonnycastle hinted that he wouldnt trust her to keep it under in a teteatete  it was needless to say that these young persons had always been to europe that was usually the first place they got to  by such arts they sometimes entered society on the other side before they did so at home it was to be added at the same time that this resource was less and less valuable for europe in the american world had less and less prestige and people in the western hemisphere now kept a watch on that roundabout road  all of which quite applied to pandora day the journey to europe the culture as exemplified in the books she read on the ship the relegation the effacement of the family the only thing that was exceptional was the rapidity of her march for the jump she had taken since he left her in the hands of mr lansing struck vogelstein even after he had made all allowance for the abnormal homogeneity of the american mass as really considerable  it took all her cleverness to account for such things  when she moved from uticamobilised her commissariat the battle appeared virtually to have been gained  count otto called the next day and mrs steubens blackamoor informed him in the communicative manner of his race that the ladies had gone out to pay some visits and look at the capitol pandora apparently had not hitherto examined this monument and our young man wished he had known the evening before of her omission so that he might have offered to be her initiator  there is too obvious a connexion for us to fail of catching it between his regret and the fact that in leaving mrs steubens door he reminded himself that he wanted a good walk and that he thereupon took his way along pennsylvania avenue  his walk had become fairly good by the time he reached the great white edifice that unfolds its repeated colonnades and uplifts its isolated dome at the end of a long vista of saloons and tobaccoshops  he slowly climbed the great steps hesitating a little even wondering why he had come  the superficial reason was obvious enough but there was a real one behind it that struck him as rather wanting in the solidity which should characterise the motives of an emissary of prince bismarck  the superficial reason was a belief that mrs steuben would pay her visit firstit was probably only a question of leaving cardsand bring her young friend to the capitol at the hour when the yellow afternoon light would give a tone to the blankness of its marble walls  the capitol was a splendid building but it was rather wanting in tone vogelsteins curiosity about pandora day had been much more quickened than checked by the revelations made to him in mrs bonnycastles drawingroom  it was a relief to have the creature classified but he had a desire of which he had not been conscious before to see really to the end how well in other words how completely and artistically a girl could make herself  his calculations had been just and he had wandered about the rotunda for only ten minutes looking again at the paintings commemorative of the national annals which occupy its lower spaces and at the simulated sculptures so touchingly characteristic of early american taste which adorn its upper reaches when the charming women he had been counting on presented themselves in charge of a licensed guide he went to meet them and didnt conceal from them that he had marked them for his very own  the encounter was happy on both sides and he accompanied them through the queer and endless interior through labyrinths of bleak bare development into legislative and judicial halls  he thought it a hideous place he had seen it all before and asked himself what senseless game he was playing  in the lower house were certain bedaubed walls in the basest style of imitation which made him feel faintly sick not to speak of a lobby adorned with artless prints and photographs of eminent defunct congressmen that was all too serious for a joke and too comic for a valhalla but pandora was greatly interested she thought the capitol very fine it was easy to criticise the details but as a whole it was the most impressive building she had ever seen  she proved a charming fellow tourist she had constantly something to say but never said it too much it was impossible to drag in the wake of a cicerone less of a lengthening or an irritating chain  vogelstein could see too that she wished to improve her mind she looked at the historical pictures at the uncanny statues of local worthies presented by the different statesthey were of different sizes as if they had been numbered in a shopshe asked questions of the guide and in the chamber of the senate requested him to show her the chairs of the gentlemen from new york  she sat down in one of them though mrs steuben told her that senator she mistook the chair dropping into another state was a horrid old thing  throughout the hour he spent with her vogelstein seemed to see how it was she had made herself  they walked about afterwards on the splendid terrace that surrounds the capitol the great marble floor on which it stands and made vague remarkspandoras were the most definiteabout the yellow sheen of the potomac the hazy hills of virginia the fargleaming pediment of arlington the raw confused looking country  washington was beneath them bristling and geometrical the long lines of its avenues seemed to stretch into national futures  pandora asked count otto if he had ever been to athens and on his admitting so much sought to know whether the eminence on which they stood didnt give him an idea of the acropolis in its prime  vogelstein deferred the satisfaction of this appeal to their next meeting he was gladin spite of the appealto make pretexts for seeing her again  he did so on the morrow mrs steubens picnic was still three days distant  he called on pandora a second time also met her each evening in the washington world  it took very little of this to remind him that he was forgetting both mrs dangerfields warnings and the admonitions long familiar to himof his own conscience  was he in peril of love  was he to be sacrificed on the altar of the american girl an altar at which those other poor fellows had poured out some of the bluest blood in germany and he had himself taken oath he would never seriously worship  he decided that he wasnt in real danger that he had rather clinched his precautions  it was true that a young person who had succeeded so well for herself might be a great help to her husband but this diplomatic aspirant preferred on the whole that his success should be his own  it wouldnt please him to have the air of being pushed by his wife  such a wife as that would wish to push him and he could hardly admit to himself that this was what fate had in reserve for himto be propelled in his career by a young lady who would perhaps attempt to talk to the kaiser as he had heard her the other night talk to the president  would she consent to discontinue relations with her family or would she wish still to borrow plastic relief from that domestic background  that her family was so impossible was to a certain extent an advantage for if they had been a little better the question of a rupture would be less easy  he turned over these questions in spite of his security or perhaps indeed because of it  the security made them speculative and disinterested  they haunted him during the excursion to mount vernon which took place according to traditions long established  mrs steubens confederates assembled on the steamer and were set afloat on the big brown stream which had already seemed to our special traveller to have too much bosom and too little bank  here and there however he became conscious of a shore where there was something to look at even though conscious at the same time that he had of old lost great opportunities of an idyllic cast in not having managed to be more thrown with a certain young lady on the deck of the north german lloyd  the two turned round together to hang over alexandria which for pandora as she declared was a picture of old virginia  she told vogelstein that she was always hearing about it during the civil war ages before  little girl as she had been at the time she remembered all the names that were on peoples lips during those years of reiteration  this historic spot had a touch of the romance of rich decay a reference to older things to a dramatic past  the past of alexandria appeared in the vista of three or four short streets sloping up a hill and lined with poor brick warehouses erected for merchandise that had ceased to come or go  it looked hot and blank and sleepy down to the shabby waterside where tattered darkies dangled their bare feet from the edge of rotting wharves  pandora was even more interested in mount vernonwhen at last its wooded bluff began to command the riverthan she had been in the capitol and after they had disembarked and ascended to the celebrated mansion she insisted on going into every room it contained  she claimed for it as she saidsome of her turns were so characteristic both of her nationality and her own style the finest situation in the world and was distinct as to the shame of their not giving it to the president for his countryseat  most of her companions had seen the house often and were now coupling themselves in the grounds according to their sympathies so that it was easy for vogelstein to offer the benefit of his own experience to the most inquisitive member of the party  they were not to lunch for another hour and in the interval the young man roamed with his first and fairest acquaintance  the breath of the potomac on the boat had been a little harsh but on the softlycurving lawn beneath the clustered trees with the river relegated to a mere shining presence far below and in the distance the day gave out nothing but its mildness the whole scene became noble and genial  count otto could joke a little on great occasions and the present one was worthy of his humour  he maintained to his companion that the shallow painted mansion resembled a false house a wing or structure of daubed canvas on the stage but she answered him so well with certain economical palaces she had seen in germany where as she said there was nothing but china stoves and stuffed birds that he was obliged to allow the home of washington to be after all really gemuthlich  what he found so in fact was the soft texture of the day his personal situation the sweetness of his suspense  for suspense had decidedly become his portion he was under a charm that made him feel he was watching his own life and that his susceptibilities were beyond his control  it hung over him that things might take a turn from one hour to the other which would make them very different from what they had been yet and his heart certainly beat a little faster as he wondered what that turn might be  why did he come to picnics on fragrant april days with american girls who might lead him too far  wouldnt such girls be glad to marry a pomeranian count  and would they after all talk that way to the kaiser  if he were to marry one of them he should have to give her several thorough lessons  in their little tour of the house our young friend and his companion had had a great many fellow visitors who had also arrived by the steamer and who had hitherto not left them an ideal privacy  but the others gradually dispersed they circled about a kind of showman who was the authorised guide a big slow genial vulgar heavily bearded man with a whimsical edifying patronising tone a tone that had immense success when he stopped here and there to make his pointsto pass his eyes over his listening flock then fix them quite above it with a meditative look and bring out some ancient pleasantry as if it were a sudden inspiration  he made a cheerful thing an echo of the platform before the booth of a country fair even of a visit to the tomb of the pater patriae  it is enshrined in a kind of grotto in the grounds and vogelstein remarked to pandora that he was a good man for the place but was too familiar oh hed have been familiar with washington said the girl with the bright dryness with which she often uttered amusing things vogelstein looked at her a moment and it came over him as he smiled that she herself probably wouldnt have been abashed even by the hero with whom history has taken fewest liberties  you look as if you could hardly believe that pandora went on  you germans are always in such awe of great people  and it occurred to her critic that perhaps after all washington would have liked her manner which was wonderfully fresh and natural  the man with the beard was an ideal minister to american shrines he played on the curiosity of his little band with the touch of a master drawing them at the right moment away to see the classic icehouse where the old lady had been found weeping in the belief it was washingtons grave  while this monument was under inspection our interesting couple had the house to themselves and they spent some time on a pretty terrace where certain windows of the second floor openeda little rootless verandah which overhung in a manner obliquely all the magnificence of the view the immense sweep of the river the artistic plantations the lastcentury garden with its big box hedges and remains of old espaliers  they lingered here for nearly half an hour and it was in this retirement that vogelstein enjoyed the only approach to intimate conversation appointed for him as was to appear with a young woman in whom he had been unable to persuade himself that he was not absorbed  its not necessary and its not possible that i should reproduce this colloquy but i may mention that it beganas they leaned against the parapet of the terrace and heard the cheerful voice of the showman wafted up to them from a distancewith his saying to her rather abruptly that he couldnt make out why they hadnt had more talk together when they crossed the atlantic  well i can if you cant said pandora  id have talked quick enough if you had spoken to me  i spoke to you first  yes i remember thatand it affected him awkwardly  you listened too much to mrs dangerfield  he feigned a vagueness  to mrs dangerfield  that woman you were always sitting with she told you not to speak to me  ive seen her in new york she speaks to me now herself she recommended you to have nothing to do with me  oh how can you say such dreadful things count otto cried with a very becoming blush  you know you cant deny it  you werent attracted by my family theyre charming people when you know them  i dont have a better time anywhere than i have at home the girl went on loyally  but what does it matter  my family are very happy  theyre getting quite used to new york  mrs dangerfields a vulgar wretchnext winter shell call on me  you are unlike any madchen ive ever seeni dont understand you said poor vogelstein with the colour still in his face  well you never will understand meprobably but what difference does it make  he attempted to tell her what difference but ive no space to follow him here  its known that when the german mind attempts to explain things it doesnt always reduce them to simplicity and pandora was first mystified then amused by some of the counts revelations  at last i think she was a little frightened for she remarked irrelevantly with some decision that luncheon would be ready and that they ought to join mrs steuben  her companion walked slowly on purpose as they left the house together for he knew the pang of a vague sense that he was losing her  and shall you be in washington many days yet he appealed as they went  it will all depend  im expecting important news  what i shall do will be influenced by that  the way she talked about expecting newsand importantmade him feel somehow that she had a career that she was active and independent so that he could scarcely hope to stop her as she passed  it was certainly true that he had never seen any girl like her  it would have occurred to him that the news she was expecting might have reference to the favour she had begged of the president if he hadnt already made up his mindin the calm of meditation after that talk with the bonnycastlesthat this favour must be a pleasantry  what she had said to him had a discouraging a somewhat chilling effect nevertheless it was not without a certain ardour that he inquired of her whether so long as she stayed in washington he mightnt pay her certain respectful attentions  as many as you likeand as respectful ones but you wont keep them up for ever  you try to torment me said count otto  she waited to explain  i mean that i may have some of my family  i shall be delighted to see them again  again she just hung fire  there are some youve never seen  in the afternoon returning to washington on the steamer vogelstein received a warning  it came from mrs bonnycastle and constituted oddly enough the second juncture at which an officious female friend had while sociably afloat with him advised him on the subject of pandora day  theres one thing we forgot to tell you the other night about the selfmade girl said the lady of infinite mirth  its never safe to fix your affections on her because she has almost always an impediment somewhere in the background  he looked at her askance but smiled and said  i should understand your informationfor which im so much obligeda little better if i knew what you mean by an impediment  oh i mean shes always engaged to some young man who belongs to her earlier phase  her earlier phase  the time before she had made herselfwhen she lived unconscious of her powers  a young man from utica say  they usually have to wait hes probably in a store  its a long engagement  count otto somehow preferred to understand as little as possible do you mean a betrothalto take effect  i dont mean anything german and moonstruck  i mean that piece of peculiarly american enterprise a premature engagementto take effect but too complacently at the end of time  vogelstein very properly reflected that it was no use his having entered the diplomatic career if he werent able to bear himself as if this interesting generalisation had no particular message for him  he did mrs bonnycastle moreover the justice to believe that she wouldnt have approached the question with such levity if she had supposed she should make him wince  the whole thing was like everything else but for her to laugh at and the betrayal moreover of a good intention  i see i seethe selfmade girl has of course always had a past  yes and the young man in the storefrom uticais part of her past  you express it perfectly said mrs bonnycastle  i couldnt say it better myself  but with her present with her future when they change like this young ladys i suppose everything else changes  how do you say it in america  she lets him slide  we dont say it at all mrs bonnycastle cried  she does nothing of the sort for what do you take her  she sticks to him that at least is what we expect her to do she added with less assurance as i tell you the types new and the case under consideration  we havent yet had time for complete study  oh of course i hope she sticks to him vogelstein declared simply and with his german accent more audible as it always was when he was slightly agitated  for the rest of the trip he was rather restless  he wandered about the boat talking little with the returning picnickers  toward the last as they drew near washington and the white dome of the capitol hung aloft before them looking as simple as a suspended snowball he found himself on the deck in proximity to mrs steuben  he reproached himself with having rather neglected her during an entertainment for which he was indebted to her bounty and he sought to repair his omission by a proper deference  but the only act of homage that occurred to him was to ask her as by chance whether miss day were to her knowledge engaged  mrs steuben turned her southern eyes upon him with a look of almost romantic compassion  to my knowledge  why of course id know  i should think youd know too  didnt you know she was engaged  why she has been engaged since she was sixteen  count otto gazed at the dome of the capitol  to a gentleman from utica  yes a native of her place  shes expecting him soon  im so very glad to hear it said vogelstein who decidedly for his career had promise  and is she going to marry him  why what do people fall in love with each other for  i presume theyll marry when she gets round to it  ah if she had only been from the sooth  at this he broke quickly in  but why have they never brought it off as you say in so many years  well at first she was too young and then she thought her family ought to see europeof course they could see it better with her and they spent some time there  and then mr bellamy had some business difficulties that made him feel as if he didnt want to marry just then  but he has given up business and i presume feels more free  of course its rather long but all the while theyve been engaged  its a true true love said mrs steuben whose sound of the adjective was that of a feeble flute  is his name mr bellamy the count asked with his haunting reminiscence  d f bellamy so  and has he been in a store  i dont know what kind of business it was  it was some kind of business in utica  i think he had a branch in new york  hes one of the leading gentlemen of utica and very highly educated  hes a good deal older than miss day  hes a very fine mani presume a college man  he stands very high in utica  i dont know why you look as if you doubted it  vogelstein assured mrs steuben that he doubted nothing and indeed what she told him was probably the more credible for seeming to him eminently strange  bellamy had been the name of the gentleman who a year and a half before was to have met pandora on the arrival of the german steamer it was in bellamys name that she had addressed herself with such effusion to bellamys friend the man in the straw hat who was about to fumble in her mothers old clothes  this was a fact that seemed to count otto to finish the picture of her contradictions it wanted at present no touch to be complete  yet even as it hung there before him it continued to fascinate him and he stared at it detached from surrounding things and feeling a little as if he had been pitched out of an overturned vehicle till the boat bumped against one of the outstanding piles of the wharf at which mrs steubens party was to disembark  there was some delay in getting the steamer adjusted to the dock during which the passengers watched the process over its side and extracted what entertainment they might from the appearance of the various persons collected to receive it  there were darkies and loafers and hackmen and also vague individuals the loosest and blankest he had ever seen anywhere with tufts on their chins toothpicks in their mouths hands in their pockets rumination in their jaws and diamond pins in their shirtfronts who looked as if they had sauntered over from pennsylvania avenue to while away half an hour forsaking for that interval their various slanting postures in the porticoes of the hotels and the doorways of the saloons  oh im so glad  how sweet of you to come down  it was a voice close to count ottos shoulder that spoke these words and he had no need to turn to see from whom it proceeded  it had been in his ears the greater part of the day though as he now perceived without the fullest richness of expression of which it was capable  still less was he obliged to turn to discover to whom it was addressed for the few simple words i have quoted had been flung across the narrowing interval of water and a gentleman who had stepped to the edge of the dock without our young mans observing him tossed back an immediate reply  i got here by the three oclock train  they told me in k street where you were and i thought id come down and meet you  charming attention said pandora day with the laugh that seemed always to invite the whole of any company to partake in it though for some moments after this she and her interlocutor appeared to continue the conversation only with their eyes  meanwhile vogelsteins also were not idle  he looked at her visitor from head to foot and he was aware that she was quite unconscious of his own proximity  the gentleman before him was tall goodlooking well dressed evidently he would stand well not only at utica but judging from the way he had planted himself on the dock in any position that circumstances might compel him to take up  he was about forty years old he had a black moustache and he seemed to look at the world over some counterlike expanse on which he invited it all warily and pleasantly to put down first its idea of the terms of a transaction  he waved a gloved hand at pandora as if when she exclaimed gracious aint they long to urge her to be patient she was patient several seconds and then asked him if he had any news  he looked at her briefly in silence smiling after which he drew from his pocket a large letter with an officiallooking seal and shook it jocosely above his head  this was discreetly covertly done  no one but our young man appeared aware of how much was taking placeand poor count otto mainly felt it in the air  the boat was touching the wharf and the space between the pair inconsiderable  department of state pandora very prettily and soundlessly mouthed across at him  thats what they call it  well what country  whats your opinion of the dutch the gentleman asked for answer  oh gracious cried pandora  well are you going to wait for the return trip said the gentleman  our silent sufferer turned away and presently mrs steuben and her companion disembarked together  when this lady entered a carriage with miss day the gentleman who had spoken to the girl followed them the others scattered and vogelstein declining with thanks a lift from mrs bonnycastle walked home alone and in some intensity of meditation  two days later he saw in a newspaper an announcement that the president had offered the post of minister to holland to mr d f bellamy of utica and in the course of a month he heard from mrs steuben that pandora a thousand other duties performed had finally got round to the altar of her own nuptials he communicated this news to mrs bonnycastle who had not heard it but who shrieking at the queer face he showed her met it with the remark that there was now ground for a new induction as to the self made girl
