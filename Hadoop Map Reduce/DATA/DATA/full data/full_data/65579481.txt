the reissue of a series of essays so ephemeral and even superfluous may seem at the first glance to require some excuse probably the best excuse is that they will have been completely forgotten and therefore may be read again with entirely new sensations i am not sure however that this claim is so modest as it sounds for i fancy that shakespeare and balzac if moved to prayers might not ask to be remembered but to be forgotten and forgotten thus for if they were forgotten they would be everlastingly rediscovered and reread it is a monotonous memory which keeps us in the main from seeing things as splendid as they are the ancients were not wrong when they made lethe the boundary of a better land perhaps the only flaw in their system is that a man who had bathed in the river of forgetfulness would be as likely as not to climb back upon the bank of the earth and fancy himself in elysium  if therefore i am certain that most sensible people have forgotten the existence of this booki do not speak in modesty or in pridei wish only to state a simple and somewhat beautiful fact in one respect the passing of the period during which a book can be considered current has afflicted me with some melancholy for i had intended to write anonymously in some daily paper a thorough and crushing exposure of the work inspired mostly by a certain artistic impatience of the too indulgent tone of the critiques and the manner in which a vast number of my most monstrous fallacies have passed unchallenged i will not repeat that powerful article here for it cannot be necessary to do anything more than warn the reader against the perfectly indefensible line of argument adopted at the end of p 28 i am also conscious that the title of the book is strictly speaking inaccurate it is a legal metaphor and speaking legally a defendant is not an enthusiast for the character of king john or the domestic virtues of the prairiedog he is one who defends himself a thing which the present writer however poisoned his mind may be with paradox certainly never dreamed of attempting  criticism upon the book considered as literature if it can be so considered i should of course never dream of discussingfirstly because it is ridiculous to do so and secondly because there was in my opinion much justice in such criticism  but there is one matter on which an author is generally considered as having a right to explain himself since it has nothing to do with capacity or intelligence and that is the question of his morals  i am proud to say that a furious uncompromising and very effective attack was made upon what was alleged to be the utter immorality of this book by my excellent friend mr cfg masterman in the speaker the tendency of that criticism was to the effect that i was discouraging improvement and disguising scandals by my offensive optimism quoting the passage in which i said that diamonds were to be found in the dustbin he said there is no difficulty in finding good in what humanity rejects the difficulty is to find it in what humanity accepts the diamond is easy enough to find in the dustbin the difficulty is to find it in the drawingroom i must admit for my part without the slightest shame that i have found a great many very excellent things in drawingrooms for example i found mr masterman in a drawingroom but i merely mention this purely ethical attack in order to state in as few sentences as possible my difference from the theory of optimism and progress therein enunciated at first sight it would seem that the pessimist encourages improvement but in reality it is a singular truth that the era in which pessimism has been cried from the housetops is also that in which almost all reform has stagnated and fallen into decay the reason of this is not difficult to discover no man ever did and no man ever can create or desire to make a bad thing good or an ugly thing beautiful there must be some germ of good to be loved some fragment of beauty to be admired the mother washes and decks out the dirty or careless child but no one can ask her to wash and deck out a goblin with a heart like hell no one can kill the fatted calf for mephistopheles the cause which is blocking all progress today is the subtle scepticism which whispers in a million ears that things are not good enough to be worth improving if the world is good we are revolutionaries if the world is evil we must be conservatives these essays futile as they are considered as serious literature are yet ethically sincere since they seek to remind men that things must be loved first and improved afterwards  g k c                                       the defendant  introduction  in certain endless uplands uplands like great flats gone dizzy slopes that seem to contradict the idea that there is even such a thing as a level and make us all realize that we live on a planet with a sloping roof you will come from time to time upon whole valleys filled with loose rocks and boulders so big as to be like mountains broken loose the whole might be an experimental creation shattered and cast away it is often difficult to believe that such cosmic refuse can have come together except by human means the mildest and most cockney imagination conceives the place to be the scene of some war of giants to me it is always associated with one idea recurrent and at last instinctive the scene was the scene of the stoning of some prehistoric prophet a prophet as much more gigantic than afterprophets as the boulders are more gigantic than the pebbles he spoke some wordswords that seemed shameful and tremendousand the world in terror buried him under a wilderness of stones the place is the monument of an ancient fear  if we followed the same mood of fancy it would he more difficult to imagine what awful hint or wild picture of the universe called forth that primal persecution what secret of sensational thought lies buried under the brutal stones for in our time the blasphemies are threadbare pessimism is now patently as it always was essentially more commonplace than piety profanity is now more than an affectationit is a convention the curse against god is exercise i in the primer of minor poetry it was not assuredly for such babyish solemnities that our imaginary prophet was stoned in the morning of the world if we weigh the matter in the faultless scales of imagination if we see what is the real trend of humanity we shall feel it most probable that he was stoned for saying that the grass was green and that the birds sang in spring for the mission of all the prophets from the beginning has not been so much the pointing out of heavens or hells as primarily the pointing out of the earth  religion has had to provide that longest and strangest telescopethe telescope through which we could see the star upon which we dwelt for the mind and eyes of the average man this world is as lost as eden and as sunken as atlantis there runs a strange law through the length of human historythat men are continually tending to undervalue their environment to undervalue their happiness to undervalue themselves the great sin of mankind the sin typified by the fall of adam is the tendency not towards pride but towards this weird and horrible humility  this is the great fall the fall by which the fish forgets the sea the ox forgets the meadow the clerk forgets the city every man forgets his environment and in the fullest and most literal sense forgets himself this is the real fall of adam and it is a spiritual fall it is a strange thing that many truly spiritual men such as general gordon have actually spent some hours in speculating upon the precise location of the garden of eden most probably we are in eden still it is only our eyes that have changed  the pessimist is commonly spoken of as the man in revolt he is not firstly because it requires some cheerfulness to continue in revolt and secondly because pessimism appeals to the weaker side of everybody and the pessimist therefore drives as roaring a trade as the publican the person who is really in revolt is the optimist who generally lives and dies in a desperate and suicidal effort to persuade all the other people how good they are it has been proved a hundred times over that if you really wish to enrage people and make them angry even unto death the right way to do it is to tell them that they are all the sons of god jesus christ was crucified it may be remembered not because of anything he said about god but on a charge of saying that a man could in three days pull down and rebuild the temple every one of the great revolutionists from isaiah to shelley have been optimists they have been indignant not about the badness of existence but about the slowness of men in realizing its goodness the prophet who is stoned is not a brawler or a marplot he is simply a rejected lover he suffers from an unrequited attachment to things in general  it becomes increasingly apparent therefore that the world is in a permanent danger of being misjudged that this is no fanciful or mystical idea may be tested by simple examples the two absolutely basic words good and bad descriptive of two primal and inexplicable sensations are not and never have been used properly things that are bad are not called good by any people who experience them but things that are good are called bad by the universal verdict of humanity  let me explain a little certain things are bad so far as they go such as pain and no one not even a lunatic calls a toothache good in itself but a knife which cuts clumsily and with difficulty is called a bad knife which it certainly is not it is only not so good as other knives to which men have grown accustomed a knife is never bad except on such rare occasions as that in which it is neatly and scientifically planted in the middle of ones back the coarsest and bluntest knife which ever broke a pencil into pieces instead of sharpening it is a good thing in so far as it is a knife it would have appeared a miracle in the stone age what we call a bad knife is a good knife not good enough for us what we call a bad hat is a good hat not good enough for us what we call bad cookery is good cookery not good enough for us what we call a bad civilization is a good civilization not good enough for us we choose to call the great mass of the history of mankind bad not because it is bad but because we are better this is palpably an unfair principle ivory may not be so white as snow but the whole arctic continent does not make ivory black  now it has appeared to me unfair that humanity should be engaged perpetually in calling all those things bad which have been good enough to make other things better in everlastingly kicking down the ladder by which it has climbed it has appeared to me that progress should be something else besides a continual parricide therefore i have investigated the dustheaps of humanity and found a treasure in all of them i have found that humanity is not incidentally engaged but eternally and systematically engaged in throwing gold into the gutter and diamonds into the sea i have found that every man is disposed to call the green leaf of the tree a little less green than it is and the snow of christmas a little less white than it is therefore i have imagined that the main business of a man however humble is defence i have conceived that a defendant is chiefly required when worldlings despise the worldthat a counsel for the defence would not have been out of place in that terrible day when the sun was darkened over calvary and man was rejected of men                                         a defence of penny dreadfuls   one of the strangest examples of the degree to which ordinary life is undervalued is the example of popular literature the vast mass of which we contentedly describe as vulgar the boys novelette may be ignorant in a literary sense which is only like saying that a modern novel is ignorant in the chemical sense or the economic sense or the astronomical sense but it is not vulgar intrinsicallyit is the actual centre of a million flaming imaginations  in former centuries the educated class ignored the ruck of vulgar literature they ignored and therefore did not properly speaking despise it simple ignorance and indifference does not inflate the character with pride a man does not walk down the street giving a haughty twirl to his moustaches at the thought of his superiority to some variety of deepsea fishes the old scholars left the whole underworld of popular compositions in a similar darkness  today however we have reversed this principle we do despise vulgar compositions and we do not ignore them we are in some danger of becoming petty in our study of pettiness there is a terrible circean law in the background that if the soul stoops too ostentatiously to examine anything it never gets up again there is no class of vulgar publications about which there is to my mind more utterly ridiculous exaggeration and misconception than the current boys literature of the lowest stratum this class of composition has presumably always existed and must exist it has no more claim to be good literature than the daily conversation of its readers to be fine oratory or the lodginghouses and tenements they inhabit to be sublime architecture but people must have conversation they must have houses and they must have stories the simple need for some kind of ideal world in which fictitious persons play an unhampered part is infinitely deeper and older than the rules of good art and much more important every one of us in childhood has constructed such an invisible dramatis personæ but it never occurred to our nurses to correct the composition by careful comparison with balzac in the east the professional storyteller goes from village to village with a small carpet and i wish sincerely that anyone had the moral courage to spread that carpet and sit on it in ludgate circus but it is not probable that all the tales of the carpetbearer are little gems of original artistic workmanship literature and fiction are two entirely different things literature is a luxury fiction is a necessity a work of art can hardly be too short for its climax is its merit a story can never be too long for its conclusion is merely to be deplored like the last halfpenny or the last pipelight and so while the increase of the artistic conscience tends in more ambitious works to brevity and impressionism voluminous industry still marks the producer of the true romantic trash there was no end to the ballads of robin hood there is no end to the volumes about dick deadshot and the avenging nine these two heroes are deliberately conceived as immortal  but instead of basing all discussion of the problem upon the commonsense recognition of this factthat the youth of the lower orders always has had and always must have formless and endless romantic reading of some kind and then going on to make provision for its wholesomenesswe begin generally speaking by fantastic abuse of this reading as a whole and indignant surprise that the errandboys under discussion do not read the egoist and the master builder it is the custom particularly among magistrates to attribute half the crimes of the metropolis to cheap novelettes if some grimy urchin runs away with an apple the magistrate shrewdly points out that the childs knowledge that apples appease hunger is traceable to some curious literary researches the boys themselves when penitent frequently accuse the novelettes with great bitterness which is only to be expected from young people possessed of no little native humour if i had forged a will and could obtain sympathy by tracing the incident to the influence of mr george moores novels i should find the greatest entertainment in the diversion at any rate it is firmly fixed in the minds of most people that gutterboys unlike everybody else in the community find their principal motives for conduct in printed books  now it is quite clear that this objection the objection brought by magistrates has nothing to do with literary merit bad story writing is not a crime mr hall caine walks the streets openly and cannot be put in prison for an anticlimax the objection rests upon the theory that the tone of the mass of boys novelettes is criminal and degraded appealing to low cupidity and low cruelty this is the magisterial theory and this is rubbish  so far as i have seen them in connection with the dirtiest bookstalls in the poorest districts the facts are simply these the whole bewildering mass of vulgar juvenile literature is concerned with adventures rambling disconnected and endless it does not express any passion of any sort for there is no human character of any sort it runs eternally in certain grooves of local and historical type the medieval knight the eighteenthcentury duellist and the modern cowboy recur with the same stiff simplicity as the conventional human figures in an oriental pattern i can quite as easily imagine a human being kindling wild appetites by the contemplation of his turkey carpet as by such dehumanized and naked narrative as this  among these stories there are a certain number which deal sympathetically with the adventures of robbers outlaws and pirates which present in a dignified and romantic light thieves and murderers like dick turpin and claude duval that is to say they do precisely the same thing as scotts ivanhoe scotts rob roy scotts lady of the lake byrons corsair wordsworths rob roys grave stevensons macaire mr max pembertons iron pirate and a thousand more works distributed systematically as prizes and christmas presents nobody imagines that an admiration of locksley in ivanhoe will lead a boy to shoot japanese arrows at the deer in richmond park no one thinks that the incautious opening of wordsworth at the poem on rob roy will set him up for life as a blackmailer in the case of our own class we recognise that this wild life is contemplated with pleasure by the young not because it is like their own life but because it is different from it it might at least cross our minds that for whatever other reason the errandboy reads the red revenge it really is not because he is dripping with the gore of his own friends and relatives  in this matter as in all such matters we lose our bearings entirely by speaking of the lower classes when we mean humanity minus ourselves this trivial romantic literature is not especially plebeian it is simply human the philanthropist can never forget classes and callings he says with a modest swagger i have invited twentyfive factory hands to tea if he said i have invited twentyfive chartered accountants to tea everyone would see the humour of so simple a classification but this is what we have done with this lumberland of foolish writing we have probed as if it were some monstrous new disease what is in fact nothing but the foolish and valiant heart of man ordinary men will always be sentimentalists for a sentimentalist is simply a man who has feelings and does not trouble to invent a new way of expressing them these common and current publications have nothing essentially evil about them they express the sanguine and heroic truisms on which civilization is built for it is clear that unless civilization is built on truisms it is not built at all clearly there could be no safety for a society in which the remark by the chief justice that murder was wrong was regarded as an original and dazzling epigram  if the authors and publishers of dick deadshot and such remarkable works were suddenly to make a raid upon the educated class were to take down the names of every man however distinguished who was caught at a university extension lecture were to confiscate all our novels and warn us all to correct our lives we should be seriously annoyed yet they have far more right to do so than we for they with all their idiotcy are normal and we are abnormal it is the modern literature of the educated not of the uneducated which is avowedly and aggressively criminal books recommending profligacy and pessimism at which the highsouled errandboy would shudder lie upon all our drawingroom tables if the dirtiest old owner of the dirtiest old bookstall in whitechapel dared to display works really recommending polygamy or suicide his stock would be seized by the police these things are our luxuries and with a hypocrisy so ludicrous as to be almost unparalleled in history we rate the gutterboys for their immorality at the very time that we are discussing with equivocal german professors whether morality is valid at all at the very instant that we curse the penny dreadful for encouraging thefts upon property we canvass the proposition that all property is theft at the very instant we accuse it quite unjustly of lubricity and indecency we are cheerfully reading philosophies which glory in lubricity and indecency at the very instant that we charge it with encouraging the young to destroy life we are placidly discussing whether life is worth preserving  but it is we who are the morbid exceptions it is we who are the criminal class this should be our great comfort the vast mass of humanity with their vast mass of idle books and idle words have never doubted and never will doubt that courage is splendid that fidelity is noble that distressed ladies should be rescued and vanquished enemies spared there are a large number of cultivated persons who doubt these maxims of daily life just as there are a large number of persons who believe they are the prince of wales and i am told that both classes of people are entertaining conversationalists but the average man or boy writes daily in these great gaudy diaries of his soul which we call penny dreadfuls a plainer and better gospel than any of those iridescent ethical paradoxes that the fashionable change as often as their bonnets it may be a very limited aim in morality to shoot a manyfaced and fickle traitor but at least it is a better aim than to be a manyfaced and fickle traitor which is a simple summary of a good many modern systems from mr dannunzios downwards so long as the coarse and thin texture of mere current popular romance is not touched by a paltry culture it will never be vitally immoral it is always on the side of life the poorthe slaves who really stoop under the burden of lifehave often been mad scatterbrained and cruel but never hopeless that is a class privilege like cigars their drivelling literature will always be a blood and thunder literature as simple as the thunder of heaven and the blood of men                                        a defence of rash vows  if a prosperous modern man with a high hat and a frockcoat were to solemnly pledge himself before all his clerks and friends to count the leaves on every third tree in holland walk to hop up to the city on one leg every thursday to repeat the whole of mills liberty seventysix times to collect 300 dandelions in fields belonging to anyone of the name of brown to remain for thirtyone hours holding his left ear in his right hand to sing the names of all his aunts in order of age on the top of an omnibus or make any such unusual undertaking we should immediately conclude that the man was mad or as it is sometimes expressed was an artist in life yet these vows are not more extraordinary than the vows which in the middle ages and in similar periods were made not by fanatics merely but by the greatest figures in civic and national civilizationby kings judges poets and priests one man swore to chain two mountains together and the great chain hung there it was said for ages as a monument of that mystical folly another swore that he would find his way to jerusalem with a patch over his eyes and died looking for it it is not easy to see that these two exploits judged from a strictly rational standpoint are any saner than the acts above suggested a mountain is commonly a stationary and reliable object which it is not necessary to chain up at night like a dog and it is not easy at first sight to see that a man pays a very high compliment to the holy city by setting out for it under conditions which render it to the last degree improbable that he will ever get there  but about this there is one striking thing to be noticed if men behaved in that way in our time we should as we have said regard them as symbols of the decadence but the men who did these things were not decadent they belonged generally to the most robust classes of what is generally regarded as a robust age again it will be urged that if men essentially sane performed such insanities it was under the capricious direction of a superstitious religious system this again will not hold water for in the purely terrestrial and even sensual departments of life such as love and lust the medieval princes show the same mad promises and performances the same misshapen imagination and the same monstrous selfsacrifice here we have a contradiction to explain which it is necessary to think of the whole nature of vows from the beginning and if we consider seriously and correctly the nature of vows we shall unless i am much mistaken come to the conclusion that it is perfectly sane and even sensible to swear to chain mountains together and that if insanity is involved at all it is a little insane not to do so  the man who makes a vow makes an appointment with himself at some distant time or place the danger of it is that himself should not keep the appointment and in modern times this terror of ones self of the weakness and mutability of ones self has perilously increased and is the real basis of the objection to vows of any kind a modern man refrains from swearing to count the leaves on every third tree in holland walk not because it is silly to do so he does many sillier things but because he has a profound conviction that before he had got to the three hundred and seventyninth leaf on the first tree he would be excessively tired of the subject and want to go home to tea in other words we fear that by that time he will be in the common but hideously significant phrase another man now it is this horrible fairy tale of a man constantly changing into other men that is the soul of the decadence that john paterson should with apparent calm look forward to being a certain general barker on monday dr macgregor on tuesday sir walter carstairs on wednesday and sam slugg on thursday may seem a nightmare but to that nightmare we give the name of modern culture one great decadent who is now dead published a poem some time ago in which he powerfully summed up the whole spirit of the movement by declaring that he could stand in the prison yard and entirely comprehend the feelings of a man about to be hanged    for he that lives more lives than one   more deaths than one must die  and the end of all this is that maddening horror of unreality which descends upon the decadents and compared with which physical pain itself would have the freshness of a youthful thing the one hell which imagination must conceive as most hellish is to be eternally acting a play without even the narrowest and dirtiest greenroom in which to be human and this is the condition of the decadent of the aesthete of the freelover to be everlastingly passing through dangers which we know cannot scathe us to be taking oaths which we know cannot bind us to be defying enemies who we know cannot conquer usthis is the grinning tyranny of decadence which is called freedom  let us turn on the other hand to the maker of vows the man who made a vow however wild gave a healthy and natural expression to the greatness of a great moment he vowed for example to chain two mountains together perhaps a symbol of some great relief or love or aspiration short as the moment of his resolve might be it was like all great moments a moment of immortality and the desire to say of it exegi monumentum oere perennius was the only sentiment that would satisfy his mind the modern aesthetic man would of course easily see the emotional opportunity he would vow to chain two mountains together but then he would quite as cheerfully vow to chain the earth to the moon and the withering consciousness that he did not mean what he said that he was in truth saying nothing of any great import would take from him exactly that sense of daring actuality which is the excitement of a vow for what could be more maddening than an existence in which our mother or aunt received the information that we were going to assassinate the king or build a temple on ben nevis with the genial composure of custom  the revolt against vows has been carried in our day even to the extent of a revolt against the typical vow of marriage it is most amusing to listen to the opponents of marriage on this subject they appear to imagine that the ideal of constancy was a yoke mysteriously imposed on mankind by the devil instead of being as it is a yoke consistently imposed by all lovers on themselves they have invented a phrase a phrase that is a black and white contradiction in two wordsfreeloveas if a lover ever had been or ever could be free it is the nature of love to bind itself and the institution of marriage merely paid the average man the compliment of taking him at his word modern sages offer to the lover with an illflavoured grin the largest liberties and the fullest irresponsibility but they do not respect him as the old church respected him they do not write his oath upon the heavens as the record of his highest moment they give him every liberty except the liberty to sell his liberty which is the only one that he wants  in mr bernard shaws brilliant play the philanderer we have a vivid picture of this state of things charteris is a man perpetually endeavouring to be a freelover which is like endeavouring to be a married bachelor or a white negro he is wandering in a hungry search for a certain exhilaration which he can only have when he has the courage to cease from wandering men knew better than this in old timesin the time for example of shakespeares heroes when shakespeares men are really celibate they praise the undoubted advantages of celibacy liberty irresponsibility a chance of continual change but they were not such fools as to continue to talk of liberty when they were in such a condition that they could be made happy or miserable by the moving of someone elses eyebrow suckling classes love with debt in his praise of freedom    and he thats fairly out of both   of all the world is blest   he lives as in the golden age   when all things made were common   he takes his pipe he takes his glass   he fears no man or woman  this is a perfectly possible rational and manly position but what have lovers to do with ridiculous affectations of fearing no man or woman they know that in the turning of a hand the whole cosmic engine to the remotest star may become an instrument of music or an instrument of torture they hear a song older than sucklings that has survived a hundred philosophies who is this that looketh out of the window fair as the sun clear as the moon terrible as an army with banners  as we have said it is exactly this backdoor this sense of having a retreat behind us that is to our minds the sterilizing spirit in modern pleasure everywhere there is the persistent and insane attempt to obtain pleasure without paying for it thus in politics the modern jingoes practically say let us have the pleasures of conquerors without the pains of soldiers let us sit on sofas and be a hardy race thus in religion and morals the decadent mystics say let us have the fragrance of sacred purity without the sorrows of selfrestraint let us sing hymns alternately to the virgin and priapus thus in love the freelovers say let us have the splendour of offering ourselves without the peril of committing ourselves let us see whether one cannot commit suicide an unlimited number of times  emphatically it will not work there are thrilling moments doubtless for the spectator the amateur and the aesthete but there is one thrill that is known only to the soldier who fights for his own flag to the ascetic who starves himself for his own illumination to the lover who makes finally his own choice and it is this transfiguring selfdiscipline that makes the vow a truly sane thing it must have satisfied even the giant hunger of the soul of a lover or a poet to know that in consequence of some one instant of decision that strange chain would hang for centuries in the alps among the silences of stars and snows all around us is the city of small sins abounding in backways and retreats but surely sooner or later the towering flame will rise from the harbour announcing that the reign of the cowards is over and a man is burning his ships                                        a defence of skeletons   some little time ago i stood among immemorial english trees that seemed to take hold upon the stars like a brood of ygdrasils as i walked among these living pillars i became gradually aware that the rustics who lived and died in their shadow adopted a very curious conversational tone they seemed to be constantly apologizing for the trees as if they were a very poor show after elaborate investigation i discovered that their gloomy and penitent tone was traceable to the fact that it was winter and all the trees were bare i assured them that i did not resent the fact that it was winter that i knew the thing had happened before and that no forethought on their part could have averted this blow of destiny but i could not in any way reconcile them to the fact that it was winter there was evidently a general feeling that i had caught the trees in a kind of disgraceful deshabille and that they ought not to be seen until like the first human sinners they had covered themselves with leaves so it is quite clear that while very few people appear to know anything of how trees look in winter the actual foresters know less than anyone so far from the line of the tree when it is bare appearing harsh and severe it is luxuriantly indefinable to an unusual degree the fringe of the forest melts away like a vignette the tops of two or three high trees when they are leafless are so soft that they seem like the gigantic brooms of that fabulous lady who was sweeping the cobwebs off the sky the outline of a leafy forest is in comparison hard gross and blotchy the clouds of night do not more certainly obscure the moon than those green and monstrous clouds obscure the tree the actual sight of the little wood with its gray and silver sea of life is entirely a winter vision so dim and delicate is the heart of the winter woods a kind of glittering gloaming that a figure stepping towards us in the chequered twilight seems as if he were breaking through unfathomable depths of spiders webs  but surely the idea that its leaves are the chief grace of a tree is a vulgar one on a par with the idea that his hair is the chief grace of a pianist when winter that healthy ascetic carries his gigantic razor over hill and valley and shaves all the trees like monks we feel surely that they are all the more like trees if they are shorn just as so many painters and musicians would be all the more like men if they were less like mops but it does appear to be a deep and essential difficulty that men have an abiding terror of their own structure or of the structure of things they love this is felt dimly in the skeleton of the tree it is felt profoundly in the skeleton of the man  the importance of the human skeleton is very great and the horror with which it is commonly regarded is somewhat mysterious without claiming for the human skeleton a wholly conventional beauty we may assert that he is certainly not uglier than a bulldog whose popularity never wanes and that he has a vastly more cheerful and ingratiating expression but just as man is mysteriously ashamed of the skeletons of the trees in winter so he is mysteriously ashamed of the skeleton of himself in death it is a singular thing altogether this horror of the architecture of things one would think it would be most unwise in a man to be afraid of a skeleton since nature has set curious and quite insuperable obstacles to his running away from it  one ground exists for this terror a strange idea has infected humanity that the skeleton is typical of death a man might as well say that a factory chimney was typical of bankruptcy the factory may be left naked after ruin the skeleton may be left naked after bodily dissolution but both of them have had a lively and workmanlike life of their own all the pulleys creaking all the wheels turning in the house of livelihood as in the house of life there is no reason why this creature new as i fancy to art the living skeleton should not become the essential symbol of life  the truth is that mans horror of the skeleton is not horror of death at all it is mans eccentric glory that he has not generally speaking any objection to being dead but has a very serious objection to being undignified and the fundamental matter which troubles him in the skeleton is the reminder that the groundplan of his appearance is shamelessly grotesque i do not know why he should object to this he contentedly takes his place in a world that does not pretend to be genteela laughing working jeering world he sees millions of animals carrying with quite a dandified levity the most monstrous shapes and appendages the most preposterous horns wings and legs when they are necessary to utility he sees the good temper of the frog the unaccountable happiness of the hippopotamus he sees a whole universe which is ridiculous from the animalcule with a head too big for its body up to the comet with a tail too big for its head but when it comes to the delightful oddity of his own inside his sense of humour rather abruptly deserts him  in the middle ages and in the renaissance which was in certain times and respects a much gloomier period this idea of the skeleton had a vast influence in freezing the pride out of all earthly pomps and the fragrance out of all fleeting pleasures but it was not surely the mere dread of death that did this for these were ages in which men went to meet death singing it was the idea of the degradation of man in the grinning ugliness of his structure that withered the juvenile insolence of beauty and pride and in this it almost assuredly did more good than harm there is nothing so cold or so pitiless as youth and youth in aristocratic stations and ages tended to an impeccable dignity an endless summer of success which needed to be very sharply reminded of the scorn of the stars it was well that such flamboyant prigs should be convinced that one practical joke at least would bowl them over that they would fall into one grinning mantrap and not rise again that the whole structure of their existence was as wholesomely ridiculous as that of a pig or a parrot they could not be expected to realize that birth was humorous coming of age humorous drinking and fighting humorous they were far too young and solemn to know but at least they were taught that death was humorous  there is a peculiar idea abroad that the value and fascination of what we call nature lie in her beauty but the fact that nature is beautiful in the sense that a dado or a liberty curtain is beautiful is only one of her charms and almost an accidental one the highest and most valuable quality in nature is not her beauty but her generous and defiant ugliness a hundred instances might be taken the croaking noise of the rooks is in itself as hideous as the whole hell of sounds in a london railway tunnel yet it uplifts us like a trumpet with its coarse kindliness and honesty and the lover in maud could actually persuade himself that this abominable noise resembled his ladyloves name has the poet for whom nature means only roses and lilies ever heard a pig grunting it is a noise that does a man gooda strong snorting imprisoned noise breaking its way out of unfathomable dungeons through every possible outlet and organ it might be the voice of the earth itself snoring in its mighty sleep this is the deepest the oldest the most wholesome and religious sense of the value of naturethe value which comes from her immense babyishness she is as topheavy as grotesque as solemn and as happy as a child the mood does come when we see all her shapes like shapes that a baby scrawls upon a slatesimple rudimentary a million years older and stronger than the whole disease that is called art the objects of earth and heaven seem to combine into a nursery tale and our relation to things seems for a moment so simple that a dancing lunatic would be needed to do justice to its lucidity and levity the tree above my head is flapping like some gigantic bird standing on one leg the moon is like the eye of a cyclops and however much my face clouds with sombre vanity or vulgar vengeance or contemptible contempt the bones of my skull beneath it are laughing for ever                                        a defence of publicity   it is a very significant fact that the form of art in which the modern world has certainly not improved upon the ancient is what may roughly be called the art of the open air public monuments have certainly not improved nor has the criticism of them improved as is evident from the fashion of condemning such a large number of them as pompous an interesting essay might be written on the enormous number of words that are used as insults when they are really compliments it is in itself a singular study in that tendency which as i have said is always making things out worse than they are and necessitating a systematic attitude of defence thus for example some dramatic critics cast contempt upon a dramatic performance by calling it theatrical which simply means that it is suitable to a theatre and is as much a compliment as calling a poem poetical similarly we speak disdainfully of a certain kind of work as sentimental which simply means possessing the admirable and essential quality of sentiment such phrases are all parts of one peddling and cowardly philosophy and remind us of the days when enthusiast was a term of reproach but of all this vocabulary of unconscious eulogies nothing is more striking than the word pompous  properly speaking of course a public monument ought to be pompous pomp is its very object it would be absurd to have columns and pyramids blushing in some coy nook like violets in the woods of spring and public monuments have in this matter a great and muchneeded lesson to teach valour and mercy and the great enthusiasms ought to be a great deal more public than they are at present we are too fond nowadays of committing the sin of fear and calling it the virtue of reverence we have forgotten the old and wholesome morality of the book of proverbs wisdom crieth without her voice is heard in the streets in athens and florence her voice was heard in the streets they had an outdoor life of war and argument and they had what modern commercial civilization has never hadan outdoor art religious services the most sacred of all things have always been held publicly it is entirely a new and debased notion that sanctity is the same as secrecy a great many modern poets with the most abstruse and delicate sensibilities love darkness when all is said and done much for the same reason that thieves love it the mission of a great spire or statue should be to strike the spirit with a sudden sense of pride as with a thunderbolt it should lift us with it into the empty and ennobling air along the base of every noble monument whatever else may be written there runs in invisible letters the lines of swinburne    this thing is god   to be man with thy might   to go straight in the strength of thy spirit and live       out thy life in the light  if a public monument does not meet this first supreme and obvious need that it should be public and monumental it fails from the outset  there has arisen lately a school of realistic sculpture which may perhaps be better described as a school of sketchy sculpture such a movement was right and inevitable as a reaction from the mean and dingy pomposity of english victorian statuary perhaps the most hideous and depressing object in the universefar more hideous and depressing than one of mr hg wellss shapeless monsters of the slime and not at all unlike themis the statue of an english philanthropist almost as bad though of course not quite as bad are the statues of english politicians in parliament fields each of them is cased in a cylindrical frockcoat and each carries either a scroll or a dubiouslooking garment over the arm that might be either a bathingtowel or a light greatcoat each of them is in an oratorical attitude which has all the disadvantage of being affected without even any of the advantages of being theatrical let no one suppose that such abortions arise merely from technical demerit in every line of those leaden dolls is expressed the fact that they were not set up with any heat of natural enthusiasm for beauty or dignity they were set up mechanically because it would seem indecorous or stingy if they were not set up they were even set up sulkily in a utilitarian age which was haunted by the thought that there were a great many more sensible ways of spending money so long as this is the dominant national sentiment the land is barren statues and churches will not growfor they have to grow as much as trees and flowers but this moral disadvantage which lay so heavily upon the early victorian sculpture lies in a modified degree upon that rough picturesque commonplace sculpture which has begun to arise and of which the statue of darwin in the south kensington museum and the statue of gordon in trafalgar square are admirable examples it is not enough for a popular monument to be artistic like a black charcoal sketch it must be striking it must be in the highest sense of the word sensational it must stand for humanity it must speak for us to the stars it must declare in the face of all the heavens that when the longest and blackest catalogue has been made of all our crimes and follies there are some things of which we men are not ashamed  the two modes of commemorating a public man are a statue and a biography they are alike in certain respects as for example in the fact that neither of them resembles the original and that both of them commonly tone down not only all a mans vices but all the more amusing of his virtues but they are treated in one respect differently we never hear anything about biography without hearing something about the sanctity of private life and the necessity for suppressing the whole of the most important part of a mans existence the sculptor does not work at this disadvantage the sculptor does not leave out the nose of an eminent philanthropist because it is too beautiful to be given to the public he does not depict a statesman with a sack over his head because his smile was too sweet to be endurable in the light of day but in biography the thesis is popularly and solidly maintained so that it requires some courage even to hint a doubt of it that the better a man was the more truly human life he led the less should be said about it  for this idea this modern idea that sanctity is identical with secrecy there is one thing at least to be said it is for all practical purposes an entirely new idea it was unknown to all the ages in which the idea of sanctity really flourished the record of the great spiritual movements of mankind is dead against the idea that spirituality is a private matter the most awful secret of every mans soul its most lonely and individual need its most primal and psychological relationship the thing called worship the communication between the soul and the last realitythis most private matter is the most public spectacle in the world anyone who chooses to walk into a large church on sunday morning may see a hundred men each alone with his maker he stands in truth in the presence of one of the strangest spectacles in the worlda mob of hermits and in thus definitely espousing publicity by making public the most internal mystery christianity acts in accordance with its earliest origins and its terrible beginning it was surely by no accident that the spectacle which darkened the sun at noonday was set upon a hill the martyrdoms of the early christians were public not only by the caprice of the oppressor but by the whole desire and conception of the victims  the mere grammatical meaning of the word martyr breaks into pieces at a blow the whole notion of the privacy of goodness the christian martyrdoms were more than demonstrations they were advertisements in our day the new theory of spiritual delicacy would desire to alter all this it would permit christ to be crucified if it was necessary to his divine nature but it would ask in the name of good taste why he could not be crucified in a private room it would declare that the act of a martyr in being torn in pieces by lions was vulgar and sensational though of course it would have no objection to being torn in pieces by a lion in ones own parlour before a circle of really intimate friends  it is i am inclined to think a decadent and diseased purity which has inaugurated this notion that the sacred object must be hidden the stars have never lost their sanctity and they are more shameless and naked and numerous than advertisements of pears soap it would be a strange world indeed if nature was suddenly stricken with this ethereal shame if the trees grew with their roots in the air and their load of leaves and blossoms underground if the flowers closed at dawn and opened at sunset if the sunflower turned towards the darkness and the birds flew like bats by night                                        a defence of nonsense   there are two equal and eternal ways of looking at this twilight world of ours we may see it as the twilight of evening or the twilight of morning we may think of anything down to a fallen acorn as a descendant or as an ancestor there are times when we are almost crushed not so much with the load of the evil as with the load of the goodness of humanity when we feel that we are nothing but the inheritors of a humiliating splendour but there are other times when everything seems primitive when the ancient stars are only sparks blown from a boys bonfire when the whole earth seems so young and experimental that even the white hair of the aged in the fine biblical phrase is like almondtrees that blossom like the white hawthorn grown in may that it is good for a man to realize that he is the heir of all the ages is pretty commonly admitted it is a less popular but equally important point that it is good for him sometimes to realize that he is not only an ancestor but an ancestor of primal antiquity it is good for him to wonder whether he is not a hero and to experience ennobling doubts as to whether he is not a solar myth  the matters which most thoroughly evoke this sense of the abiding childhood of the world are those which are really fresh abrupt and inventive in any age and if we were asked what was the best proof of this adventurous youth in the nineteenth century we should say with all respect to its portentous sciences and philosophies that it was to be found in the rhymes of mr edward lear and in the literature of nonsense the dong with the luminous nose at least is original as the first ship and the first plough were original  it is true in a certain sense that some of the greatest writers the world has seenaristophanes rabelais and sternehave written nonsense but unless we are mistaken it is in a widely different sense the nonsense of these men was satiricthat is to say symbolic it was a kind of exuberant capering round a discovered truth there is all the difference in the world between the instinct of satire which seeing in the kaisers moustaches something typical of him draws them continually larger and larger and the instinct of nonsense which for no reason whatever imagines what those moustaches would look like on the present archbishop of canterbury if he grew them in a fit of absence of mind we incline to think that no age except our own could have understood that the quanglewangle meant absolutely nothing and the lands of the jumblies were absolutely nowhere we fancy that if the account of the knaves trial in alice in wonderland had been published in the seventeenth century it would have been bracketed with bunyans trial of faithful as a parody on the state prosecutions of the time we fancy that if the dong with the luminous nose had appeared in the same period everyone would have called it a dull satire on oliver cromwell  it is altogether advisedly that we quote chiefly from mr lears nonsense rhymes to our mind he is both chronologically and essentially the father of nonsense we think him superior to lewis carroll in one sense indeed lewis carroll has a great advantage we know what lewis carroll was in daily life he was a singularly serious and conventional don universally respected but very much of a pedant and something of a philistine thus his strange double life in earth and in dreamland emphasizes the idea that lies at the back of nonsensethe idea of escape of escape into a world where things are not fixed horribly in an eternal appropriateness where apples grow on peartrees and any odd man you meet may have three legs lewis carroll living one life in which he would have thundered morally against any one who walked on the wrong plot of grass and another life in which he would cheerfully call the sun green and the moon blue was by his very divided nature his one foot on both worlds a perfect type of the position of modern nonsense his wonderland is a country populated by insane mathematicians we feel the whole is an escape into a world of masquerade we feel that if we could pierce their disguises we might discover that humpty dumpty and the march hare were professors and doctors of divinity enjoying a mental holiday this sense of escape is certainly less emphatic in edward lear because of the completeness of his citizenship in the world of unreason we do not know his prosaic biography as we know lewis carrolls we accept him as a purely fabulous figure on his own description of himself    his body is perfectly spherical     he weareth a runcible hat  while lewis carrolls wonderland is purely intellectual lear introduces quite another elementthe element of the poetical and even emotional carroll works by the pure reason but this is not so strong a contrast for after all mankind in the main has always regarded reason as a bit of a joke lear introduces his unmeaning words and his amorphous creatures not with the pomp of reason but with the romantic prelude of rich hues and haunting rhythms    far and few far and few   are the lands where the jumblies live  is an entirely different type of poetry to that exhibited in jabberwocky carroll with a sense of mathematical neatness makes his whole poem a mosaic of new and mysterious words but edward lear with more subtle and placid effrontery is always introducing scraps of his own elvish dialect into the middle of simple and rational statements until we are almost stunned into admitting that we know what they mean there is a genial ring of commonsense about such lines as    for his aunt jobiska said every one knows   that a pobble is better without his toes  which is beyond the reach of carroll the poet seems so easy on the matter that we are almost driven to pretend that we see his meaning that we know the peculiar difficulties of a pobble that we are as old travellers in the gromboolian plain as he is  our claim that nonsense is a new literature we might almost say a new sense would be quite indefensible if nonsense were nothing more than a mere aesthetic fancy nothing sublimely artistic has ever arisen out of mere art any more than anything essentially reasonable has ever arisen out of the pure reason there must always be a rich moral soil for any great aesthetic growth the principle of art for arts sake is a very good principle if it means that there is a vital distinction between the earth and the tree that has its roots in the earth but it is a very bad principle if it means that the tree could grow just as well with its roots in the air every great literature has always been allegoricalallegorical of some view of the whole universe the iliad is only great because all life is a battle the odyssey because all life is a journey the book of job because all life is a riddle there is one attitude in which we think that all existence is summed up in the word ghosts another and somewhat better one in which we think it is summed up in the words a midsummer nights dream even the vulgarest melodrama or detective story can be good if it expresses something of the delight in sinister possibilitiesthe healthy lust for darkness and terror which may come on us any night in walking down a dark lane if therefore nonsense is really to be the literature of the future it must have its own version of the cosmos to offer the world must not only be the tragic romantic and religious it must be nonsensical also and here we fancy that nonsense will in a very unexpected way come to the aid of the spiritual view of things religion has for centuries been trying to make men exult in the wonders of creation but it has forgotten that a thing cannot be completely wonderful so long as it remains sensible so long as we regard a tree as an obvious thing naturally and reasonably created for a giraffe to eat we cannot properly wonder at it it is when we consider it as a prodigious wave of the living soil sprawling up to the skies for no reason in particular that we take off our hats to the astonishment of the parkkeeper everything has in fact another side to it like the moon the patroness of nonsense viewed from that other side a bird is a blossom broken loose from its chain of stalk a man a quadruped begging on its hind legs a house a gigantesque hat to cover a man from the sun a chair an apparatus of four wooden legs for a cripple with only two  this is the side of things which tends most truly to spiritual wonder it is significant that in the greatest religious poem existent the book of job the argument which convinces the infidel is not as has been represented by the merely rational religionism of the eighteenth century a picture of the ordered beneficence of the creation but on the contrary a picture of the huge and undecipherable unreason of it hast thou sent the rain upon the desert where no man is this simple sense of wonder at the shapes of things and at their exuberant independence of our intellectual standards and our trivial definitions is the basis of spirituality as it is the basis of nonsense nonsense and faith strange as the conjunction may seem are the two supreme symbolic assertions of the truth that to draw out the soul of things with a syllogism is as impossible as to draw out leviathan with a hook the wellmeaning person who by merely studying the logical side of things has decided that faith is nonsense does not know how truly he speaks later it may come back to him in the form that nonsense is faith                                        a defence of planets   a book has at one time come under my notice called terra firma the earth not a planet the author was a mr d wardlaw scott and he quoted very seriously the opinions of a large number of other persons of whom we have never heard but who are evidently very important mr beach of southsea for example thinks that the world is flat and in southsea perhaps it is it is no part of my present intention however to follow mr scotts arguments in detail on the lines of such arguments it may be shown that the earth is flat and for the matter of that that it is triangular a few examples will suffice  one of mr scotts objections was that if a projectile is fired from a moving body there is a difference in the distance to which it carries according to the direction in which it is sent but as in practice there is not the slightest difference whichever way the thing is done in the case of the earth we have a forcible overthrow of all fancies relative to the motion of the earth and a striking proof that the earth is not a globe  this is altogether one of the quaintest arguments we have ever seen it never seems to occur to the author among other things that when the firing and falling of the shot all take place upon the moving body there is nothing whatever to compare them with as a matter of fact of course a shot fired at an elephant does actually often travel towards the marksman but much slower than the marksman travels mr scott probably would not like to contemplate the fact that the elephant properly speaking swings round and hits the bullet to us it appears full of a rich cosmic humour  i will only give one other example of the astronomical proofs  if the earth were a globe the distance round the surface say at 45 degrees south latitude could not possibly be any greater than the same latitude north but since it is found by navigators to be twice the distanceto say the least of itor double the distance it ought to be according to the globular theory it is a proof that the earth is not a globe  this sort of thing reduces my mind to a pulp i can faintly resist when a man says that if the earth were a globe cats would not have four legs but when he says that if the earth were a globe cats would not have five legs i am crushed  but as i have indicated it is not in the scientific aspect of this remarkable theory that i am for the moment interested it is rather with the difference between the flat and the round worlds as conceptions in art and imagination that i am concerned it is a very remarkable thing that none of us are really copernicans in our actual outlook upon things we are convinced intellectually that we inhabit a small provincial planet but we do not feel in the least suburban men of science have quarrelled with the bible because it is not based upon the true astronomical system but it is certainly open to the orthodox to say that if it had been it would never have convinced anybody  if a single poem or a single story were really transfused with the copernican idea the thing would be a nightmare can we think of a solemn scene of mountain stillness in which some prophet is standing in a trance and then realize that the whole scene is whizzing round like a zoetrope at the rate of nineteen miles a second could we tolerate the notion of a mighty king delivering a sublime fiat and then remember that for all practical purposes he is hanging head downwards in space a strange fable might be written of a man who was blessed or cursed with the copernican eye and saw all men on the earth like tintacks clustering round a magnet it would be singular to imagine how very different the speech of an aggressive egoist announcing the independence and divinity of man would sound if he were seen hanging on to the planet by his boot soles  for despite mr wardlaw scotts horror at the newtonian astronomy and its contradiction of the bible the whole distinction is a good instance of the difference between letter and spirit the letter of the old testament is opposed to the conception of the solar system but the spirit has much kinship with it the writers of the book of genesis had no theory of gravitation which to the normal person will appear a fact of as much importance as that they had no umbrellas but the theory of gravitation has a curiously hebrew sentiment in ita sentiment of combined dependence and certainty a sense of grappling unity by which all things hang upon one thread thou hast hanged the world upon nothing said the author of the book of job and in that sentence wrote the whole appalling poetry of modern astronomy the sense of the preciousness and fragility of the universe the sense of being in the hollow of a hand is one which the round and rolling earth gives in its most thrilling form mr wardlaw scotts flat earth would be the true territory for a comfortable atheist nor would the old jews have any objection to being as much upside down as right way up they had no foolish ideas about the dignity of man  it would be an interesting speculation to imagine whether the world will ever develop a copernican poetry and a copernican habit of fancy whether we shall ever speak of early earthturn instead of early sunrise and speak indifferently of looking up at the daisies or looking down on the stars but if we ever do there are really a large number of big and fantastic facts awaiting us worthy to make a new mythology mr wardlaw scott for example with genuine if unconscious imagination says that according to astronomers the sea is a vast mountain of water miles high to have discovered that mountain of moving crystal in which the fishes build like birds is like discovering atlantis it is enough to make the old world young again in the new poetry which we contemplate athletic young men will set out sturdily to climb up the face of the sea if we once realize all this earth as it is we should find ourselves in a land of miracles we shall discover a new planet at the moment that we discover our own among all the strange things that men have forgotten the most universal and catastrophic lapse of memory is that by which they have forgotten that they are living on a star  in the early days of the world the discovery of a fact of natural history was immediately followed by the realization of it as a fact of poetry when man awoke from the long fit of absentmindedness which is called the automatic animal state and began to notice the queer facts that the sky was blue and the grass green he immediately began to use those facts symbolically blue the colour of the sky became a symbol of celestial holiness green passed into the language as indicating a freshness verging upon unintelligence if we had the good fortune to live in a world in which the sky was green and the grass blue the symbolism would have been different but for some mysterious reason this habit of realizing poetically the facts of science has ceased abruptly with scientific progress and all the confounding portents preached by galileo and newton have fallen on deaf ears they painted a picture of the universe compared with which the apocalypse with its falling stars was a mere idyll they declared that we are all careering through space clinging to a cannonball and the poets ignore the matter as if it were a remark about the weather they say that an invisible force holds us in our own armchairs while the earth hurtles like a boomerang and men still go back to dusty records to prove the mercy of god they tell us that mr scotts monstrous vision of a mountain of seawater rising in a solid dome like the glass mountain in the fairytale is actually a fact and men still go back to the fairytale to what towering heights of poetic imagery might we not have risen if only the poetizing of natural history had continued and mans fancy had played with the planets as naturally as it once played with the flowers we might have had a planetary patriotism in which the green leaf should be like a cockade and the sea an everlasting dance of drums we might have been proud of what our star has wrought and worn its heraldry haughtily in the blind tournament of the spheres all this indeed we may surely do yet for with all the multiplicity of knowledge there is one thing happily that no man knows whether the world is old or young                                        a defence of china shepherdesses   there are some things of which the world does not like to be reminded for they are the dead loves of the world one of these is that great enthusiasm for the arcadian life which however much it may now lie open to the sneers of realism did beyond all question hold sway for an enormous period of the worlds history from the times that we describe as ancient down to times that may fairly be called recent the conception of the innocent and hilarious life of shepherds and shepherdesses certainly covered and absorbed the time of theocritus of virgil of catullus of dante of cervantes of ariosto of shakespeare and of pope we are told that the gods of the heathen were stone and brass but stone and brass have never endured with the long endurance of the china shepherdess the catholic church and the ideal shepherd are indeed almost the only things that have bridged the abyss between the ancient world and the modern yet as we say the world does not like to be reminded of this boyish enthusiasm  but imagination the function of the historian cannot let so great an element alone by the cheap revolutionary it is commonly supposed that imagination is a merely rebellious thing that it has its chief function in devising new and fantastic republics but imagination has its highest use in a retrospective realization the trumpet of imagination like the trumpet of the resurrection calls the dead out of their graves imagination sees delphi with the eyes of a greek jerusalem with the eyes of a crusader paris with the eyes of a jacobin and arcadia with the eyes of a euphuist the prime function of imagination is to see our whole orderly system of life as a pile of stratified revolutions in spite of all revolutionaries it must be said that the function of imagination is not to make strange things settled so much as to make settled things strange not so much to make wonders facts as to make facts wonders to the imaginative the truisms are all paradoxes since they were paradoxes in the stone age to them the ordinary copybook blazes with blasphemy  let us then consider in this light the old pastoral or arcadian ideal but first certainly one thing must be definitely recognised this arcadian art and literature is a lost enthusiasm to study it is like fumbling in the loveletters of a dead man to us its flowers seem as tawdry as cockades the lambs that dance to the shepherds pipe seem to dance with all the artificiality of a ballet even our own prosaic toil seems to us more joyous than that holiday where its ancient exuberance passed the bounds of wisdom and even of virtue its caperings seem frozen into the stillness of an antique frieze in those gray old pictures a bacchanal seems as dull as an archdeacon their very sins seem colder than our restraints  all this may be frankly recognised all the barren sentimentality of the arcadian ideal and all its insolent optimism but when all is said and done something else remains  through ages in which the most arrogant and elaborate ideals of power and civilization held otherwise undisputed sway the ideal of the perfect and healthy peasant did undoubtedly represent in some shape or form the conception that there was a dignity in simplicity and a dignity in labour it was good for the ancient aristocrat even if he could not attain to innocence and the wisdom of the earth to believe that these things were the secrets of the priesthood of the poor it was good for him to believe that even if heaven was not above him heaven was below him it was well that he should have amid all his flamboyant triumphs the neverextinguished sentiment that there was something better than his triumphs the conception that there remaineth a rest  the conception of the ideal shepherd seems absurd to our modern ideas but after all it was perhaps the only trade of the democracy which was equalized with the trades of the aristocracy even by the aristocracy itself the shepherd of pastoral poetry was without doubt very different from the shepherd of actual fact where one innocently piped to his lambs the other innocently swore at them and their divergence in intellect and personal cleanliness was immense but the difference between the ideal shepherd who danced with amaryllis and the real shepherd who thrashed her is not a scrap greater than the difference between the ideal soldier who dies to capture the colours and the real soldier who lives to clean his accoutrements between the ideal priest who is everlastingly by someones bed and the real priest who is as glad as anyone else to get to his own there are ideal conceptions and real men in every calling yet there are few who object to the ideal conceptions and not many after all who object to the real men  the fact then is this so far from resenting the existence in art and literature of an ideal shepherd i genuinely regret that the shepherd is the only democratic calling that has ever been raised to the level of the heroic callings conceived by an aristocratic age so far from objecting to the ideal shepherd i wish there were an ideal postman an ideal grocer and an ideal plumber it is undoubtedly true that we should laugh at the idea of an ideal postman it is true and it proves that we are not genuine democrats  undoubtedly the modern grocer if called upon to act in an arcadian manner if desired to oblige with a symbolic dance expressive of the delights of grocery or to perform on some simple instrument while his assistants skipped around him would be embarrassed and perhaps even reluctant but it may be questioned whether this temporary reluctance of the grocer is a good thing or evidence of a good condition of poetic feeling in the grocery business as a whole there certainly should be an ideal image of health and happiness in any trade and its remoteness from the reality is not the only important question no one supposes that the mass of traditional conceptions of duty and glory are always operative for example in the mind of a soldier or a doctor that the battle of waterloo actually makes a private enjoy pipeclaying his trousers or that the health of humanity softens the momentary phraseology of a physician called out of bed at two oclock in the morning but although no ideal obliterates the ugly drudgery and detail of any calling that ideal does in the case of the soldier or the doctor exist definitely in the background and makes that drudgery worth while as a whole it is a serious calamity that no such ideal exists in the case of the vast number of honourable trades and crafts on which the existence of a modern city depends it is a pity that current thought and sentiment offer nothing corresponding to the old conception of patron saints if they did there would be a patron saint of plumbers and this would alone be a revolution for it would force the individual craftsman to believe that there was once a perfect being who did actually plumb  when all is said and done then we think it much open to question whether the world has not lost something in the complete disappearance of the ideal of the happy peasant it is foolish enough to suppose that the rustic went about all over ribbons but it is better than knowing that he goes about all over rags and being indifferent to the fact the modern realistic study of the poor does in reality lead the student further astray than the old idyllic notion for we cannot get the chiaroscuro of humble life so long as its virtues seem to us as gross as its vices and its joys as sullen as its sorrows probably at the very moment that we can see nothing but a dullfaced man smoking and drinking heavily with his friend in a pothouse the man himself is on his souls holiday crowned with the flowers of a passionate idleness and far more like the happy peasant than the world will ever know                                        a defence of useful information   it is natural and proper enough that the masses of explosive ammunition stored up in detective stories and the replete and solid sweetstuff shops which are called sentimental novelettes should be popular with the ordinary customer it is not difficult to realize that all of us ignorant or cultivated are primarily interested in murder and lovemaking the really extraordinary thing is that the most appalling fictions are not actually so popular as that literature which deals with the most undisputed and depressing facts men are not apparently so interested in murder and lovemaking as they are in the number of different forms of latchkey which exist in london or the time that it would take a grasshopper to jump from cairo to the cape the enormous mass of fatuous and useless truth which fills the most widelycirculated papers such as titbits science siftings and many of the illustrated magazines is certainly one of the most extraordinary kinds of emotional and mental pabulum on which man ever fed it is almost incredible that these preposterous statistics should actually be more popular than the most bloodcurdling mysteries and the most luxurious debauches of sentiment to imagine it is like imagining the humorous passages in bradshaws railway guide read aloud on winter evenings it is like conceiving a man unable to put down an advertisement of mother seigels syrup because he wished to know what eventually happened to the young man who was extremely ill at edinburgh in the case of cheap detective stories and cheap novelettes we can most of us feel whatever our degree of education that it might be possible to read them if we gave full indulgence to a lower and more facile part of our natures at the worst we feel that we might enjoy them as we might enjoy bullbaiting or getting drunk but the literature of information is absolutely mysterious to us we can no more think of amusing ourselves with it than of reading whole pages of a surbiton local directory to read such things would not be a piece of vulgar indulgence it would be a highly arduous and meritorious enterprise it is this fact which constitutes a profound and almost unfathomable interest in this particular branch of popular literature  primarily at least there is one rather peculiar thing which must in justice be said about it the readers of this strange science must be allowed to be upon the whole as disinterested as a prophet seeing visions or a child reading fairytales here again we find as we so often do that whatever view of this matter of popular literature we can trust we can trust least of all the comment and censure current among the vulgar educated the ordinary version of the ground of this popularity for information which would be given by a person of greater cultivation would be that common men are chiefly interested in those sordid facts that surround them on every side a very small degree of examination will show us that whatever ground there is for the popularity of these insane encyclopaedias it cannot be the ground of utility the version of life given by a penny novelette may be very moonstruck and unreliable but it is at least more likely to contain facts relevant to daily life than compilations on the subject of the number of cows tails that would reach the north pole there are many more people who are in love than there are people who have any intention of counting or collecting cows tails it is evident to me that the grounds of this widespread madness of information for informations sake must be sought in other and deeper parts of human nature than those daily needs which lie so near the surface that even social philosophers have discovered them somewhere in that profound and eternal instinct for enthusiasm and minding other peoples business which made great popular movements like the crusades or the gordon riots  i once had the pleasure of knowing a man who actually talked in private life after the manner of these papers his conversation consisted of fragmentary statements about height and weight and depth and time and population and his conversation was a nightmare of dulness during the shortest pause he would ask whether his interlocutors were aware how many tons of rust were scraped every year off the menai bridge and how many rival shops mr whiteley had bought up since he opened his business the attitude of his acquaintances towards this inexhaustible entertainer varied according to his presence or absence between indifference and terror it was frightful to think of a mans brain being stocked with such inexpressibly profitless treasures it was like visiting some imposing british museum and finding its galleries and glass cases filled with specimens of london mud of common mortar of broken walkingsticks and cheap tobacco years afterwards i discovered that this intolerable prosaic bore had been in fact a poet i learnt that every item of this multitudinous information was totally and unblushingly untrue that for all i knew he had made it up as he went along that no tons of rust are scraped off the menai bridge and that the rival tradesmen and mr whiteley were creatures of the poets brain instantly i conceived consuming respect for the man who was so circumstantial so monotonous so entirely purposeless a liar with him it must have been a case of art for arts sake the joke sustained so gravely through a respected lifetime was of that order of joke which is shared with omniscience but what struck me more cogently upon reflection was the fact that these immeasurable trivialities which had struck me as utterly vulgar and arid when i thought they were true immediately became picturesque and almost brilliant when i thought they were inventions of the human fancy and here as it seems to me i laid my finger upon a fundamental quality of the cultivated class which prevents it and will perhaps always prevent it from seeing with the eyes of popular imagination the merely educated can scarcely ever be brought to believe that this world is itself an interesting place when they look at a work of art good or bad they expect to be interested but when they look at a newspaper advertisement or a group in the street they do not properly and literally speaking expect to be interested but to common and simple people this world is a work of art though it is like many great works of art anonymous they look to life for interest with the same kind of cheerful and uneradicable assurance with which we look for interest at a comedy for which we have paid money at the door to the eyes of the ultimate school of contemporary fastidiousness the universe is indeed an illdrawn and overcoloured picture the scrawlings in circles of a baby upon the slate of night its starry skies are a vulgar pattern which they would not have for a wallpaper its flowers and fruits have a cockney brilliancy like the holiday hat of a flowergirl hence degraded by art to its own level they have lost altogether that primitive and typical taste of manthe taste for news by this essential taste for news i mean the pleasure in hearing the mere fact that a man has died at the age of 110 in south wales or that the horses ran away at a funeral in san francisco large masses of the early faiths and politics of the world numbers of the miracles and heroic anecdotes are based primarily upon this love of something that has just happened this divine institution of gossip when christianity was named the good news it spread rapidly not only because it was good but also because it was news so it is that if any of us have ever spoken to a navvy in a train about the daily paper we have generally found the navvy interested not in those struggles of parliaments and trades unions which sometimes are and are always supposed to be for his benefit but in the fact that an unusually large whale has been washed up on the coast of orkney or that some leading millionaire like mr harmsworth is reported to break a hundred pipes a year the educated classes cloyed and demoralized with the mere indulgence of art and mood can no longer understand the idle and splendid disinterestedness of the reader of pearsons weekly he still keeps something of that feeling which should be the birthright of menthe feeling that this planet is like a new house into which we have just moved our baggage any detail of it has a value and with a truly sportsmanlike instinct the average man takes most pleasure in the details which are most complicated irrelevant and at once difficult and useless to discover those parts of the newspaper which announce the giant gooseberry and the raining frogs are really the modern representatives of the popular tendency which produced the hydra and the werewolf and the dogheaded men folk in the middle ages were not interested in a dragon or a glimpse of the devil because they thought that it was a beautiful prose idyll but because they thought that it had really just been seen it was not like so much artistic literature a refuge indicating the dulness of the world it was an incident pointedly illustrating the fecund poetry of the world  that much can be said and is said against the literature of information i do not for a moment deny it is shapeless it is trivial it may give an unreal air of knowledge it unquestionably lies along with the rest of popular literature under the general indictment that it may spoil the chance of better work certainly by wasting time possibly by ruining taste but these obvious objections are the objections which we hear so persistently from everyone that one cannot help wondering where the papers in question procure their myriads of readers the natural necessity and natural good underlying such crude institutions is far less often a subject of speculation yet the healthy hungers which lie at the back of the habits of modern democracy are surely worthy of the same sympathetic study that we give to the dogmas of the fanatics long dethroned and the intrigues of commonwealths long obliterated from the earth and this is the base and consideration which i have to offer that perhaps the taste for shreds and patches of journalistic science and history is not as is continually asserted the vulgar and senile curiosity of a people that has grown old but simply the babyish and indiscriminate curiosity of a people still young and entering history for the first time in other words i suggest that they only tell each other in magazines the same kind of stories of commonplace portents and conventional eccentricities which in any case they would tell each other in taverns science itself is only the exaggeration and specialization of this thirst for useless fact which is the mark of the youth of man but science has become strangely separated from the mere news and scandal of flowers and birds men have ceased to see that a pterodactyl was as fresh and natural as a flower that a flower is as monstrous as a pterodactyl the rebuilding of this bridge between science and human nature is one of the greatest needs of mankind we have all to show that before we go on to any visions or creations we can be contented with a planet of miracles                                        a defence of heraldry   the modern view of heraldry is pretty accurately represented by the words of the famous barrister who after crossexamining for some time a venerable dignitary of heralds college summed up his results in the remark that the silly old man didnt even understand his own silly old trade  heraldry properly so called was of course a wholly limited and aristocratic thing but the remark needs a kind of qualification not commonly realized in a sense there was a plebeian heraldry since every shop was like every castle distinguished not by a name but a sign the whole system dates from a time when picturewriting still really ruled the world in those days few could read or write they signed their names with a pictorial symbol a crossand a cross is a great improvement on most mens names  now there is something to be said for the peculiar influence of pictorial symbols on mens minds all letters we learn were originally pictorial and heraldic thus the letter a is the portrait of an ox but the portrait is now reproduced in so impressionist a manner that but little of the rural atmosphere can be absorbed by contemplating it but as long as some pictorial and poetic quality remains in the symbol the constant use of it must do something for the aesthetic education of those employing it publichouses are now almost the only shops that use the ancient signs and the mysterious attraction which they exercise may be by the optimistic explained in this manner there are taverns with names so dreamlike and exquisite that even sir wilfrid lawson might waver on the threshold for a moment suffering the poet to struggle with the moralist so it was with the heraldic images it is impossible to believe that the red lion of scotland acted upon those employing it merely as a naked convenience like a number or a letter it is impossible to believe that the kings of scotland would have cheerfully accepted the substitute of a pig or a frog there are as we say certain real advantages in pictorial symbols and one of them is that everything that is pictorial suggests without naming or defining there is a road from the eye to the heart that does not go through the intellect men do not quarrel about the meaning of sunsets they never dispute that the hawthorn says the best and wittiest thing about the spring  thus in the old aristocratic days there existed this vast pictorial symbolism of all the colours and degrees of aristocracy when the great trumpet of equality was blown almost immediately afterwards was made one of the greatest blunders in the history of mankind for all this pride and vivacity all these towering symbols and flamboyant colours should have been extended to mankind the tobacconist should have had a crest and the cheesemonger a warcry the grocer who sold margarine as butter should have felt that there was a stain on the escutcheon of the higginses instead of doing this the democrats made the appalling mistakea mistake at the root of the whole modern maladyof decreasing the human magnificence of the past instead of increasing it they did not say as they should have done to the common citizen you are as good as the duke of norfolk but used that meaner democratic formula the duke of norfolk is no better than you are  for it cannot be denied that the world lost something finally and most unfortunately about the beginning of the nineteenth century in former times the mass of the people was conceived as mean and commonplace but only as comparatively mean and commonplace they were dwarfed and eclipsed by certain high stations and splendid callings but with the victorian era came a principle which conceived men not as comparatively but as positively mean and commonplace a man of any station was represented as being by nature a dingy and trivial persona person born as it were in a black hat it began to be thought that it was ridiculous for a man to wear beautiful garments instead of it beingas of course it isridiculous for him to deliberately wear ugly ones it was considered affected for a man to speak bold and heroic words whereas of course it is emotional speech which is natural and ordinary civil speech which is affected the whole relations of beauty and ugliness of dignity and ignominy were turned upside down beauty became an extravagance as if tophats and umbrellas were not the real extravagancea landscape from the land of the goblins dignity became a form of foolery and shamelessness as if the very essence of a fool were not a lack of dignity and the consequence is that it is practically most difficult to propose any decoration or public dignity for modern men without making them laugh they laugh at the idea of carrying crests and coatsofarms instead of laughing at their own boots and neckties we are forbidden to say that tradesmen should have a poetry of their own although there is nothing so poetical as trade a grocer should have a coatofarms worthy of his strange merchandise gathered from distant and fantastic lands a postman should have a coatofarms capable of expressing the strange honour and responsibility of the man who carries mens souls in a bag the chemist should have a coatofarms symbolizing something of the mysteries of the house of healing the cavern of a merciful witchcraft  there were in the french revolution a class of people at whom everybody laughed and at whom it was probably difficult as a practical matter to refrain from laughing they attempted to erect by means of huge wooden statues and brandnew festivals the most extraordinary new religions they adored the goddess of reason who would appear even when the fullest allowance has been made for their many virtues to be the deity who had least smiled upon them but these capering maniacs disowned alike by the old world and the new were men who had seen a great truth unknown alike to the new world and the old they had seen the thing that was hidden from the wise and understanding from the whole modern democratic civilization down to the present time they realized that democracy must have a heraldry that it must have a proud and highcoloured pageantry if it is to keep always before its own mind its own sublime mission unfortunately for this ideal the world has in this matter followed english democracy rather than french and those who look back to the nineteenth century will assuredly look back to it as we look back to the reign of the puritans as the time of black coats and black tempers from the strange life the men of that time led they might be assisting at the funeral of liberty instead of at its christening the moment we really believe in democracy it will begin to blossom as aristocracy blossomed into symbolic colours and shapes we shall never make anything of democracy until we make fools of ourselves for if a man really cannot make a fool of himself we may be quite certain that the effort is superfluous                                        a defence of ugly things   there are some people who state that the exterior sex or physique of another person is indifferent to them that they care only for the communion of mind with mind but these people need not detain us there are some statements that no one ever thinks of believing however often they are made  but while nothing in this world would persuade us that a great friend of mr forbes robertson let us say would experience no surprise or discomfort at seeing him enter the room in the bodily form of mr chaplin there is a confusion constantly made between being attracted by exterior which is natural and universal and being attracted by what is called physical beauty which is not entirely natural and not in the least universal or rather to speak more strictly the conception of physical beauty has been narrowed to mean a certain kind of physical beauty which no more exhausts the possibilities of external attractiveness than the respectability of a clapham builder exhausts the possibilities of moral attractiveness  the tyrants and deceivers of mankind in this matter have been the greeks all their splendid work for civilization ought not to have wholly blinded us to the fact of their great and terrible sin against the variety of life it is a remarkable fact that while the jews have long ago been rebelled against and accused of blighting the world with a stringent and onesided ethical standard nobody has noticed that the greeks have committed us to an infinitely more horrible asceticisman asceticism of the fancy a worship of one aesthetic type alone jewish severity had at least commonsense as its basis it recognised that men lived in a world of fact and that if a man married within the degrees of blood certain consequences might follow but they did not starve their instinct for contrasts and combinations their prophets gave two wings to the ox and any number of eyes to the cherubim with all the riotous ingenuity of lewis carroll but the greeks carried their police regulation into elfland they vetoed not the actual adulteries of the earth but the wild weddings of ideas and forbade the banns of thought  it is extraordinary to watch the gradual emasculation of the monsters of greek myth under the pestilent influence of the apollo belvedere the chimaera was a creature of whom any healthyminded people would have been proud but when we see it in greek pictures we feel inclined to tie a ribbon round its neck and give it a saucer of milk who ever feels that the giants in greek art and poetry were really bigbig as some folklore giants have been in some scandinavian story a hero walks for miles along a mountain ridge which eventually turns out to be the bridge of the giants nose that is what we should call with a calm conscience a large giant but this earthquake fancy terrified the greeks and their terror has terrified all mankind out of their natural love of size vitality variety energy ugliness nature intended every human face so long as it was forcible individual and expressive to be regarded as distinct from all others as a poplar is distinct from an oak and an appletree from a willow but what the dutch gardeners did for trees the greeks did for the human form they lopped away its living and sprawling features to give it a certain academic shape they hacked off noses and pared down chins with a ghastly horticultural calm and they have really succeeded so far as to make us call some of the most powerful and endearing faces ugly and some of the most silly and repulsive faces beautiful this disgraceful via media this pitiful sense of dignity has bitten far deeper into the soul of modern civilization than the external and practical puritanism of israel the jew at the worst told a man to dance in fetters the greek put an exquisite vase upon his head and told him not to move  scripture says that one star differeth from another in glory and the same conception applies to noses to insist that one type of face is ugly because it differs from that of the venus of milo is to look at it entirely in a misleading light it is strange that we should resent people differing from ourselves we should resent much more violently their resembling ourselves this principle has made a sufficient hash of literary criticism in which it is always the custom to complain of the lack of sound logic in a fairy tale and the entire absence of true oratorical power in a threeact farce but to call another mans face ugly because it powerfully expresses another mans soul is like complaining that a cabbage has not two legs if we did so the only course for the cabbage would be to point out with severity but with some show of truth that we were not a beautiful green all over  but this frigid theory of the beautiful has not succeeded in conquering the art of the world except in name in some quarters indeed it has never held sway a glance at chinese dragons or japanese gods will show how independent are orientals of the conventional idea of facial and bodily regularity and how keen and fiery is their enjoyment of real beauty of goggle eyes of sprawling claws of gaping mouths and writhing coils in the middle ages men broke away from the greek standard of beauty and lifted up in adoration to heaven great towers which seemed alive with dancing apes and devils in the full summer of technical artistic perfection the revolt was carried to its real consummation in the study of the faces of men rembrandt declared the sane and manly gospel that a man was dignified not when he was like a greek god but when he had a strong square nose like a cudgel a boldlyblocked head like a helmet and a jaw like a steel trap  this branch of art is commonly dismissed as the grotesque we have never been able to understand why it should be humiliating to be laughable since it is giving an elevated artistic pleasure to others if a gentleman who saw us in the street were suddenly to burst into tears at the mere thought of our existence it might be considered disquieting and uncomplimentary but laughter is not uncomplimentary in truth however the phrase grotesque is a misleading description of ugliness in art it does not follow that either the chinese dragons or the gothic gargoyles or the goblinish old women of rembrandt were in the least intended to be comic their extravagance was not the extravagance of satire but simply the extravagance of vitality and here lies the whole key of the place of ugliness in aesthetics we like to see a crag jut out in shameless decision from the cliff we like to see the red pines stand up hardily upon a high cliff we like to see a chasm cloven from end to end of a mountain with equally noble enthusiasm we like to see a nose jut out decisively we like to see the red hair of a friend stand up hardily in bristles upon his head we like to see his mouth broad and clean cut like the mountain crevasse at least some of us like all this it is not a question of humour we do not burst with amusement at the first sight of the pines or the chasm but we like them because they are expressive of the dramatic stillness of nature her bold experiments her definite departures her fearlessness and savage pride in her children the moment we have snapped the spell of conventional beauty there are a million beautiful faces waiting for us everywhere just as there are a million beautiful spirits                                         a defence of farce   i have never been able to understand why certain forms of art should be marked off as something debased and trivial a comedy is spoken of as degenerating into farce it would be fair criticism to speak of it changing into farce but as for degenerating into farce we might equally reasonably speak of it as degenerating into tragedy again a story is spoken of as melodramatic and the phrase queerly enough is not meant as a compliment to speak of something as pantomimic or sensational is innocently supposed to be biting heaven knows why for all works of art are sensations and a good pantomime now extinct is one of the pleasantest sensations of all this stuff is fit for a detective story is often said as who should say this stuff is fit for an epic  whatever may be the rights and wrongs of this mode of classification there can be no doubt about one most practical and disastrous effect of it these lighter or wilder forms of art having no standard set up for them no gust of generous artistic pride to lift them up do actually tend to become as bad as they are supposed to be neglected children of the great mother they grow up in darkness dirty and unlettered and when they are right they are right almost by accident because of the blood in their veins the common detective story of mystery and murder seems to the intelligent reader to be little except a strange glimpse of a planet peopled by congenital idiots who cannot find the end of their own noses or the character of their own wives the common pantomime seems like some horrible satiric picture of a world without cause or effect a mass of jarring atoms a prolonged mental torture of irrelevancy the ordinary farce seems a world of almost piteous vulgarity where a halfwitted and stunted creature is afraid when his wife comes home and amused when she sits down on the doorstep all this is in a sense true but it is the fault of nothing in heaven or earth except the attitude and the phrases quoted at the beginning of this article we have no doubt in the world that if the other forms of art had been equally despised they would have been equally despicable if people had spoken of sonnets with the same accent with which they speak of musichall songs a sonnet would have been a thing so fearful and wonderful that we almost regret we cannot have a specimen a rowdy sonnet is a thing to dream about if people had said that epics were only fit for children and nursemaids paradise lost might have been an average pantomime it might have been called harlequin satan or how adam ad em for who would trouble to bring to perfection a work in which even perfection is grotesque why should shakespeare write othello if even his triumph consisted in the eulogy mr shakespeare is fit for something better than writing tragedies  the case of farce and its wilder embodiment in harlequinade is especially important that these high and legitimate forms of art glorified by aristophanes and molière have sunk into such contempt may be due to many causes i myself have little doubt that it is due to the astonishing and ludicrous lack of belief in hope and hilarity which marks modern aesthetics to such an extent that it has spread even to the revolutionists once the hopeful section of men so that even those who ask us to fling the stars into the sea are not quite sure that they will be any better there than they were before every form of literary art must be a symbol of some phase of the human spirit but whereas the phase is in human life sufficiently convincing in itself in art it must have a certain pungency and neatness of form to compensate for its lack of reality thus any set of young people round a teatable may have all the comedy emotions of much ado about nothing or northanger abbey but if their actual conversation were reported it would possibly not be a worthy addition to literature an old man sitting by his fire may have all the desolate grandeur of lear or père goriot but if he comes into literature he must do something besides sit by the fire the artistic justification then of farce and pantomime must consist in the emotions of life which correspond to them and these emotions are to an incredible extent crushed out by the modern insistence on the painful side of life only pain it is said is the dominant element of life but this is true only in a very special sense if pain were for one single instant literally the dominant element in life every man would be found hanging dead from his own bedpost by the morning pain as the black and catastrophic thing attracts the youthful artist just as the schoolboy draws devils and skeletons and men hanging but joy is a far more elusive and elvish matter since it is our reason for existing and a very feminine reason it mingles with every breath we draw and every cup of tea we drink the literature of joy is infinitely more difficult more rare and more triumphant than the black and white literature of pain and of all the varied forms of the literature of joy the form most truly worthy of moral reverence and artistic ambition is the form called farceor its wilder shape in pantomime to the quietest human being seated in the quietest house there will sometimes come a sudden and unmeaning hunger for the possibilities or impossibilities of things he will abruptly wonder whether the teapot may not suddenly begin to pour out honey or seawater the clock to point to all hours of the day at once the candle to burn green or crimson the door to open upon a lake or a potatofield instead of a london street upon anyone who feels this nameless anarchism there rests for the time being the abiding spirit of pantomime of the clown who cuts the policeman in two it may be said with no darker meaning that he realizes one of our visions and it may be noted here that this internal quality in pantomime is perfectly symbolized and preserved by that commonplace or cockney landscape and architecture which characterizes pantomime and farce if the whole affair happened in some alien atmosphere if a peartree began to grow apples or a river to run with wine in some strange fairyland the effect would be quite different the streets and shops and doorknockers of the harlequinade which to the vulgar aesthete make it seem commonplace are in truth the very essence of the aesthetic departure it must be an actual modern door which opens and shuts constantly disclosing different interiors it must be a real baker whose loaves fly up into the air without his touching them or else the whole internal excitement of this elvish invasion of civilization this abrupt entrance of puck into pimlico is lost some day perhaps when the present narrow phase of aesthetics has ceased to monopolize the name the glory of a farcical art may become fashionable long after men have ceased to drape their houses in green and gray and to adorn them with japanese vases an aesthete may build a house on pantomime principles in which all the doors shall have their bells and knockers on the inside all the staircases be constructed to vanish on the pressing of a button and all the dinners humorous dinners in themselves come up cooked through a trapdoor we are very sure at least that it is as reasonable to regulate ones life and lodgings by this kind of art as by any other  the whole of this view of farce and pantomime may seem insane to us but we fear that it is we who are insane nothing in this strange age of transition is so depressing as its merriment all the most brilliant men of the day when they set about the writing of comic literature do it under one destructive fallacy and disadvantage the notion that comic literature is in some sort of way superficial they give us little knickknacks of the brittleness of which they positively boast although two thousand years have beaten as vainly upon the follies of the frogs as on the wisdom of the republic it is all a mean shame of joy when we come out from a performance of the midsummer nights dream we feel as near to the stars as when we come out from king lear for the joy of these works is older than sorrow their extravagance is saner than wisdom their love is stronger than death  the old masters of a healthy madness aristophanes or rabelais or shakespeare doubtless had many brushes with the precisians or ascetics of their day but we cannot but feel that for honest severity and consistent selfmaceration they would always have had respect but what abysses of scorn inconceivable to any modern would they have reserved for an aesthetic type and movement which violated morality and did not even find pleasure which outraged sanity and could not attain to exuberance which contented itself with the fools cap without the bells                                        a defence of humility   the act of defending any of the cardinal virtues has today all the exhilaration of a vice moral truisms have been so much disputed that they have begun to sparkle like so many brilliant paradoxes and especially in this age of egoistic idealism there is about one who defends humility something inexpressibly rakish  it is no part of my intention to defend humility on practical grounds practical grounds are uninteresting and moreover on practical grounds the case for humility is overwhelming we all know that the divine glory of the ego is socially a great nuisance we all do actually value our friends for modesty freshness and simplicity of heart whatever may be the reason we all do warmly respect humilityin other people  but the matter must go deeper than this if the grounds of humility are found only in social convenience they may be quite trivial and temporary the egoists may be the martyrs of a nobler dispensation agonizing for a more arduous ideal to judge from the comparative lack of ease in their social manner this seems a reasonable suggestion  there is one thing that must be seen at the outset of the study of humility from an intrinsic and eternal point of view the new philosophy of selfesteem and selfassertion declares that humility is a vice if it be so it is quite clear that it is one of those vices which are an integral part of original sin it follows with the precision of clockwork every one of the great joys of life no one for example was ever in love without indulging in a positive debauch of humility all fullblooded and natural people such as schoolboys enjoy humility the moment they attain heroworship humility again is said both by its upholders and opponents to be the peculiar growth of christianity the real and obvious reason of this is often missed the pagans insisted upon selfassertion because it was the essence of their creed that the gods though strong and just were mystic capricious and even indifferent but the essence of christianity was in a literal sense the new testamenta covenant with god which opened to men a clear deliverance they thought themselves secure they claimed palaces of pearl and silver under the oath and seal of the omnipotent they believed themselves rich with an irrevocable benediction which set them above the stars and immediately they discovered humility it was only another example of the same immutable paradox it is always the secure who are humble  this particular instance survives in the evangelical revivalists of the street they are irritating enough but no one who has really studied them can deny that the irritation is occasioned by these two things an irritating hilarity and an irritating humility this combination of joy and selfprostration is a great deal too universal to be ignored if humility has been discredited as a virtue at the present day it is not wholly irrelevant to remark that this discredit has arisen at the same time as a great collapse of joy in current literature and philosophy men have revived the splendour of greek selfassertion at the same time that they have revived the bitterness of greek pessimism a literature has arisen which commands us all to arrogate to ourselves the liberty of selfsufficing deities at the same time that it exhibits us to ourselves as dingy maniacs who ought to be chained up like dogs it is certainly a curious state of things altogether when we are genuinely happy we think we are unworthy of happiness but when we are demanding a divine emancipation we seem to be perfectly certain that we are unworthy of anything  the only explanation of the matter must be found in the conviction that humility has infinitely deeper roots than any modern men suppose that it is a metaphysical and one might almost say a mathematical virtue probably this can best be tested by a study of those who frankly disregard humility and assert the supreme duty of perfecting and expressing ones self these people tend by a perfectly natural process to bring their own great human gifts of culture intellect or moral power to a great perfection successively shutting out everything that they feel to be lower than themselves now shutting out things is all very well but it has one simple corollarythat from everything that we shut out we are ourselves shut out when we shut our door on the wind it would be equally true to say that the wind shuts its door on us whatever virtues a triumphant egoism really leads to no one can reasonably pretend that it leads to knowledge turning a beggar from the door may be right enough but pretending to know all the stories the beggar might have narrated is pure nonsense and this is practically the claim of the egoism which thinks that selfassertion can obtain knowledge a beetle may or may not be inferior to a manthe matter awaits demonstration but if he were inferior by ten thousand fathoms the fact remains that there is probably a beetle view of things of which a man is entirely ignorant if he wishes to conceive that point of view he will scarcely reach it by persistently revelling in the fact that he is not a beetle the most brilliant exponent of the egoistic school nietszche with deadly and honourable logic admitted that the philosophy of selfsatisfaction led to looking down upon the weak the cowardly and the ignorant looking down on things may be a delightful experience only there is nothing from a mountain to a cabbage that is really seen when it is seen from a balloon the philosopher of the ego sees everything no doubt from a high and rarified heaven only he sees everything foreshortened or deformed  now if we imagine that a man wished truly as far as possible to see everything as it was he would certainly proceed on a different principle he would seek to divest himself for a time of those personal peculiarities which tend to divide him from the thing he studies it is as difficult for example for a man to examine a fish without developing a certain vanity in possessing a pair of legs as if they were the latest article of personal adornment but if a fish is to be approximately understood this physiological dandyism must be overcome the earnest student of fish morality will spiritually speaking chop off his legs and similarly the student of birds will eliminate his arms the froglover will with one stroke of the imagination remove all his teeth and the spirit wishing to enter into all the hopes and fears of jellyfish will simplify his personal appearance to a really alarming extent it would appear therefore that this great body of ours and all its natural instincts of which we are proud and justly proud is rather an encumbrance at the moment when we attempt to appreciate things as they should be appreciated we do actually go through a process of mental asceticism a castration of the entire being when we wish to feel the abounding good in all things it is good for us at certain times that ourselves should be like a mere windowas clear as luminous and as invisible  in a very entertaining work over which we have roared in childhood it is stated that a point has no parts and no magnitude humility is the luxurious art of reducing ourselves to a point not to a small thing or a large one but to a thing with no size at all so that to it all the cosmic things are what they really areof immeasurable stature that the trees are high and the grasses short is a mere accident of our own footrules and our own stature but to the spirit which has stripped off for a moment its own idle temporal standards the grass is an everlasting forest with dragons for denizens the stones of the road are as incredible mountains piled one upon the other the dandelions are like gigantic bonfires illuminating the lands around and the heathbells on their stalks are like planets hung in heaven each higher than the other between one stake of a paling and another there are new and terrible landscapes here a desert with nothing but one misshapen rock here a miraculous forest of which all the trees flower above the head with the hues of sunset here again a sea full of monsters that dante would not have dared to dream these are the visions of him who like the child in the fairy tales is not afraid to become small meanwhile the sage whose faith is in magnitude and ambition is like a giant becoming larger and larger which only means that the stars are becoming smaller and smaller world after world falls from him into insignificance the whole passionate and intricate life of common things becomes as lost to him as is the life of the infusoria to a man without a microscope he rises always through desolate eternities he may find new systems and forget them he may discover fresh universes and learn to despise them but the towering and tropical vision of things as they really arethe gigantic daisies the heavenconsuming dandelions the great odyssey of strangecoloured oceans and strangeshaped trees of dust like the wreck of temples and thistledown like the ruin of starsall this colossal vision shall perish with the last of the humble                                        a defence of slang   the aristocrats of the nineteenth century have destroyed entirely their one solitary utility it is their business to be flaunting and arrogant but they flaunt unobtrusively and their attempts at arrogance are depressing their chief duty hitherto has been the development of variety vivacity and fulness of life oligarchy was the worlds first experiment in liberty but now they have adopted the opposite ideal of good form which may be defined as puritanism without religion good form has sent them all into black like the stroke of a funeral bell they engage like mr gilberts curates in a war of mildness a positive competition of obscurity in old times the lords of the earth sought above all things to be distinguished from each other with that object they erected outrageous images on their helmets and painted preposterous colours on their shields they wished to make it entirely clear that a norfolk was as different say from an argyll as a white lion from a black pig but today their ideal is precisely the opposite one and if a norfolk and an argyll were dressed so much alike that they were mistaken for each other they would both go home dancing with joy  the consequences of this are inevitable the aristocracy must lose their function of standing to the world for the idea of variety experiment and colour and we must find these things in some other class to ask whether we shall find them in the middle class would be to jest upon sacred matters the only conclusion therefore is that it is to certain sections of the lower class chiefly for example to omnibusconductors with their rich and rococo mode of thought that we must look for guidance towards liberty and light  the one stream of poetry which is continually flowing is slang every day a nameless poet weaves some fairy tracery of popular language it may be said that the fashionable world talks slang as much as the democratic this is true and it strongly supports the view under consideration nothing is more startling than the contrast between the heavy formal lifeless slang of the manabouttown and the light living and flexible slang of the coster the talk of the upper strata of the educated classes is about the most shapeless aimless and hopeless literary product that the world has ever seen clearly in this again the upper classes have degenerated we have ample evidence that the old leaders of feudal war could speak on occasion with a certain natural symbolism and eloquence that they had not gained from books when cyrano de bergerac in rostands play throws doubts on the reality of christians dulness and lack of culture the latter replies    bah on trouve des mots quand on monte à lassaut   oui jai un certain esprit facile et militaire  and these two lines sum up a truth about the old oligarchs they could not write three legible letters but they could sometimes speak literature douglas when he hurled the heart of bruce in front of him in his last battle cried out pass first great heart as thou wert ever wont a spanish nobleman when commanded by the king to receive a highplaced and notorious traitor said i will receive him in all obedience and burn down my house afterwards this is literature without culture it is the speech of men convinced that they have to assert proudly the poetry of life  anyone however who should seek for such pearls in the conversation of a young man of modern belgravia would have much sorrow in his life it is not only impossible for aristocrats to assert proudly the poetry of life it is more impossible for them than for anyone else it is positively considered vulgar for a nobleman to boast of his ancient name which is when one comes to think of it the only rational object of his existence if a man in the street proclaimed with rude feudal rhetoric that he was the earl of doncaster he would be arrested as a lunatic but if it were discovered that he really was the earl of doncaster he would simply be cut as a cad no poetical prose must be expected from earls as a class the fashionable slang is hardly even a language it is like the formless cries of animals dimly indicating certain broad wellunderstood states of mind bored cut up jolly rotten and so on are like the words of some tribe of savages whose vocabulary has only twenty of them if a man of fashion wished to protest against some solecism in another man of fashion his utterance would be a mere string of set phrases as lifeless as a string of dead fish but an omnibus conductor being filled with the muse would burst out into a solid literary effort youre a genleman arent yer  yer boots is a lot brighter than yer edtheres precious little of yer and thats clothesthats right put yer cigar in yer mouth cos i cant see yer beind ittake it out again do yer youre young for smokin but ive sent for yer mother goin oh dont run away i wont arm yer ive got a good art i ave down with croolty to animals i say and so on it is evident that this mode of speech is not only literary but literary in a very ornate and almost artificial sense keats never put into a sonnet so many remote metaphors as a coster puts into a curse his speech is one long allegory like spensers faerie queen  i do not imagine that it is necessary to demonstrate that this poetic allusiveness is the characteristic of true slang such an expression as keep your hair on is positively meredithian in its perverse and mysterious manner of expressing an idea the americans have a wellknown expression about swelledhead as a description of selfapproval and the other day i heard a remarkable fantasia upon this air an american said that after the chinese war the japanese wanted to put on their hats with a shoehorn this is a monument of the true nature of slang which consists in getting further and further away from the original conception in treating it more and more as an assumption it is rather like the literary doctrine of the symbolists  the real reason of this great development of eloquence among the lower orders again brings us back to the case of the aristocracy in earlier times the lower classes live in a state of war a war of words their readiness is the product of the same fiery individualism as the readiness of the old fighting oligarchs any cabman has to be ready with his tongue as any gentleman of the last century had to be ready with his sword it is unfortunate that the poetry which is developed by this process should be purely a grotesque poetry but as the higher orders of society have entirely abdicated their right to speak with a heroic eloquence it is no wonder that the language should develop by itself in the direction of a rowdy eloquence the essential point is that somebody must be at work adding new symbols and new circumlocutions to a language  all slang is metaphor and all metaphor is poetry if we paused for a moment to examine the cheapest cant phrases that pass our lips every day we should find that they were as rich and suggestive as so many sonnets to take a single instance we speak of a man in english social relations breaking the ice if this were expanded into a sonnet we should have before us a dark and sublime picture of an ocean of everlasting ice the sombre and baffling mirror of the northern nature over which men walked and danced and skated easily but under which the living waters roared and toiled fathoms below the world of slang is a kind of topsyturveydom of poetry full of blue moons and white elephants of men losing their heads and men whose tongues run away with thema whole chaos of fairy tales                                        a defence of babyworship   the two facts which attract almost every normal person to children are first that they are very serious and secondly that they are in consequence very happy they are jolly with the completeness which is possible only in the absence of humour the most unfathomable schools and sages have never attained to the gravity which dwells in the eyes of a baby of three months old it is the gravity of astonishment at the universe and astonishment at the universe is not mysticism but a transcendent commonsense the fascination of children lies in this that with each of them all things are remade and the universe is put again upon its trial as we walk the streets and see below us those delightful bulbous heads three times too big for the body which mark these human mushrooms we ought always primarily to remember that within every one of these heads there is a new universe as new as it was on the seventh day of creation in each of those orbs there is a new system of stars new grass new cities a new sea  there is always in the healthy mind an obscure prompting that religion teaches us rather to dig than to climb that if we could once understand the common clay of earth we should understand everything similarly we have the sentiment that if we could destroy custom at a blow and see the stars as a child sees them we should need no other apocalypse this is the great truth which has always lain at the back of babyworship and which will support it to the end maturity with its endless energies and aspirations may easily be convinced that it will find new things to appreciate but it will never be convinced at bottom that it has properly appreciated what it has got we may scale the heavens and find new stars innumerable but there is still the new star we have not foundthat on which we were born  but the influence of children goes further than its first trifling effort of remaking heaven and earth it forces us actually to remodel our conduct in accordance with this revolutionary theory of the marvellousness of all things we do even when we are perfectly simple or ignorantwe do actually treat talking in children as marvellous walking in children as marvellous common intelligence in children as marvellous the cynical philosopher fancies he has a victory in this matterthat he can laugh when he shows that the words or antics of the child so much admired by its worshippers are common enough the fact is that this is precisely where babyworship is so profoundly right any words and any antics in a lump of clay are wonderful the childs words and antics are wonderful and it is only fair to say that the philosophers words and antics are equally wonderful  the truth is that it is our attitude towards children that is right and our attitude towards grownup people that is wrong our attitude towards our equals in age consists in a servile solemnity overlying a considerable degree of indifference or disdain our attitude towards children consists in a condescending indulgence overlying an unfathomable respect we bow to grown people take off our hats to them refrain from contradicting them flatly but we do not appreciate them properly we make puppets of children lecture them pull their hair and reverence love and fear them when we reverence anything in the mature it is their virtues or their wisdom and this is an easy matter but we reverence the faults and follies of children  we should probably come considerably nearer to the true conception of things if we treated all grownup persons of all titles and types with precisely that dark affection and dazed respect with which we treat the infantile limitations a child has a difficulty in achieving the miracle of speech consequently we find his blunders almost as marvellous as his accuracy if we only adopted the same attitude towards premiers and chancellors of the exchequer if we genially encouraged their stammering and delightful attempts at human speech we should be in a far more wise and tolerant temper a child has a knack of making experiments in life generally healthy in motive but often intolerable in a domestic commonwealth if we only treated all commercial buccaneers and bumptious tyrants on the same terms if we gently chided their brutalities as rather quaint mistakes in the conduct of life if we simply told them that they would understand when they were older we should probably be adopting the best and most crushing attitude towards the weaknesses of humanity in our relations to children we prove that the paradox is entirely true that it is possible to combine an amnesty that verges on contempt with a worship that verges upon terror we forgive children with the same kind of blasphemous gentleness with which omar khayyam forgave the omnipotent  the essential rectitude of our view of children lies in the fact that we feel them and their ways to be supernatural while for some mysterious reason we do not feel ourselves or our own ways to be supernatural the very smallness of children makes it possible to regard them as marvels we seem to be dealing with a new race only to be seen through a microscope i doubt if anyone of any tenderness or imagination can see the hand of a child and not be a little frightened of it it is awful to think of the essential human energy moving so tiny a thing it is like imagining that human nature could live in the wing of a butterfly or the leaf of a tree when we look upon lives so human and yet so small we feel as if we ourselves were enlarged to an embarrassing bigness of stature we feel the same kind of obligation to these creatures that a deity might feel if he had created something that he could not understand  but the humorous look of children is perhaps the most endearing of all the bonds that hold the cosmos together their topheavy dignity is more touching than any humility their solemnity gives us more hope for all things than a thousand carnivals of optimism their large and lustrous eyes seem to hold all the stars in their astonishment their fascinating absence of nose seems to give to us the most perfect hint of the humour that awaits us in the kingdom of heaven                                         a defence of detective stories   in attempting to reach the genuine psychological reason for the popularity of detective stories it is necessary to rid ourselves of many mere phrases it is not true for example that the populace prefer bad literature to good and accept detective stories because they are bad literature the mere absence of artistic subtlety does not make a book popular bradshaws railway guide contains few gleams of psychological comedy yet it is not read aloud uproariously on winter evenings if detective stories are read with more exuberance than railway guides it is certainly because they are more artistic many good books have fortunately been popular many bad books still more fortunately have been unpopular a good detective story would probably be even more popular than a bad one the trouble in this matter is that many people do not realize that there is such a thing as a good detective story it is to them like speaking of a good devil to write a story about a burglary is in their eyes a sort of spiritual manner of committing it to persons of somewhat weak sensibility this is natural enough it must be confessed that many detective stories are as full of sensational crime as one of shakespeares plays  there is however between a good detective story and a bad detective story as much or rather more difference than there is between a good epic and a bad one not only is a detective story a perfectly legitimate form of art but it has certain definite and real advantages as an agent of the public weal  the first essential value of the detective story lies in this that it is the earliest and only form of popular literature in which is expressed some sense of the poetry of modern life men lived among mighty mountains and eternal forests for ages before they realized that they were poetical it may reasonably be inferred that some of our descendants may see the chimneypots as rich a purple as the mountainpeaks and find the lampposts as old and natural as the trees of this realization of a great city itself as something wild and obvious the detective story is certainly the iliad no one can have failed to notice that in these stories the hero or the investigator crosses london with something of the loneliness and liberty of a prince in a tale of elfland that in the course of that incalculable journey the casual omnibus assumes the primal colours of a fairy ship the lights of the city begin to glow like innumerable goblin eyes since they are the guardians of some secret however crude which the writer knows and the reader does not every twist of the road is like a finger pointing to it every fantastic skyline of chimneypots seems wildly and derisively signalling the meaning of the mystery  this realization of the poetry of london is not a small thing a city is properly speaking more poetic even than a countryside for while nature is a chaos of unconscious forces a city is a chaos of conscious ones the crest of the flower or the pattern of the lichen may or may not be significant symbols but there is no stone in the street and no brick in the wall that is not actually a deliberate symbola message from some man as much as if it were a telegram or a postcard the narrowest street possesses in every crook and twist of its intention the soul of the man who built it perhaps long in his grave every brick has as human a hieroglyph as if it were a graven brick of babylon every slate on the roof is as educational a document as if it were a slate covered with addition and subtraction sums anything which tends even under the fantastic form of the minutiae of sherlock holmes to assert this romance of detail in civilization to emphasize this unfathomably human character in flints and tiles is a good thing it is good that the average man should fall into the habit of looking imaginatively at ten men in the street even if it is only on the chance that the eleventh might be a notorious thief we may dream perhaps that it might be possible to have another and higher romance of london that mens souls have stranger adventures than their bodies and that it would be harder and more exciting to hunt their virtues than to hunt their crimes but since our great authors with the admirable exception of stevenson decline to write of that thrilling mood and moment when the eyes of the great city like the eyes of a cat begin to flame in the dark we must give fair credit to the popular literature which amid a babble of pedantry and preciosity declines to regard the present as prosaic or the common as commonplace popular art in all ages has been interested in contemporary manners and costume it dressed the groups around the crucifixion in the garb of florentine gentlefolk or flemish burghers in the last century it was the custom for distinguished actors to present macbeth in a powdered wig and ruffles how far we are ourselves in this age from such conviction of the poetry of our own life and manners may easily be conceived by anyone who chooses to imagine a picture of alfred the great toasting the cakes dressed in tourists knickerbockers or a performance of hamlet in which the prince appeared in a frockcoat with a crape band round his hat but this instinct of the age to look back like lots wife could not go on for ever a rude popular literature of the romantic possibilities of the modern city was bound to arise it has arisen in the popular detective stories as rough and refreshing as the ballads of robin hood  there is however another good work that is done by detective stories while it is the constant tendency of the old adam to rebel against so universal and automatic a thing as civilization to preach departure and rebellion the romance of police activity keeps in some sense before the mind the fact that civilization itself is the most sensational of departures and the most romantic of rebellions by dealing with the unsleeping sentinels who guard the outposts of society it tends to remind us that we live in an armed camp making war with a chaotic world and that the criminals the children of chaos are nothing but the traitors within our gates when the detective in a police romance stands alone and somewhat fatuously fearless amid the knives and fists of a thieves kitchen it does certainly serve to make us remember that it is the agent of social justice who is the original and poetic figure while the burglars and footpads are merely placid old cosmic conservatives happy in the immemorial respectability of apes and wolves the romance of the police force is thus the whole romance of man it is based on the fact that morality is the most dark and daring of conspiracies it reminds us that the whole noiseless and unnoticeable police management by which we are ruled and protected is only a successful knighterrantry                                        a defence of patriotism   the decay of patriotism in england during the last year or two is a serious and distressing matter only in consequence of such a decay could the current lust of territory be confounded with the ancient love of country we may imagine that if there were no such thing as a pair of lovers left in the world all the vocabulary of love might without rebuke be transferred to the lowest and most automatic desire if no type of chivalrous and purifying passion remained there would be no one left to say that lust bore none of the marks of love that lust was rapacious and love pitiful that lust was blind and love vigilant that lust sated itself and love was insatiable so it is with the love of the city that high and ancient intellectual passion which has been written in red blood on the same table with the primal passions of our being on all sides we hear today of the love of our country and yet anyone who has literally such a love must be bewildered at the talk like a man hearing all men say that the moon shines by day and the sun by night the conviction must come to him at last that these men do not realize what the word love means that they mean by the love of country not what a mystic might mean by the love of god but something of what a child might mean by the love of jam to one who loves his fatherland for instance our boasted indifference to the ethics of a national war is mere mysterious gibberism it is like telling a man that a boy has committed murder but that he need not mind because it is only his son here clearly the word love is used unmeaningly it is the essence of love to be sensitive it is a part of its doom and anyone who objects to the one must certainly get rid of the other this sensitiveness rising sometimes to an almost morbid sensitiveness was the mark of all great lovers like dante and all great patriots like chatham my country right or wrong is a thing that no patriot would think of saying except in a desperate case it is like saying my mother drunk or sober no doubt if a decent mans mother took to drink he would share her troubles to the last but to talk as if he would be in a state of gay indifference as to whether his mother took to drink or not is certainly not the language of men who know the great mystery  what we really need for the frustration and overthrow of a deaf and raucous jingoism is a renascence of the love of the native land when that comes all shrill cries will cease suddenly for the first of all the marks of love is seriousness love will not accept sham bulletins or the empty victory of words it will always esteem the most candid counsellor the best love is drawn to truth by the unerring magnetism of agony it gives no pleasure to the lover to see ten doctors dancing with vociferous optimism round a deathbed  we have to ask then why is it that this recent movement in england which has honestly appeared to many a renascence of patriotism seems to us to have none of the marks of patriotismat least of patriotism in its highest form why has the adoration of our patriots been given wholly to qualities and circumstances good in themselves but comparatively material and trivialtrade physical force a skirmish at a remote frontier a squabble in a remote continent colonies are things to be proud of but for a country to be only proud of its extremities is like a man being only proud of his legs why is there not a high central intellectual patriotism a patriotism of the head and heart of the empire and not merely of its fists and its boots a rude athenian sailor may very likely have thought that the glory of athens lay in rowing with the right kind of oars or having a good supply of garlic but pericles did not think that this was the glory of athens with us on the other hand there is no difference at all between the patriotism preached by mr chamberlain and that preached by mr pat rafferty who sings what do you think of the irish now they are both honest simpleminded vulgar eulogies upon trivialities and truisms  i have rightly or wrongly a notion of the chief cause of this pettiness in english patriotism of today and i will attempt to expound it it may be taken generally that a man loves his own stock and environment and that he will find something to praise in it but whether it is the most praiseworthy thing or no will depend upon the mans enlightenment as to the facts if the son of thackeray let us say were brought up in ignorance of his fathers fame and genius it is not improbable that he would be proud of the fact that his father was over six feet high it seems to me that we as a nation are precisely in the position of this hypothetical child of thackerays we fall back upon gross and frivolous things for our patriotism for a simple reason we are the only people in the world who are not taught in childhood our own literature and our own history  we are as a nation in the truly extraordinary condition of not knowing our own merits we have played a great and splendid part in the history of universal thought and sentiment we have been among the foremost in that eternal and bloodless battle in which the blows do not slay but create in painting and music we are inferior to many other nations but in literature science philosophy and political eloquence if history be taken as a whole we can hold our own with any but all this vast heritage of intellectual glory is kept from our schoolboys like a heresy and they are left to live and die in the dull and infantile type of patriotism which they learnt from a box of tin soldiers there is no harm in the box of tin soldiers we do not expect children to be equally delighted with a beautiful box of tin philanthropists but there is great harm in the fact that the subtler and more civilized honour of england is not presented so as to keep pace with the expanding mind a french boy is taught the glory of molière as well as that of turenne a german boy is taught his own great national philosophy before he learns the philosophy of antiquity the result is that though french patriotism is often crazy and boastful though german patriotism is often isolated and pedantic they are neither of them merely dull common and brutal as is so often the strange fate of the nation of bacon and locke it is natural enough and even righteous enough under the circumstances an englishman must love england for something consequently he tends to exalt commerce or prizefighting just as a german might tend to exalt music or a flamand to exalt painting because he really believes it is the chief merit of his fatherland it would not be in the least extraordinary if a claim of eating up provinces and pulling down princes were the chief boast of a zulu the extraordinary thing is that it is the chief boast of a people who have shakespeare newton burke and darwin to boast of  the peculiar lack of any generosity or delicacy in the current english nationalism appears to have no other possible origin but in this fact of our unique neglect in education of the study of the national literature an englishman could not be silly enough to despise other nations if he once knew how much england had done for them great men of letters cannot avoid being humane and universal the absence of the teaching of english literature in our schools is when we come to think of it an almost amazing phenomenon it is even more amazing when we listen to the arguments urged by headmasters and other educational conservatives against the direct teaching of english it is said for example that a vast amount of english grammar and literature is picked up in the course of learning latin and greek this is perfectly true but the topsyturviness of the idea never seems to strike them it is like saying that a baby picks up the art of walking in the course of learning to hop or that a frenchman may successfully be taught german by helping a prussian to learn ashanti surely the obvious foundation of all education is the language in which that education is conveyed if a boy has only time to learn one thing he had better learn that  we have deliberately neglected this great heritage of high national sentiment we have made our public schools the strongest walls against a whisper of the honour of england and we have had our punishment in this strange and perverted fact that while a unifying vision of patriotism can ennoble bands of brutal savages or dingy burghers and be the best thing in their lives we who arethe world being judgehumane honest and serious individually have a patriotism that is the worst thing in ours what have we done and where have we wandered we that have produced sages who could have spoken with socrates and poets who could walk with dante that we should talk as if we have never done anything more intelligent than found colonies and kick niggers we are the children of light and it is we that sit in darkness if we are judged it will not be for the merely intellectual transgression of failing to appreciate other nations but for the supreme spiritual transgression of failing to appreciate ourselves   the end  billing and sons ltd printers guildford
