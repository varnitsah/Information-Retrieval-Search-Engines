three      the little man      the hanging of cultus george      the mistake of creation      a flutter in eggs      the townsite of tralee      wonder of woman        alternate titlethe race for number one      i the taste of the meat   in the beginning he was christopher bellew by the time he was at college he had become chris bellew later in the bohemian crowd of san francisco he was called kit bellew and in the end he was known by no other name than smoke bellew and this history of the evolution of his name is the history of his evolution nor would it have happened had he not had a fond mother and an iron uncle and had he not received a letter from gillet bellamy  i have just seen a copy of the billow gillet wrote from paris of course ohara will succeed with it but hes missing some tricks here followed details in the improvement of the budding society weekly go down and see him let him think theyre your own suggestions dont let him know theyre from me if you do hell make me paris correspondent which i cant afford because im getting real money for my stuff from the big magazines above all dont forget to make him fire that dub whos doing the musical and art criticism another thing san francisco has always had a literature of her own but she hasnt any now tell him to kick around and get some gink to turn out a live serial and to put into it the real romance and glamour and colour of san francisco  and down to the office of the billow went kit bellew faithfully to instruct ohara listened ohara debated ohara agreed ohara fired the dub who wrote criticisms further ohara had a way with himthe very way that was feared by gillet in distant paris when ohara wanted anything no friend could deny him he was sweetly and compellingly irresistible before kit bellew could escape from the office he had become an associate editor had agreed to write weekly columns of criticism till some decent pen was found and had pledged himself to write a weekly instalment of ten thousand words on the san francisco serialand all this without pay the billow wasnt paying yet ohara explained and just as convincingly had he exposited that there was only one man in san francisco capable of writing the serial and that man kit bellew  oh lord im the gink kit had groaned to himself afterward on the narrow stairway  and thereat had begun his servitude to ohara and the insatiable columns of the billow week after week he held down an office chair stood off creditors wrangled with printers and turned out twentyfive thousand words of all sorts nor did his labours lighten the billow was ambitious it went in for illustration the processes were expensive it never had any money to pay kit bellew and by the same token it was unable to pay for any additions to the office staff  this is what comes of being a good fellow kit grumbled one day  thank god for good fellows then ohara cried with tears in his eyes as he gripped kits hand youre all thats saved me kit but for you id have gone bust just a little longer old man and things will be easier  never was kits plaint i see my fate clearly i shall be here always  a little later he thought he saw his way out watching his chance in oharas presence he fell over a chair a few minutes afterwards he bumped into the corner of the desk and with fumbling fingers capsized a paste pot  out late ohara queried  kit brushed his eyes with his hands and peered about him anxiously before replying  no its not that its my eyes they seem to be going back on me thats all  for several days he continued to fall over and bump into the office furniture but oharas heart was not softened  i tell you what kit he said one day youve got to see an oculist theres doctor hassdapple hes a crackerjack and it wont cost you anything we can get it for advertizing ill see him myself  and true to his word he dispatched kit to the oculist  theres nothing the matter with your eyes was the doctors verdict after a lengthy examination in fact your eyes are magnificenta pair in a million  dont tell ohara kit pleaded and give me a pair of black glasses  the result of this was that ohara sympathized and talked glowingly of the time when the billow would be on its feet  luckily for kit bellew he had his own income small it was compared with some yet it was large enough to enable him to belong to several clubs and maintain a studio in the latin quarter in point of fact since his associateeditorship his expenses had decreased prodigiously he had no time to spend money he never saw the studio any more nor entertained the local bohemians with his famous chafingdish suppers yet he was always broke for the billow in perennial distress absorbed his cash as well as his brains there were the illustrators who periodically refused to illustrate the printers who periodically refused to print and the officeboy who frequently refused to officiate at such times ohara looked at kit and kit did the rest  when the steamship excelsior arrived from alaska bringing the news of the klondike strike that set the country mad kit made a purely frivolous proposition  look here ohara he said this gold rush is going to be bigthe days of 49 over again suppose i cover it for the billow ill pay my own expenses  ohara shook his head  cant spare you from the office kit then theres that serial besides i saw jackson not an hour ago hes starting for the klondike tomorrow and hes agreed to send a weekly letter and photos i wouldnt let him get away till he promised and the beauty of it is that it doesnt cost us anything  the next kit heard of the klondike was when he dropped into the club that afternoon and in an alcove off the library encountered his uncle  hello avuncular relative kit greeted sliding into a leather chair and spreading out his legs wont you join me  he ordered a cocktail but the uncle contented himself with the thin native claret he invariably drank he glanced with irritated disapproval at the cocktail and on to his nephews face kit saw a lecture gathering  ive only a minute he announced hastily ive got to run and take in that keith exhibition at ellerys and do half a column on it  whats the matter with you the other demanded youre pale youre a wreck  kits only answer was a groan  ill have the pleasure of burying you i can see that  kit shook his head sadly  no destroying worm thank you cremation for mine  john bellew came of the old hard and hardy stock that had crossed the plains by oxteam in the fifties and in him was this same hardness and the hardness of a childhood spent in the conquering of a new land  youre not living right christopher im ashamed of you  primrose path eh kit chuckled  the older man shrugged his shoulders  shake not your gory locks at me avuncular i wish it were the primrose path but thats all cut out i have no time  then what in  overwork  john bellew laughed harshly and incredulously  honest  again came the laughter  men are the products of their environment kit proclaimed pointing at the others glass your mirth is thin and bitter as your drink  overwork was the sneer you never earned a cent in your life  you bet i haveonly i never got it im earning five hundred a week right now and doing four mens work  pictures that wont sell orerfancy work of some sort can you swim  i used to  sit a horse  i have essayed that adventure  john bellew snorted his disgust im glad your father didnt live to see you in all the glory of your gracelessness he said your father was a man every inch of him do you get it a man i think hed have whaled all this musical and artistic tom foolery out of you  alas these degenerate days kit sighed  i could understand it and tolerate it the other went on savagely if you succeeded at it youve never earned a cent in your life nor done a tap of mans work  etchings and pictures and fans kit contributed unsoothingly  youre a dabbler and a failure what pictures have you painted dinky watercolours and nightmare posters youve never had one exhibited even here in san francisco  ah you forget there is one in the jinks room of this very club  a gross cartoon music your dear fool of a mother spent hundreds on lessons youve dabbled and failed youve never even earned a fivedollar piece by accompanying some one at a concert your songsragtime rot thats never printed and thats sung only by a pack of fake bohemians  i had a book published oncethose sonnets you remember kit interposed meekly  what did it cost you  only a couple of hundred  any other achievements  i had a forest play acted at the summer jinks  what did you get for it  glory  and you used to swim and you have essayed to sit a horse john bellew set his glass down with unnecessary violence what earthly good are you anyway you were well put up yet even at university you didnt play football you didnt row you didnt  i boxed and fencedsome  when did you box last  not since but i was considered an excellent judge of time and distance only i waser  go on  considered desultory  lazy you mean  i always imagined it was an euphemism  my father sir your grandfather old isaac bellew killed a man with a blow of his fist when he was sixtynine years old  the man  no youryou graceless scamp but youll never kill a mosquito at sixtynine  the times have changed oh my avuncular they send men to prison for homicide now  your father rode one hundred and eightyfive miles without sleeping and killed three horses  had he lived today hed have snored over the course in a pullman  the older man was on the verge of choking with wrath but swallowed it down and managed to articulate  how old are you  i have reason to believe  i know twentyseven you finished college at twentytwo youve dabbled and played and frilled for five years before god and man of what use are you when i was your age i had one suit of underclothes i was riding with the cattle in coluso i was hard as rocks and i could sleep on a rock i lived on jerked beef and bearmeat i am a better man physically right now than you are you weigh about one hundred and sixtyfive i can throw you right now or thrash you with my fists  it doesnt take a physical prodigy to mop up cocktails or pink tea kit murmured deprecatingly dont you see my avuncular the times have changed besides i wasnt brought up right my dear fool of a mother  john bellew started angrily  as you described her was too good to me kept me in cotton wool and all the rest now if when i was a youngster i had taken some of those intensely masculine vacations you go in fori wonder why you didnt invite me sometimes you took hal and robbie all over the sierras and on that mexico trip  i guess you were too lordfauntleroyish  your fault avuncular and my dearermothers how was i to know the hard i was only a cheeild what was there left but etchings and pictures and fans was it my fault that i never had to sweat  the older man looked at his nephew with unconcealed disgust he had no patience with levity from the lips of softness  well im going to take another one of those whatyoucall masculine vacations suppose i asked you to come along  rather belated i must say where is it  hal and robert are going in to klondike and im going to see them across the pass and down to the lakes then return  he got no further for the young man had sprung forward and gripped his hand  my preserver  john bellew was immediately suspicious he had not dreamed the invitation would be accepted  you dont mean it he said  when do we start  it will be a hard trip youll be in the way  no i wont ill work ive learned to work since i went on the billow  each man has to take a years supplies in with him therell be such a jam the indian packers wont be able to handle it hal and robert will have to pack their outfits across themselves thats what im going along forto help them pack if you come youll have to do the same  watch me  you cant pack was the objection  when do we start  tomorrow  you neednt take it to yourself that your lecture on the hard has done it kit said at parting i just had to get away somewhere anywhere from ohara  who is ohara a jap  no hes an irishman and a slavedriver and my best friend hes the editor and proprietor and allround big squeeze of the billow what he says goes he can make ghosts walk  that night kit bellew wrote a note to ohara its only a several weeks vacation he explained youll have to get some gink to dope out instalments for that serial sorry old man but my health demands it ill kick in twice as hard when i get back   kit bellew landed through the madness of the dyea beach congested with thousandpound outfits of thousands of men this immense mass of luggage and food flung ashore in mountains by the steamers was beginning slowly to dribble up the dyea valley and across chilkoot it was a portage of twentyeight miles and could be accomplished only on the backs of men despite the fact that the indian packers had jumped the freight from eight cents a pound to forty they were swamped with the work and it was plain that winter would catch the major portion of the outfits on the wrong side of the divide  tenderest of the tenderfeet was kit like many hundreds of others he carried a big revolver swung on a cartridgebelt of this his uncle filled with memories of old lawless days was likewise guilty but kit bellew was romantic he was fascinated by the froth and sparkle of the gold rush and viewed its life and movement with an artists eye he did not take it seriously as he said on the steamer it was not his funeral he was merely on a vacation and intended to peep over the top of the pass for a look see and then to return  leaving his party on the sand to wait for the putting ashore of the freight he strolled up the beach toward the old tradingpost he did not swagger though he noticed that many of the berevolvered individuals did a strapping sixfoot indian passed him carrying an unusually large pack kit swung in behind admiring the splendid calves of the man and the grace and ease with which he moved along under his burden the indian dropped his pack on the scales in front of the post and kit joined the group of admiring goldrushers who surrounded him the pack weighed one hundred and twentyfive pounds which fact was uttered back and forth in tones of awe it was going some kit decided and he wondered if he could lift such a weight much less walk off with it  going to lake linderman with it old man he asked  the indian swelling with pride grunted an affirmative  how much you make that one pack  fifty dollar  here kit slid out of the conversation a young woman standing in the doorway had caught his eye unlike other women landing from the steamers she was neither shortskirted nor bloomerclad she was dressed as any woman travelling anywhere would be dressed what struck him was the justness of her being there a feeling that somehow she belonged moreover she was young and pretty the bright beauty and colour of her oval face held him and he looked overlonglooked till she resented and her own eyes longlashed and dark met his in cool survey  from his face they travelled in evident amusement down to the big revolver at his thigh then her eyes came back to his and in them was amused contempt it struck him like a blow she turned to the man beside her and indicated kit the man glanced him over with the same amused contempt  chechako the girl said  the man who looked like a tramp in his cheap overalls and dilapidated woollen jacket grinned dryly and kit felt withered though he knew not why but anyway she was an unusually pretty girl he decided as the two moved off he noted the way of her walk and recorded the judgment that he would recognize it over the lapse of a thousand years  did you see that man with the girl kits neighbor asked him excitedly know who he is  kit shook his head  cariboo charley he was just pointed out to me he struck it big on klondike oldtimer been on the yukon a dozen years hes just come out  whats chechako mean kit asked  youre one im one was the answer  maybe i am but youve got to search me what does it mean  tenderfoot  on his way back to the beach kit turned the phrase over and over it rankled to be called tenderfoot by a slender chit of a woman  going into a corner among the heaps of freight his mind still filled with the vision of the indian with the redoubtable pack kit essayed to learn his own strength he picked out a sack of flour which he knew weighed an even hundred pounds he stepped astride it reached down and strove to get it on his shoulder his first conclusion was that one hundred pounds were real heavy his next was that his back was weak his third was an oath and it occurred at the end of five futile minutes when he collapsed on top of the burden with which he was wrestling he mopped his forehead and across a heap of grubsacks saw john bellew gazing at him wintry amusement in his eyes  god proclaimed that apostle of the hard out of our loins has come a race of weaklings when i was sixteen i toyed with things like that  you forget avuncular kit retorted that i wasnt raised on bearmeat  and ill toy with it when im sixty  youve got to show me  john bellew did he was fortyeight but he bent over the sack applied a tentative shifting grip that balanced it and with a quick heave stood erect the somersaulted sack of flour on his shoulder  knack my boy knackand a spine  kit took off his hat reverently  youre a wonder avuncular a shining wonder dye think i can learn the knack  john bellew shrugged his shoulders youll be hitting the back trail before we get started  never you fear kit groaned theres ohara the roaring lion down there im not going back till i have to   kits first pack was a success up to finnegans crossing they had managed to get indians to carry the twentyfivehundredpound outfit from that point their own backs must do the work they planned to move forward at the rate of a mile a day it looked easyon paper since john bellew was to stay in camp and do the cooking he would be unable to make more than an occasional pack so to each of the three young men fell the task of carrying eight hundred pounds one mile each day if they made fiftypound packs it meant a daily walk of sixteen miles loaded and of fifteen miles lightbecause we dont backtrip the last time kit explained the pleasant discovery eightypound packs meant nineteen miles travel each day and hundredpound packs meant only fifteen miles  i dont like walking said kit therefore i shall carry one hundred pounds he caught the grin of incredulity on his uncles face and added hastily of course i shall work up to it a fellows got to learn the ropes and tricks ill start with fifty  he did and ambled gaily along the trail he dropped the sack at the next campsite and ambled back it was easier than he had thought but two miles had rubbed off the velvet of his strength and exposed the underlying softness his second pack was sixtyfive pounds it was more difficult and he no longer ambled several times following the custom of all packers he sat down on the ground resting the pack behind him on a rock or stump with the third pack he became bold he fastened the straps to a ninetyfivepound sack of beans and started at the end of a hundred yards he felt that he must collapse he sat down and mopped his face  short hauls and short rests he muttered thats the trick  sometimes he did not make a hundred yards and each time he struggled to his feet for another short haul the pack became undeniably heavier he panted for breath and the sweat streamed from him before he had covered a quarter of a mile he stripped off his woollen shirt and hung it on a tree a little later he discarded his hat at the end of half a mile he decided he was finished he had never exerted himself so in his life and he knew that he was finished as he sat and panted his gaze fell upon the big revolver and the heavy cartridgebelt  ten pounds of junk he sneered as he unbuckled it  he did not bother to hang it on a tree but flung it into the underbush and as the steady tide of packers flowed by him up trail and down he noted that the other tenderfeet were beginning to shed their shootingirons  his short hauls decreased at times a hundred feet was all he could stagger and then the ominous pounding of his heart against his eardrums and the sickening totteriness of his knees compelled him to rest and his rests grew longer but his mind was busy it was a twentyeightmile portage which represented as many days and this by all accounts was the easiest part of it wait till you get to chilkoot others told him as they rested and talked where you climb with hands and feet  they aint going to be no chilkoot was his answer not for me long before that ill be at peace in my little couch beneath the moss  a slip and a violent wrenching effort at recovery frightened him he felt that everything inside him had been torn asunder  if ever i fall down with this on my back im a goner he told another packer  thats nothing came the answer wait till you hit the canyon youll have to cross a raging torrent on a sixtyfoot pinetree no guideropes nothing and the water boiling at the sag of the log to your knees if you fall with a pack on your back theres no getting out of the straps you just stay there and drown  sounds good to me he retorted and out of the depths of his exhaustion he almost meant it  they drown three or four a day there the man assured him i helped fish a german out of there he had four thousand in greenbacks on him  cheerful i must say said kit battling his way to his feet and tottering on  he and the sack of beans became a perambulating tragedy it reminded him of the old man of the sea who sat on sinbads neck and this was one of those intensely masculine vacations he meditated compared with it the servitude to ohara was sweet again and again he was nearly seduced by the thought of abandoning the sack of beans in the brush and of sneaking around the camp to the beach and catching a steamer for civilization  but he didnt somewhere in him was the strain of the hard and he repeated over and over to himself that what other men could do he could it became a nightmare chant and he gibbered it to those that passed him on the trail at other times resting he watched and envied the stolid mulefooted indians that plodded by under heavier packs they never seemed to rest but went on and on with a steadiness and certitude that were to him appalling  he sat and cursedhe had no breath for it when under wayand fought the temptation to sneak back to san francisco before the mile pack was ended he ceased cursing and took to crying the tears were tears of exhaustion and of disgust with self if ever a man was a wreck he was as the end of the pack came in sight he strained himself in desperation gained the campsite and pitched forward on his face the beans on his back it did not kill him but he lay for fifteen minutes before he could summon sufficient shreds of strength to release himself from the straps then he became deathly sick and was so found by robbie who had similar troubles of his own it was this sickness of robbie that braced kit up  what other men can do we can do kit told robbie though down in his heart he wondered whether or not he was bluffing   and i am twentyseven years old and a man he privately assured himself many times in the days that followed there was need for it at the end of a week though he had succeeded in moving his eight hundred pounds forward a mile a day he had lost fifteen pounds of his own weight his face was lean and haggard all resilience had gone out of his body and mind he no longer walked but plodded and on the backtrips travelling light his feet dragged almost as much as when he was loaded  he had become a work animal he fell asleep over his food and his sleep was heavy and beastly save when he was aroused screaming with agony by the cramps in his legs every part of him ached he tramped on raw blisters yet even this was easier than the fearful bruising his feet received on the waterrounded rocks of the dyea flats across which the trail led for two miles these two miles represented thirtyeight miles of travelling he washed his face once a day his nails torn and broken and afflicted with hangnails were never cleaned his shoulders and chest galled by the packstraps made him think and for the first time with understanding of the horses he had seen on city streets  one ordeal that nearly destroyed him at first had been the food the extraordinary amount of work demanded extraordinary stoking and his stomach was unaccustomed to great quantities of bacon and of the coarse highly poisonous brown beans as a result his stomach went back on him and for several days the pain and irritation of it and of starvation nearly broke him down and then came the day of joy when he could eat like a ravenous animal and wolfeyed ask for more  when they had moved the outfit across the footlogs at the mouth of the canyon they made a change in their plans word had come across the pass that at lake linderman the last available trees for building boats were being cut the two cousins with tools whipsaw blankets and grub on their backs went on leaving kit and his uncle to hustle along the outfit john bellew now shared the cooking with kit and both packed shoulder to shoulder time was flying and on the peaks the first snow was falling to be caught on the wrong side of the pass meant a delay of nearly a year the older man put his iron back under a hundred pounds kit was shocked but he gritted his teeth and fastened his own straps to a hundred pounds it hurt but he had learned the knack and his body purged of all softness and fat was beginning to harden up with lean and bitter muscle also he observed and devised he took note of the headstraps worn by the indians and manufactured one for himself which he used in addition to the shoulderstraps it made things easier so that he began the practice of piling any light cumbersome piece of luggage on top thus he was soon able to bend along with a hundred pounds in the straps fifteen or twenty more lying loosely on top of the pack and against his neck an axe or a pair of oars in one hand and in the other the nested cookingpails of the camp  but work as they would the toil increased the trail grew more rugged their packs grew heavier and each day saw the snowline dropping down the mountains while freight jumped to sixty cents no word came from the cousins beyond so they knew they must be at work chopping down the standing trees and whipsawing them into boatplanks john bellew grew anxious capturing a bunch of indians backtripping from lake linderman he persuaded them to put their straps on the outfit they charged thirty cents a pound to carry it to the summit of chilkoot and it nearly broke him as it was some four hundred pounds of clothesbags and camp outfit were not handled he remained behind to move it along dispatching kit with the indians at the summit kit was to remain slowly moving his ton until overtaken by the four hundred pounds with which his uncle guaranteed to catch him   kit plodded along the trail with his indian packers in recognition of the fact that it was to be a long pack straight to the top of chilkoot his own load was only eighty pounds the indians plodded under their loads but it was a quicker gait than he had practised yet he felt no apprehension and by now had come to deem himself almost the equal of an indian  at the end of a quarter of a mile he desired to rest but the indians kept on he stayed with them and kept his place in the line at the halfmile he was convinced that he was incapable of another step yet he gritted his teeth kept his place and at the end of the mile was amazed that he was still alive then in some strange way came the thing called second wind and the next mile was almost easier than the first the third mile nearly killed him but though half delirious with pain and fatigue he never whimpered and then when he felt he must surely faint came the rest instead of sitting in the straps as was the custom of the white packers the indians slipped out of the shoulder and headstraps and lay at ease talking and smoking a full halfhour passed before they made another start to kits surprise he found himself a fresh man and long hauls and long rests became his newest motto  the pitch of chilkoot was all he had heard of it and many were the occasions when he climbed with hands as well as feet but when he reached the crest of the divide in the thick of a driving snowsquall it was in the company of his indians and his secret pride was that he had come through with them and never squealed and never lagged to be almost as good as an indian was a new ambition to cherish  when he had paid off the indians and seen them depart a stormy darkness was falling and he was left alone a thousand feet above timberline on the backbone of a mountain wet to the waist famished and exhausted he would have given a years income for a fire and a cup of coffee instead he ate half a dozen cold flapjacks and crawled into the folds of the partly unrolled tent as he dozed off he had time for only one fleeting thought and he grinned with vicious pleasure at the picture of john bellew in the days to follow masculinely backtripping his four hundred pounds up chilcoot as for himself even though burdened with two thousand pounds he was bound down the hill  in the morning stiff from his labours and numb with the frost he rolled out of the canvas ate a couple of pounds of uncooked bacon buckled the straps on a hundred pounds and went down the rocky way several hundred yards beneath the trail led across a small glacier and down to crater lake other men packed across the glacier all that day he dropped his packs at the glaciers upper edge and by virtue of the shortness of the pack he put his straps on one hundred and fifty pounds each load his astonishment at being able to do it never abated for two dollars he bought from an indian three leathery seabiscuits and out of these and a huge quantity of raw bacon made several meals unwashed unwarmed his clothing wet with sweat he slept another night in the canvas  in the early morning he spread a tarpaulin on the ice loaded it with threequarters of a ton and started to pull where the pitch of the glacier accelerated his load likewise accelerated overran him scooped him in on top and ran away with him  a hundred packers bending under their loads stopped to watch him he yelled frantic warnings and those in his path stumbled and staggered clear below on the lower edge of the glacier was pitched a small tent which seemed leaping toward him so rapidly did it grow larger he left the beaten track where the packers trail swerved to the left and struck a patch of fresh snow this arose about him in frosty smoke while it reduced his speed he saw the tent the instant he struck it carrying away the corner guys bursting in the front flaps and fetching up inside still on top of the tarpaulin and in the midst of his grubsacks the tent rocked drunkenly and in the frosty vapour he found himself face to face with a startled young woman who was sitting up in her blanketsthe very one who had called him a tenderfoot at dyea  did you see my smoke he queried cheerfully  she regarded him with disapproval  talk about your magic carpets he went on  do you mind removing that sack from my foot she said coldly  he looked and lifted his weight quickly  it wasnt a sack it was my elbow pardon me  the information did not perturb her and her coolness was a challenge  it was a mercy you did not overturn the stove she said  he followed her glance and saw a sheetiron stove and a coffeepot attended by a young squaw he sniffed the coffee and looked back to the girl  im a chechako he said  her bored expression told him that he was stating the obvious but he was unabashed  ive shed my shootingirons he added  then she recognized him and her eyes lighted i never thought youd get this far she informed him  again and greedily he sniffed the air as i live coffee he turned and directly addressed her ill give you my little fingercut it right off now ill do anything ill be your slave for a year and a day or any other old time if youll give me a cup out of that pot  and over the coffee he gave his name and learned hersjoy gastell also he learned that she was an oldtimer in the country she had been born in a tradingpost on the great slave and as a child had crossed the rockies with her father and come down to the yukon she was going in she said with her father who had been delayed by business in seattle and who had then been wrecked on the illfated chanter and carried back to puget sound by the rescuing steamer  in view of the fact that she was still in her blankets he did not make it a long conversation and heroically declining a second cup of coffee he removed himself and his heaped and shifted baggage from her tent further he took several conclusions away with him she had a fetching name and fetching eyes could not be more than twenty or twentyone or two her father must be french she had a will of her own and temperament to burn and she had been educated elsewhere than on the frontier   over the icescoured rocks and above the timberline the trail ran around crater lake and gained the rocky defile that led toward happy camp and the first scrubpines to pack his heavy outfit around would take days of heartbreaking toil on the lake was a canvas boat employed in freighting two trips with it in two hours would see him and his ton across but he was broke and the ferryman charged forty dollars a ton  youve got a goldmine my friend in that dinky boat kit said to the ferryman do you want another goldmine  show me was the answer  ill sell it to you for the price of ferrying my outfit its an idea not patented and you can jump the deal as soon as i tell you it are you game  the ferryman said he was and kit liked his looks  very well you see that glacier take a pickaxe and wade into it in a day you can have a decent groove from top to bottom see the point the chilkoot and crater lake consolidated chute corporation limited you can charge fifty cents a hundred get a hundred tons a day and have no work to do but collect the coin  two hours later kits ton was across the lake and he had gained three days on himself and when john bellew overtook him he was well along toward deep lake another volcanic pit filled with glacial water   the last pack from long lake to linderman was three miles and the trail if trail it could be called rose up over a thousandfoot hogback dropped down a scramble of slippery rocks and crossed a wide stretch of swamp john bellew remonstrated when he saw kit arise with a hundred pounds in the straps and pick up a fiftypound sack of flour and place it on top of the pack against the back of his neck  come on you chunk of the hard kit retorted kick in on your bearmeat fodder and your one suit of underclothes  but john bellew shook his head im afraid im getting old christopher  youre only fortyeight do you realize that my grandfather sir your father old isaac bellew killed a man with his fist when he was sixtynine years old  john bellew grinned and swallowed his medicine  avuncular i want to tell you something important i was raised a lord fauntleroy but i can outpack you outwalk you put you on your back or lick you with my fists right now  john bellew thrust out his hand and spoke solemnly christopher my boy i believe you can do it i believe you can do it with that pack on your back at the same time youve made good boy though its too unthinkable to believe  kit made the round trip of the last pack four times a day which is to say that he daily covered twentyfour miles of mountain climbing twelve miles of it under one hundred and fifty pounds he was proud hard and tired but in splendid physical condition he ate and slept as he had never eaten and slept in his life and as the end of the work came in sight he was almost half sorry  one problem bothered him he had learned that he could fall with a hundredweight on his back and survive but he was confident if he fell with that additional fifty pounds across the back of his neck that it would break it clean each trail through the swamp was quickly churned bottomless by the thousands of packers who were compelled continually to make new trails it was while pioneering such a new trail that he solved the problem of the extra fifty  the soft lush surface gave way under him he floundered and pitched forward on his face the fifty pounds crushed his face in the mud and went clear without snapping his neck with the remaining hundred pounds on his back he arose on hands and knees but he got no farther one arm sank to the shoulder pillowing his cheek in the slush as he drew this arm clear the other sank to the shoulder in this position it was impossible to slip the straps and the hundredweight on his back would not let him rise on hands and knees sinking first one arm and then the other he made an effort to crawl to where the small sack of flour had fallen but he exhausted himself without advancing and so churned and broke the grass surface that a tiny pool of water began to form in perilous proximity to his mouth and nose  he tried to throw himself on his back with the pack underneath but this resulted in sinking both arms to the shoulders and gave him a foretaste of drowning with exquisite patience he slowly withdrew one sucking arm and then the other and rested them flat on the surface for the support of his chin then he began to call for help after a time he heard the sound of feet sucking through the mud as some one advanced from behind  lend a hand friend he said throw out a lifeline or something  it was a womans voice that answered and he recognized it  if youll unbuckle the straps i can get up  the hundred pounds rolled into the mud with a soggy noise and he slowly gained his feet  a pretty predicament miss gastell laughed at sight of his mudcovered face  not at all he replied airily my favourite physicalexercise stunt try it some time its great for the pectoral muscles and the spine  he wiped his face flinging the slush from his hand with a snappy jerk  oh she cried in recognition its mrahmr smoke bellew  i thank you gravely for your timely rescue and for that name he answered i have been doubly baptized henceforth i shall insist always on being called smoke bellew it is a strong name and not without significance  he paused and then voice and expression became suddenly fierce  do you know what im going to do he demanded im going back to the states i am going to get married i am going to raise a large family of children and then as the evening shadows fall i shall gather those children about me and relate the sufferings and hardships i endured on the chilkoot trail and if they dont cryi repeat if they dont cry ill lambaste the stuffing out of them   the arctic winter came down apace snow that had come to stay lay six inches on the ground and the ice was forming in quiet ponds despite the fierce gales that blew it was in the late afternoon during a lull in such a gale that kit and john bellew helped the cousins load the boat and watched it disappear down the lake in a snowsquall  and now a nights sleep and an early start in the morning said john bellew if we arent stormbound at the summit well make dyea tomorrow night and if we have luck in catching a steamer well be in san francisco in a week  enjoyed your vacation kit asked absently  their camp for that last night at linderman was a melancholy remnant everything of use including the tent had been taken by the cousins a tattered tarpaulin stretched as a windbreak partially sheltered them from the driving snow supper they cooked on an open fire in a couple of battered and discarded camp utensils all that was left them were their blankets and food for several meals  from the moment of the departure of the boat kit had become absent and restless his uncle noticed his condition and attributed it to the fact that the end of the hard toil had come only once during supper did kit speak  avuncular he said relevant of nothing after this i wish youd call me smoke ive made some smoke on this trail havent i  a few minutes later he wandered away in the direction of the village of tents that sheltered the goldrushers who were still packing or building their boats he was gone several hours and when he returned and slipped into his blankets john bellew was asleep  in the darkness of a galedriven morning kit crawled out built a fire in his stocking feet by which he thawed out his frozen shoes then boiled coffee and fried bacon it was a chilly miserable meal as soon as it was finished they strapped their blankets as john bellew turned to lead the way toward the chilcoot trail kit held out his hand  goodbye avuncular he said  john bellew looked at him and swore in his surprise  dont forget my names smoke kit chided  but what are you going to do  kit waved his hand in a general direction northward over the stormlashed lake  whats the good of turning back after getting this far he asked besides ive got my taste of meat and i like it im going on  youre broke protested john bellew you have no outfit  ive got a job behold your nephew christopher smoke bellew hes got a job hes a gentlemans man hes got a job at a hundred and fifty per month and grub hes going down to dawson with a couple of dudes and another gentlemans mancampcook boatman and general allaround hustler and ohara and the billow can go to the devil goodbye  but john bellew was dazed and could only mutter i dont understand  they say the baldface grizzlies are thick in the yukon basin kit explained well ive got only one suit of underclothes and im going after the bearmeat thats all     ii the meat   half the time the wind blew a gale and smoke bellew staggered against it along the beach in the gray of dawn a dozen boats were being loaded with the precious outfits packed across chilkoot they were clumsy homemade boats put together by men who were not boatbuilders out of planks they had sawed by hand from green sprucetrees one boat already loaded was just starting and kit paused to watch  the wind which was fair down the lake here blew in squarely on the beach kicking up a nasty sea in the shallows the men of the departing boat waded in high rubber boots as they shoved it out toward deeper water twice they did this clambering aboard and failing to row clear the boat was swept back and grounded kit noticed that the spray on the sides of the boat quickly turned to ice the third attempt was a partial success the last two men to climb in were wet to their waists but the boat was afloat they struggled awkwardly at the heavy oars and slowly worked off shore then they hoisted a sail made of blankets had it carry away in a gust and were swept a third time back on the freezing beach  kit grinned to himself and went on this was what he must expect to encounter for he too in his new role of gentlemans man was to start from the beach in a similar boat that very day  everywhere men were at work and at work desperately for the closing down of winter was so imminent that it was a gamble whether or not they would get across the great chain of lakes before the freezeup yet when kit arrived at the tent of messrs sprague and stine he did not find them stirring  by a fire under the shelter of a tarpaulin squatted a short thick man smoking a brownpaper cigarette  hello he said are you mister spragues new man  as kit nodded he thought he had noted a shade of emphasis on the mister and the man and he was sure of a hint of a twinkle in the corner of the eye  well im doc stines man the other went on im five feet two inches long and my names shorty jack short for short and sometimes known as johnnyonthespot  kit put out his hand and shook were you raised on bearmeat he queried  sure was the answer though my first feedin was buffalomilk as near as i can remember sit down an have some grub the bosses aint turned out yet  and despite the one breakfast kit sat down under the tarpaulin and ate a second breakfast thrice as hearty the heavy purging toil of weeks had given him the stomach and appetite of a wolf he could eat anything in any quantity and be unaware that he possessed a digestion shorty he found voluble and pessimistic and from him he received surprising tips concerning their bosses and ominous forecasts of the expedition thomas stanley sprague was a budding mining engineer and the son of a millionaire doctor adolph stine was also the son of a wealthy father and through their fathers both had been backed by an investing syndicate in the klondike adventure  oh theyre sure made of money shorty expounded when they hit the beach at dyea freight was seventy cents but no indians there was a party from eastern oregon real miners thatd managed to get a team of indians together at seventy cents indians had the straps on the outfit three thousand pounds of it when along comes sprague and stine they offered eighty cents and ninety and at a dollar a pound the indians jumped the contract and took off their straps sprague and stine came through though it cost them three thousand and the oregon bunch is still on the beach they wont get through till next year  oh they are real hummers your boss and mine when it comes to sheddin the mazuma an never mindin other folks feelins what did they do when they hit linderman the carpenters was just putting in the last licks on a boat theyd contracted to a frisco bunch for six hundred sprague and stine slipped em an even thousand and they jumped their contract its a goodlookin boat but its jiggered the other bunch theyve got their outfit right here but no boat and theyre stuck for next year  have another cup of coffee and take it from me that i wouldnt travel with no such outfit if i didnt want to get to klondike so blamed bad they aint hearted right theyd take the crape off the door of a house in mourning if they needed it in their business did you sign a contract  kit shook his head  then im sorry for you pardner they aint no grub in the country and theyll drop you cold as soon as they hit dawson men are going to starve there this winter  they agreed kit began  verbal shorty snapped him short its your sayso against theirs thats all well anyway whats your name pardner  call me smoke said kit  well smoke youll have a run for your verbal contract just the same this is a plain sample of what to expect they can sure shed mazuma but they cant work or turn out of bed in the morning we should have been loaded and started an hour ago its you an me for the big work pretty soon youll hear em shoutin for their coffeein bed mind you and them grown men what dye know about boatin on the water im a cowman and a prospector but im sure tenderfooted on water an they dont know punkins what dye know  search me kit answered snuggling in closer under the tarpaulin as the snow whirled before a fiercer gust i havent been on a small boat since a boy but i guess we can learn  a corner of the tarpaulin tore loose and shorty received a jet of driven snow down the back of his neck  oh we can learn all right he muttered wrathfully sure we can a child can learn but its dollars to doughnuts we dont even get started today  it was eight oclock when the call for coffee came from the tent and nearly nine before the two employers emerged  hello said sprague a rosycheeked wellfed young man of twentyfive time we made a start shorty you and here he glanced interrogatively at kit i didnt quite catch your name last evening  smoke  well shorty you and mr smoke had better begin loading the boat  plain smokecut out the mister kit suggested  sprague nodded curtly and strolled away among the tents to be followed by doctor stine a slender pallid young man  shorty looked significantly at his companion over a ton and a half of outfit and they wont lend a hand youll see  i guess its because were paid to do the work kit answered cheerfully and we might as well buck in  to move three thousand pounds on the shoulders a hundred yards was no slight task and to do it in half a gale slushing through the snow in heavy rubber boots was exhausting in addition there was the taking down of the tent and the packing of small camp equipage then came the loading as the boat settled it had to be shoved farther and farther out increasing the distance they had to wade by two oclock it had all been accomplished and kit despite his two breakfasts was weak with the faintness of hunger his knees were shaking under him shorty in similar predicament foraged through the pots and pans and drew forth a big pot of cold boiled beans in which were imbedded large chunks of bacon there was only one spoon a longhandled one and they dipped turn and turn about into the pot kit was filled with an immense certitude that in all his life he had never tasted anything so good  lord man he mumbled between chews i never knew what appetite was till i hit the trail  sprague and stine arrived in the midst of this pleasant occupation  whats the delay sprague complained arent we ever going to get started  shorty dipped in turn and passed the spoon to kit nor did either speak till the pot was empty and the bottom scraped  of course we aint been doin nothing shorty said wiping his mouth with the back of his hand we aint been doin nothing at all and of course you aint had nothing to eat it was sure careless of me  yes yes stine said quickly we ate at one of the tentsfriends of ours  thought so shorty grunted  but now that youre finished let us get started sprague urged  theres the boat said shorty shes sure loaded now just how might you be goin about to get started  by climbing aboard and shoving off come on  they waded out and the employers got on board while kit and shorty shoved clear when the waves lapped the tops of their boots they clambered in the other two men were not prepared with the oars and the boat swept back and grounded half a dozen times with a great expenditure of energy this was repeated  shorty sat down disconsolately on the gunwale took a chew of tobacco and questioned the universe while kit baled the boat and the other two exchanged unkind remarks  if youll take my orders ill get her off sprague finally said  the attempt was well intended but before he could clamber on board he was wet to the waist  weve got to camp and build a fire he said as the boat grounded again im freezing  dont be afraid of a wetting stine sneered other men have gone off today wetter than you now im going to take her out  this time it was he who got the wetting and who announced with chattering teeth the need of a fire  a little splash like that sprague chattered spitefully well go on  shorty dig out my clothesbag and make a fire the other commanded  youll do nothing of the sort sprague cried  shorty looked from one to the other expectorated but did not move  hes working for me and i guess he obeys my orders stine retorted shorty take that bag ashore  shorty obeyed and sprague shivered in the boat kit having received no orders remained inactive glad of the rest  a boat divided against itself wont float he soliloquized  whats that sprague snarled at him  talking to myselfhabit of mine he answered  his employer favoured him with a hard look and sulked several minutes longer then he surrendered  get out my bag smoke he ordered and lend a hand with that fire we wont get off till morning now   next day the gale still blew lake linderman was no more than a narrow mountain gorge filled with water sweeping down from the mountains through this funnel the wind was irregular blowing great guns at times and at other times dwindling to a strong breeze  if you give me a shot at it i think i can get her off kit said when all was ready for the start  what do you know about it stine snapped at him  search me kit answered and subsided  it was the first time he had worked for wages in his life but he was learning the discipline of it fast obediently and cheerfully he joined in various vain efforts to get clear of the beach  how would you go about it sprague finally half panted half whined at him  sit down and get a good rest till a lull comes in the wind and then buck in for all were worth  simple as the idea was he had been the first to evolve it the first time it was applied it worked and they hoisted a blanket to the mast and sped down the lake stine and sprague immediately became cheerful shorty despite his chronic pessimism was always cheerful and kit was too interested to be otherwise sprague struggled with the steeringsweep for a quarter of an hour and then looked appealingly at kit who relieved him  my arms are fairly broken with the strain of it sprague muttered apologetically  you never ate bearmeat did you kit asked sympathetically  what the devil do you mean  oh nothing i was just wondering  but behind his employers back kit caught the approving grin of shorty who had already caught the whim of his metaphor  kit steered the length of linderman displaying an aptitude that caused both young men of money and disinclination for work to name him boatsteerer shorty was no less pleased and volunteered to continue cooking and leave the boat work to the other  between linderman and lake bennett was a portage the boat lightly loaded was lined down the small but violent connecting stream and here kit learned a vast deal more about boats and water but when it came to packing the outfit stine and sprague disappeared and their men spent two days of backbreaking toil in getting the outfit across and this was the history of many miserable days of the tripkit and shorty working to exhaustion while their masters toiled not and demanded to be waited upon  but the ironbound arctic winter continued to close down and they were held back by numerous and unavoidable delays at windy arm stine arbitrarily dispossessed kit of the steeringsweep and within the hour wrecked the boat on a wavebeaten lee shore two days were lost here in making repairs and the morning of the fresh start as they came down to embark on stern and bow in large letters was charcoaled the chechako  kit grinned at the appropriateness of the invidious word  huh said shorty when accused by stine i can sure read and spell an i know that chechako means tenderfoot but my education never went high enough to learn me to spell a jawbreaker like that  both employers looked daggers at kit for the insult rankled nor did he mention that the night before shorty had besought him for the spelling of that particular word  thats most as bad as your bearmeat slam at em shorty confided later  kit chuckled along with the continuous discovery of his own powers had come an everincreasing disapproval of the two masters it was not so much irritation which was always present as disgust he had got his taste of the meat and liked it but they were teaching him how not to eat it privily he thanked god that he was not made as they he came to dislike them to a degree that bordered on hatred their malingering bothered him less than their helpless inefficiency somewhere in him old isaac bellew and all the rest of the hardy bellews were making good  shorty he said one day in the usual delay of getting started i could almost fetch them a rap over the head with an oar and bury them in the river  same here shorty agreed theyre not meateaters theyre fisheaters and they sure stink   they came to the rapids first the box canyon and several miles below the white horse the box canyon was adequately named it was a box a trap once in it the only way out was through on either side arose perpendicular walls of rock the river narrowed to a fraction of its width and roared through this gloomy passage in a madness of motion that heaped the water in the center into a ridge fully eight feet higher than at the rocky sides this ridge in turn was crested with stiff upstanding waves that curled over yet remained each in its unvarying place the canyon was well feared for it had collected its toll of dead from the passing goldrushers  tying to the bank above where lay a score of other anxious boats kit and his companions went ahead on foot to investigate they crept to the brink and gazed down at the swirl of water sprague drew back shuddering  my god he exclaimed a swimmer hasnt a chance in that  shorty touched kit significantly with his elbow and said in an undertone  cold feet dollars to doughnuts they dont go through  kit scarcely heard from the beginning of the boat trip he had been learning the stubbornness and inconceivable viciousness of the elements and this glimpse of what was below him acted as a challenge weve got to ride that ridge he said if we get off it well hit the walls  and never know what hit us was shortys verdict can you swim smoke  id wish i couldnt if anything went wrong in there  thats what i say a stranger standing alongside and peering down into the canyon said mournfully and i wish i were through it  i wouldnt sell my chance to go through kit answered  he spoke honestly but it was with the idea of heartening the man he turned to go back to the boat  are you going to tackle it the man asked  kit nodded  i wish i could get the courage to the other confessed ive been here for hours the longer i look the more afraid i am i am not a boatman and i have with me only my nephew who is a young boy and my wife if you get through safely will you run my boat through  kit looked at shorty who delayed to answer  hes got his wife with him kit suggested nor had he mistaken his man  sure shorty affirmed it was just what i was stopping to think about i knew there was some reason i ought to do it  again they turned to go but sprague and stine made no movement  good luck smoke sprague called to him iller he hesitated ill just stay here and watch you  we need three men in the boat two at the oars and one at the steeringsweep kit said quietly  sprague looked at stine  im damned if i do said that gentleman if youre not afraid to stand here and look on im not  whos afraid sprague demanded hotly  stine retorted in kind and their two men left them in the thick of a squabble  we can do without them kit said to shorty you take the bow with a paddle and ill handle the steeringsweep all youll have to do is just to help keep her straight once were started you wont be able to hear me so just keep on keeping her straight  they cast off the boat and worked out to middle in the quickening current from the canyon came an evergrowing roar the river sucked in to the entrance with the smoothness of molten glass and here as the darkening walls received them shorty took a chew of tobacco and dipped his paddle the boat leaped on the first crests of the ridge and they were deafened by the uproar of wild water that reverberated from the narrow walls and multiplied itself they were halfsmothered with flying spray at times kit could not see his comrade at the bow it was only a matter of two minutes in which time they rode the ridge threequarters of a mile and emerged in safety and tied to the bank in the eddy below  shorty emptied his mouth of tobacco juicehe had forgotten to spitand spoke  that was bearmeat he exulted the real bearmeat say we want a few didnt we smoke i dont mind tellin you in confidence that before we started i was the goshdangdest scaredest man this side of the rocky mountains now im a beareater come on an well run that other boat through  midway back on foot they encountered their employers who had watched the passage from above  there comes the fisheaters said shorty keep to winward   after running the strangers boat through whose name proved to be breck kit and shorty met his wife a slender girlish woman whose blue eyes were moist with gratitude breck himself tried to hand kit fifty dollars and then attempted it on shorty  stranger was the latters rejection i come into this country to make money outa the ground an not outa my fellow critters  breck rummaged in his boat and produced a demijohn of whiskey shortys hand half went out to it and stopped abruptly he shook his head  theres that blamed white horse right below an they say its worse than the box i reckon i dont dast tackle any lightning  several miles below they ran in to the bank and all four walked down to look at the bad water the river which was a succession of rapids was here deflected toward the right bank by a rocky reef the whole body of water rushing crookedly into the narrow passage accelerated its speed frightfully and was upflung into huge waves white and wrathful this was the dread mane of the white horse and here an even heavier toll of dead had been exacted on one side of the mane was a corkscrew curlover and suckunder and on the opposite side was the big whirlpool to go through the mane itself must be ridden  this plum rips the strings outa the box shorty concluded  as they watched a boat took the head of the rapids above it was a large boat fully thirty feet long laden with several tons of outfit and handled by six men before it reached the mane it was plunging and leaping at times almost hidden by the foam and spray  shorty shot a slow sidelong glance at kit and said shes fair smoking and she hasnt hit the worst theyve hauled the oars in there she takes it now god shes gone no there she is  big as the boat was it had been buried from sight in the flying smother between crests the next moment in the thick of the mane the boat leaped up a crest and into view to kits amazement he saw the whole long bottom clearly outlined the boat for the fraction of an instant was in the air the men sitting idly in their places all save one in the stern who stood at the steeringsweep then came the downward plunge into the trough and a second disappearance three times the boat leaped and buried itself then those on the bank saw its nose take the whirlpool as it slipped off the mane the steersman vainly opposing with his full weight on the steeringgear surrendered to the whirlpool and helped the boat to take the circle  three times it went around each time so close to the rocks on which kit and shorty stood that either could have leaped on board the steersman a man with a reddish beard of recent growth waved his hand to them the only way out of the whirlpool was by the mane and on the third round the boat entered the mane obliquely at its upper end possibly out of fear of the draw of the whirlpool the steersman did not attempt to straighten out quickly enough when he did it was too late alternately in the air and buried the boat angled the mane and was sucked into and down through the stiff wall of the corkscrew on the opposite side of the river a hundred feet below boxes and bales began to float up then appeared the bottom of the boat and the scattered heads of six men two managed to make the bank in the eddy below the others were drawn under and the general flotsam was lost to view borne on by the swift current around the bend  there was a long minute of silence shorty was the first to speak  come on he said we might as well tackle it my feetll get cold if i stay here any longer  well smoke some kit grinned at him  and youll sure earn your name was the rejoinder shorty turned to their employers comin he queried  perhaps the roar of the water prevented them from hearing the invitation  shorty and kit tramped back through a foot of snow to the head of the rapids and cast off the boat kit was divided between two impressions one of the caliber of his comrade which served as a spur to him the other likewise a spur was the knowledge that old isaac bellew and all the other bellews had done things like this in their westward march of empire what they had done he could do it was the meat the strong meat and he knew as never before that it required strong men to eat such meat  youve sure got to keep the top of the ridge shorty shouted at him the plug of tobacco lifting to his mouth as the boat quickened in the quickening current and took the head of the rapids  kit nodded swayed his strength and weight tentatively on the steeringgear and headed the boat for the plunge  several minutes later halfswamped and lying against the bank in the eddy below the white horse shorty spat out a mouthful of tobacco juice and shook kits hand  meat meat shorty chanted we eat it raw we eat it alive  at the top of the bank they met breck his wife stood at a little distance kit shook his hand  im afraid your boat cant make it he said it is smaller than ours and a bit cranky  the man pulled out a row of bills  ill give you each a hundred if you run it through  kit looked out and up the tossing mane of the white horse a long gray twilight was falling it was turning colder and the landscape seemed taking on a savage bleakness  it aint that shorty was saying we dont want your money wouldnt touch it nohow but my pardner is the real meat with boats and when he says yourn aint safe i reckon he knows what hes talkin about  kit nodded affirmation and chanced to glance at mrs breck her eyes were fixed upon him and he knew that if ever he had seen prayer in a womans eyes he was seeing it then shorty followed his gaze and saw what he saw they looked at each other in confusion and did not speak moved by the common impulse they nodded to each other and turned to the trail that led to the head of the rapids they had not gone a hundred yards when they met stine and sprague coming down  where are you going the latter demanded  to fetch that other boat through shorty answered  no youre not its getting dark you two are going to pitch camp  so huge was kits disgust that he forebore to speak  hes got his wife with him shorty said  thats his lookout stine contributed  and smokes and mine was shortys retort  i forbid you sprague said harshly smoke if you go another step ill discharge you  and you too shorty stine added  and a hell of a pickle youll be in with us fired shorty replied howll you get your blamed boat to dawson wholl serve you coffee in your blankets and manicure your fingernails come on smoke they dont dast fire us besides weve got agreements if they fire us theyve got to divvy up grub to last us through the winter  barely had they shoved brecks boat out from the bank and caught the first rough water when the waves began to lap aboard they were small waves but it was an earnest of what was to come shorty cast back a quizzical glance as he gnawed at his inevitable plug and kit felt a strange rush of warmth at his heart for this man who couldnt swim and who couldnt back out  the rapids grew stiffer and the spray began to fly in the gathering darkness kit glimpsed the mane and the crooked fling of the current into it he worked into this crooked current and felt a glow of satisfaction as the boat hit the head of the mane squarely in the middle after that in the smother leaping and burying and swamping he had no clear impression of anything save that he swung his weight on the steeringoar and wished his uncle were there to see they emerged breathless wet through the boat filled with water almost to the gunwale lighter pieces of baggage and outfit were floating inside the boat a few careful strokes on shortys part worked the boat into the draw of the eddy and the eddy did the rest till the boat softly touched the bank looking down from above was mrs breck her prayer had been answered and the tears were streaming down her cheeks  you boys have simply got to take the money breck called down to them  shorty stood up slipped and sat down in the water while the boat dipped one gunwale under and righted again  damn the money said shorty fetch out that whiskey now that its over im getting cold feet an im sure likely to have a chill   in the morning as usual they were among the last of the boats to start breck despite his boating inefficiency and with only his wife and nephew for crew had broken camp loaded his boat and pulled out at the first streak of day but there was no hurrying stine and sprague who seemed incapable of realizing that the freezeup might come at any time they malingered got in the way delayed and doubled the work of kit and shorty  im sure losing my respect for god seein as he must a made them two mistakes in human form was the latters blasphemous way of expressing his disgust  well youre the real goods at any rate kit grinned back at him it makes me respect god the more just to look at you  he was sure goin some eh was shortys fashion of overcoming the embarrassment of the compliment  the trail by water crossed lake labarge here was no fast current but a tideless stretch of forty miles which must be rowed unless a fair wind blew but the time for fair wind was past and an icy gale blew in their teeth out of the north this made a rough sea against which it was almost impossible to pull the boat added to their troubles was driving snow also the freezing of the water on their oarblades kept one man occupied in chopping it off with a hatchet compelled to take their turn at the oars sprague and stine patently loafed kit had learned how to throw his weight on an oar but he noted that his employers made a seeming of throwing their weights and that they dipped their oars at a cheating angle  at the end of three hours sprague pulled his oar in and said they would run back into the mouth of the river for shelter stine seconded him and the several hardwon miles were lost a second day and a third the same fruitless attempt was made in the river mouth the continually arriving boats from white horse made a flotilla of over two hundred each day forty or fifty arrived and only two or three won to the northwest shore of the lake and did not come back ice was now forming in the eddies and connecting from eddy to eddy in thin lines around the points the freezeup was very imminent  we could make it if they had the souls of clams kit told shorty as they dried their moccasins by the fire on the evening of the third day we could have made it today if they hadnt turned back another hours work would have fetched that west shore theyretheyre babes in the woods  sure shorty agreed he turned his moccasin to the flame and debated a moment look here smoke its hundreds of miles to dawson if we dont want to freeze in here weve got to do something what dye say  kit looked at him and waited  weve got the immortal cinch on them two babes shorty expounded they can give orders an shed mazuma but as you say theyre plum babes if were goin to dawson we got to take charge of this here outfit  they looked at each other  its a go said kit as his hand went out in ratification  in the morning long before daylight shorty issued his call come on he roared tumble out you sleepers heres your coffee kick into it were goin to make a start  grumbling and complaining stine and sprague were forced to get under way two hours earlier than ever before if anything the gale was stiffer and in a short time every mans face was iced up while the oars were heavy with ice three hours they struggled and four one man steering one chopping ice two toiling at the oars and each taking his various turns the northwest shore loomed nearer and nearer the gale blew ever harder and at last sprague pulled in his oar in token of surrender shorty sprang to it though his relief had only begun  chop ice he said handing sprague the hatchet  but whats the use the other whined we cant make it were going to turn back  were going on said shorty chop ice an when you feel better you can spell me  it was heartbreaking toil but they gained the shore only to find it composed of surgebeaten rocks and cliffs with no place to land  i told you so sprague whimpered  you never peeped shorty answered  were going back  nobody spoke and kit held the boat into the seas as they skirted the forbidding shore sometimes they gained no more than a foot to the stroke and there were times when two or three strokes no more than enabled them to hold their own he did his best to hearten the two weaklings he pointed out that the boats which had won to this shore had never come back perforce he argued they had found a shelter somewhere ahead another hour they labored and a second  if you fellowsd put into your oars some of that coffee you swig in your blankets wed make it was shortys encouragement youre just goin through the motions an not pullin a pound  a few minutes later sprague drew in his oar  im finished he said and there were tears in his voice  so are the rest of us kit answered himself ready to cry or to commit murder so great was his exhaustion but were going on just the same  were going back turn the boat around  shorty if he wont pull take that oar yourself kit commanded  sure was the answer he can chop ice  but sprague refused to give over the oar stine had ceased rowing and the boat was drifting backward  turn around smoke sprague ordered  and kit who never in his life had cursed any man astonished himself  ill see you in hell first he replied take hold of that oar and pull  it is in moments of exhaustion that men lose all their reserves of civilization and such a moment had come each man had reached the breakingpoint sprague jerked off a mitten drew his revolver and turned it on his steersman this was a new experience to kit he had never had a gun presented at him in his life and now to his surprise it seemed to mean nothing at all it was the most natural thing in the world  if you dont put that gun up he said ill take it away and rap you over the knuckles with it  if you dont turn the boat around ill shoot you sprague threatened  then shorty took a hand he ceased chopping ice and stood up behind sprague  go on an shoot said shorty wiggling the hatchet im just aching for a chance to brain you go on an start the festivities  this is mutiny stine broke in you were engaged to obey orders  shorty turned on him oh youll get yours as soon as i finish with your pardner you little hogwallopin snooper you  sprague kit said ill give you just thirty seconds to put away that gun and get that oar out  sprague hesitated gave a short hysterical laugh put the revolver away and bent his back to the work  for two hours more inch by inch they fought their way along the edge of the foaming rocks until kit feared he had made a mistake and then when on the verge of himself turning back they came abreast of a narrow opening not twenty feet wide which led into a landlocked enclosure where the fiercest gusts scarcely flawed the surface it was the haven gained by the boats of previous days they landed on a shelving beach and the two employers lay in collapse in the boat while kit and shorty pitched the tent built a fire and started the cooking  whats a hogwalloping snooper shorty kit asked  blamed if i know was the answer but hes one just the same  the gale which had been dying quickly ceased at nightfall and it came on clear and cold a cup of coffee set aside to cool and forgotten a few minutes later was found coated with half an inch of ice at eight oclock when sprague and stine already rolled in their blankets were sleeping the sleep of exhaustion kit came back from a look at the boat  its the freezeup shorty he announced theres a skin of ice over the whole pond already  what are you going to do  theres only one thing the lake of course freezes first the rapid current of the river may keep it open for days this time tomorrow any boat caught in lake labarge remains there until next year  you mean we got to get out tonight now  kit nodded  tumble out you sleepers was shortys answer couched in a roar as he began casting off the guyropes of the tent  the other two awoke groaning with the pain of stiffened muscles and the pain of rousing from the sleep of exhaustion  what time is it stine asked  halfpast eight  its dark yet was the objection  shorty jerked out a couple of guyropes and the tent began to sag  its not morning he said its evening come on the lakes freezin we got to get acrost  stine sat up his face bitter and wrathful let it freeze were not going to stir  all right said shorty were goin on with the boat  you were engaged  to take your outfit to dawson shorty caught him up well were takin it aint we he punctuated his query by bringing half the tent down on top of them  they broke their way through the thin ice in the little harbor and came out on the lake where the water heavy and glassy froze on their oars with every stroke the water soon became like mush clogging the stroke of the oars and freezing in the air even as it dripped later the surface began to form a skin and the boat proceeded slower and slower  often afterwards when kit tried to remember that night and failed to bring up aught but nightmare recollections he wondered what must have been the sufferings of stine and sprague his one impression of himself was that he struggled through biting frost and intolerable exertion for a thousand years more or less  morning found them stationary stine complained of frosted fingers and sprague of his nose while the pain in kits cheeks and nose told him that he too had been touched with each accretion of daylight they could see farther and as far as they could see was icy surface the water of the lake was gone a hundred yards away was the shore of the north end shorty insisted that it was the opening of the river and that he could see water he and kit alone were able to work and with their oars they broke the ice and forced the boat along and at the last gasp of their strength they made the suck of the rapid river one look back showed them several boats which had fought through the night and were hopelessly frozen in then they whirled around a bend in a current running six miles an hour   day by day they floated down the swift river and day by day the shoreice extended farther out when they made camp at nightfall they chopped a space in the ice in which to lay the boat and carried the camp outfit hundreds of feet to shore in the morning they chopped the boat out through the new ice and caught the current shorty set up the sheetiron stove in the boat and over this stine and sprague hung through the long drifting hours they had surrendered no longer gave orders and their one desire was to gain dawson shorty pessimistic indefatigable and joyous at frequent intervals roared out the three lines of the first fourline stanza of a song he had forgotten the colder it got the oftener he sang       like argus of the ancient times        we leave this modern greece       tumtum tumtum tumtum tumtum        to shear the golden fleece  as they passed the mouths of the hootalinqua and the big and little salmon they found these streams throwing mushice into the main yukon this gathered about the boat and attached itself and at night they found themselves compelled to chop the boat out of the current in the morning they chopped the boat back into the current  the last night ashore was spent between the mouths of the white river and the stewart at daylight they found the yukon half a mile wide running white from icerimmed bank to icerimmed bank shorty cursed the universe with less geniality than usual and looked at kit  well be the last boat this year to make dawson kit said  but they aint no water smoke  then well ride the ice down come on  futilely protesting sprague and stine were bundled on board for half an hour with axes kit and shorty struggled to cut a way into the swift but solid stream when they did succeed in clearing the shoreice the floating ice forced the boat along the edge for a hundred yards tearing away half of one gunwale and making a partial wreck of it then at the lower end of the bend they caught the current that flung offshore they proceeded to work farther toward the middle the stream was no longer composed of mushice but of hard cakes in between the cakes only was mushice that froze solidly as they looked at it shoving with the oars against the cakes sometimes climbing out on the cakes in order to force the boat along after an hour they gained the middle five minutes after they ceased their exertions the boat was frozen in the whole river was coagulating as it ran cake froze to cake until at last the boat was the center of a cake seventyfive feet in diameter sometimes they floated sideways sometimes sternfirst while gravity tore asunder the forming fetters in the moving mass only to be manacled by fasterforming ones while the hours passed shorty stoked the stove cooked meals and chanted his warsong  night came and after many efforts they gave up the attempt to force the boat to shore and through the darkness they swept helplessly onward  what if we pass dawson shorty queried  well walk back kit answered if were not crushed in a jam  the sky was clear and in the light of the cold leaping stars they caught occasional glimpses of the loom of mountains on either hand at eleven oclock from below came a dull grinding roar their speed began to diminish and cakes of ice to upend and crash and smash about them the river was jamming one cake forced upward slid across their cake and carried one side of the boat away it did not sink for its own cake still upbore it but in a whirl they saw dark water show for an instant within a foot of them then all movement ceased at the end of half an hour the whole river picked itself up and began to move this continued for an hour when again it was brought to rest by a jam once again it started running swiftly and savagely with a great grinding then they saw lights ashore and when abreast gravity and the yukon surrendered and the river ceased for six months  on the shore at dawson curious ones gathered to watch the river freeze heard from out of the darkness the warsong of shorty       like argus of the ancient times        we leave this modern greece       tumtum tumtum tumtum tumtum        to shear the golden fleece   for three days kit and shorty labored carrying the ton and a half of outfit from the middle of the river to the logcabin stine and sprague had bought on the hill overlooking dawson this work finished in the warm cabin as twilight was falling sprague motioned kit to him outside the thermometer registered sixtyfive below zero  your full month isnt up smoke sprague said but here it is in full i wish you luck  how about the agreement kit asked you know theres a famine here a man cant get work in the mines even unless he has his own grub you agreed  i know of no agreement sprague interrupted do you stine we engaged you by the month theres your pay will you sign the receipt  kits hands clenched and for the moment he saw red both men shrank away from him he had never struck a man in anger in his life and he felt so certain of his ability to thrash sprague that he could not bring himself to do it  shorty saw his trouble and interposed  look here smoke i aint travelin no more with a ornery outfit like this right heres where i sure jump it you an me stick together savvy now you take your blankets an hike down to the elkhorn wait for me ill settle up collect whats comin an give them whats comin i aint no good on the water but my feets on terryfermy now an im sure goin to make smoke                                       half an hour afterwards shorty appeared at the elkhorn from his bleeding knuckles and the skin off one cheek it was evident that he had given stine and sprague what was coming  you ought to see that cabin he chuckled as they stood at the bar roughhouse aint no name for it dollars to doughnuts nary one of em shows up on the street for a week an now its all figgered out for you an me grubs a dollar an a half a pound they aint no work for wages without you have your own grub moosemeats sellin for two dollars a pound an they aint none we got enough money for a months grub an ammunition an we hike up the klondike to the back country if they aint no moose we go an live with the indians but if we aint got five thousand pounds of meat six weeks from now illill sure go back an apologize to our bosses is it a go  kits hand went out and they shook then he faltered i dont know anything about hunting he said  shorty lifted his glass  but youre a sure meateater an ill learn you     iii the stampede to squaw creek   two months after smoke bellew and shorty went after moose for a grubstake they were back in the elkhorn saloon at dawson the hunting was done the meat hauled in and sold for two dollars and a half a pound and between them they possessed three thousand dollars in gold dust and a good team of dogs they had played in luck despite the fact that the goldrush had driven the game a hundred miles or more into the mountains they had within half that distance bagged four moose in a narrow canyon  the mystery of the strayed animals was no greater than the luck of their killers for within the day four famished indian families reporting no game in three days journey back camped beside them meat was traded for starving dogs and after a week of feeding smoke and shorty harnessed the animals and began freighting the meat to the eager dawson market  the problem of the two men now was to turn their golddust into food the current price for flour and beans was a dollar and a half a pound but the difficulty was to find a seller dawson was in the throes of famine hundreds of men with money but no food had been compelled to leave the country many had gone down the river on the last water and many more with barely enough food to last had walked the six hundred miles over the ice to dyea  smoke met shorty in the warm saloon and found the latter jubilant  life aint no punkins without whiskey an sweetenin was shortys greeting as he pulled lumps of ice from his thawing moustache and flung them rattling on the floor an i sure just got eighteen pounds of that same sweetenin the geezer only charged three dollars a pound for it what luck did you have  i too have not been idle smoke answered with pride i bought fifty pounds of flour and theres a man up on adam creek who says hell let me have fifty pounds more tomorrow  great well sure live till the river opens say smoke them dogs of ourn is the goods a dogbuyer offered me two hundred apiece for the five of them i told him nothin doin they sure took on class when they got meat to get outside of but it goes against the grain feedin dogcritters on grub thats worth two an a half a pound come on an have a drink i just got to celebrate them eighteen pounds of sweetenin  several minutes later as he weighed in on the goldscales for the drinks he gave a start of recollection  i plum forgot that man i was to meet in the tivoli hes got some spoiled bacon hell sell for a dollar an a half a pound we can feed it to the dogs an save a dollar a day on eachs boardbill so long  so long said smoke im goin to the cabin an turn in  hardly had shorty left the place when a furclad man entered through the double stormdoors his face lighted at sight of smoke who recognized him as breck the man whose boat they had run through the box canyon and white horse rapids  i heard you were in town breck said hurriedly as they shook hands been looking for you for half an hour come outside i want to talk with you  smoke looked regretfully at the roaring redhot stove  wont this do  no its important come outside  as they emerged smoke drew off one mitten lighted a match and glanced at the thermometer that hung beside the door he remittened his naked hand hastily as if the frost had burned him overhead arched the flaming aurora borealis while from all dawson arose the mournful howling of thousands of wolfdogs  what did it say breck asked  sixty below kit spat experimentally and the spittle crackled in the air and the thermometer is certainly working its falling all the time an hour ago it was only fiftytwo dont tell me its a stampede  it is breck whispered back cautiously casting anxious eyes about in fear of some other listener you know squaw creekempties in on the other side of the yukon thirty miles up  nothing doing there was smokes judgment it was prospected years ago  so were all the other rich creeks listen its big only eight to twenty feet to bedrock there wont be a claim that dont run to half a million its a dead secret two or three of my close friends let me in on it i told my wife right away that i was going to find you before i started now so long my packs hidden down the bank in fact when they told me they made me promise not to pull out until dawson was asleep you know what it means if youre seen with a stampeding outfit get your partner and follow you ought to stake fourth or fifth claim from discovery dont forgetsquaw creek its the third after you pass swede creek   when smoke entered the little cabin on the hillside back of dawson he heard a heavy familiar breathing  aw go to bed shorty mumbled as smoke shook his shoulder im not on the night shift was his next remark as the rousing hand became more vigorous tell your troubles to the barkeeper  kick into your clothes smoke said weve got to stake a couple of claims  shorty sat up and started to explode but smokes hand covered his mouth  ssh smoke warned its a big strike dont wake the neighborhood dawsons asleep  huh you got to show me nobody tells anybody about a strike of course not but aint it plum amazin the way everybody hits the trail just the same  squaw creek smoke whispered its right breck gave me the tip shallow bedrock gold from the grassroots down come on well sling a couple of light packs together and pull out  shortys eyes closed as he lapsed back into sleep the next moment his blankets were swept off him  if you dont want them i do smoke explained  shorty followed the blankets and began to dress  goin to take the dogs he asked  no the trail up the creek is sure to be unbroken and we can make better time without them  then ill throw em a meal whichll have to last em till we get back be sure you take some birchbark and a candle  shorty opened the door felt the bite of the cold and shrank back to pull down his earflaps and mitten his hands  five minutes later he returned sharply rubbing his nose  smoke im sure opposed to makin this stampede its colder than the hinges of hell a thousand years before the first fire was lighted besides its friday the thirteenth an were goin to trouble as the sparks fly upward  with small stampedingpacks on their backs they closed the door behind them and started down the hill the display of the aurora borealis had ceased and only the stars leaped in the great cold and by their uncertain light made traps for the feet shorty floundered off a turn of the trail into deep snow and raised his voice in blessing of the date of the week and month and year  cant you keep still smoke chided leave the almanac alone youll have all dawson awake and after us  huh see the light in that cabin an in that one over there an hear that door slam oh sure dawsons asleep them lights just buryin their dead they aint stampedin betcher life they aint  by the time they reached the foot of the hill and were fairly in dawson lights were springing up in the cabins doors were slamming and from behind came the sound of many moccasins on the hardpacked snow again shorty delivered himself  but it beats hell the amount of mourners there is  they passed a man who stood by the path and was calling anxiously in a low voice oh charley get a move on  see that pack on his back smoke the graveyards sure a long ways off when the mourners got to pack their blankets  by the time they reached the main street a hundred men were in line behind them and while they sought in the deceptive starlight for the trail that dipped down the bank to the river more men could be heard arriving shorty slipped and shot down the thirtyfoot chute into the soft snow smoke followed knocking him over as he was rising to his feet  i found it first he gurgled taking off his mittens to shake the snow out of the gauntlets  the next moment they were scrambling wildly out of the way of the hurtling bodies of those that followed at the time of the freezeup a jam had occurred at this point and cakes of ice were upended in snowcovered confusion after several hard falls smoke drew out his candle and lighted it those in the rear hailed it with acclaim in the windless air it burned easily and he led the way more quickly  its a sure stampede shorty decided or might all them be sleepwalkers  were at the head of the procession at any rate was smokes answer  oh i dont know mebbe thats a firefly ahead there mebbe theyre all firefliesthat one an that one look at em believe me they is a whole string of processions ahead  it was a mile across the jams to the west bank of the yukon and candles flickered the full length of the twisting trail behind them clear to the top of the bank they had descended were more candles  say smoke this aint no stampede its a exodeus they must be a thousand men ahead of us an ten thousand behind now you listen to your uncle my medicines good when i get a hunch its sure right an were in wrong on this stampede lets turn back an hit the sleep  youd better save your breath if you intend to keep up smoke retorted gruffly  huh my legs is short but i slog along slack at the knees an dont worry my muscles none an i can sure walk every piker here off the ice  and smoke knew he was right for he had long since learned his comrades phenomenal walking powers  ive been holding back to give you a chance smoke jeered  an im plum troddin on your heels if you cant do better let me go ahead and set pace  smoke quickened and was soon at the rear of the nearest bunch of stampeders  hike along you smoke the other urged walk over them unburied dead this aint no funeral hit the frost like you was goin somewheres  smoke counted eight men and two women in this party and before the way across the jamice was won he and shorty had passed another party twenty strong within a few feet of the west bank the trail swerved to the south emerging from the jam upon smooth ice the ice however was buried under several feet of fine snow through this the sledtrail ran a narrow ribbon of packed footing barely two feet in width on either side one sank to his knees and deeper in the snow the stampeders they overtook were reluctant to give way and often smoke and shorty had to plunge into the deep snow and by supreme efforts flounder past  shorty was irrepressible and pessimistic when the stampeders resented being passed he retorted in kind  whats your hurry one of them asked  whats yours he answered a stampede come down from indian river yesterday afternoon an beat you to it they aint no claims left  that being so i repeat whats your hurry  who me i aint no stampeder im workin for the government im on official business im just traipsin along to take the census of squaw creek  to another who hailed him with where away little one do you really expect to stake a claim shorty answered  me im the discoverer of squaw creek im just comin back from recordin so as to see no blamed chechako jumps my claim  the average pace of the stampeders on the smooth going was three miles and a half an hour smoke and shorty were doing four and a half though sometimes they broke into short runs and went faster  im going to travel your feet clean off shorty smoke challenged  huh i can hike along on the stumps an wear the heels off your moccasins though it aint no use ive been figgerin creek claims is five hundred feet call em ten to the mile theys a thousand stampeders ahead of us an that creek aint no hundred miles long somebodys goin to get left an it makes a noise like you an me  before replying smoke let out an unexpected link that threw shorty half a dozen feet in the rear if you saved your breath and kept up wed cut down a few of that thousand he chided  who me if youd get outa the way id show you a pace what is  smoke laughed and let out another link the whole aspect of the adventure had changed through his brain was running a phrase of the mad philosopherthe transvaluation of values in truth he was less interested in staking a fortune than in beating shorty after all he concluded it wasnt the reward of the game but the playing of it that counted mind and muscle and stamina and soul were challenged in a contest with this shorty a man who had never opened the books and who did not know grand opera from ragtime nor an epic from a chilblain  shorty ive got you skinned to death ive reconstructed every cell in my body since i hit the beach at dyea my flesh is as stringy as whipcords and as bitter and mean as the bite of a rattlesnake a few months ago id have patted myself on the back to write such words but i couldnt have written them i had to live them first and now that im living them theres no need to write them im the real bitter stinging goods and no scrub of a mountaineer can put anything over on me without getting it back compound now you go ahead and set pace for half an hour do your worst and when youre all in ill go ahead and give you half an hour of the real worst  huh shorty sneered genially an him not dry behind the ears yet get outa the way an let your father show you some goin  halfhour by halfhour they alternated in setting pace nor did they talk much their exertions kept them warm though their breath froze on their faces from lips to chin so intense was the cold that they almost continually rubbed their noses and cheeks with their mittens a few minutes cessation from this allowed the flesh to grow numb and then most vigorous rubbing was required to produce the burning prickle of returning circulation  often they thought they had reached the lead but always they overtook more stampeders who had started before them occasionally groups of men attempted to swing in behind to their pace but invariably they were discouraged after a mile or two and disappeared in the darkness to the rear  weve been out on trail all winter was shortys comment an them geezers soft from layin around their cabins has the nerve to think they can keep our stride now if they was real sourdoughs itd be different if theres one thing a sourdough can do its sure walk  once smoke lighted a match and glanced at his watch he never repeated it for so quick was the bite of the frost on his bared hands that half an hour passed before they were again comfortable  four oclock he said as he pulled on his mittens and weve already passed three hundred  three hundred and thirtyeight shorty corrected i been keepin count get outa the way stranger let somebody stampede that knows how to stampede  the latter was addressed to a man evidently exhausted who could no more than stumble along and who blocked the trail this and one other were the only playedout men they encountered for they were very near to the head of the stampede nor did they learn till afterwards the horrors of that night exhausted men sat down to rest by the way and failed to get up again seven were frozen to death while scores of amputations of toes feet and fingers were performed in the dawson hospitals on the survivors for the stampede to squaw creek occurred on the coldest night of the year before morning the spirit thermometers at dawson registered seventy degrees below zero the men composing the stampede with few exceptions were newcomers in the country who did not know the way of the cold  the other playedout man they found a few minutes later revealed by a streamer of aurora borealis that shot like a searchlight from horizon to zenith he was sitting on a piece of ice beside the trail  hop along sister mary shorty gaily greeted him keep movin if you sit there youll freeze stiff  the man made no response and they stopped to investigate  stiff as a poker was shortys verdict if you tumbled him over hed break  see if hes breathing smoke said as with bared hand he sought through furs and woollens for the mans heart  shorty lifted one earflap and bent to the iced lips nary breathe he reported  nor heartbeat said smoke  he mittened his hand and beat it violently for a minute before exposing it to the frost to strike a match it was an old man incontestably dead in the moment of illumination they saw a long grey beard massed with ice to the nose cheeks that were white with frost and closed eyes with frostrimmed lashes frozen together then the match went out  come on shorty said rubbing his ear we cant do nothin for the old geezer an ive sure frosted my ear now all the blamed skinll peel off and itll be sore for a week  a few minutes later when a flaming ribbon spilled pulsating fire over the heavens they saw on the ice a quarter of a mile ahead two forms beyond for a mile nothing moved  theyre leading the procession smoke said as darkness fell again come on lets get them  at the end of half an hour not yet having overtaken the two in front shorty broke into a run  if we catch em well never pass em he panted lord what a pace theyre hittin dollars to doughnuts theyre no chechakos theyre the real sourdough variety you can stack on that  smoke was leading when they finally caught up and he was glad to ease to a walk at their heels almost immediately he got the impression that the one nearer him was a woman how this impression came he could not tell hooded and furred the dark form was as any form yet there was a haunting sense of familiarity about it he waited for the next flame of the aurora and by its light saw the smallness of the moccasined feet but he saw morethe walk and knew it for the unmistakable walk he had once resolved never to forget  shes a sure goer shorty confided hoarsely ill bet its an indian  how do you do miss gastell smoke addressed her  how do you do she answered with a turn of the head and a quick glance its too dark to see who are you  smoke  she laughed in the frost and he was certain it was the prettiest laughter he had ever heard and have you married and raised all those children you were telling me about before he could retort she went on how many chechakos are there behind  several thousand i imagine we passed over three hundred and they werent wasting any time  its the old story she said bitterly the newcomers get in on the rich creeks and the oldtimers who dared and suffered and made this country get nothing oldtimers made this discovery on squaw creekhow it leaked out is the mysteryand they sent word up to all the oldtimers on sea lion but its ten miles farther than dawson and when they arrive theyll find the creek staked to the skyline by the dawson chechakos it isnt right it isnt fair such perversity of luck  it is too bad smoke sympathized but im hanged if i know what youre going to do about it first come first served you know  i wish i could do something she flashed back at him id like to see them all freeze on the trail or have everything terrible happen to them so long as the sea lion stampede arrived first  youve certainly got it in for us hard he laughed  it isnt that she said quickly man by man i know the crowd from sea lion and they are men they starved in this country in the old days and they worked like giants to develop it i went through the hard times on the koyukuk with them when i was a little girl and i was with them in the birch creek famine and in the forty mile famine they are heroes and they deserve some reward and yet here are thousands of green softlings who havent earned the right to stake anything miles and miles ahead of them and now if youll forgive my tirade ill save my breath for i dont know when you and all the rest may try to pass dad and me  no further talk passed between joy and smoke for an hour or so though he noticed that for a time she and her father talked in low tones  i know em now shorty told smoke hes old louis gastell an the real goods that must be his kid he come into this country so long ago they aint nobody can recollect an he brought the girl with him she only a baby him an beetles was tradin partners an they ran the first dinkey little steamboat up the koyukuk  i dont think well try to pass them smoke said were at the head of the stampede and there are only four of us  shorty agreed and another hour of silence followed during which they swung steadily along at seven oclock the blackness was broken by a last display of the aurora borealis which showed to the west a broad opening between snowclad mountains  squaw creek joy exclaimed  goin some shorty exulted we oughtnt to been there for another half hour to the least accordin to my reckonin i must a been spreadin my legs  it was at this point that the dyea trail baffled by icejams swerved abruptly across the yukon to the east bank and here they must leave the hardpacked maintravelled trail mount the jams and follow a dim trail but slightly packed that hovered the west bank  louis gastell leading slipped in the darkness on the rough ice and sat up holding his ankle in both his hands he struggled to his feet and went on but at a slower pace and with a perceptible limp after a few minutes he abruptly halted  its no use he said to his daughter ive sprained a tendon you go ahead and stake for me as well as yourself  cant we do something smoke asked solicitously  louis gastell shook his head she can stake two claims as well as one ill crawl over to the bank start a fire and bandage my ankle ill be all right go on joy stake ours above the discovery claim its richer higher up  heres some birch bark smoke said dividing his supply equally well take care of your daughter  louis gastell laughed harshly thank you just the same he said but she can take care of herself follow her and watch her  do you mind if i lead she asked smoke as she headed on i know this country better than you  lead on smoke answered gallantly though i agree with you its a darned shame all us chechakos are going to beat that sea lion bunch to it isnt there some way to shake them  she shook her head we cant hide our trail and theyll follow it like sheep  after a quarter of a mile she turned sharply to the west smoke noticed that they were going through unpacked snow but neither he nor shorty observed that the dim trail they had been on still led south had they witnessed the subsequent procedure of louis gastell the history of the klondike would have been written differently for they would have seen that oldtimer no longer limping running with his nose to the trail like a hound following them also they would have seen him trample and widen the turn to the fresh trail they had made to the west and finally they would have seen him keep on the old dim trail that still led south  a trail did run up the creek but so slight was it that they continually lost it in the darkness after a quarter of an hour joy gastell was willing to drop into the rear and let the two men take turns in breaking a way through the snow this slowness of the leaders enabled the whole stampede to catch up and when daylight came at nine oclock as far back as they could see was an unbroken line of men joys dark eyes sparkled at the sight  how long since we started up the creek she asked  fully two hours smoke answered  and two hours back make four she laughed the stampede from sea lion is saved  a faint suspicion crossed smokes mind and he stopped and confronted her  i dont understand he said  you dont then ill tell you this is norway creek squaw creek is the next to the south  smoke was for the moment speechless  you did it on purpose shorty demanded  i did it to give the oldtimers a chance she laughed mockingly the men grinned at each other and finally joined her id lay you across my knee an give you a wallopin if women folk wasnt so scarce in this country shorty assured her  your father didnt sprain a tendon but waited till we were out of sight and then went on smoke asked  she nodded  and you were the decoy  again she nodded and this time smokes laughter rang out clear and true it was the spontaneous laughter of a frankly beaten man  why dont you get angry with me she queried ruefully oror wallop me  well we might as well be starting back shorty urged my feets gettin cold standin here  smoke shook his head that would mean four hours lost we must be eight miles up this creek now and from the look ahead norway is making a long swing south well follow it then cross over the divide somehow and tap squaw creek somewhere above discovery he looked at joy wont you come along with us i told your father wed look after you  i she hesitated i think i shall if you dont mind she was looking straight at him and her face was no longer defiant and mocking really mr smoke you make me almost sorry for what i have done but somebody had to save the oldtimers  it strikes me that stampeding is at best a sporting proposition  and it strikes me you two are very game about it she went on then added with the shadow of a sigh what a pity you are not oldtimers  for two hours more they kept to the frozen creekbed of norway then turned into a narrow and rugged tributary that flowed from the south at midday they began the ascent of the divide itself behind them looking down and back they could see the long line of stampeders breaking up here and there in scores of places thin smokecolumns advertised the making of camps  as for themselves the going was hard they wallowed through snow to their waists and were compelled to stop every few yards to breathe shorty was the first to call a halt  we been hittin the trail for over twelve hours he said smoke im plum willin to say im good an tired an so are you an im free to shout that i can sure hang on to this here pasear like a starvin indian to a hunk of bearmeat but this poor girl here cant keep her legs no time if she dont get something in her stomach heres where we build a fire what dye say  so quickly so deftly and methodically did they go about making a temporary camp that joy watching with jealous eyes admitted to herself that the oldtimers could not do it better spruce boughs with a spread blanket on top gave a foundation for rest and cooking operations but they kept away from the heat of the fire until noses and cheeks had been rubbed cruelly  smoke spat in the air and the resultant crackle was so immediate and loud that he shook his head i give it up he said ive never seen cold like this  one winter on the koyukuk it went to eightysix below joy answered its at least seventy or seventyfive right now and i know ive frosted my cheeks theyre burning like fire  on the steep slope of the divide there was no ice so snow as fine and hard and crystalline as granulated sugar was poured into the goldpan by the bushel until enough water was melted for the coffee smoke fried bacon and thawed biscuits shorty kept the fuel supplied and tended the fire and joy set the simple table composed of two plates two cups two spoons a tin of mixed salt and pepper and a tin of sugar when it came to eating she and smoke shared one set between them they ate out of the same plate and drank from the same cup  it was nearly two in the afternoon when they cleared the crest of the divide and began dropping down a feeder of squaw creek earlier in the winter some moosehunter had made a trail up the canyonthat is in going up and down he had stepped always in his previous tracks as a result in the midst of soft snow and veiled under later snow falls was a line of irregular hummocks if ones foot missed a hummock he plunged down through unpacked snow and usually to a fall also the moosehunter had been an exceptionally longlegged individual joy who was eager now that the two men should stake and fearing that they were slackening their pace on account of her evident weariness insisted on taking her turn in the lead the speed and manner in which she negotiated the precarious footing called out shortys unqualified approval  look at her he cried shes the real goods an the red meat look at them moccasins swing along no highheels there she uses the legs god gave her shes the right squaw for any bearhunter  she flashed back a smile of acknowledgment that included smoke he caught a feeling of chumminess though at the same time he was bitingly aware that it was very much of a woman who embraced him in that comradely smile  looking back as they came to the bank of squaw creek they could see the stampede strung out irregularly struggling along the descent of the divide  they slipped down the bank to the creek bed the stream frozen solidly to bottom was from twenty to thirty feet wide and ran between six and eightfoot earth banks of alluvial wash no recent feet had disturbed the snow that lay upon its ice and they knew they were above the discovery claim and the last stakes of the sea lion stampeders  look out for springs joy warned as smoke led the way down the creek at seventy below youll lose your feet if you break through  these springs common to most klondike streams never cease at the lowest temperatures the water flows out from the banks and lies in pools which are cuddled from the cold by later surfacefreezings and snow falls thus a man stepping on dry snow might break through half an inch of iceskin and find himself up to the knees in water in five minutes unless able to remove the wet gear the loss of ones foot was the penalty  though only three in the afternoon the long grey twilight of the arctic had settled down they watched for a blazed tree on either bank which would show the centerstake of the last claim located joy impulsively eager was the first to find it she darted ahead of smoke crying somebodys been here see the snow look for the blaze there it is see that spruce  she sank suddenly to her waist in the snow  now ive done it she said woefully then she cried dont come near me ill wade out  step by step each time breaking through the thin skin of ice concealed under the dry snow she forced her way to solid footing smoke did not wait but sprang to the bank where dry and seasoned twigs and sticks lodged amongst the brush by spring freshets waited the match by the time she reached his side the first flames and flickers of an assured fire were rising  sit down he commanded  she obediently sat down in the snow he slipped his pack from his back and spread a blanket for her feet  from above came the voices of the stampeders who followed them  let shorty stake she urged  go on shorty smoke said as he attacked her moccasins already stiff with ice pace off a thousand feet and place the two centerstakes we can fix the cornerstakes afterwards  with his knife smoke cut away the lacings and leather of the moccasins so stiff were they with ice that they snapped and crackled under the hacking and sawing the siwash socks and heavy woollen stockings were sheaths of ice it was as if her feet and calves were encased in corrugated iron  how are your feet he asked as he worked  pretty numb i cant move nor feel my toes but it will be all right the fire is burning beautifully watch out you dont freeze your own hands they must be numb now from the way youre fumbling  he slipped his mittens on and for nearly a minute smashed the open hands savagely against his sides when he felt the bloodprickles he pulled off the mittens and ripped and tore and sawed and hacked at the frozen garments the white skin of one foot appeared then that of the other to be exposed to the bite of seventy below zero which is the equivalent of one hundred and two below freezing  then came the rubbing with snow carried on with an intensity of cruel fierceness till she squirmed and shrank and moved her toes and joyously complained of the hurt  he halfdragged her and she halflifted herself nearer to the fire he placed her feet on the blanket close to the fleshsaving flames  youll have to take care of them for a while he said  she could now safely remove her mittens and manipulate her own feet with the wisdom of the initiated being watchful that the heat of the fire was absorbed slowly while she did this he attacked his hands the snow did not melt nor moisten its light crystals were like so much sand slowly the stings and pangs of circulation came back into the chilled flesh then he tended the fire unstrapped the light pack from her back and got out a complete change of footgear  shorty returned along the creek bed and climbed the bank to them i sure staked a full thousan feet he proclaimed number twentyseven an number twentyeight though id only got the upper stake of twentyseven when i met the first geezer of the bunch behind he just straight declared i wasnt goin to stake twentyeight an i told him  yes yes joy cried what did you tell him  well i told him straight that if he didnt back up plum five hundred feet id sure punch his frozen nose into icecream an chocolate eclaires he backed up an ive got in the centerstakes of two full an honest fivehundredfoot creek claims he staked next and i guess by now the bunch has squaw creek located to headwaters an down the other side ourn is safe its too dark to see now but we can put out the cornerstakes in the mornin   when they awoke they found a change had taken place during the night so warm was it that shorty and smoke still in their mutual blankets estimated the temperature at no more than twenty below the cold snap had broken on top of their blankets lay six inches of frost crystals  good morning how are your feet was smokes greeting across the ashes of the fire to where joy gastell carefully shaking aside the snow was sitting up in her sleepingfurs  shorty built the fire and quarried ice from the creek while smoke cooked breakfast daylight came on as they finished the meal  you go an fix them cornerstakes smoke shorty said theres gravel under where i chopped ice for the coffee an im goin to melt water and wash a pan of that same gravel for luck  smoke departed axe in hand to blaze the stakes starting from the downstream centerstake of twentyseven he headed at right angles across the narrow valley towards its rim he proceeded methodically almost automatically for his mind was alive with recollections of the night before he felt somehow that he had won to empery over the delicate lines and firm muscles of those feet and ankles he had rubbed with snow and this empery seemed to extend to the rest and all of this woman of his kind in dim and fiery ways a feeling of possession mastered him it seemed that all that was necessary was for him to walk up to this joy gastell take her hand in his and say come  it was in this mood that he discovered something that made him forget empery over the white feet of woman at the valley rim he blazed no cornerstake he did not reach the valley rim but instead he found himself confronted by another stream he lined up with his eye a blasted willow tree and a big and recognizable spruce he returned to the stream where were the centerstakes he followed the bed of the creek around a wide horseshoe bend through the flat and found that the two creeks were the same creek next he floundered twice through the snow from valley rim to valley rim running the first line from the lower stake of twentyseven the second from the upper stake of twentyeight and he found that the upper stake of the latter was lower than the lower stake of the former in the gray twilight and halfdarkness shorty had located their two claims on the horseshoe  smoke plodded back to the little camp shorty at the end of washing a pan of gravel exploded at sight of him  we got it shorty cried holding out the pan look at it a nasty mess of gold two hundred right there if its a cent she runs rich from the top of the washgravel ive churned around placers some but i never got butter like whats in this pan  smoke cast an incurious glance at the coarse gold poured himself a cup of coffee at the fire and sat down joy sensed something wrong and looked at him with eagerly solicitous eyes shorty however was disgruntled by his partners lack of delight in the discovery  why dont you kick in an get excited he demanded we got our pile right here unless youre stickin up your nose at twohundreddollar pans  smoke took a swallow of coffee before replying shorty why are our two claims here like the panama canal  whats the answer  well the eastern entrance of the panama canal is west of the western entrance thats all  go on shorty said i aint seen the joke yet  in short shorty you staked our two claims on a big horseshoe bend  shorty set the gold pan down in the snow and stood up go on he repeated  the upper stake of twentyeight is ten feet below the lower stake of twentyseven  you mean we aint got nothin smoke  worse than that weve got ten feet less than nothing  shorty departed down the bank on the run five minutes later he returned in response to joys look he nodded without speech he went over to a log and sat down to gaze steadily at the snow in front of his moccasins  we might as well break camp and start back for dawson smoke said beginning to fold the blankets  i am sorry smoke joy said its all my fault  its all right he answered all in the days work you know  but its my fault wholly mine she persisted dads staked for me down near discovery i know ill give you my claim  he shook his head  shorty she pleaded  shorty shook his head and began to laugh it was a colossal laugh chuckles and muffled explosions yielded to hearty roars  it aint hysterics he explained i sure get powerful amused at times an this is one of them  his gaze chanced to fall on the goldpan he walked over and gravely kicked it scattering the gold over the landscape  it aint ourn he said it belongs to the geezer i backed up five hundred feet last night an what gets me is four hundred an ninety of them feet was to the goodhis good come on smoke lets start the hike to dawson though if youre hankerin to kill me i wont lift a finger to prevent     iv shorty dreams   funny you dont gamble none shorty said to smoke one night in the elkhorn aint it in your blood  it is smoke answered but the statistics are in my head i like an even break for my money  all about them in the huge barroom arose the click and rattle and rumble of a dozen games at which furclad moccasined men tried their luck smoke waved his hand to include them all  look at them he said its cold mathematics that they will lose more than they win tonight that the big proportion are losing right now  youre sure strong on figgers shorty murmured admiringly an in the main youre right but theys such a thing as facts an one fact is streaks of luck theys times when every geezer playin wins as i know for ive sat in such games an saw moren one bank busted the only way to win at gamblin is wait for a hunch that youve got a lucky streak comin and then play it to the roof  it sounds simple smoke criticized so simple i cant see how men can lose  the trouble is shorty admitted that most men gets fooled on their hunches on occasion i sure get fooled on mine the thing is to try an find out  smoke shook his head thats a statistic too shorty most men prove wrong on their hunches  but dont you ever get one of them streaky feelins that all you got to do is put your money down an pick a winner  smoke laughed im too scared of the percentage against me but ill tell you what shorty ill throw a dollar on the high card right now and see if it will buy us a drink  smoke was edging his way in to the faro table when shorty caught his arm  hold on im gettin one of them hunches now you put that dollar on roulette  they went over to a roulette table near the bar  wait till i give the word shorty counselled  what number smoke asked  pick it yourself but wait till i say let her go  you dont mean to say ive got an even chance on that table smoke argued  as good as the next geezers  but not as good as the banks  wait an see shorty urged now let her go  the gamekeeper had just sent the little ivory ball whirling around the smooth rim above the revolving manyslotted wheel smoke at the lower end of the table reached over a player and blindly tossed the dollar it slid along the smooth green cloth and stopped fairly in the center of 34  the ball came to rest and the gamekeeper announced thirtyfour wins he swept the table and alongside of smokes dollar stacked thirtyfive dollars smoke drew the money in and shorty slapped him on the shoulder  now that was the real goods of a hunch smoke howd i know it theres no tellin i just knew youd win why if that dollar of yournd fell on any other number itd won just the same when the hunch is right you just cant help winnin  suppose it had come double naught smoke queried as they made their way to the bar  then your dollard been on double naught was shortys answer theys no gettin away from it a hunch is a hunch heres how come on back to the table i got a hunch after pickin you for a winner that i can pick some few numbers myself  are you playing a system smoke asked at the end of ten minutes when his partner had dropped a hundred dollars  shorty shook his head indignantly as he spread his chips out in the vicinities of 3 11 and 17 and tossed a spare chip on the green  hell is sure cluttered with geezers that played systems he exposited as the keeper raked the table  from idly watching smoke became fascinated following closely every detail of the game from the whirling of the ball to the making and the paying of the bets he made no plays however merely contenting himself with looking on yet so interested was he that shorty announcing that he had had enough with difficulty drew smoke away from the table  the gamekeeper returned shorty the goldsack he had deposited as a credential for playing and with it went a slip of paper on which was scribbled out35000 shorty carried the sack and the paper across the room and handed them to the weigher who sat behind a large pair of goldscales out of shortys sack he weighed three hundred and fifty dollars which he poured into the coffer of the house  that hunch of yours was another one of those statistics smoke jeered  i had to play it didnt i in order to find out shorty retorted i reckon i was crowdin some just on account of tryin to convince you theys such a thing as hunches  never mind shorty smoke laughed ive got a hunch right now  shortys eyes sparkled as he cried eagerly what is it kick in an play it pronto  its not that kind shorty now what ive got is a hunch that some day ill work out a system that will beat the spots off that table  system shorty groaned then surveyed his partner with a vast pity smoke listen to your sidekicker an leave system alone systems is sure losers they aint no hunches in systems  thats why i like them smoke answered a system is statistical when you get the right system you cant lose and thats the difference between it and a hunch you never know when the right hunch is going wrong  but i know a lot of systems that went wrong an i never seen a system win shorty paused and sighed look here smoke if youre gettin cracked on systems this aint no place for you an its about time we hit the trail again   during the several following weeks the two partners played at cross purposes smoke was bent on spending his time watching the roulette game in the elkhorn while shorty was equally bent on travelling trail at last smoke put his foot down when a stampede was proposed for two hundred miles down the yukon  look here shorty he said im not going that trip will take ten days and before that time i hope to have my system in proper working order i could almost win with it now what are you dragging me around the country this way for anyway  smoke i got to take care of you was shortys reply youre gettin nutty id drag you stampedin to jericho or the north pole if i could keep you away from that table  its all right shorty but just remember ive reached full mangrown meateating size the only dragging youll do will be dragging home the dust im going to win with that system of mine and youll most likely have to do it with a dogteam  shortys response was a groan  and i dont want you to be bucking any games on your own smoke went on were going to divide the winnings and ill need all our money to get started that systems young yet and its liable to trip me for a few falls before i get it lined up   at last after long hours and days spent at watching the table the night came when smoke proclaimed he was ready and shorty glum and pessimistic with all the seeming of one attending a funeral accompanied his partner to the elkhorn smoke bought a stack of chips and stationed himself at the gamekeepers end of the table again and again the ball was whirled and the other players won or lost but smoke did not venture a chip shorty waxed impatient  buck in buck in he urged lets get this funeral over whats the matter got cold feet  smoke shook his head and waited a dozen plays went by and then suddenly he placed ten onedollar chips on 26 the number won and the keeper paid smoke three hundred and fifty dollars a dozen plays went by twenty plays and thirty when smoke placed ten dollars on 32 again he received three hundred and fifty dollars  its a hunch shorty whispered vociferously in his ear ride it ride it  half an hour went by during which smoke was inactive then he placed ten dollars on 34 and won  a hunch shorty whispered  nothing of the sort smoke whispered back its the system isnt she a dandy  you cant tell me shorty contended hunches comes in mighty funny ways you might think its a system but it aint systems is impossible they cant happen its a sure hunch youre playin  smoke now altered his play he bet more frequently with single chips scattered here and there and he lost more often than he won  quit it shorty advised cash in youve rung the bullseye three times an youre ahead a thousand you cant keep it up  at this moment the ball started whirling and smoke dropped ten chips on 26 the ball fell into the slot of 26 and the keeper again paid him three hundred and fifty dollars  if youre plum crazy an got the immortal cinch bet em the limit shorty said put down twentyfive next time  a quarter of an hour passed during which smoke won and lost on small scattering bets then with the abruptness that characterized his big betting he placed twentyfive dollars on the double naught and the keeper paid him eight hundred and seventyfive dollars  wake me up smoke im dreamin shorty moaned  smoke smiled consulted his notebook and became absorbed in calculation he continually drew the notebook from his pocket and from time to time jotted down figures  a crowd had packed densely around the table while the players themselves were attempting to cover the same numbers he covered it was then that a change came over his play ten times in succession he placed ten dollars on 18 and lost at this stage he was deserted by the hardiest he changed his number and won another three hundred and fifty dollars immediately the players were back with him deserting again after a series of losing bets  quit it smoke quit it shorty advised the longest string of hunches is only so long an your strings finished no more bullseyes for you  im going to ring her once again before i cash in smoke answered  for a few minutes with varying luck he played scattering chips over the table and then dropped twentyfive dollars on the double naught  ill take my slip now he said to the dealer as he won  oh you dont need to show it to me shorty said as they walked to the weigher i been keepin track youre something like thirtysix hundred to the good how near am i  thirtysixsixty smoke replied and now youve got to pack the dust home that was the agreement   dont crowd your luck shorty pleaded with smoke the next night in the cabin as he evidenced preparations to return to the elkhorn you played a mighty long string of hunches but you played it out if you go back youll sure drop all your winnings  but i tell you it isnt hunches shorty its statistics its a system it cant lose  system be damned they aint no such a thing as system i made seventeen straight passes at a crap table once was it system nope it was fool luck only i had cold feet an didnt dast let it ride if itd rid instead of me drawin down after the third pass id a won over thirty thousan on the original twobit piece  just the same shorty this is a real system  huh you got to show me  i did show you come on with me now and ill show you again  when they entered the elkhorn all eyes centered on smoke and those about the table made way for him as he took up his old place at the keepers end his play was quite unlike that of the previous night in the course of an hour and a half he made only four bets but each bet was for twentyfive dollars and each bet won he cashed in thirtyfive hundred dollars and shorty carried the dust home to the cabin  nows the time to jump the game shorty advised as he sat on the edge of his bunk and took off his moccasins youre seven thousan ahead a mans a fool thatd crowd his luck harder  shorty a man would be a blithering lunatic if he didnt keep on backing a winning system like mine  smoke youre a sure bright boy youre collegelearnt you know moren a minute than i could know in forty thousan years but just the same youre dead wrong when you call your luck a system ive been around some an seen a few an i tell you straight an confidential an allassurin a system to beat a bankin game aint possible  but im showing you this one its a pipe  no youre not smoke its a pipedream im asleep bimeby ill wake up an build the fire an start breakfast  well my unbelieving friend theres the dust heft it  so saying smoke tossed the bulging goldsack upon his partners knees it weighed thirtyfive pounds and shorty was fully aware of the crush of its impact on his flesh  its real smoke hammered his point home  huh ive saw some mighty real dreams in my time in a dream all things is possible in real life a system aint possible now i aint never been to college but im plum justified in sizin up this gamblin orgy of ourn as a sureenough dream  hamiltons law of parsimony smoke laughed  i aint never heard of the geezer but his dopes sure right im dreamin smoke an youre just snoopin around in my dream an tormentin me with system if you love me if you sure do love me youll just yell shorty wake up an ill wake up an start breakfast   the third night of play as smoke laid his first bet the gamekeeper shoved fifteen dollars back to him  tens all you can play he said the limits come down  gettin picayune shorty sneered  no one has to play at this table that dont want to the keeper retorted and im willing to say straight out in meeting that wed sooner your pardner didnt play at our table  scared of his system eh shorty challenged as the keeper paid over three hundred and fifty dollars  i aint saying i believe in system because i dont there never was a system thatd beat roulette or any percentage game but just the same ive seen some queer strings of luck and i aint going to let this bank go bust if i can help it  cold feet  gambling is just as much business my friend as any other business we aint philanthropists  night by night smoke continued to win his method of play varied expert after expert in the jam about the table scribbled down his bets and numbers in vain attempts to work out his system they complained of their inability to get a clew to start with and swore that it was pure luck though the most colossal streak of it they had ever seen  it was smokes varied play that obfuscated them sometimes consulting his notebook or engaging in long calculations an hour elapsed without his staking a chip at other times he would win three limitbets and clean up a thousand dollars and odd in five or ten minutes at still other times his tactics would be to scatter single chips prodigally and amazingly over the table this would continue for from ten to thirty minutes of play when abruptly as the ball whirled through the last few of its circles he would play the limit on column colour and number and win all three once to complete confusion in the minds of those that strove to divine his secret he lost forty straight bets each at the limit but each night play no matter how diversely shorty carried home thirtyfive hundred dollars for him  it aint no system shorty expounded at one of their bedgoing discussions i follow you an follow you but they aint no figgerin it out you never play twice the same all you do is pick winners when you want to an when you dont want to you just on purpose dont  maybe youre nearer right than you think shorty ive just got to pick losers sometimes its part of the system  systemhell ive talked with every gambler in town an the last one is agreed they aint no such thing as system  yet im showing them one all the time  look here smoke shorty paused over the candle in the act of blowing it out im real irritated maybe you think this is a candle it aint no sir an this aint me neither im out on trail somewheres in my blankets lyin flat on my back with my mouth open an dreamin all this that aint you talkin any more than this candle is a candle  its funny how i happen to be dreaming along with you then smoke persisted  no it aint youre part of my dream thats all ive hearn many a man talk in my dreams i want to tell you one thing smoke im gettin mangy an mad if this here dream keeps up much more im goin to bite my veins an howl   on the sixth night of play at the elkhorn the limit was reduced to five dollars  its all right smoke assured the gamekeeper i want thirtyfive hundred tonight as usual and you only compel me to play longer ive got to pick twice as many winners thats all  why dont you buck somebody elses table the keeper demanded wrathfully  because i like this one smoke glanced over to the roaring stove only a few feet away besides there are no draughts here and it is warm and comfortable  on the ninth night when shorty had carried the dust home he had a fit i quit smoke i quit he began i know when i got enough i aint dreamin im wide awake a system cant be but you got one just the same theres nothin in the rule o three the almanacs clean out the worlds gone smash theres nothin regular an uniform no more the multiplication tables gone loco two is eight nine is eleven and twotimessix is eight hundred an fortysixanan a half anything is everything an nothings all an twice all is coldcream milkshakes an calico horses youve got a system figgers beat the figgerin what aint is an what isnt has to be the sun rises in the west the moons a paystreak the stars is canned cornbeef scurvys the blessin of god him that dies kicks again rocks floats waters gas i aint me youre somebody else an mebbe were twins if we aint hashedbrown potatoes fried in verdigris wake me up somebody oh wake me up   the next morning a visitor came to the cabin smoke knew him harvey moran the owner of all the games in the tivoli there was a note of appeal in his deep gruff voice as he plunged into his business  its like this smoke he began youve got us all guessing im representing nine other gameowners and myself from all the saloons in town we dont understand we know that no system ever worked against roulette all the mathematic sharps in the colleges have told us gamblers the same thing they say that roulette itself is the system the one and only system and therefore that no system can beat it for that would mean arithmetic has gone bughouse  shorty nodded his head violently  if a system can beat a system then theres no such thing as system the gambler went on in such a case anything could be possiblea thing could be in two different places at once or two things could be in the same place thats only large enough for one at the same time  well youve seen me play smoke answered defiantly and if you think its only a string of luck on my part why worry  thats the trouble we cant help worrying its a system youve got and all the time we know it cant be ive watched you five nights now and all i can make out is that you favour certain numbers and keep on winning now the ten of us gameowners have got together and we want to make a friendly proposition well put a roulettetable in a back room of the elkhorn pool the bank against you and have you buck us it will be all quiet and private just you and shorty and us what do you say  i think its the other way around smoke answered its up to you to come and see me ill be playing in the barroom of the elkhorn tonight you can watch me there just as well   that night when smoke took up his customary place at the table the keeper shut down the game the games closed he said bosss orders  but the assembled gameowners were not to be balked in a few minutes they arranged a pool each putting in a thousand and took over the table  come on and buck us harvey moran challenged as the keeper sent the ball on its first whirl around  give me the twentyfive limit smoke suggested  sure go to it  smoke immediately placed twentyfive chips on the double naught and won  moran wiped the sweat from his forehead go on he said we got ten thousand in this bank  at the end of an hour and a half the ten thousand was smokes  the banks bust the keeper announced  got enough smoke asked  the gameowners looked at one another they were awed they the fatted proteges of the laws of chance were undone they were up against one who had more intimate access to those laws or who had invoked higher and undreamed laws  we quit moran said aint that right burke  big burke who owned the games in the m and g saloon nodded the impossible has happened he said this smoke here has got a system all right if we let him go on well all bust all i can see if were goin to keep our tables running is to cut down the limit to a dollar or to ten cents or a cent he wont win much in a night with such stakes  all looked at smoke  he shrugged his shoulders in that case gentlemen ill have to hire a gang of men to play at all your tables i can pay them ten dollars for a fourhour shift and make money  then well shut down our tables big burke replied unless he hesitated and ran his eye over his fellows to see that they were with him unless youre willing to talk business what will you sell the system for  thirty thousand dollars smoke answered thats a tax of three thousand apiece  they debated and nodded  and youll tell us your system  surely  and youll promise not to play roulette in dawson ever again  no sir smoke said positively ill promise not to play this system again  my god moran exploded you havent got other systems have you  hold on shorty cried i want to talk to my pardner come over here smoke on the side  smoke followed into a quiet corner of the room while hundreds of curious eyes centered on him and shorty  look here smoke shorty whispered hoarsely mebbe it aint a dream in which case youre sellin out almighty cheap youve sure got the world by the slack of its pants theys millions in it shake it shake it hard  but if its a dream smoke queried softly  then for the sake of the dream an the love of mike stick them gamblers up good and plenty whats the good of dreamin if you cant dream to the real right dead sure eternal finish  fortunately this isnt a dream shorty  then if you sell out for thirty thousan ill never forgive you  when i sell out for thirty thousand youll fall on my neck an wake up to find out that you havent been dreaming at all this is no dream shorty in about two minutes youll see you have been wide awake all the time let me tell you that when i sell out its because ive got to sell out  back at the table smoke informed the gameowners that his offer still held they proffered him their paper to the extent of three thousand each  hold out for the dust shorty cautioned  i was about to intimate that id take the money weighed out smoke said  the owner of the elkhorn cashed their paper and shorty took possession of the golddust  now i dont want to wake up he chortled as he hefted the various sacks toted up its a seventy thousan dream itd be too blamed expensive to open my eyes roll out of the blankets an start breakfast  whats your system big burke demanded weve paid for it and we want it  smoke led the way to the table now gentlemen bear with me a moment this isnt an ordinary system it can scarcely be called legitimate but its one great virtue is that it works ive got my suspicious but im not saying anything you watch mr keeper be ready with the ball wait i am going to pick 26 consider ive bet on it be ready mr keepernow  the ball whirled around  you observe smoke went on that 9 was directly opposite  the ball finished in 26  big burke swore deep in his chest and all waited  for double naught to win 11 must be opposite try it yourself and see  but the system moran demanded impatiently we know you can pick winning numbers and we know what those numbers are but how do you do it  by observed sequences by accident i chanced twice to notice the ball whirled when 9 was opposite both times 26 won after that i saw it happen again then i looked for other sequences and found them double naught opposite fetches 32 and 11 fetches double naught it doesnt always happen but it usually happens you notice i say usually as i said before i have my suspicions but im not saying anything  big burke with a sudden flash of comprehension reached over stopped the wheel and examined it carefully the heads of the nine other gameowners bent over and joined in the examination big burke straightened up and cast a glance at the nearby stove  hell he said it wasnt any system at all the table stood close to the fire and the blamed wheels warped and weve been worked to a frazzle no wonder he liked this table he couldnt have bucked for sour apples at any other table  harvey moran gave a great sigh of relief and wiped his forehead well anyway he said its cheap at the price just to find out that it wasnt a system his face began to work and then he broke into laughter and slapped smoke on the shoulder smoke you had us going for a while and we patting ourselves on the back because you were letting our tables alone say ive got some real fizz ill open if youll all come over to the tivoli with me  later back in the cabin shorty silently overhauled and hefted the various bulging goldsacks he finally piled them on the table sat down on the edge of his bunk and began taking off his moccasins  seventy thousan he calculated it weighs three hundred and fifty pounds and all out of a warped wheel an a quick eye smoke you eatm raw you eatm alive you work under water youve given me the jimjams but just the same i know its a dream its only in dreams that the good things comes true im almighty unanxious to wake up i hope i never wake up  cheer up smoke answered you wont there are a lot of philosophy sharps that think men are sleepwalkers youre in good company  shorty got up went to the table selected the heaviest sack and cuddled it in his arms as if it were a baby i may be sleepwalkin he said but as you say im sure in mighty good company     v the man on the other bank   it was before smoke bellew staked the farcical townsite of tralee made the historic corner of eggs that nearly broke swiftwater bills bank account or won the dogteam race down the yukon for an even million dollars that he and shorty parted company on the upper klondike shortys task was to return down the klondike to dawson to record some claims they had staked  smoke with the dogteam turned south his quest was surprise lake and the mythical two cabins his traverse was to cut the headwaters of the indian river and cross the unknown region over the mountains to the stewart river here somewhere rumour persisted was surprise lake surrounded by jagged mountains and glaciers its bottom paved with raw gold oldtimers it was said whose very names were forgotten in the frosts of earlier years had dived into the icy waters of surprise lake and fetched lumpgold to the surface in both hands at different times parties of oldtimers had penetrated the forbidding fastness and sampled the lakes golden bottom but the water was too cold some died in the water being pulled up dead others died later of consumption and one who had gone down never did come up all survivors had planned to return and drain the lake yet none had ever gone back disaster always smote them one man fell into an airhole below forty mile another was killed and eaten by his dogs a third was crushed by a falling tree and so the tale ran surprise lake was a hoodoo its location was unremembered and the gold still paved its undrained bottom  two cabins no less mythical was more definitely located five sleeps up the mcquestion river from the stewart stood two ancient cabins so ancient were they that they must have been built before ever the first known goldhunter had entered the yukon basin wandering moosehunters whom even smoke had met and talked with claimed to have found the two cabins in the old days but to have sought vainly for the mine which those early adventurers must have worked  i wish you was goin with me shorty said wistfully at parting just because you got the indian bug aint no reason for to go pokin into trouble theys no gettin away from it thats loco country youre bound for the hoodoos sure on it from the first flip to the last call judgin from all you an me has hearn tell about it  its all right shorty replied smoke ill make the round trip and be back in dawson in six weeks the yukon trail is packed and the first hundred miles or so of the stewart ought to be packed oldtimers from henderson have told me a number of outfits went up last fall after the freezeup when i strike their trail i ought to hit her up forty or fifty miles a day im likely to be back inside a month once i get across  yep once you get acrost but its the gettin acrost that worries me well so long smoke keep your eyes open for that hoodoo thats all an dont be ashamed to turn back if you dont kill any meat   a week later smoke found himself among the jumbled ranges south of indian river on the divide from the klondike he had abandoned the sled and packed his wolfdogs the six big huskies each carried fifty pounds and on his own back was an equal burden through the soft snow he led the way packing it down under his snowshoes and behind in single file toiled the dogs  he loved the life the deep arctic winter the silent wilderness the unending snowsurface unpressed by the foot of any man about him towered icy peaks unnamed and uncharted no hunters campsmoke rising in the still air of the valleys ever caught his eye he alone moved through the brooding quiet of the untravelled wastes nor was he oppressed by the solitude he loved it all the days toil the bickering wolfdogs the making of the camp in the long twilight the leaping stars overhead and the flaming pageant of the aurora borealis  especially he loved his camp at the end of the day and in it he saw a picture which he ever yearned to paint and which he knew he would never forgeta beaten place in the snow where burned his fire his bed a couple of rabbitskin robes spread on freshchopped spruceboughs his shelter a stretched strip of canvas that caught and threw back the heat of the fire the blackened coffeepot and pail resting on a length of log the moccasins propped on sticks to dry the snowshoes upended in the snow and across the fire the wolfdogs snuggling to it for the warmth wistful and eager furry and frostrimed with bushy tails curled protectingly over their feet and all about pressed backward but a space the wall of encircling darkness  at such times san francisco the billow and ohara seemed very far away lost in a remote past shadows of dreams that had never happened he found it hard to believe that he had known any other life than this of the wild and harder still was it for him to reconcile himself to the fact that he had once dabbled and dawdled in the bohemian drift of city life alone with no one to talk to he thought much and deeply and simply he was appalled by the wastage of his city years by the cheapness now of the philosophies of the schools and books of the clever cynicism of the studio and editorial room of the cant of the business men in their clubs they knew neither food nor sleep nor health nor could they ever possibly know the sting of real appetite the goodly ache of fatigue nor the rush of mad strong blood that bit like wine through all ones body as work was done  and all the time this fine wise spartan northland had been here and he had never known what puzzled him was that with such intrinsic fitness he had never heard the slightest calling whisper had not himself gone forth to seek but this too he solved in time  look here yellow face ive got it clear  the dog addressed lifted first one forefoot and then the other with quick appeasing movements curled his bush of a tail about them again and laughed across the fire  herbert spencer was nearly forty before he caught the vision of his greatest efficiency and desire im none so slow i didnt have to wait till i was thirty to catch mine right here is my efficiency and desire almost yellow face do i wish i had been born a wolfboy and been brother all my days to you and yours  for days he wandered through a chaos of canyons and divides which did not yield themselves to any rational topographical plan it was as if they had been flung there by some cosmic joker in vain he sought for a creek or feeder that flowed truly south toward the mcquestion and the stewart then came a mountain storm that blew a blizzard across the riffraff of high and shallow divides above timberline fireless for two days he struggled blindly to find lower levels on the second day he came out upon the rim of an enormous palisade so thickly drove the snow that he could not see the base of the wall nor dared he attempt the descent he rolled himself in his robes and huddled the dogs about him in the depths of a snowdrift but did not permit himself to sleep  in the morning the storm spent he crawled out to investigate a quarter of a mile beneath him beyond all mistake lay a frozen snowcovered lake about it on every side rose jagged peaks it answered the description blindly he had found surprise lake  well named he muttered an hour later as he came out upon its margin a clump of aged spruce was the only woods on his way to it he stumbled upon three graves snowburied but marked by handhewn headposts and undecipherable writing on the edge of the woods was a small ramshackle cabin he pulled the latch and entered in a corner on what had once been a bed of spruceboughs still wrapped in mangy furs that had rotted to fragments lay a skeleton the last visitor to surprise lake was smokes conclusion as he picked up a lump of gold as large as his doubled fist beside the lump was a peppercan filled with nuggets of the size of walnuts roughsurfaced showing no signs of wash  so true had the tale run that smoke accepted without question that the source of the gold was the lakes bottom under many feet of ice and inaccessible there was nothing to be done and at midday from the rim of the palisade he took a farewell look back and down at his find  its all right mr lake he said you just keep right on staying there im coming back to drain youif that hoodoo doesnt catch me i dont know how i got here but ill know by the way i go out   in a little valley beside a frozen stream and under beneficent spruce trees he built a fire four days later somewhere in that white anarchy he had left behind him was surprise lakesomewhere he knew not where for a hundred hours of driftage and struggle through blinding driving snow had concealed his course from him and he knew not in what direction lay behind it was as if he had just emerged from a nightmare he was not sure whether four days or a week had passed he had slept with the dogs fought across a forgotten number of shallow divides followed the windings of weird canyons that ended in pockets and twice had managed to make a fire and thaw out frozen moosemeat and here he was wellfed and wellcamped the storm had passed and it had turned clear and cold the lay of the land had again become rational the creek he was on was natural in appearance and tended as it should toward the southwest but surprise lake was as lost to him as it had been to all its seekers in the past  half a days journey down the creek brought him to the valley of a larger stream which he decided was the mcquestion here he shot a moose and once again each wolfdog carried a full fiftypound pack of meat as he turned down the mcquestion he came upon a sledtrail the late snows had drifted over but underneath it was well packed by travel his conclusion was that two camps had been established on the mcquestion and that this was the connecting trail evidently two cabins had been found and it was the lower camp so he headed down the stream  it was forty below zero when he camped that night and he fell asleep wondering who were the men who had rediscovered the two cabins and if he would fetch it next day at the first hint of dawn he was under way easily following the halfobliterated trail and packing the recent snow with his webbed shoes so that the dogs should not wallow  and then it came the unexpected leaping out upon him on a bend of the river it seemed to him that he heard and felt simultaneously the crack of the rifle came from the right and the bullet tearing through and across the shoulders of his drill parka and woollen coat pivoted him half around with the shock of its impact he staggered on his twisted snowshoes to recover balance and heard a second crack of the rifle this time it was a clean miss he did not wait for more but plunged across the snow for the sheltering trees of the bank a hundred feet away again and again the rifle cracked and he was unpleasantly aware of a trickle of warm moisture down his back  he climbed the bank the dogs floundering behind and dodged in among the trees and brush slipping out of his snowshoes he wallowed forward at full length and peered cautiously out nothing was to be seen whoever had shot at him was lying quiet among the trees of the opposite bank  if something doesnt happen pretty soon he muttered at the end of half an hour ill have to sneak away and build a fire or freeze my feet yellow face whatd you do lying in the frost with circulation getting slack and a man trying to plug you  he crawled back a few yards packed down the snow danced a jig that sent the blood back into his feet and managed to endure another half hour then from down the river he heard the unmistakable jingle of dogbells peering out he saw a sled round the bend only one man was with it straining at the geepole and urging the dogs along the effect on smoke was one of shock for it was the first human he had seen since he parted from shorty three weeks before his next thought was of the potential murderer concealed on the opposite bank  without exposing himself smoke whistled warningly the man did not hear and came on rapidly again and more sharply smoke whistled the man whoad his dogs stopped and had turned and faced smoke when the rifle cracked the instant afterwards smoke fired into the wood in the direction of the sound the man on the river had been struck by the first shot the shock of the high velocity bullet staggered him he stumbled awkwardly to the sled halffalling and pulled a rifle out from under the lashings as he strove to raise it to his shoulder he crumpled at the waist and sank down slowly to a sitting posture on the sled then abruptly as the gun went off aimlessly he pitched backward and across a corner of the sledload so that smoke could see only his legs and stomach  from below came more jingling bells the man did not move around the bend swung three sleds accompanied by half a dozen men smoke cried warningly but they had seen the condition of the first sled and they dashed on to it no shots came from the other bank and smoke calling his dogs to follow emerged into the open there were exclamations from the men and two of them flinging off the mittens of their right hands levelled their rifles at him  come on you redhanded murderer you one of them a blackbearded man commanded an jest pitch that gun of yourn in the snow  smoke hesitated then dropped his rifle and came up to them  go through him louis an take his weapons the blackbearded man ordered  louis was a frenchcanadian voyageur smoke decided as were four of the others his search revealed only smokes hunting knife which was appropriated  now what have you got to say for yourself stranger before i shoot you dead the blackbearded man demanded  that youre making a mistake if you think i killed that man smoke answered  a cry came from one of the voyageurs he had quested along the trail and found smokes tracks where he had left it to take refuge on the bank the man explained the nature of his find  whatd you kill joe kinade for he of the black beard asked  i tell you i didnt smoke began  aw whats the good of talkin we got you redhanded right up theres where you left the trail when you heard him comin you laid among the trees an bushwhacked him a short shot you couldnt a missed pierre go an get that gun he dropped  you might let me tell what happened smoke objected  you shut up the man snarled at him i reckon your gunll tell the story  all the men examined smokes rifle ejecting and counting the cartridges and examining the barrel at muzzle and breech  one shot blackbeard concluded  pierre with nostrils that quivered and distended like a deers sniffed at the breech  him one fresh shot he said  the bullet entered his back smoke said he was facing me when he was shot you see it came from the other bank  blackbeard considered this proposition for a scant second and shook his head nope it wont do turn him around to face the other bankthats how you whopped him in the back some of you boys run up an down the trail and see if you can see any tracks making for the other bank  their report was that on that side the snow was unbroken not even a snowshoe rabbit had crossed it blackbeard bending over the dead man straightened up with a woolly furry wad in his hand shredding this he found imbedded in the center the bullet which had perforated the body its nose was spread to the size of a half dollar its buttend steeljacketed was undamaged he compared it with a cartridge from smokes belt  thats plain enough evidence stranger to satisfy a blind man its softnosed an steeljacketed yourn is softnosed and steeljacketed its thirtythirty yourn is thirtythirty its manufactured by the j and t arms company yourn is manufactured by the j and t arms company now you come along an well go over to the bank an see jest how you done it  i was bushwhacked myself smoke said look at the hole in my parka  while blackbeard examined it one of the voyageurs threw open the breech of the dead mans gun it was patent to all that it had been fired once the empty cartridge was still in the chamber  a damn shame poor joe didnt get you blackbeard said bitterly but he did pretty well with a hole like that in him come on you  search the other bank first smoke urged  you shut up an come on an let the facts do the talkin  they left the trail at the same spot he had and followed it on up the bank and then in among the trees  him dance that place keep him feet warm louis pointed out that place him crawl on belly that place him put one elbow wen him shoot  and by god theres the empty cartridge he done it with was blackbeards discovery boys theres only one thing to do  you might ask me how i came to fire that shot smoke interrupted  an i might knock your teeth into your gullet if you butt in again you can answer them questions later on now boys were decent an lawabidin an we got to handle this right an regular how far do you reckon weve come pierre  twenty mile i tink for sure  all right well cache the outfit an run him an poor joe back to two cabins i reckon weve seen an can testify to whatll stretch his neck   it was three hours after dark when the dead man smoke and his captors arrived at two cabins by the starlight smoke could make out a dozen or more recently built cabins snuggling about a larger and older cabin on a flat by the river bank thrust inside this older cabin he found it tenanted by a young giant of a man his wife and an old blind man the woman whom her husband called lucy was herself a strapping creature of the frontier type the old man as smoke learned afterwards had been a trapper on the stewart for years and had gone finally blind the winter before the camp of two cabins he was also to learn had been made the previous fall by a dozen men who arrived in half as many polingboats loaded with provisions here they had found the blind trapper on the site of two cabins and about his cabin they had built their own later arrivals mushing up the ice with dog teams had tripled the population there was plenty of meat in camp and good lowpay dirt had been discovered and was being worked  in five minutes all the men of two cabins were jammed into the room smoke shoved off into a corner ignored and scowled at his hands and feet tied with thongs of moosehide looked on thirtyeight men he counted a wild and husky crew all frontiersmen of the states or voyageurs from upper canada his captors told the tale over and over each the center of an excited and wrathful group there were mutterings of lynch him now why wait and once a big irishman was restrained only by force from rushing upon the helpless prisoner and giving him a beating  it was while counting the men that smoke caught sight of a familiar face it was breck the man whose boat smoke had run through the rapids he wondered why the other did not come and speak to him but himself gave no sign of recognition later when with shielded face breck passed him a significant wink smoke understood  blackbeard whom smoke heard called eli harding ended the discussion as to whether or not the prisoner should be immediately lynched  hold on harding roared keep your shirts on that man belongs to me i caught him an i brought him here dye think i brought him all the way here to be lynched not on your life i could a done that myself when i found him i brought him here for a fair an impartial trial an by god a fair an impartial trial hes goin to get hes tied up safe an sound chuck him in a bunk till morning an well hold the trial right here   smoke woke up a draught that possessed all the rigidity of an icicle was boring into the front of his shoulders as he lay on his side facing the wall when he had been tied into the bunk there had been no such draught and now the outside air driving into the heated atmosphere of the cabin with the pressure of fifty below zero was sufficient advertizement that some one from without had pulled away the mosschinking between the logs he squirmed as far as his bonds would permit then craned his neck forward until his lips just managed to reach the crack  who is it he whispered  breck came the almost inaudible answer be careful you dont make a noise im going to pass a knife in to you  no good smoke said i couldnt use it my hands are tied behind me and made fast to the leg of the bunk besides you couldnt get a knife through that crack but something must be done those fellows are of a temper to hang me and of course you know i didnt kill that man  it wasnt necessary to mention it smoke and if you did you had your reasons which isnt the point at all i want to get you out of this its a tough bunch of men here youve seen them theyre shut off from the world and they make and enforce their own lawby miners meeting you know they handled two men alreadyboth grubthieves one they hiked from camp without an ounce of grub and no matches he made about forty miles and lasted a couple of days before he froze stiff two weeks ago they hiked the second man they gave him his choice no grub or ten lashes for each days ration he stood for forty lashes before he fainted and now theyve got you and every last one is convinced you killed kinade  the man who killed kinade shot at me too his bullet broke the skin on my shoulder get them to delay the trial till some one goes up and searches the bank where the murderer hid  no use they take the evidence of harding and the five frenchmen with him besides they havent had a hanging yet and theyre keen for it you see things have been pretty monotonous they havent located anything big and they got tired of hunting for surprise lake they did some stampeding the first part of the winter but theyve got over that now scurvy is beginning to show up amongst them too and theyre just ripe for excitement  and it looks like ill furnish it was smokes comment say breck how did you ever fall in with such a godforsaken bunch  after i got the claims at squaw creek opened up and some men to working i came up here by way of the stewart hunting for two cabins theyd beaten me to it so ive been higher up the stewart just got back yesterday out of grub  find anything  nothing much but i think ive got a hydraulic proposition thatll work big when the countrys opened up its that or a golddredger  hold on smoke interrupted wait a minute let me think  he was very much aware of the snores of the sleepers as he pursued the idea that had flashed into his mind  say breck have they opened up the meatpacks my dogs carried he asked  a couple i was watching they put them in hardings cache  did they find anything  meat  good youve got to get into the browncanvas pack thats patched with moosehide youll find a few pounds of lumpy gold youve never seen gold like it in the country nor has anybody else heres what youve got to do listen  a quarter of an hour later fully instructed and complaining that his toes were freezing breck went away smoke his own nose and one cheek frosted by proximity to the chink rubbed them against the blankets for half an hour before the blaze and bite of the returning blood assured him of the safety of his flesh   my minds made up right now there aint no doubt but what he killed kinade we heard the whole thing last night whats the good of goin over it again i vote guilty  in such fashion smokes trial began the speaker a loosejointed hardrock man from colorado manifested irritation and disgust when harding set his suggestion aside demanded the proceedings should be regular and nominated one shunk wilson for judge and chairman of the meeting the population of two cabins constituted the jury though after some discussion the woman lucy was denied the right to vote on smokes guilt or innocence  while this was going on smoke jammed into a corner on a bunk overheard a whispered conversation between breck and a miner  you havent fifty pounds of flour youll sell breck queried  you aint got the dust to pay the price im askin was the reply  ill give you two hundred  the man shook his head  three hundred threefifty  at four hundred the man nodded and said come on over to my cabin an weigh out the dust  the two squeezed their way to the door and slipped out after a few minutes breck returned alone  harding was testifying when smoke saw the door shoved open slightly and in the crack appear the face of the man who had sold the flour he was grimacing and beckoning emphatically to some one inside who arose from near the stove and started to work toward the door  where are you goin sam shunk wilson demanded  ill be back in a jiffy sam explained i jes got to go  smoke was permitted to question the witnesses and he was in the middle of the crossexamination of harding when from without came the whining of dogs in harness and the grind and churn of sledrunners somebody near the door peeped out  its sam an his pardner an a dogteam hellbent down the trail for stewart river the man reported  nobody spoke for a long halfminute but men glanced significantly at one another and a general restlessness pervaded the packed room out of the corner of his eye smoke caught a glimpse of breck lucy and her husband whispering together  come on you shunk wilson said gruffly to smoke cut this questionin short we know what youre tryin to provethat the other bank want searched the witness admits it we admit it it want necessary no tracks led to that bank the snow want broke  there was a man on the other bank just the same smoke insisted  thats too thin for skatin young man there aint many of us on the mcquestion an we got every man accounted for  who was the man you hiked out of camp two weeks ago smoke asked  alonzo miramar he was a mexican whats that grubthief got to do with it  nothing except that you havent accounted for him mr judge  he went down the river not up  how do you know where he went  saw him start  and thats all you know of what became of him  no it aint young man i know we all know he had four days grub an no gun to shoot meat with if he didnt make the settlement on the yukon hed croaked long before this  i suppose youve got all the guns in this part of the country accounted for too smoke observed pointedly  shunk wilson was angry youd think i was the prisoner the way you slam questions into me now then come on with the next witness wheres french louis  while french louis was shoving forward lucy opened the door  where you goin shunk wilson shouted  i reckon i dont have to stay she answered defiantly i aint got no vote an besides my cabins so jammed up i cant breathe  in a few minutes her husband followed the closing of the door was the first warning the judge received of it  who was that he interrupted pierres narrative to ask  bill peabody somebody spoke up said he wanted to ask his wife something and was coming right back  instead of bill it was lucy who reentered took off her furs and resumed her place by the stove  i reckon we dont need to hear the rest of the witnesses was shunk wilsons decision when pierre had finished we already know they only can testify to the same facts weve already heard say sorensen you go an bring bill peabody back well be votin a verdict pretty short now stranger you can get up an say your say concernin what happened in the meantime well just be savin delay by passin around the two rifles the ammunition an the bullet that done the killin  midway in his story of how he had arrived in that part of the country and at the point in his narrative where he described his own ambush and how he had fled to the bank smoke was interrupted by the indignant shunk wilson  young man what sense is there in you testifyin that way youre just takin up valuable time of course you got the right to lie to save your neck but we aint goin to stand for such foolishness the rifle the ammunition an the bullet that killed joe kinade is against you whats that open the door somebody  the frost rushed in taking form and substance in the heat of the room while through the open door came the whining of dogs that decreased rapidly with distance  its sorensen an peabody some one cried athrowin the whip into the dawgs an headin down river  now what the hell shunk wilson paused with dropped jaw and glared at lucy i reckon you can explain mrs peabody  she tossed her head and compressed her lips and shunk wilsons wrathful and suspicious gaze passed on and rested on breck  an i reckon that newcomer youve been chinning with could explain if he had a mind to  breck now very uncomfortable found all eyes centered on him  sam was chewing the rag with him too before he hit out some one said  look here mr breck shunk wilson continued youve been interruptin proceedings and you got to explain the meanin of it what was you chinnin about  breck cleared his throat timidly and replied i was just trying to buy some grub  what with  dust of course  whered you get it  breck did not answer  hes been snoopin around up the stewart a man volunteered i run across his camp a week ago when i was huntin an i want to tell you he was almighty secretious about it  the dust didnt come from there breck said thats only a lowgrade hydraulic proposition  bring your poke here an lets see your dust wilson commanded  i tell you it didnt come from there  lets see it just the same  breck made as if to refuse but all about him were menacing faces reluctantly he fumbled in his coat pocket in the act of drawing forth a peppercan it rattled against what was evidently a hard object  fetch it all out shunk wilson thundered  and out came the big nugget fistsize yellow as no gold any onlooker had ever seen shunk wilson gasped half a dozen catching one glimpse made a break for the door they reached it at the same moment and with cursing and scuffling jammed and pivoted through the judge emptied the contents of the peppercan on the table and the sight of the rough lumpgold sent half a dozen more toward the door  where are you goin eli harding asked as shunk started to follow  for my dogs of course  aint you goin to hang him  itd take too much time right now hell keep till we get back so i reckon this court is adjourned this aint no place for lingerin  harding hesitated he glanced savagely at smoke saw pierre beckoning to louis from the doorway took one last look at the lumpgold on the table and decided  no use you tryin to get away he flung back over his shoulder besides im goin to borrow your dogs  what is itanother one of them blamed stampedes the old blind trapper asked in a queer and petulant falsetto as the cries of men and dogs and the grind of the sleds swept the silence of the room  it sure is lucy answered an i never seen gold like it feel that old man  she put the big nugget in his hand he was but slightly interested  it was a good furcountry he complained before them danged miners come in an scared back the game  the door opened and breck entered well he said we four are all that are left in camp its forty miles to the stewart by the cutoff i broke and the fastest of them cant make the round trip in less than five or six days but its time you pulled out smoke just the same  breck drew his huntingknife across the others bonds and glanced at the woman i hope you dont object he said with significant politeness  if theres goin to be any shootin the blind man broke out i wish somebodyd take me to another cabin first  go on an dont mind me lucy answered if i aint good enough to hang a man i aint good enough to hold him  smoke stood up rubbing his wrists where the thongs had impeded the circulation  ive got a pack all ready for you breck said ten days grub blankets matches tobacco an axe and a rifle  go to it lucy encouraged hit the high places stranger beat it as fast as godll let you  im going to have a square meal before i start smoke said and when i start it will be up the mcquestion not down i want you to go along with me breck were going to search that other bank for the man that really did the killing  if youll listen to me youll head down for the stewart and the yukon breck objected when this gang gets back from my lowgrade hydraulic proposition it will be seeing red  smoke laughed and shook his head  i cant jump this country breck ive got interests here ive got to stay and make good i dont care whether you believe me or not but ive found surprise lake thats where that gold came from besides they took my dogs and ive got to wait to get them back also i know what im about there was a man hidden on that bank he came pretty close to emptying his magazine at me  half an hour afterward with a big plate of moosesteak before him and a big mug of coffee at his lips smoke halfstarted up from his seat he had heard the sounds first lucy threw open the door  hello spike hello methody she greeted the two frostrimed men who were bending over the burden on their sled  we just come down from upper camp one said as the pair staggered into the room with a furwrapped object which they handled with exceeding gentleness an this is what we found by the way hes all in i guess  put him in the near bunk there lucy said she bent over and pulled back the furs disclosing a face composed principally of large staring black eyes and of skin dark and scabbed by repeated frostbite tightly stretched across the bones  if it aint alonzo she cried you pore starved devil  thats the man on the other bank smoke said in an undertone to breck  we found it raidin a cache that harding must a made one of the men was explaining he was eatin raw flour an frozen bacon an when we got m he was cryin an squealin like a hawg look at him hes all starved an most of him frozen hell kick at any moment   half an hour later when the furs had been drawn over the face of the still form in the bunk smoke turned to lucy if you dont mind mrs peabody ill have another whack at that steak make it thick and not so well done im a meateater i am     vi the race for number three   huh get on to the glad rags  shorty surveyed his partner with simulated disapproval and smoke vainly attempting to rub the wrinkles out of the pair of trousers he had just put on was irritated  they sure fit you close for a secondhand buy shorty went on what was the tax  one hundred and fifty for the suit smoke answered the man was nearly my own size i thought it was remarkably reasonable what are you kicking about  who me oh nothin i was just thinkin it was goin some for a meateater that hit dawson in an icejam with no grub one suit of underclothes a pair of mangy moccasins an overalls that looked like theyd been through the wreck of the hesperus pretty gay front pardner pretty gay front say  what do you want now smoke demanded testily  whats her name  there isnt any her my friend im to have dinner at colonel bowies if you want to know the trouble with you shorty is youre envious because im going into high society and youre not invited  aint you some late shorty queried with concern  what do you mean  for dinner theyll be eatin supper when you get there  smoke was about to explain with crudely elaborate sarcasm when he caught the twinkle in the others eye he went on dressing with fingers that had lost their deftness tying a windsor tie in a bowknot at the throat of his soft cotton shirt  wisht i hadnt sent all my starched shirts to the laundry shorty murmured sympathetically i might a fitted you out  by this time smoke was straining at a pair of shoes the woollen socks were too thick to go into them he looked appealingly at shorty who shook his head  nope if i had thin ones i wouldnt lend em to you back to the moccasins pardner youd sure freeze your toes in skimpyfangled gear like that  i paid fifteen dollars for them second hand smoke lamented  i reckon they wont be a man not in moccasins  but there are to be women shorty im going to sit down and eat with real live womenmrs bowie and several others so the colonel told me  well moccasins wont spoil their appetite none was shortys comment wonder what the colonel wants with you  i dont know unless hes heard about my finding surprise lake it will take a fortune to drain it and the guggenheims are out for investment  reckon thats it thats right stick to the moccasins gee that coat is sure wrinkled an it fits you a mite too swift just peck around at your vittles if you eat hearty youll bust through an if them women folks gets to droppin handkerchiefs just let em lay dont do any pickin up whatever you do dont   as became a highsalaried expert and the representative of the great house of guggenheim colonel bowie lived in one of the most magnificent cabins in dawson of squared logs handhewn it was two stories high and of such extravagant proportions that it boasted a big living room that was used for a living room and for nothing else  here were big bearskins on the rough board floor and on the walls horns of moose and caribou here roared an open fireplace and a big woodburning stove and here smoke met the social elect of dawsonnot the mere pickhandle millionaires but the ultracream of a mining city whose population had been recruited from all the worldmen like warburton jones the explorer and writer captain consadine of the mounted police haskell gold commissioner of the northwest territory and baron von schroeder an emperors favourite with an international duelling reputation  and here dazzling in evening gown he met joy gastell whom hitherto he had encountered only on trail befurred and moccasined at dinner he found himself beside her  i feel like a fish out of water he confessed all you folks are so real grand you know besides i never dreamed such oriental luxury existed in the klondike look at von schroeder there hes actually got a dinner jacket and consadines got a starched shirt i noticed he wore moccasins just the same how do you like my outfit  he moved his shoulders about as if preening himself for joys approval  it looks as if youd grown stout since you came over the pass she laughed  wrong guess again  its somebody elses  you win i bought it for a price from one of the clerks at the a c company  its a shame clerks are so narrowshouldered she sympathized and you havent told me what you think of my outfit  i cant he said im out of breath ive been living on trail too long this sort of thing comes to me with a shock you know id quite forgotten that women have arms and shoulders tomorrow morning like my friend shorty ill wake up and know its all a dream now the last time i saw you on squaw creek  i was just a squaw she broke in  i hadnt intended to say that i was remembering that it was on squaw creek that i discovered you had feet  and i can never forget that you saved them for me she said ive been wanting to see you ever since to thank you he shrugged his shoulders deprecatingly and thats why you are here tonight  you asked the colonel to invite me  no mrs bowie and i asked her to let me have you at table and heres my chance everybodys talking listen and dont interrupt you know mono creek  yes  it has turned out richdreadfully rich they estimate the claims as worth a million and more apiece it was only located the other day  i remember the stampede  well the whole creek was staked to the skyline and all the feeders too and yet right now on the main creek number three below discovery is unrecorded the creek was so far away from dawson that the commissioner allowed sixty days for recording after location every claim was recorded except number three below it was staked by cyrus johnson and that was all cyrus johnson has disappeared whether he died whether he went down river or up nobody knows anyway in six days the time for recording will be up then the man who stakes it and reaches dawson first and records it gets it  a million dollars smoke murmured  gilchrist who has the next claim below has got six hundred dollars in a single pan off bedrock hes burned one hole down and the claim on the other side is even richer i know  but why doesnt everybody know smoke queried skeptically  theyre beginning to know they kept it secret for a long time and it is only now that its coming out good dogteams will be at a premium in another twentyfour hours now youve got to get away as decently as you can as soon as dinner is over ive arranged it an indian will come with a message for you you read it let on that youre very much put out make your excuses and get away  ieri fail to follow  ninny she exclaimed in a halfwhisper what you must do is to get out tonight and hustle dogteams i know of two theres hansons team seven big hudson bay dogshes holding them at four hundred each thats top price tonight but it wont be tomorrow and sitka charley has eight malemutes hes asking thirtyfive hundred for tomorrow hell laugh at an offer of five thousand then youve got your own team of dogs and youll have to buy several more teams thats your work tonight get the best its dogs as well as men that will win this race its a hundred and ten miles and youll have to relay as frequently as you can  oh i see you want me to go in for it smoke drawled  if you havent the money for the dogs ill she faltered but before she could continue smoke was speaking  i can buy the dogs buterarent you afraid this is gambling  after your exploits at roulette in the elkhorn she retorted im not afraid that youre afraid its a sporting proposition if thats what you mean a race for a million and with some of the stiffest dogmushers and travellers in the country entered against you they havent entered yet but by this time tomorrow they will and dogs will be worth what the richest man can afford to pay big olaf is in town he came up from circle city last month he is one of the most terrible dogmushers in the country and if he enters he will be your most dangerous man arizona bill is another hes been a professional freighter and mailcarrier for years if he goes in interest will be centered on him and big olaf  and you intend me to come along as a sort of dark horse  exactly and it will have its advantages you will not be supposed to stand a show after all you know you are still classed as a chechako you havent seen the four seasons go around nobody will take notice of you until you come into the home stretch in the lead  its on the home stretch the dark horse is to show up its classy form eh  she nodded and continued earnestly remember i shall never forgive myself for the trick i played on the squaw creek stampede unless you win this mono claim and if any man can win this race against the oldtimers its you  it was the way she said it he felt warm all over and in his heart and head he gave her a quick searching look involuntary and serious and for the moment that her eyes met his steadily ere they fell it seemed to him that he read something of vaster import than the claim cyrus johnson had failed to record  ill do it he said ill win it  the glad light in her eyes seemed to promise a greater meed than all the gold in the mono claim he was aware of a movement of her hand in her lap next to his under the screen of the tablecloth he thrust his own hand across and met a firm grip of womans fingers that sent another wave of warmth through him  what will shorty say was the thought that flashed whimsically through his mind as he withdrew his hand he glanced almost jealously at the faces of von schroeder and jones and wondered if they had not divined the remarkableness and deliciousness of this woman who sat beside him  he was aroused by her voice and realized that she had been speaking some moments  so you see arizona bill is a white indian she was saying and big olaf is a bear wrestler a king of the snows a mighty savage he can outtravel and outendure an indian and hes never known any other life but that of the wild and the frost  whos that captain consadine broke in from across the table  big olaf she answered i was just telling mr bellew what a traveller he is  youre right the captains voice boomed big olaf is the greatest traveller in the yukon id back him against old nick himself for snowbucking and icetravel he brought in the government dispatches in 1895 and he did it after two couriers were frozen on chilkoot and the third drowned in the open water of thirty mile   smoke had travelled in a leisurely fashion up to mono creek fearing to tire his dogs before the big race also he had familiarized himself with every mile of the trail and located his relay camps so many men had entered the race that the hundred and ten miles of its course was almost a continuous village relay camps were everywhere along the trail von schroeder who had gone in purely for the sport had no less than eleven dogteamsa fresh one for every ten miles arizona bill had been forced to content himself with eight teams big olaf had seven which was the complement of smoke in addition over two score of other men were in the running not every day even in the golden north was a million dollars the prize for a dog race the country had been swept of dogs no animal of speed and endurance escaped the finetooth comb that had raked the creeks and camps and the prices of dogs had doubled and quadrupled in the course of the frantic speculation  number three below discovery was ten miles up mono creek from its mouth the remaining hundred miles was to be run on the frozen breast of the yukon on number three itself were fifty tents and over three hundred dogs the old stakes blazed and scrawled sixty days before by cyrus johnson still stood and every man had gone over the boundaries of the claim again and again for the race with the dogs was to be preceded by a foot and obstacle race each man had to relocate the claim for himself and this meant that he must place two centerstakes and four cornerstakes and cross the creek twice before he could start for dawson with his dogs  furthermore there were to be no sooners not until the stroke of midnight of friday night was the claim open for relocation and not until the stroke of midnight could a man plant a stake this was the ruling of the gold commissioner at dawson and captain consadine had sent up a squad of mounted police to enforce it discussion had arisen about the difference between suntime and policetime but consadine had sent forth his fiat that policetime went and further that it was the watch of lieutenant pollock that went  the mono trail ran along the level creekbed and less than two feet in width was like a groove walled on either side by the snowfall of months the problem of how fortyodd sleds and three hundred dogs were to start in so narrow a course was in everybodys mind  huh said shorty its goin to be the goshdangdest mixup that ever was i cant see no way out smoke except main strength an sweat an to plow through if the whole creek was glareice they aint room for a dozen teams abreast i got a hunch right now theys goin to be a heap of scrappin before they get strung out an if any of it comes our way you got to let me do the punchin  smoke squared his shoulders and laughed noncommittally  no you dont his partner cried in alarm no matter what happens you dont dast hit you cant handle dogs a hundred miles with a busted knuckle an thats whatll happen if you land on somebodys jaw  smoke nodded his head youre right shorty i couldnt risk the chance  an just remember shorty went on that i got to do all the shovin for them first ten miles an you got to take it easy as you can ill sure jerk you through to the yukon after that its up to you an the dogs saywhat dye think schroeders scheme is hes got his first team a quarter of a mile down the creek an hell know it by a green lantern but we got him skinned me for the red flare every time   the day had been clear and cold but a blanket of cloud formed across the face of the sky and the night came on warm and dark with the hint of snow impending the thermometer registered fifteen below zero and in the klondike winter fifteen below is esteemed very warm  at a few minutes before midnight leaving shorty with the dogs five hundred yards down the creek smoke joined the racers on number three there were fortyfive of them waiting the start for the thousand thousand dollars cyrus johnson had left lying in the frozen gravel each man carried six stakes and a heavy wooden mallet and was clad in a smocklike parka of heavy cotton drill  lieutenant pollock in a big bearskin coat looked at his watch by the light of a fire it lacked a minute of midnight make ready he said as he raised a revolver in his right hand and watched the second hand tick around  fortyfive hoods were thrown back from the parkas fortyfive pairs of hands unmittened and fortyfive pairs of moccasins pressed tensely into the packed snow also fortyfive stakes were thrust into the snow and the same number of mallets lifted in the air  the shot rang out and the mallets fell cyrus johnsons right to the million had expired to prevent confusion lieutenant pollock had insisted that the lower centerstake be driven first next the southeastern and so on around the four sides including the upper centerstake on the way  smoke drove in his stake and was away with the leading dozen fires had been lighted at the corners and by each fire stood a policeman list in hand checking off the names of the runners a man was supposed to call out his name and show his face there was to be no staking by proxy while the real racer was off and away down the creek  at the first corner beside smokes stake von schroeder placed his the mallets struck at the same instant as they hammered more arrived from behind and with such impetuosity as to get in one anothers way and cause jostling and shoving squirming through the press and calling his name to the policeman smoke saw the baron struck in collision by one of the rushers hurled clean off his feet into the snow but smoke did not wait others were still ahead of him by the light of the vanishing fire he was certain that he saw the back hugely looming of big olaf and at the southwestern corner big olaf and he drove their stakes side by side  it was no light work this preliminary obstacle race the boundaries of the claim totalled nearly a mile and most of it was over the uneven surface of a snowcovered niggerhead flat all about smoke men tripped and fell and several times he pitched forward himself jarringly on hands and knees once big olaf fell so immediately in front of him as to bring him down on top  the upper centerstake was driven by the edge of the bank and down the bank the racers plunged across the frozen creekbed and up the other side here as smoke clambered a hand gripped his ankle and jerked him back in the flickering light of a distant fire it was impossible to see who had played the trick but arizona bill who had been treated similarly rose to his feet and drove his fist with a crunch into the offenders face smoke saw and heard as he was scrambling to his feet but before he could make another lunge for the bank a fist dropped him halfstunned into the snow he staggered up located the man halfswung a hook for his jaw then remembered shortys warning and refrained the next moment struck below the knees by a hurtling body he went down again  it was a foretaste of what would happen when the men reached their sleds men were pouring over the other bank and piling into the jam they swarmed up the bank in bunches and in bunches were dragged back by their impatient fellows more blows were struck curses rose from the panting chests of those who still had wind to spare and smoke curiously visioning the face of joy gastell hoped that the mallets would not be brought into play overthrown trod upon groping in the snow for his lost stakes he at last crawled out of the crush and attacked the bank farther along others were doing this and it was his luck to have many men in advance of him in the race for the northwestern corner  reaching the fourth corner he tripped headlong and in the long sprawling fall lost his remaining stake for five minutes he groped in the darkness before he found it and all the time the panting runners were passing him from the last corner to the creek he began overtaking men for whom the mile run had been too much in the creek itself bedlam had broken loose a dozen sleds were piled up and overturned and nearly a hundred dogs were locked in combat among them men struggled tearing the tangled animals apart or beating them apart with clubs in the fleeting glimpse he caught of it smoke wondered if he had ever seen a dore grotesquery to compare  leaping down the bank beyond the glutted passage he gained the hardfooting of the sledtrail and made better time here in packed harbors beside the narrow trail sleds and men waited for runners that were still behind from the rear came the whine and rush of dogs and smoke had barely time to leap aside into the deep snow a sled tore past and he made out the man kneeling and shouting madly scarcely was it by when it stopped with a crash of battle the excited dogs of a harbored sled resenting the passing animals had got out of hand and sprung upon them  smoke plunged around and by he could see the green lantern of von schroeder and just below it the red flare that marked his own team two men were guarding schroeders dogs with short clubs interposed between them and the trail  come on you smoke come on you smoke he could hear shorty calling anxiously  coming he gasped  by the red flare he could see the snow torn up and trampled and from the way his partner breathed he knew a battle had been fought he staggered to the sled and in a moment he was falling on it shortys whip snapped as he yelled mush you devils mush  the dogs sprang into the breastbands and the sled jerked abruptly ahead they were big animalshansons prize team of hudson baysand smoke had selected them for the first stage which included the ten miles of mono the heavy going of the cutoff across the flat at the mouth and the first ten miles of the yukon stretch  how many are ahead he asked  you shut up an save your wind shorty answered hi you brutes hit her up hit her up  he was running behind the sled towing on a short rope smoke could not see him nor could he see the sled on which he lay at full length the fires had been left in the rear and they were tearing through a wall of blackness as fast as the dogs could spring into it this blackness was almost sticky so nearly did it take on the seeming of substance  smoke felt the sled heel up on one runner as it rounded an invisible curve and from ahead came the snarls of beasts and the oaths of men this was known afterward as the barnesslocum jam it was the teams of these two men which first collided and into it at full career piled smokes seven big fighters scarcely more than semidomesticated wolves the excitement of that night on mono creek had sent every dog fighting mad the klondike dogs driven without reins cannot be stopped except by voice so that there was no stopping this glut of struggle that heaped itself between the narrow rims of the creek from behind sled after sled hurled into the turmoil men who had their teams nearly extricated were overwhelmed by fresh avalanches of dogseach animal well fed well rested and ripe for battle  its knock down an drag out an plow through shorty yelled in his partners ear an watch out for your knuckles you drag dogs out an let me do the punchin  what happened in the next half hour smoke never distinctly remembered at the end he emerged exhausted sobbing for breath his jaw sore from a fistblow his shoulder aching from the bruise of a club the blood running warmly down one leg from the rip of a dogs fangs and both sleeves of his parka torn to shreds as in a dream while the battle still raged behind he helped shorty reharness the dogs one dying they cut from the traces and in the darkness they felt their way to the repair of the disrupted harness  now you lie down an get your wind back shorty commanded  and through the darkness the dogs sped with unabated strength down mono creek across the long cutoff and to the yukon here at the junction with the main rivertrail somebody had lighted a fire and here shorty said goodbye by the light of the fire as the sled leaped behind the flying dogs smoke caught another of the unforgettable pictures of the northland it was of shorty swaying and sinking down limply in the snow yelling his parting encouragement one eye blackened and closed knuckles bruised and broken and one arm ripped and fangtorn gushing forth a steady stream of blood   how many ahead smoke asked as he dropped his tired hudson bays and sprang on the waiting sled at the first relay station  i counted eleven the man called after him for he was already away behind the leaping dogs  fifteen miles they were to carry him on the next stage which would fetch him to the mouth of white river there were nine of them but they composed his weakest team the twentyfive miles between white river and sixty mile he had broken into two stages because of icejams and here two of his heaviest toughest teams were stationed  he lay on the sled at full length facedown holding on with both hands whenever the dogs slacked from topmost speed he rose to his knees and yelling and urging clinging precariously with one hand threw his whip into them poor team that it was he passed two sleds before white river was reached here at the freezeup a jam had piled a barrier allowing the open water that formed for half a mile below to freeze smoothly this smooth stretch enabled the racers to make flying exchanges of sleds and down all the course they had placed their relays below the jams  over the jam and out on to the smooth smoke tore along calling loudly billy billy  billy heard and answered and by the light of the many fires on the ice smoke saw a sled swing in from the side and come abreast its dogs were fresh and overhauled his as the sleds swerved toward each other he leaped across and billy promptly rolled off  wheres big olaf smoke cried  leading billys voice answered and the fires were left behind and smoke was again flying through the wall of blackness  in the jams of that relay where the way led across a chaos of upended icecakes and where smoke slipped off the forward end of the sled and with a haulrope toiled behind the wheeldog he passed three sleds accidents had happened and he could hear the men cutting out dogs and mending harnesses  among the jams of the next short relay into sixty mile he passed two more teams and that he might know adequately what had happened to them one of his own dogs wrenched a shoulder was unable to keep up and was dragged in the harness its teammates angered fell upon it with their fangs and smoke was forced to club them off with the heavy butt of his whip as he cut the injured animal out he heard the whining cries of dogs behind him and the voice of a man that was familiar it was von schroeder smoke called a warning to prevent a rearend collision and the baron hawing his animals and swinging on the geepole went by a dozen feet to the side yet so impenetrable was the blackness that smoke heard him pass but never saw him  on the smooth stretch of ice beside the tradingpost at sixty mile smoke overtook two more sleds all had just changed teams and for five minutes they ran abreast each man on his knees and pouring whip and voice into the maddened dogs but smoke had studied out that portion of the trail and now marked the tall pine on the bank that showed faintly in the light of the many fires below that pine was not merely darkness but an abrupt cessation of the smooth stretch there the trail he knew narrowed to a single sledwidth leaning out ahead he caught the haulrope and drew his leaping sled up to the wheeldog he caught the animal by the hind legs and threw it with a snarl of rage it tried to slash him with its fangs but was dragged on by the rest of the team its body proved an efficient brake and the two other teams still abreast dashed ahead into the darkness for the narrow way  smoke heard the crash and uproar of their collision released his wheeler sprang to the geepole and urged his team to the right into the soft snow where the straining animals wallowed to their necks it was exhausting work but he won by the tangled teams and gained the hardpacked trail beyond   on the relay out of sixty mile smoke had next to his poorest team and though the going was good he had set it a short fifteen miles two more teams would bring him into dawson and to the goldrecorders office and smoke had selected his best animals for the last two stretches sitka charley himself waited with the eight malemutes that would jerk smoke along for twenty miles and for the finish with a fifteenmile run was his own teamthe team he had had all winter and which had been with him in the search for surprise lake  the two men he had left entangled at sixty mile failed to overtake him and on the other hand his team failed to overtake any of the three that still led his animals were willing though they lacked stamina and speed and little urging was needed to keep them jumping into it at their best there was nothing for smoke to do but to lie face downward and hold on now and again he would plunge out of the darkness into the circle of light about a blazing fire catch a glimpse of furred men standing by harnessed and waiting dogs and plunge into the darkness again mile after mile with only the grind and jar of the runners in his ears he sped on almost automatically he kept his place as the sled bumped ahead or half lifted and heeled on the swings and swerves of the bends first one and then another without apparent rhyme or reason three faces limned themselves on his consciousness joy gastells laughing and audacious shortys battered and exhausted by the struggle down mono creek and john bellews seamed and rigid as if cast in iron so unrelenting was its severity and sometimes smoke wanted to shout aloud to chant a paean of savage exultation as he remembered the office of the billow and the serial story of san francisco which he had left unfinished along with the other fripperies of those empty days  the grey twilight of morning was breaking as he exchanged his weary dogs for the eight fresh malemutes lighter animals than hudson bays they were capable of greater speed and they ran with the supple tirelessness of true wolves sitka charley called out the order of the teams ahead big olaf led arizona bill was second and von schroeder third these were the three best men in the country in fact ere smoke had left dawson the popular betting had placed them in that order while they were racing for a million at least half a million had been staked by others on the outcome of the race no one had bet on smoke who despite his several known exploits was still accounted a chechako with much to learn  as daylight strengthened smoke caught sight of a sled ahead and in half an hour his own leaddog was leaping at its tail not until the man turned his head to exchange greetings did smoke recognize him as arizona bill von schroeder had evidently passed him the trail hardpacked ran too narrowly through the soft snow and for another halfhour smoke was forced to stay in the rear then they topped an icejam and struck a smooth stretch below where were a number of relay camps and where the snow was packed widely on his knees swinging his whip and yelling smoke drew abreast he noted that arizona bills right arm hung dead at his side and that he was compelled to pour leather with his left hand awkward as it was he had no hand left with which to hold on and frequently he had to cease from the whip and clutch to save himself from falling off smoke remembered the scrimmage in the creek bed at three below discovery and understood shortys advice had been sound  whats happened smoke asked as he began to pull ahead  i dont know arizona bill answered i think i threw my shoulder out in the scrapping  he dropped behind very slowly though when the last relay station was in sight he was fully half a mile in the rear ahead bunched together smoke could see big olaf and von schroeder again smoke arose to his knees and he lifted his jaded dogs into a burst of speed such as a man only can who has the proper instinct for dogdriving he drew up close to the tail of von schroeders sled and in this order the three sleds dashed out on the smooth going below a jam where many men and many dogs waited dawson was fifteen miles away  von schroeder with his tenmile relays had changed five miles back and would change five miles ahead so he held on keeping his dogs at full leap big olaf and smoke made flying changes and their fresh teams immediately regained what had been lost to the baron big olaf led past and smoke followed into the narrow trail beyond  still good but not so good smoke paraphrased spencer to himself  of von schroeder now behind he had no fear but ahead was the greatest dogdriver in the country to pass him seemed impossible again and again many times smoke forced his leader to the others sledtail and each time big olaf let out another link and drew away smoke contented himself with taking the pace and hung on grimly the race was not lost until one or the other won and in fifteen miles many things could happen  three miles from dawson something did happen to smokes surprise big olaf rose up and with oaths and leather proceeded to fetch out the last ounce of effort in his animals it was a spurt that should have been reserved for the last hundred yards instead of being begun three miles from the finish sheer dogkilling that it was smoke followed his own team was superb no dogs on the yukon had had harder work or were in better condition besides smoke had toiled with them and eaten and bedded with them and he knew each dog as an individual and how best to win in to the animals intelligence and extract its last least shred of willingness  they topped a small jam and struck the smooth going below big olaf was barely fifty feet ahead a sled shot out from the side and drew in toward him and smoke understood big olafs terrific spurt he had tried to gain a lead for the change this fresh team that waited to jerk him down the home stretch had been a private surprise of his even the men who had backed him to win had had no knowledge of it  smoke strove desperately to pass during the exchange of sleds lifting his dogs to the effort he ate up the intervening fifty feet with urging and pouring of leather he went to the side and on until his leaddog was jumping abreast of big olafs wheeler on the other side abreast was the relay sled at the speed they were going big olaf did not dare try the flying leap if he missed and fell off smoke would be in the lead and the race would be lost  big olaf tried to spurt ahead and he lifted his dogs magnificently but smokes leader still continued to jump beside big olafs wheeler for half a mile the three sleds tore and bounced along side by side the smooth stretch was nearing its end when big olaf took the chance as the flying sleds swerved toward each other he leaped and the instant he struck he was on his knees with whip and voice spurting the fresh team the smooth stretch pinched out into the narrow trail and he jumped his dogs ahead and into it with a lead of barely a yard  a man was not beaten until he was beaten was smokes conclusion and drive no matter how big olaf failed to shake him off no team smoke had driven that night could have stood such a killing pace and kept up with fresh dogsno team save this one nevertheless the pace was killing it and as they began to round the bluff at klondike city he could feel the pitch of strength going out of his animals almost imperceptibly they lagged behind and foot by foot big olaf drew away until he led by a score of yards  a great cheer went up from the population of klondike city assembled on the ice here the klondike entered the yukon and half a mile away across the klondike on the north bank stood dawson an outburst of madder cheering arose and smoke caught a glimpse of a sled shooting out to him he recognized the splendid animals that drew it they were joy gastells and joy gastell drove them the hood of her squirrelskin parka was tossed back revealing the cameolike oval of her face outlined against her heavilymassed hair mittens had been discarded and with bare hands she clung to whip and sled  jump she cried as her leader snarled at smokes  smoke struck the sled behind her it rocked violently from the impact of his body but she was full up on her knees and swinging the whip  hi you mush on chook chook she was crying and the dogs whined and yelped in eagerness of desire and effort to overtake big olaf  and then as the leaddog caught the tail of big olafs sled and yard by yard drew up abreast the great crowd on the dawson bank went mad it was a great crowd for the men had dropped their tools on all the creeks and come down to see the outcome of the race and a dead heat at the end of a hundred and ten miles justified any madness  when youre in the lead im going to drop off joy cried out over her shoulder  smoke tried to protest  and watch out for the dip curve half way up the bank she warned  dog by dog separated by half a dozen feet the two teams were running abreast big olaf with whip and voice held his own for a minute then slowly an inch at a time joys leader began to forge past  get ready she cried to smoke im going to leave you in a minute get the whip  and as he shifted his hand to clutch the whip they heard big olaf roar a warning but too late his leaddog incensed at being passed swerved in to the attack his fangs struck joys leader on the flank the rival teams flew at one anothers throats the sleds overran the fighting brutes and capsized smoke struggled to his feet and tried to lift joy up but she thrust him from her crying go  on foot already fifty feet in advance was big olaf still intent on finishing the race smoke obeyed and when the two men reached the foot of the dawson bank he was at the others heels but up the bank big olaf lifted his body hugely regaining a dozen feet  five blocks down the main street was the goldrecorders office the street was packed as for the witnessing of a parade not so easily this time did smoke gain to his giant rival and when he did he was unable to pass side by side they ran along the narrow aisle between the solid walls of furclad cheering men now one now the other with great convulsive jerks gained an inch or so only to lose it immediately after  if the pace had been a killing one for their dogs the one they now set themselves was no less so but they were racing for a million dollars and greatest honour in yukon country the only outside impression that came to smoke on that last mad stretch was one of astonishment that there should be so many people in the klondike he had never seen them all at once before  he felt himself involuntarily lag and big olaf sprang a full stride in the lead to smoke it seemed that his heart would burst while he had lost all consciousness of his legs he knew they were flying under him but he did not know how he continued to make them fly nor how he put even greater pressure of will upon them and compelled them again to carry him to his giant competitors side  the open door of the recorders office appeared ahead of them both men made a final futile spurt neither could draw away from the other and side by side they hit the doorway collided violently and fell headlong on the office floor  they sat up but were too exhausted to rise big olaf the sweat pouring from him breathing with tremendous painful gasps pawed the air and vainly tried to speak then he reached out his hand with unmistakable meaning smoke extended his and they shook  its a dead heat smoke could hear the recorder saying but it was as if in a dream and the voice was very thin and very far away and all i can say is that you both win youll have to divide the claim between you youre partners  their two arms pumped up and down as they ratified the decision big olaf nodded his head with great emphasis and spluttered at last he got it out  you damn chechako was what he said but in the saying of it was admiration i dont know how you done it but you did  outside the great crowd was noisily massed while the office was packing and jamming smoke and big olaf essayed to rise and each helped the other to his feet smoke found his legs weak under him and staggered drunkenly big olaf tottered toward him  im sorry my dogs jumped yours  it couldnt be helped smoke panted back i heard you yell  say big olaf went on with shining eyes that girlone damn fine girl eh  one damn fine girl smoke agreed     vii the little man   i wisht you wasnt so set in your ways shorty demurred im sure scairt of that glacier no man ought to tackle it by his lonely  smoke laughed cheerfully and ran his eye up the glistening face of the tiny glacier that filled the head of the valley here it is august already and the days have been getting shorter for two months he epitomized the situation you know quartz and i dont but i can bring up the grub while you keep after that mother lode solong ill be back by tomorrow evening  he turned and started  i got a hunch somethings goin to happen shorty pleaded after him  but smokes reply was a bantering laugh he held on down the little valley occasionally wiping the sweat from his forehead the while his feet crushed through ripe mountain raspberries and delicate ferns that grew beside patches of sunsheltered ice  in the early spring he and shorty had come up the stewart river and launched out into the amazing chaos of the region where surprise lake lay and all of the spring and half of the summer had been consumed in futile wanderings when on the verge of turning back they caught their first glimpse of the baffling goldbottomed sheet of water which had lured and fooled a generation of miners making their camp in the old cabin which smoke had discovered on his previous visit they had learned three things first heavy nugget gold was carpeted thickly on the lake bottom next the gold could be dived for in the shallower portions but the temperature of the water was mankilling and finally the draining of the lake was too stupendous a task for two men in the shorter half of a short summer undeterred reasoning from the coarseness of the gold that it had not traveled far they had set out in search of the mother lode they had crossed the big glacier that frowned on the southern rim and devoted themselves to the puzzling maze of small valleys and canyons beyond which by most unmountainlike methods drained or had at one time drained into the lake  the valley smoke was descending gradually widened after the fashion of any normal valley but at the lower end it pinched narrowly between high precipitous walls and abruptly stopped in a cross wall at the base of this in a welter of broken rock the streamlet disappeared evidently finding its way out underground climbing the cross wall from the top smoke saw the lake beneath him unlike any mountain lake he had ever seen it was not blue instead its intense peacockgreen tokened its shallowness it was this shallowness that made its draining feasible all about arose jumbled mountains with icescarred peaks and crags grotesquely shaped and grouped all was topsyturvy and unsystematica dore nightmare so fantastic and impossible was it that it affected smoke as more like a cosmic landscapejoke than a rational portion of earths surface there were many glaciers in the canyons most of them tiny and as he looked one of the larger ones on the north shore calved amid thunders and splashings across the lake seemingly not more than half a mile but as he well knew five miles away he could see the bunch of sprucetrees and the cabin he looked again to make sure and saw smoke clearly rising from the chimney somebody else had surprised themselves into finding surprise lake was his conclusion as he turned to climb the southern wall  from the top of this he came down into a little valley flowerfloored and lazy with the hum of bees that behaved quite as a reasonable valley should in so far as it made legitimate entry on the lake what was wrong with it was its lengthscarcely a hundred yards its head a straight upanddown cliff of a thousand feet over which a stream pitched itself in descending veils of mist  and here he encountered more smoke floating lazily upward in the warm sunshine beyond an outjut of rock as he came around the corner he heard a light metallic taptapping and a merry whistling that kept the beat then he saw the man an upturned shoe between his knees into the sole of which he was driving hobspikes  hello was the strangers greeting and smokes heart went out to the man in ready liking just in time for a snack theres coffee in the pot a couple of cold flapjacks and some jerky  ill go you if i lose was smokes acceptance as he sat down ive been rather skimped on the last several meals but theres oodles of grub over in the cabin  across the lake thats what i was heading for  seems surprise lake is becoming populous smoke complained emptying the coffeepot  go on youre joking arent you the man said astonishment painted on his face  smoke laughed thats the way it takes everybody you see those high ledges across there to the northwest theres where i first saw it no warning just suddenly caught the view of the whole lake from there id given up looking for it too  same here the other agreed id headed back and was expecting to fetch the stewart last night when out i popped in sight of the lake if thats it wheres the stewart and where have i been all the time and how did you come here and whats your name  bellew kit bellew  oh i know you the mans eyes and face were bright with a joyous smile and his hand flashed eagerly out to smokes ive heard all about you  been reading policecourt news i see smoke sparred modestly  nope the man laughed and shook his head merely recent klondike history i might have recognized you if youd been shaved i watched you putting it all over the gambling crowd when you were bucking roulette in the elkhorn my names carsonandy carson and i cant begin to tell you how glad i am to meet up with you  he was a slender man wiry with health with quick black eyes and a magnetism of camaraderie  and this is surprise lake he murmured incredulously  it certainly is  and its bottoms buttered with gold  sure theres some of the churning smoke dipped in his overalls pocket and brought forth half a dozen nuggets thats the stuff all you have to do is go down to bottom blind if you want to and pick up a handful then youve got to run half a mile to get up your circulation  well goshdash my dingbats if you havent beaten me to it carson swore whimsically but his disappointment was patent an i thought id scooped the whole caboodle anyway ive had the fun of getting here  fun smoke cried why if we can ever get our hands on all that bottom well make rockefeller look like thirty cents  but its yours was carsons objection  nothing to it my friend youve got to realize that no gold deposit like it has been discovered in all the history of mining it will take you and me and my partner and all the friends weve got to lay our hands on it all bonanza and eldorado dumped together wouldnt be richer than half an acre down here the problem is to drain the lake it will take millions and theres only one thing im afraid of theres so much of it that if we fail to control the output it will bring about the demonetization of gold  and you tell me carson broke off speechless and amazed  and glad to have you it will take a year or two with all the money we can raise to drain the lake it can be done ive looked over the ground but it will take every man in the country thats willing to work for wages well need an army and we need right now decent men in on the ground floor are you in  am i in dont i look it i feel so much like a millionaire that im real timid about crossing that big glacier couldnt afford to break my neck now wish i had some more of those hobspikes i was just hammering the last in when you came along hows yours lets see  smoke held up his foot  worn smooth as a skatingrink carson cried youve certainly been hiking some wait a minute and ill pull some of mine out for you  but smoke refused to listen besides he said ive got about forty feet of rope cached where we take the ice my partner and i used it coming over it will be a cinch  it was a hard hot climb the sun blazed dazzlingly on the icesurface and with streaming pores they panted from the exertion there were places crisscrossed by countless fissures and crevasses where an hour of dangerous toil advanced them no more than a hundred yards at two in the afternoon beside a pool of water bedded in the ice smoke called a halt  lets tackle some of that jerky he said ive been on short allowance and my knees are shaking besides were across the worst three hundred yards will fetch us to the rocks and its easy going except for a couple of nasty fissures and one bad one that heads us down toward the bulge theres a weak icebridge there but shorty and i managed it  over the jerky the two men got acquainted and andy carson unbosomed himself of the story of his life i just knew id find surprise lake he mumbled in the midst of mouthfuls i had to i missed the french hill benches the big skookum and monte cristo and then it was surprise lake or bust and here i am my wife knew id strike it ive got faith enough but hers knocks mine galleywest shes a corker a crackerjackdead game grit to her fingerends neversaydie a fighter from the drop of the hat the one woman for me true blue and all the rest take a look at that  he sprung open his watch and on the inside cover smoke saw the small pasted photograph of a brighthaired woman framed on either side by the laughing face of a child  boys he queried  boy and girl carson answered proudly hes a year and a half older he sighed they might have been some grown but we had to wait you see she was sick lungs but she put up a fight whatd we know about such stuff i was clerking railroad clerk chicago when we got married her folks were tuberculous doctors didnt know much in those days they said it was hereditary all her family had it caught it from each other only they never guessed it thought they were born with it fate she and i lived with them the first couple of years i wasnt afraid no tuberculosis in my family and i got it that set me thinking it was contagious i caught it from breathing their air  we talked it over she and i then i jumped the family doctor and consulted an uptodate expert he told me what id figured out for myself and said arizona was the place for us we pulled up stakes and went downno money nothing i got a job sheepherding and left her in towna lung town it was filled to spilling with lungers  of course living and sleeping in the clean open i started right in to mend i was away months at a time every time i came back she was worse she just couldnt pick up but we were learning i jerked her out of that town and she went to sheepherding with me in four years winter and summer cold and heat rain snow and frost and all the rest we never slept under a roof and we were moving camp all the time you ought to have seen the changebrown as berries lean as indians tough as rawhide when we figured we were cured we pulled out for san francisco but we were too previous by the second month we both had slight hemorrhages we flew the coop back to arizona and the sheep two years more of it that fixed us perfect cure all her familys dead wouldnt listen to us  then we jumped cities for keeps knocked around on the pacific coast and southern oregon looked good to us we settled in the rogue river valleyapples theres a big future there only nobody knows it i got my landon time of coursefor forty an acre ten years from now itll be worth five hundred  weve done some almighty hustling takes money and we hadnt a cent to start with you knowhad to build a house and barn get horses and plows and all the rest she taught school

shed a come along only for the kids and the trees shes handlin that end and here i am a goshdanged expensive millionairein prospect  he looked happily across the sundazzle on the ice to the green water of the lake along the farther shore took a final look at the photograph and murmured  shes some woman that shes hung on she just wouldnt die though she was pretty close to skin and bone all wrapped around a bit of fire when she went out with the sheep oh shes thin now never will be fat but its the prettiest thinness i ever saw and when i get back and the trees begin to bear and the kids get going to school she and i are going to do paris i dont think much of that burg but shes just hankered for it all her life  well heres the gold that will take you to paris smoke assured him all weve got to do is to get our hands on it  carson nodded with glistening eyes saythat farm of ours is the prettiest piece of orchard land on all the pacific coast good climate too our lungs will never get touched again there exlungers have to be almighty careful you know if youre thinking of settling well just take a peep in at our valley before you settle thats all and fishing saydid you ever get a thirtyfivepound salmon on a sixounce rod some fight bo some fight   im lighter than you by forty pounds carson said let me go first  they stood on the edge of the crevasse it was enormous and ancient fully a hundred feet across with sloping ageeaten sides instead of sharpangled rims at this one place it was bridged by a huge mass of pressurehardened snow that was itself half ice even the bottom of this mass they could not see much less the bottom of the crevasse crumbling and melting the bridge threatened imminent collapse there were signs where recent portions had broken away and even as they studied it a mass of half a ton dislodged and fell  looks pretty bad carson admitted with an ominous headshake and it looks much worse than if i wasnt a millionaire  but weve got to tackle it smoke said were almost across we cant go back we cant camp here on the ice all night and theres no other way shorty and i explored for a mile up it was in better shape though when we crossed  its one at a time and me first carson took the part coil of rope from smokes hand youll have to cast off ill take the rope and the pick gimme your hand so i can slip down easy  slowly and carefully he lowered himself the several feet to the bridge where he stood making final adjustments for the perilous traverse on his back was his pack outfit around his neck resting on his shoulders he coiled the rope one end of which was still fast to his waist  id give a mighty good part of my millions right now for a bridgeconstruction gang he said but his cheery whimsical smile belied the words also he added its all right im a cat  the pick and the long stick he used as an alpenstock he balanced horizontally after the manner of a ropewalker he thrust one foot forward tentatively drew it back and steeled himself with a visible physical effort  i wish i was flat broke he smiled up if ever i get out of being a millionaire this time ill never be one again its too uncomfortable  its all right smoke encouraged ive been over it before better let me try it first  and you forty pounds to the worse the little man flashed back ill be all right in a minute im all right now and this time the nervingup process was instantaneous well here goes for rogue river and the apples he said as his foot went out this time to rest carefully and lightly while the other foot was brought up and past very gently and circumspectly he continued on his way until twothirds of the distance was covered here he stopped to examine a depression he must cross at the bottom of which was a fresh crack smoke watching saw him glance to the side and down into the crevasse itself and then begin a slight swaying  keep your eyes up smoke commanded sharply now go on  the little man obeyed nor faltered on the rest of the journey the suneroded slope of the farther edge of the crevasse was slippery but not steep and he worked his way up to a narrow ledge faced about and sat down  your turn he called across but just keep acoming and dont look down thats what got my goat just keep acoming thats all and get a move on its almighty rotten  balancing his own stick horizontally smoke essayed the passage that the bridge was on its last legs was patent he felt a jar under foot a slight movement of the mass and a heavier jar this was followed by a single sharp crackle behind him he knew something was happening if for no other reason he knew it by the strained tense face of carson from beneath thin and faint came the murmur of running water and smokes eyes involuntarily wavered to a glimpse of the shimmering depths he jerked them back to the way before him twothirds over he came to the depression the sharp edges of the crack but slightly touched by the sun showed how recent it was his foot was lifted to make the step across when the crack began slowly widening at the same time emitting numerous sharp snaps he made the step quickly increasing the stride of it but the worn nails of his shoe skated on the farther slope of the depression he fell on his face and without pause slipped down and into the crack his legs hanging clear his chest supported by the stick which he had managed to twist crosswise as he fell  his first sensation was the nausea caused by the sickening upleap of his pulse his first idea was of surprise that he had fallen no farther behind him was crackling and jar and movement to which the stick vibrated from beneath in the heart of the glacier came the soft and hollow thunder of the dislodged masses striking bottom and still the bridge broken from its farthest support and ruptured in the middle held though the portion he had crossed tilted downward at a pitch of twenty degrees he could see carson perched on his ledge his feet braced against the melting surface swiftly recoiling the rope from his shoulders to his hand  wait he cried dont move or the whole shootingmatch will come down  he calculated the distance with a quick glance took the bandana from his neck and tied it to the rope and increased the length by a second bandana from his pocket the rope manufactured from sledlashings and short lengths of plaited rawhide knotted together was both light and strong the first cast was lucky as well as deft and smokes fingers clutched it he evidenced a handoverhand intention of crawling out of the crack but carson who had refastened the rope around his own waist stopped him  make it fast around yourself as well he ordered  if i go ill take you with me smoke objected  the little man became very peremptory  you shut up he ordered the sound of your voice is enough to start the whole thing going  if i ever start going smoke began  shut up you aint going to ever start going now do what i say thats rightunder the shoulders make it fast now start get a move on but easy as you go ill take in the slack you just keep acoming thats it easy easy  smoke was still a dozen feet away when the final collapse of the bridge began without noise but in a jerky way it crumbled to an increasing tilt  quick carson called coiling in handoverhand on the slack of the rope which smokes rush gave him  when the crash came smokes fingers were clawing into the hard face of the wall of the crevasse while his body dragged back with the falling bridge carson sitting up feet wide apart and braced was heaving on the rope this effort swung smoke in to the side wall but it jerked carson out of his niche like a cat he faced about clawing wildly for a hold on the ice and slipping down beneath him with forty feet of taut rope between them smoke was clawing just as wildly and ere the thunder from below announced the arrival of the bridge both men had come to rest carson had achieved this first and the several pounds of pull he was able to put on the rope had helped bring smoke to a stop  each lay in a shallow niche but smokes was so shallow that tense with the strain of flattening and sticking nevertheless he would have slid on had it not been for the slight assistance he took from the rope he was on the verge of a bulge and could not see beneath him several minutes passed in which they took stock of the situation and made rapid strides in learning the art of sticking to wet and slippery ice the little man was the first to speak  gee he said and a minute later if you can dig in for a moment and slack on the rope i can turn over try it  smoke made the effort then rested on the rope again i can do it he said tell me when youre ready and be quick  about three feet down is holding for my heels carson said it wont take a moment are you ready  go on  it was hard work to slide down a yard turn over and sit up but it was even harder for smoke to remain flattened and maintain a position that from instant to instant made a greater call upon his muscles as it was he could feel the almost perceptible beginning of the slip when the rope tightened and he looked up into his companions face smoke noted the yellow pallor of suntan forsaken by the blood and wondered what his own complexion was like but when he saw carson with shaking fingers fumble for his sheathknife he decided the end had come the man was in a funk and was going to cut the rope  dont mmind mmme the little man chattered i aint scared its only my nerves goshdang them ill bbbe all right in a minute  and smoke watched him doubled over his shoulders between his knees shivering and awkward holding a slight tension on the rope with one hand while with the other he hacked and gouged holes for his heels in the ice  carson he breathed up to him youre some bear some bear  the answering grin was ghastly and pathetic i never could stand height carson confessed it always did get me do you mind if i stop a minute and clear my head then ill make those heelholds deeper so i can heave you up  smokes heart warmed look here carson the thing for you to do is to cut the rope you can never get me up and theres no use both of us being lost you can make it out with your knife  you shut up was the hurt retort whos running this  and smoke could not help but see that anger was a good restorative for the others nerves as for himself it was the more nerveracking strain lying plastered against the ice with nothing to do but strive to stick on  a groan and a quick cry of hold on warned him with face pressed against the ice he made a supreme sticking effort felt the rope slacken and knew carson was slipping toward him he did not dare look up until he felt the rope tighten and knew the other had again come to rest  gee that was a near go carson chattered i came down over a yard now you wait ive got to dig new holds if this danged ice wasnt so melty wed be hunkydory  holding the few pounds of strain necessary for smoke with his left hand the little man jabbed and chopped at the ice with his right ten minutes of this passed  now ill tell you what ive done carson called down ive made heelholds and handholes for you alongside of me im going to heave the rope in slow and easy and you just come along sticking an not too fast ill tell you what first of all ill take you on the rope and you worry out of that pack get me  smoke nodded and with infinite care unbuckled his packstraps with a wriggle of the shoulders he dislodged the pack and carson saw it slide over the bulge and out of sight  now im going to ditch mine he called down you just take it easy and wait  five minutes later the upward struggle began smoke after drying his hands on the insides of his armsleeves clawed into the climbbellied and clung and stuck and plasteredsustained and helped by the pull of the rope alone he could not have advanced despite his muscles because of his forty pounds handicap he could not cling as did carson a third of the way up where the pitch was steeper and the ice less eroded he felt the strain on the rope decreasing he moved slower and slower here was no place to stop and remain his most desperate effort could not prevent the stop and he could feel the downslip beginning  im going he called up  so am i was the reply gritted through carsons teeth  then cast loose  smoke felt the rope tauten in a futile effort then the pace quickened and as he went past his previous lodgment and over the bulge the last glimpse he caught of carson he was turned over with madly moving hands and feet striving to overcome the downward draw to smokes surprise as he went over the bulge there was no sheer fall the rope restrained him as he slid down a steeper pitch which quickly eased until he came to a halt in another niche on the verge of another bulge carson was now out of sight ensconced in the place previously occupied by smoke  gee he could hear carson shiver gee  an interval of quiet followed and then smoke could feel the rope agitated  what are you doing he called up  making more hand and footholds came the trembling answer you just wait ill have you up here in a jiffy dont mind the way i talk im just excited but im all right you wait and see  youre holding me by main strength smoke argued soon or late with the ice melting youll slip down after me the thing for you to do is to cut loose hear me theres no use both of us going get that youre the biggest little man in creation but youve done your best you cut loose  you shut up im going to make holes this time deep enough to haul up a span of horses  youve held me up long enough smoke urged let me go  how many times have i held you up came the truculent query  some several and all of them too many youve been coming down all the time  and ive been learning the game all the time im going on holding you up until we get out of here savvy when god made me a lightweight i guess he knew what he was about now shut up im busy  several silent minutes passed smoke could hear the metallic strike and hack of the knife and occasional driblets of ice slid over the bulge and came down to him thirsty clinging on hand and foot he caught the fragments in his mouth and melted them to water which he swallowed  he heard a gasp that slid into a groan of despair and felt a slackening of the rope that made him claw immediately the rope tightened again straining his eyes in an upward look along the steep slope he stared a moment then saw the knife point first slide over the verge of the bulge and down upon him he tucked his cheek to it shrank from the pang of cut flesh tucked more tightly and felt the knife come to rest  im a slob came the wail down the crevasse  cheer up ive got it smoke answered  say wait ive a lot of string in my pocket ill drop it down to you and you send the knife up  smoke made no reply he was battling with a sudden rush of thought  hey you here comes the string tell me when youve got it  a small pocketknife weighted on the end of the string slid down the ice smoke got it opened the larger blade by a quick effort of his teeth and one hand and made sure that the blade was sharp then he tied the sheathknife to the end of the string  haul away he called  with strained eyes he saw the upward progress of the knife but he saw morea little man afraid and indomitable who shivered and chattered whose head swam with giddiness and who mastered his qualms and distresses and played a heros part not since his meeting with shorty had smoke so quickly liked a man here was a proper meateater eager with friendliness generous to destruction with a grit that shaking fear could not shake then too he considered the situation coldbloodedly there was no chance for two steadily they were sliding into the heart of the glacier and it was his greater weight that was dragging the little man down the little man could stick like a fly alone he could save himself  bully for us came the voice from above down and across the bulge of ice now well get out of here in two shakes  the awful struggle for good cheer and hope in carsons voice decided smoke  listen to me he said steadily vainly striving to shake the vision of joy gastells face from his brain i sent that knife up for you to get out with get that im going to chop loose with the jackknife its one or both of us get that  two or nothing came the grim but shaky response if youll hold on a minute  ive held on for too long now im not married i have no adorable thin woman nor kids nor appletrees waiting for me get me now you hike up and out of that  wait for gods sake wait carson screamed down you cant do that give me a chance to get you out be calm old horse well make the turn youll see im going to dig holds thatll lift a house and barn  smoke made no reply slowly and gently fascinated by the sight he cut with the knife until one of the three strands popped and parted  what are you doing carson cried desperately if you cut ill never forgive younever i tell you its two or nothing were going to get out wait for gods sake  and smoke staring at the parted strand five inches before his eyes knew fear in all its weakness he did not want to die he recoiled from the shimmering abyss beneath him and his panic brain urged all the preposterous optimism of delay it was fear that prompted him to compromise  all right he called up ill wait do your best but i tell you carson if we both start slipping again im going to cut  huh forget it when we start old horse we start up im a porous plaster i could stick here if it was twice as steep im getting a sizable hole for one heel already now you hush and let me work  the slow minutes passed smoke centered his soul on the dull hurt of a hangnail on one of his fingers he should have clipped it away that morningit was hurting thenhe decided and he resolved once clear of the crevasse that it should immediately be clipped then with short focus he stared at the hangnail and the finger with a new comprehension in a minute or a few minutes at best that hangnail that finger cunningly jointed and efficient might be part of a mangled carcass at the bottom of the crevasse conscious of his fear he hated himself beareaters were made of sterner stuff in the anger of selfrevolt he all but hacked at the rope with his knife but fear made him draw back the hand and to stick himself again trembling and sweating to the slippery slope to the fact that he was soaking wet by contact with the thawing ice he tried to attribute the cause of his shivering but he knew in the heart of him that it was untrue  a gasp and a groan and an abrupt slackening of the rope warned him he began to slip the movement was very slow the rope tightened loyally but he continued to slip carson could not hold him and was slipping with him the digging toe of his fartherextended foot encountered vacancy and he knew that it was over the straightaway fall and he knew too that in another moment his falling body would jerk carsons after it  blindly desperately all the vitality and lifelove of him beaten down in a flashing instant by a shuddering perception of right and wrong he brought the knifeedge across the rope saw the strands part felt himself slide more rapidly and then fall  what happened then he did not know he was not unconscious but it happened too quickly and it was unexpected instead of falling to his death his feet almost immediately struck in water and he sat violently down in water that splashed coolingly on his face his first impression was that the crevasse was shallower than he had imagined and that he had safely fetched bottom but of this he was quickly disabused the opposite wall was a dozen feet away he lay in a basin formed in an outjut of the icewall by melting water that dribbled and trickled over the bulge above and fell sheer down a distance of a dozen feet this had hollowed out the basin where he sat the water was two feet deep and it was flush with the rim he peered over the rim and looked down the narrow chasm hundreds of feet to the torrent that foamed along the bottom  oh why did you he heard a wail from above  listen he called up im perfectly safe sitting in a pool of water up to my neck and heres both our packs im going to sit on them theres room for a halfdozen here if you slip stick close and youll land in the meantime you hike up and get out go to the cabin somebodys there i saw the smoke get a rope or anything that will make rope and come back and fish for me  honest came carsons incredulous voice  cross my heart and hope to die now get a hustle on or ill catch my death of cold  smoke kept himself warm by kicking a channel through the rim with the heel of his shoe by the time he had drained off the last of the water a faint call from carson announced that he had reached the top  after that smoke occupied himself with drying his clothes the late afternoon sun beat warmly in upon him and he wrung out his garments and spread them about him his matchcase was waterproof and he manipulated and dried sufficient tobacco and ricepaper to make cigarettes  two hours later perched naked on the two packs and smoking he heard a voice above that he could not fail to identify  oh smoke smoke  hello joy gastell he called back whered you drop from  are you hurt  not even any skin off  fathers paying the rope down now do you see it  yes and ive got it he answered now wait a couple of minutes please  whats the matter came her anxious query after several minutes oh i know youre hurt  no im not im dressing  dressing  yes ive been in swimming now ready hoist away  he sent up the two packs on the first trip was consequently rebuked by joy gastell and on the second trip came up himself   joy gastell looked at him with glowing eyes while her father and carson were busy coiling the rope how could you cut loose in that splendid way she cried it wasit was glorious thats all  smoke waved the compliment away with a deprecatory hand  i know all about it she persisted carson told me you sacrificed yourself to save him  nothing of the sort smoke lied i could see that swimmingpool right under me all the time     viii the hanging of cultus george   the way led steeply up through deep powdery snow that was unmarred by sledtrack or moccasin impression smoke in the lead pressed the fragile crystals down under his fat short snowshoes the task required lungs and muscle and he flung himself into it with all his strength behind on the surface he packed strained the string of six dogs the steamjets of their breathing attesting their labor and the lowness of the temperature between the wheeldog and the sled toiled shorty his weight divided between the guiding geepole and the haul for he was pulling with the dogs every halfhour he and smoke exchanged places for the snowshoe work was even more arduous than that of the geepole  the whole outfit was fresh and strong it was merely hard work being efficiently donethe breaking of a midwinter trail across a divide on this severe stretch ten miles a day they called a decent stint they kept in condition but each night crawled well tired into their sleepingfurs this was their sixth day out from the lively camp of mucluc on the yukon in two days with the loaded sled they had covered the fifty miles of packed trail up moose creek then had come the struggle with the four feet of untouched snow that was really not snow but frostcrystals so lacking in cohesion that when kicked it flew with the thin hissing of granulated sugar in three days they had wallowed thirty miles up minnow creek and across the series of low divides that separate the several creeks flowing south into siwash river and now they were breasting the big divide past the bald buttes where the way would lead them down porcupine creek to the middle reaches of milk river higher up milk river it was fairly rumored were deposits of copper and this was their goala hill of pure copper half a mile to the right and up the first creek after milk river issued from a deep gorge to flow across a heavily timbered stretch of bottom they would know it when they saw it oneeyed mccarthy had described it with sharp definiteness it was impossible to miss itunless mccarthy had lied  smoke was in the lead and the small scattered sprucetrees were becoming scarcer and smaller when he saw one dead and bonedry that stood in their path there was no need for speech his glance to shorty was acknowledged by a stentorian whoa the dogs stood in the traces till they saw shorty begin to undo the sledlashings and smoke attack the dead spruce with an ax whereupon the animals dropped in the snow and curled into balls the bush of each tail curved to cover four padded feet and an icerimmed muzzle  the men worked with the quickness of long practice goldpan coffeepot and cookingpail were soon thawing the heaped frostcrystals into water smoke extracted a stick of beans from the sled already cooked with a generous admixture of cubes of fat pork and bacon the beans had been frozen into this portable immediacy he chopped off chunks with an ax as if it were so much firewood and put them into the fryingpan to thaw solidly frozen sourdough biscuits were likewise placed to thaw in twenty minutes from the time they halted the meal was ready to eat  about forty below shorty mumbled through a mouthful of beans sayi hope it dont get colderor warmer neither its just right for trail breaking  smoke did not answer his own mouth full of beans his jaws working he had chanced to glance at the leaddog lying half a dozen feet away that gray and frosty wolf was gazing at him with the infinite wistfulness and yearning that glimmers and hazes so often in the eyes of northland dogs smoke knew it well but never got over the unfathomable wonder of it as if to shake off the hypnotism he set down his plate and coffeecup went to the sled and began opening the driedfish sack  hey shorty expostulated what r you doin  breaking all law custom precedent and trail usage smoke replied im going to feed the dogs in the middle of the dayjust this once theyve worked hard and that last pull to the top of the divide is before them besides bright there has been talking to me telling me all untellable things with those eyes of his  shorty laughed skeptically go on an spoil em pretty soon youll be manicurin their nails id recommend cold cream and electric massageits great for sleddogs and sometimes a turkish bath does em fine  ive never done it before smoke defended and i wont again but this once im going to its just a whim i guess  oh if its a hunch go to it shortys tones showed how immediately he had been mollified a mans always got to follow his hunches  it isnt a hunch shorty bright just sort of got on my imagination for a couple of twists he told me more in one minute with those eyes of his than i could read in the books in a thousand years his eyes were acrawl with the secrets of life they were just squirming and wriggling there the trouble is i almost got them and then i didnt im no wiser than i was before but i was near them he paused and then added i cant tell you but that dogs eyes were just spilling over with cues to what life is and evolution and stardust and cosmic sap and all the resteverything  boiled down into simple american you got a hunch shorty insisted  smoke finished tossing the dried salmon one to each dog and shook his head  i tell you yes shorty argued smoke its a sure hunch somethings goin to happen before the day is out youll see and them dried fishll have a bearin  youve got to show me said smoke  no i aint the dayll take care of itself an show you now listen to what im tellin you i got a hunch myself out of your hunch ill bet eleven ounces against three ornery toothpicks im right when i get a hunch i aint ascared to ride it  you bet the toothpicks and ill bet the ounces smoke returned  nope thatd be plain robbery i win i know a hunch when it tickles me before the days out somethin ll happen an them fishll have a meanin  hell said smoke dismissing the discussion contemptuously  an itll be hell shorty came back an ill take three more toothpicks with you on them same odds that itll be sureenough hell  done said smoke  i win shorty exulted chickenfeather toothpicks for mine  an hour later they cleared the divide dipped down past the bald buttes through a sharp elbowcanyon and took the steep open slope that dropped into porcupine creek shorty in the lead stopped abruptly and smoke whoaed the dogs beneath them coming up was a procession of humans scattered and draggled a quarter of a mile long  they move like it was a funeral shorty noted  theyve no dogs said smoke  yep theres a couple of men pullin on a sled  see that fellow fall down theres something the matter shorty and there must be two hundred of them  look at em stagger as if they was soused there goes another  its a whole tribe there are children there  smoke i win shorty proclaimed a hunch is a hunch an you cant beat it there she comes look at hersurgin up like a lot of corpses  the mass of indians at sight of the two men had raised a weird cry of joy and accelerated its pace  theyre sure tolerable woozy commented shorty see em fallin down in lumps and bunches  look at the face of that first one smoke said its starvationthats whats the matter with them theyve eaten their dogs  whatll we do run for it  and leave the sled and dogs smoke demanded reproachfully  theyll sure eat us if we dont they look hungry enough for it hello old skeeziks whats wrong with you dont look at that dog that way no cookinpot for himsavvy  the forerunners were arriving and crowding about them moaning and plainting in an unfamiliar jargon to smoke the picture was grotesque and horrible it was famine unmistakable their faces hollowcheeked and skinstretched were so many deathsheads more and more arrived and crowded about until smoke and shorty were hemmed in by the wild crew their ragged garments of skin and fur were cut and slashed away and smoke knew the reason for it when he saw a wizened child on a squaws back that sucked and chewed a strip of filthy fur another child he observed steadily masticating a leather thong  keep off therekeep back shorty yelled falling back on english after futile attempts with the little indian he did know  bucks and squaws and children tottered and swayed on shaking legs and continued to surge in their mad eyes swimming with weakness and burning with ravenous desire a woman moaning staggered past shorty and fell with spread and grasping arms on the sled an old man followed her panting and gasping with trembling hands striving to cast off the sled lashings and get at the grubsacks beneath a young man with a naked knife tried to rush in but was flung back by smoke the whole mass pressed in upon them and the fight was on  at first smoke and shorty shoved and thrust and threw back then they used the butt of the dogwhip and their fists on the foodmad crowd and all this against a background of moaning and wailing women and children here and there in a dozen places the sledlashings were cut men crawled in on their bellies regardless of a rain of kicks and blows and tried to drag out the grub these had to be picked up bodily and flung back and such was their weakness that they fell continually under the slightest pressures or shoves yet they made no attempt to injure the two men who defended the sled  it was the utter weakness of the indians that saved smoke and shorty from being overborne in five minutes the wall of upstanding onstruggling indians had been changed to heaps of fallen ones that moaned and gibbered in the snow and cried and sniveled as their staring swimming eyes focused on the grub that meant life to them and that brought the slaver to their lips and behind it all arose the wailing of the women and children  shut up oh shut up shorty yelled thrusting his fingers into his ears and breathing heavily from his exertions ah you would would you was his cry as he lunged forward and kicked a knife from the hand of a man who bellying through the snow was trying to stab the leaddog in the throat  this is terrible smoke muttered  im all het up shorty replied returning from the rescue of bright im real sweaty an now what r we goin to do with this ambulance outfit  smoke shook his head and then the problem was solved for him an indian crawled forward his one eye fixed on smoke instead of on the sled and in it smoke could see the struggle of sanity to assert itself shorty remembered having punched the other eye which was already swollen shut the indian raised himself on his elbow and spoke  me carluk me good siwash me savvy boston man plenty me plenty hungry all people plenty hungry all people no savvy boston man me savvy me eat grub now all people eat grub now we buy m grub got m plenty gold no got m grub summer salmon no come milk river winter caribou no come no

like m gold  he began fumbling with wasted fingers at the drawstring of a pouch he took from his belt  too much make m noise shorty broke in distractedly you tell m squaw you tell m papoose shut m up mouth  carluk turned and addressed the wailing women other bucks listening raised their voices authoritatively and slowly the squaws stilled and quieted the children near to them carluk paused from fumbling the drawstring and held up his fingers many times  him people make m die he said  and smoke following the count knew that seventyfive of the tribe had starved to death  me buy m grub carluk said as he got the pouch open and drew out a large chunk of heavy metal others were following his example and on every side appeared similar chunks shorty stared  great jeminey he cried copper raw red copper an they think its gold  him gold carluk assured them confidently his quick comprehension having caught the gist of shortys exclamation  and the poor devils banked everything on it smoke muttered look at it that chunk there weighs forty pounds theyve got hundreds of pounds of it and theyve carried it when they didnt have strength enough to drag themselves look here shorty weve got to feed them  huh sounds easy but how about statistics you an me has a months grub which is six meals times thirty which is one hundred an eighty meals heres two hundred indians with real fullgrown appetites how the blazes can we give m one meal even  theres the doggrub smoke answered a couple of hundred pounds of dried salmon ought to help out weve got to do it theyve pinned their faith on the white man you know  sure an we cant throw m down shorty agreed an we got two nasty jobs cut out for us each just about twicet as nasty as the other one of us has got to make a run of it to mucluc an raise a relief the other has to stay here an run the hospital an most likely be eaten dont let it slip your noodle that weve been six days gettin here an travelin light an all played out it cant be made back in less n three days  for a minute smoke pondered the miles of the way they had come visioning the miles in terms of time measured by his capacity for exertion i can get there tomorrow night he announced  all right shorty acquiesced cheerfully an ill stay an be eaten  but im going to take one fish each for the dogs smoke explained and one meal for myself  an youll sure need it if you make mucluc tomorrow night  smoke through the medium of carluk stated the program make fires long fires plenty fires he concluded plenty boston man stop mucluc boston man much good boston man plenty grub five sleeps i come back plenty grub this man his name shorty very good friend of mine he stop here he big bosssavvy  carluk nodded and interpreted  all grub stop here shorty he give m grub he bosssavvy  carluk interpreted and nods and guttural cries of agreement proceeded from the men  smoke remained and managed until the full swing of the arrangement was under way those who were able crawled or staggered in the collecting of firewood long indian fires were built that accommodated all shorty aided by a dozen assistants with a short club handy for the rapping of hungry knuckles plunged into the cooking the women devoted themselves to thawing snow in every utensil that could be mustered first a tiny piece of bacon was distributed all around and next a spoonful of sugar to cloy the edge of their razor appetites soon on a circle of fires drawn about shorty many pots of beans were boiling and he with a wrathful eye for what he called renigers was frying and apportioning the thinnest of flapjacks  me for the big cookin was his farewell to smoke you just keep ahikin trot all the way there an run all the way back itll take you today an tomorrow to get there and you cant be back inside of three days more tomorrow theyll eat the last of the dogfish an then therell be nary a scrap for three days you gotta keep acomin smoke you gotta keep acomin  though the sled was light loaded only with six dried salmon a couple of pounds of frozen beans and bacon and a sleepingrobe smoke could not make speed instead of riding the sled and running the dogs he was compelled to plod at the geepole also a day of work had already been done and the freshness and spring had gone out of the dogs and himself the long arctic twilight was on when he cleared the divide and left the bald buttes behind  down the slope better time was accomplished and often he was able to spring on the sled for short intervals and get an exhausting sixmile clip out of the animals darkness caught him and fooled him in a widevalleyed nameless creek here the creek wandered in broad horseshoe curves through the flats and here to save time he began shortcutting the flats instead of keeping to the creekbed and black dark found him back on the creekbed feeling for the trail after an hour of futile searching too wise to go farther astray he built a fire fed each dog half a fish and divided his own ration in half rolled in his robe ere quick sleep came he had solved the problem the last big flat he had shortcut was the one that occurred at the forks of the creek he had missed the trail by a mile he was now on the main stream and below where his and shortys trail crossed the valley and climbed through a small feeder to the low divide on the other side  at the first hint of daylight he got under way breakfastless and wallowed a mile upstream to pick up the trail and breakfastless man and dogs without a halt for eight hours held back transversely across the series of small creeks and low divides and down minnow creek by four in the afternoon with darkness fastset about him he emerged on the hardpacked running trail of moose creek fifty miles of it would end the journey he called a rest built a fire threw each dog its halfsalmon and thawed and ate his pound of beans then he sprang on the sled yelled mush and the dogs went out strongly against their breastbands  hit her up you huskies he cried mush on hit her up for grub and no grub short of mucluc dig in you wolves dig in   midnight had gone a quarter of an hour in the annie mine the main room was comfortably crowded while roaring stoves combined with lack of ventilation kept the big room unsanitarily warm the click of chips and the boisterous play at the crapstable furnished a monotonous background of sound to the equally monotonous rumble of mens voices where they sat and stood about and talked in groups and twos and threes the goldweighers were busy at their scales for dust was the circulating medium and even a dollar drink of whiskey at the bar had to be paid for to the weighers  the walls of the room were of tiered logs the bark still on and the chinking between the logs plainly visible was arctic moss through the open door that led to the danceroom came the rollicking strains of a virginia reel played by a piano and a fiddle the drawing of chinese lottery had just taken place and the luckiest player having cashed at the scales was drinking up his winnings with half a dozen cronies the faro and roulettetables were busy and quiet the drawpoker and studpoker tables each with its circle of onlookers were equally quiet at another table a serious concentrated game of black jack was on only from the crapstable came noise as the man who played rolled the dice full sweep down the green amphitheater of a table in pursuit of his elusive and longdelayed point ever he cried oh you joe cotton come a four come a joe little joe bring home the bacon joe joe you joe you  cultus george a big strapping circle city indian leaned distantly and dourly against the log wall he was a civilized indian if living like a white man connotes civilization and he was sorely offended though the offense was of long standing for years he had done a white mans work had done it alongside of white men and often had done it better than they did he wore the same pants they wore the same hearty woolens and heavy shirts he sported as good a watch as they parted his short hair on the side and ate the same foodbacon beans and flour and yet he was denied their greatest diversion and reward namely whiskey cultus george was a moneyearner he had staked claims and bought and sold claims he had been grubstaked and he had accorded grubstakes just now he was a dogmusher and freighter charging twentyeight cents a pound for the winter haul from sixty mile to muclucand for bacon thirtythree cents as was the custom his poke was fat with dust he had the price of many drinks yet no barkeeper would serve him whiskey the hottest swiftest completest gratifier of civilization was not for him only by subterranean and cowardly and expensive ways could he get a drink and he resented this invidious distinction as he had resented it for years deeply and he was especially thirsty and resentful this night while the white men he had so sedulously emulated he hated more bitterly than ever before the white men would graciously permit him to lose his gold across their gamingtables but for neither love nor money could he obtain a drink across their bars wherefore he was very sober and very logical and logically sullen  the virginia reel in the danceroom wound to a wild close that interfered not with the three camp drunkards who snored under the piano all couples promenade to the bar was the callers last cry as the music stopped and the couples were so promenading through the wide doorway into the main roomthe men in furs and moccasins the women in soft fluffy dresses silk stockings and dancingslipperswhen the double stormdoors were thrust open and smoke bellew staggered wearily in  eyes centered on him and silence began to fall he tried to speak pulled off his mittens which fell dangling from their cords and clawed at the frozen moisture of his breath which had formed in fifty miles of running he halted irresolutely then went over and leaned his elbow on the end of the bar  only the man at the crapstable without turning his head continued to roll the dice and to cry oh you joe come on you joe the gamekeepers gaze fixed on smoke caught the players attention and he too with suspended dice turned and looked  whats up smoke matson the owner of the annie mine demanded  with a last effort smoke clawed his mouth free i got some dogs out theredead beat he said huskily somebody go and take care of them and ill tell you whats the matter  in a dozen brief sentences he outlined the situation the crapsplayer his money still lying on the table and his slippery joe cotton still uncaptured had come over to smoke and was now the first to speak  we gotta do something thats straight but what youve had time to think whats your plan spit it out  sure smoke assented heres what ive been thinking weve got to hustle light sleds on the jump say a hundred pounds of grub on each sled the drivers outfit and doggrub will fetch it up fifty more but they can make time say we start five of these sleds prontobest running teams best mushers and traileaters on the soft trail the sleds can take the lead turn about theyve got to start at once at the best by the time they can get there all those indians wont have had a scrap to eat for three days and then as soon as weve got those sleds off well have to follow up with heavy sleds figure it out yourself two pounds a day is the very least we can decently keep those indians traveling on thats four hundred pounds a day and with the old people and the children five days is the quickest time we can bring them into mucluc now what are you going to do  take up a collection to buy all the grub said the crapsplayer  ill stand for the grub smoke began impatiently  nope the other interrupted this aint your treat were all in fetch a washbasin somebody it wont take a minute an heres a starter  he pulled a heavy goldsack from his pocket untied the mouth and poured a stream of coarse dust and nuggets into the basin a man beside him caught his hand up with a jerk and an oath elevating the mouth of the sack so as to stop the run of the dust to a casual eye six or eight ounces had already run into the basin  dont be a hawg cried the second man you aint the only one with a poke gimme a chance at it  huh sneered the crapsplayer youd think it was a stampede youre so goshdanged eager about it  men crowded and jostled for the opportunity to contribute and when they were satisfied smoke hefted the heavy basin with both hands and grinned  it will keep the whole tribe in grub for the rest of the winter he said now for the dogs five light teams that have some run in them  a dozen teams were volunteered and the camp as a committee of the whole bickered and debated accepted and rejected  huh your drayhorses long bill haskell was told  they can pull he bristled with hurt pride  they sure can he was assured but they cant make time for sour apples theyve got theirs cut out for them bringing up the heavy loads  as fast as a team was selected its owner with half a dozen aids departed to harness up and get ready  one team was rejected because it had come in tired that afternoon one owner contributed his team but apologetically exposed a bandaged ankle that prevented him from driving it this team smoke took overriding the objection of the crowd that he was played out  long bill haskell pointed out that while fat olsens team was a crackerjack fat olsen himself was an elephant fat olsens two hundred and forty pounds of heartiness was indignant tears of anger came into his eyes and his scandinavian explosions could not be stopped until he was given a place in the heavy division the crapsplayer jumping at the chance to take out olsens light team  five teams were accepted and were being harnessed and loaded but only four drivers had satisfied the committee of the whole  theres cultus george some one cried hes a traileater and hes fresh and rested  all eyes turned upon the indian but his face was expressionless and he said nothing  youll take a team smoke said to him  still the big indian made no answer as with an electric thrill it ran through all of them that something untoward was impending a restless shifting of the group took place forming a circle in which smoke and cultus george faced each other and smoke realized that by common consent he had been made the representative of his fellows in what was taking place in what was to take place also he was angered it was beyond him that any human creature a witness to the scramble of volunteers should hang back for another thing in what followed smoke did not have cultus georges point of viewdid not dream that the indian held back for any reason save the selfish mercenary one  of course you will take a team smoke said  how much cultus george asked  a snarl spontaneous and general grated in the throats and twisted the mouths of the miners at the same moment with clenched fists or fingers crooked to grip they pressed in on the offender  wait a bit boys smoke cried maybe he doesnt understand let me explain it to him look here george dont you see nobody is charging anything theyre giving everything to save two hundred indians from starving to death he paused to let it sink home  how much said cultus george  wait you fellows now listen george we dont want you to make any mistake these starving people are your kind of people theyre another tribe but theyre indians just the same now youve seen what the white men are doingcoughing up their dust giving their dogs and sleds falling over one another to hit the trail only the best men can go with the first sleds look at fat olsen there he was ready to fight because they wouldnt let him go you ought to be mighty proud because all men think you are a numberone musher it isnt a case of how much but how quick  how much said cultus george  kill him bust his head tar and feathers were several of the cries in the wild medley that went up the spirit of philanthropy and good fellowship changed to brute savagery on the instant  in the stormcenter cultus george stood imperturbable while smoke thrust back the fiercest and shouted  wait whos running this the clamor died away fetch a rope he added quietly  cultus george shrugged his shoulders his face twisting tensely in a sullen and incredulous grin he knew this whiteman breed he had toiled on trail with it and eaten its flour and bacon and beans too long not to know it it was a lawabiding breed he knew that thoroughly it always punished the man who broke the law but he had broken no law he knew its law he had lived up to it he had neither murdered stolen nor lied there was nothing in the white mans law against charging a price and driving a bargain they all charged a price and drove bargains he was doing nothing more than that and it was the thing they had taught him besides if he wasnt good enough to drink with them then he was not good enough to be charitable with them nor to join them in any other of their foolish diversions  neither smoke nor any man there glimpsed what lay in cultus georges brain behind his attitude and prompting his attitude though they did not know it they were as beclouded as he in the matter of mutual understanding to them he was a selfish brute to him they were selfish brutes  when the rope was brought long bill haskell fat olsen and the crapsplayer with much awkwardness and angry haste got the slipnoose around the indians neck and rove the rope over a rafter at the other end of the dangling thing a dozen men tailed on ready to hoist away  nor had cultus george resisted he knew it for what it wasbluff the whites were strong on bluff was not drawpoker their favorite game did they not buy and sell and make all bargains with bluff yes he had seen a white man do business with a look on his face of four aces and in his hand a busted straight  wait smoke commanded tie his hands we dont want him climbing  more bluff cultus george decided and passively permitted his hands to be tied behind his back  now its your last chance george said smoke will you take out the team  how much said cultus george  astounded at himself that he should be able to do such a thing and at the same time angered by the colossal selfishness of the indian smoke gave the signal nor was cultus george any less astounded when he felt the noose tighten with a jerk and swing him off the floor his stolidity broke on the instant on his face in quick succession appeared surprise dismay and pain  smoke watched anxiously having never been hanged himself he felt a tyro at the business the body struggled convulsively the tied hands strove to burst the bonds and from the throat came unpleasant noises of strangulation suddenly smoke held up his hand  slack away he ordered  grumbling at the shortness of the punishment the men on the rope lowered cultus george to the floor his eyes were bulging and he was tottery on his feet swaying from side to side and still making a fight with his hands smoke divined what was the matter thrust violent fingers between the rope and the neck and brought the noose slack with a jerk with a great heave of the chest cultus george got his first breath  will you take that team out smoke demanded  cultus george did not answer he was too busy breathing  oh we white men are hogs smoke filled in the interval resentful himself at the part he was compelled to play wed sell our souls for gold and all that but once in a while we forget about it and turn loose and do something without a thought of how much there is in it and when we do that cultus george watch out what we want to know now is are you going to take out that team  cultus george debated with himself he was no coward perhaps this was the extent of their bluff and if he gave in now he was a fool and while he debated smoke suffered from secret worry lest this stubborn aborigine would persist in being hanged  how much said cultus george  smoke started to raise his hand for the signal  me go cultus george said very quickly before the rope could tighten  an when that rescue expedition found me shorty told it in the annie mine that ornery cultus george was the first in beatin smokes sled by three hours an dont you forget it smoke comes in second at that just the same it was about time when i heard cultus george ayellin at his dogs from the top of the divide for those blamed siwashes had ate my moccasins my mitts the leather lacins my knifesheath an some of em was beginnin to look mighty hungry at meme bein better nourished you see  an smoke he was near dead he hustled around a while helpin to start a meal for them two hundred sufferin siwashes an then he fell asleep settin on his haunches thinkin he was feedin snow into a thawinpail i fixed him my bed an dang me if i didnt have to help him into it he was that give out sure i win the toothpicks didnt them dogs just naturally need the six salmon smoke fed em at the noonin     ix the mistake of creation   whoa smoke yelled at the dogs throwing his weight back on the geepole to bring the sled to a halt  whats eatin you now shorty complained they aint no water under that footing  no but look at that trail cutting out to the right smoke answered i thought nobody was wintering in this section  the dogs on the moment they stopped dropped in the snow and began biting out the particles of ice from between their toes this ice had been water five minutes before the animals had broken through a skein of ice snowpowdered which had hidden the spring water that oozed out of the bank and pooled on top of the threefoot winter crust of nordbeska river  first i heard of anybody up the nordbeska shorty said staring at the all but obliterated track covered by two feet of snow that left the bed of the river at right angles and entered the mouth of a small stream flowing from the left mebbe theyre hunters and pulled their freight long ago  smoke scooping the light snow away with mittened hands paused to consider scooped again and again paused no he decided theres been travel both ways but the last travel was up that creek whoever they are theyre there nowcertain theres been no travel for weeks now whats been keeping them there all the time thats what i want to know  and what i want to know is where were going to camp tonight shorty said staring disconsolately at the skyline in the southwest where the midafternoon twilight was darkening into night  lets follow the track up the creek was smokes suggestion theres plenty of dead timber we can camp any time  sure we can camp any time but we got to travel most of the time if we aint goin to starve an we got to travel in the right direction  were going to find something up that creek smoke went on  but look at the grub look at them dogs shorty cried look atoh hell all right you will have your will  it wont make the trip a day longer smoke urged possibly no more than a mile longer  men has died for as little as a mile shorty retorted shaking his head with lugubrious resignation come on for trouble get up you poor sorefoots youget up haw you bright haw  the leaddog obeyed and the whole team strained weakly into the soft snow  whoa shorty yelled its pack trail  smoke pulled his snowshoes from under the sledlashings bound them to his moccasined feet and went to the fore to press and pack the light surface for the dogs  it was heavy work dogs and men had been for days on short rations and few and limited were the reserves of energy they could call upon though they followed the creek bed so pronounced was its fall that they toiled on a stiff and unrelenting upgrade the high rocky walls quickly drew near together so that their way led up the bottom of a narrow gorge the long lingering twilight blocked by the high mountains was no more than semidarkness  its a trap shorty said the whole look of it is rotten its a hole in the ground its the stampinground of trouble  smoke made no reply and for half an hour they toiled on in silencea silence that was again broken by shorty  shes aworkin he grumbled shes sure aworkin an ill tell you if youre minded to hear an listen  go on smoke answered  well she tells me plain an simple that we aint never goin to get out of this hole in the ground in days an days were goin to find trouble an be stuck in here a long time an then some  does she say anything about grub smoke queried unsympathetically for we havent grub for days and days and days and then some  nope nary whisper about grub i guess well manage to make out but i tell you one thing smoke straight an flat ill eat any dog in the team exceptin bright i got to draw the line on bright i just couldnt scoff him  cheer up smoke girded my hunch is working overtime she tells me therell be no dogs eaten and whether its moose or caribou or quail on toast well all fatten up  shorty snorted his unutterable disgust and silence obtained for another quarter of an hour  theres the beginning of your trouble smoke said halting on his snowshoes and staring at an object that lay on one side of the old trail  shorty left the geepole and joined him and together they gazed down on the body of a man beside the trail  well fed said smoke  look at them lips said shorty  stiff as a poker said smoke lifting an arm that without moving moved the whole body  pick m up an drop m and hed break to pieces was shortys comment  the man lay on his side solidly frozen from the fact that no snow powdered him it was patent that he had lain there but a short time  there was a general fall of snow three days back said shorty  smoke nodded bending over the corpse twisting it half up to face them and pointing to a bullet wound in the temple he glanced to the side and tilted his head at a revolver that lay on top of the snow  a hundred yards farther on they came upon a second body that lay face downward in the trail two things are pretty clear smoke said theyre fat that means no famine theyve not struck it rich else they wouldnt have committed suicide  if they did shorty objected  they certainly did there are no tracks besides their own and each is powderburned smoke dragged the corpse to one side and with the toe of his moccasin nosed a revolver out of the snow into which it had been pressed by the body thats what did the work i told you wed find something  from the looks of it we aint started yet now whatd two fat geezers want to kill theirselves for  when we find that out well have found the rest of your trouble smoke answered come on its blowing dark  quite dark it was when smokes snowshoe tripped him over a body he fell across a sled on which lay another body and when he had dug the snow out of his neck and struck a match he and shorty glimpsed a third body wrapped in blankets lying beside a partially dug grave also ere the match flickered out they caught sight of half a dozen additional graves  brrr shorty shivered suicide camp all fed up i reckon theyre all dead  nopeep at that smoke was looking farther along at a dim glimmer of light and theres another lightand a third one there come on lets hike  no more corpses delayed them and in several minutes over a hardpacked trail they were in the camp  its a city shorty whispered there must be twenty cabins an not a dog aint that funny  and that explains it smoke whispered back excitedly its the laura sibley outfit dont you remember came up the yukon last fall on the port townsend number six went right by dawson without stopping the steamer must have landed them at the mouth of the creek  sure i remember they was mormons  novegetarians smoke grinned in the darkness they wont eat meat and they wont work dogs  its all the same i knowed they was something funny about em had the allwise steer to the yellow that laura sibley was goin to take em right to the spot where theyd all be millionaires  yes she was their seeresshad visions and that sort of stuff i thought they went up the nordensjold  huh listen to that  shortys hand in the darkness went out warningly to smokes chest and together they listened to a groan deep and long drawn that came from one of the cabins ere it could die away it was taken up by another cabin and anothera vast suspiration of human misery the effect was monstrous and nightmarish  brrr shorty shivered its gettin me goin lets break in an find whats eatin em  smoke knocked at a lighted cabin and was followed in by shorty in answer to the come in of the voice they heard groaning it was a simple log cabin the walls mosschinked the earth floor covered with sawdust and shavings the light was a kerosenelamp and they could make out four bunks three of which were occupied by men who ceased from groaning in order to stare  whats the matter smoke demanded of one whose blankets could not hide his broad shoulders and massively muscled body whose eyes were painracked and whose cheeks were hollow smallpox what is it  in reply the man pointed at his mouth spreading black and swollen lips in the effort and smoke recoiled at the sight  scurvy he muttered to shorty and the man confirmed the diagnosis with a nod of the head  plenty of grub shorty asked  yep was the answer from a man in another bunk help yourself theres slathers of it the cabin next on the other side is empty cache is right alongside wade into it  in every cabin they visited that night they found a similar situation scurvy had smitten the whole camp a dozen women were in the party though the two men did not see all of them originally there had been ninetythree men and women but ten had died and two had recently disappeared smoke told of finding the two and expressed surprise that none had gone that short distance down the trail to find out for themselves what particularly struck him and shorty was the helplessness of these people their cabins were littered and dirty the dishes stood unwashed on the rough plank tables there was no mutual aid a cabins troubles were its own troubles and already they had ceased from the exertion of burying their dead  its almost weird smoke confided to shorty ive met shirkers and loafers but i never met so many all at one time you heard what they said theyve never done a tap ill bet they havent washed their own faces no wonder they got scurvy  but vegetarians hadnt ought to get scurvy shorty contended its the saltmeateaters thats supposed to fall for it and they dont eat meat salt or fresh raw or cooked or any other way  smoke shook his head i know and its vegetable diet that cures scurvy no drugs will do it vegetables especially potatoes are the only dope but dont forget one thing shorty we are not up against a theory but a condition the fact is these grasseaters have all got scurvy  must be contagious  no that the doctors do know scurvy is not a germ disease it cant be caught its generated as near as i can get it its due to an impoverished condition of the blood its cause is not something theyve got but something they havent got a man gets scurvy for lack of certain chemicals in his blood and those chemicals dont come out of powders and bottles but do come out of vegetables  an these people eats nothin but grass shorty groaned and theyve got it up to their ears that proves youre all wrong smoke youre spielin a theory but this condition sure knocks the spots outa your theory scurvys catchin an thats why theyve all got it an rotten bad at that you an mell get it too if we hang around this diggin brrri can feel the bugs crawlin into my system right now  smoke laughed skeptically and knocked on a cabin door i suppose well find the same old thing he said come on weve got to get a line on the situation  what do you want came a womans sharp voice  we want to see you smoke answered  who are you  two doctors from dawson shorty blurted in with a levity that brought a punch in the short ribs from smokes elbow  dont want to see any doctors the woman said in tones crisp and staccato with pain and irritation go away good night we dont believe in doctors  smoke pulled the latch shoved the door open and entered turning up the lowflamed kerosenelamp so that he could see in four bunks four women ceased from groaning and sighing to stare at the intruders two were young thinfaced creatures the third was an elderly and very stout woman and the fourth the one whom smoke identified by her voice was the thinnest frailest specimen of the human race he had ever seen as he quickly learned she was laura sibley the seeress and professional clairvoyant who had organized the expedition in los angeles and led it to this deathcamp on the nordbeska the conversation that ensued was acrimonious laura sibley did not believe in doctors also to add to her purgatory she had wellnigh ceased to believe in herself  why didnt you send out for help smoke asked when she paused breathless and exhausted from her initial tirade theres a camp at stewart river and eighteen days travel would fetch dawson from here  why didnt amos wentworth go she demanded with a wrath that bordered on hysteria  dont know the gentleman smoke countered whats he been doing  nothing except that hes the only one that hasnt caught the scurvy and why hasnt he caught the scurvy ill tell you no i wont the thin lips compressed so tightly that through the emaciated transparency of them smoke was almost convinced he could see the teeth and the roots of the teeth and what would have been the use dont i know im not a fool our caches are filled with every kind of fruit juice and preserved vegetables we are better situated than any other camp in alaska to fight scurvy there is no prepared vegetable fruit and nut food we havent and in plenty  shes got you there smoke shorty exulted and its a condition not a theory you say vegetables cures heres the vegetables and wheres the cure  theres no explanation i can see smoke acknowledged yet there is no camp in alaska like this ive seen scurvya sprinkling of cases here and there but i never saw a whole camp with it nor did i ever see such terrible cases which is neither here nor there shorty weve got to do what we can for these people but first weve got to make camp and take care of the dogs well see you in the morning ermrs sibley  miss sibley she bridled and now young man if you come fooling around this cabin with any doctor stuff ill fill you full of birdshot  this divine seeress is a sweet one smoke chuckled as he and shorty felt their way back through the darkness to the empty cabin next to the one they had first entered  it was evident that two men had lived until recently in the cabin and the partners wondered if they werent the two suicides down the trail together they overhauled the cache and found it filled with an undreamedof variety of canned powdered dried evaporated condensed and desiccated foods  what in the name of reason do they want to go and get scurvy for shorty demanded brandishing to the light packages of eggpowder and italian mushrooms and look at that and that he tossed out cans of tomatoes and corn and bottles of stuffed olives and the divine steeress got the scurvy too what dye make of it  seeress smoke corrected  steeress shorty reiterated didnt she steer em here to this hole in the ground  next morning after daylight smoke encountered a man carrying a heavy sledload of firewood he was a little man cleanlooking and spry who walked briskly despite the load smoke experienced an immediate dislike  whats the matter with you he asked  nothing the little man answered  i know that smoke said thats why i asked you youre amos wentworth now why under the sun havent you the scurvy like all the rest  because ive exercised came the quick reply there wasnt any need for any of them to get it if theyd only got out and done something what did they do growled and kicked and grouched at the cold the long nights the hardships the aches and pains and everything else they loafed in their beds until they swelled up and couldnt leave them thats all look at me ive worked come into my cabin  smoke followed him in  squint around clean as a whistle eh you bet everything shipshape i wouldnt keep those chips and shavings on the floor except for the warmth but theyre clean chips and shavings you ought to see the floor in some of the shacks pigpens as for me i havent eaten a meal off an unwashed dish no sir it meant work and ive worked and i havent the scurvy you can put that in your pipe and smoke it  youve hit the nail on the head smoke admitted but i see youve only one bunk why so unsociable  because i like to be its easier to clean up for one than two thats why the lazy blanketloafers do you think that i could have stood one around no wonder they got scurvy  it was very convincing but smoke could not rid himself of his dislike of the man  whats laura sibley got it in for you for he asked abruptly  amos wentworth shot a quick look at him shes a crank was the reply so are we all cranks for that matter but heaven save me from the crank that wont wash the dishes that he eats off of and thats what this crowd of cranks are like  a few minutes later smoke was talking with laura sibley supported by a stick in either hand she had paused in hobbling by his cabin  what have you got it in for wentworth for he asked apropos of nothing in the conversation and with a suddenness that caught her off her guard  her green eyes flashed bitterly her emaciated face for the second was convulsed with rage and her sore lips writhed on the verge of unconsidered speech but only a splutter of gasping unintelligible sounds issued forth and then by a terrible effort she controlled herself  because hes healthy she panted because he hasnt the scurvy because he is supremely selfish because he wont lift a hand to help anybody else because hed let us rot and die as he is letting us rot and die without lifting a finger to fetch us a pail of water or a load of firewood thats the kind of a brute he is but let him beware thats all let him beware  still panting and gasping she hobbled on her way and five minutes afterward coming out of the cabin to feed the dogs smoke saw her entering amos wentworths cabin  something rotten here shorty something rotten he said shaking his head ominously as his partner came to the door to empty a pan of dishwater  sure was the cheerful rejoinder an you an mell be catchin it yet youll see  i dont mean the scurvy  oh sure if you mean the divine steeress shed rob a corpse shes the hungriestlookin female i ever seen  exercise has kept you and me in condition shorty its kept wentworth in condition you see what lack of exercise has done for the rest now its up to us to prescribe exercise for these hospital wrecks it will be your job to see that they get it i appoint you chief nurse  what me shorty shouted i resign  no you dont ill be able assistant because it isnt going to be any soft snap weve got to make them hustle first thing theyll have to bury their dead the strongest for the burial squad then the next strongest on the firewood squad theyve been lying in their blankets to save wood and so on down the line and sprucetea mustnt forget that all the sourdoughs swear by it these people have never even heard of it  we sure got ourn cut out for us shorty grinned first thing we know well be full of lead  and thats our first job smoke said come on  in the next hour each of the twentyodd cabins was raided all ammunition and every rifle shotgun and revolver was confiscated  come on you invalids was shortys method shootinironsfork em over we need em  who says so was the query at the first cabin  two doctors from dawson was shortys answer an what they say goes come on shell out the ammunition too  what do you want them for  to stand off a warparty of canned beef comin down the canyon and im givin you fair warnin of a sprucetea invasion come across  and this was only the beginning of the day men were persuaded coaxed bullied or dragged by main strength from their bunks and forced to dress smoke selected the mildest cases for the burial squad another squad was told off to supply the wood by which the graves were burned down into the frozen muck and gravel still another squad had to chop firewood and impartially supply every cabin those who were too weak for outdoor work were put to cleaning and scrubbing the cabins and washing clothes one squad brought in many loads of spruceboughs and every stove was used for the brewing of sprucetea  but no matter what face smoke and shorty put on it the situation was grim and serious at least thirty fearful and impossible cases could not be taken from the beds as the two men with nausea and horror learned while one a woman died in laura sibleys cabin yet strong measures were necessary  i dont like to wallop a sick man shorty explained his fist doubled menacingly but id wallop his block off if itd make him well and what all you lazy bums needs is a wallopin come on out of that an into them duds of yourn double quick or ill sure muss up the front of your face  all the gangs groaned and sighed and wept the tears streaming and freezing down their cheeks as they toiled and it was patent that their agony was real the situation was desperate and smokes prescription was heroic  when the workgangs came in at noon they found decently cooked dinners awaiting them prepared by the weaker members of their cabins under the tutelage and drive of smoke and shorty  thatll do smoke said at three in the afternoon knock off go to your bunks you may be feeling rotten now but youll be the better for it tomorrow of course it hurts to get well but im going to get you well  too late amos wentworth sneered pallidly at smokes efforts they ought to have started in that way last fall  come along with me smoke answered pick up those two pails youre not ailing  from cabin to cabin the three men went dosing every man and woman with a full pint of sprucetea nor was it easy  you might as well learn at the start that we mean business smoke stated to the first obdurate who lay on his back groaning through set teeth stand by shorty smoke caught the patient by the nose and tapped the solarplexus section so as to make the mouth gasp open now shorty down she goes  and down it went accompanied with unavoidable splutterings and stranglings  next time youll take it easier smoke assured the victim reaching for the nose of the man in the adjoining bunk  id sooner take castor oil was shortys private confidence ere he downed his own portion great jumpin methuselem was his entirely public proclamation the moment after he had swallowed the bitter dose its a pint long but hogshead strong  were covering this sprucetea route four times a day and there are eighty of you to be dosed each time smoke informed laura sibley so weve no time to fool will you take it or must i hold your nose his thumb and forefinger hovered eloquently above her its vegetable so you neednt have any qualms  qualms shorty snorted no sure certainly not its the deliciousest dope  laura sibley hesitated she gulped her apprehension  well smoke demanded peremptorily  illill take it she quavered hurry up  that night exhausted as by no hard day of trail smoke and shorty crawled into their blankets  im fairly sick with it smoke confessed the way they suffer is awful but exercise is the only remedy i can think of and it must be given a thorough trial i wish we had a sack of raw potatoes  sparkins he cant wash no more dishes shorty said it hurts him so he sweats his pain i seen him sweat it i had to put him back in the bunk he was that helpless  if only we had raw potatoes smoke went on the vital essential something is missing from that prepared stuff the life has been evaporated out of it  an if that young fellow jones in the brownlow cabin dont croak before morning i miss my guess  for heavens sake be cheerful smoke chided  we got to bury him aint we came the indignant snort i tell you that boys something awful  shut up smoke said  and after several more indignant snorts the heavy breathing of sleep arose from shortys bunk  in the morning not only was jones dead but one of the stronger men who had worked on the firewood squad was found to have hanged himself a nightmare procession of days set in for a week steeling himself to the task smoke enforced the exercise and the sprucetea and one by one and in twos and threes he was compelled to knock off the workers as he was learning exercise was the last thing in the world for scurvy patients the diminishing burial squad was kept steadily at work and a surplus halfdozen graves were always burned down and waiting  you couldnt have selected a worse place for a camp smoke told laura sibley look at itat the bottom of a narrow gorge running east and west the noon sun doesnt rise above the top of the wall you cant have had sunlight for several months  but how was i to know  he shrugged his shoulders i dont see why not if you could lead a hundred fools to a goldmine  she glared malevolently at him and hobbled on several minutes afterward coming back from a trip to where a squad of groaning patients was gathering spruceboughs smoke saw the seeress entering amos wentworths cabin and followed after her at the door he could hear her voice whimpering and pleading  just for me she was begging as smoke entered i wont tell a soul  both glanced guiltily at the intruder and smoke was certain that he was on the edge of something he knew not what and he cursed himself for not having eavesdropped  out with it he commanded harshly what is it  what is what amos wentworth asked sullenly and smoke could not name what was what  grimmer and grimmer grew the situation in that dark hole of a canyon where sunlight never penetrated the horrible death list mounted up each day in apprehension smoke and shorty examined each others mouths for the whitening of the gums and mucous membranesthe invariable first symptom of the disease  ive quit shorty announced one evening ive been thinkin it over an i quit i can make a go at slavedrivin but crippledrivins too much for my stomach they go from bad to worse they aint twenty men i can drive to work i told jackson this afternoon he could take to his bunk he was gettin ready to suicide i could see it stickin out all over him exercise aint no good  ive made up my mind to the same thing smoke answered well knock off all but about a dozen theyll have to lend a hand we can relay them and well keep up the sprucetea  it aint no good  im about ready to agree with that too but at any rate it doesnt hurt them  another suicide was shortys news the following morning that phillips is the one i seen it comin for days  were up against the real thing smoke groaned what would you suggest shorty  who me i aint got no suggestions the things got to run its course  but that means theyll all die smoke protested  except wentworth shorty snarled for he had quickly come to share his partners dislike for that individual  the everlasting miracle of wentworths immunity perplexed smoke why should he alone not have developed scurvy why did laura sibley hate him and at the same time whine and snivel and beg from him what was it she begged from him and that he would not give  on several occasions smoke made it a point to drop into wentworths cabin at mealtime but one thing did he note that was suspicious and that was wentworths suspicion of him next he tried sounding out laura sibley  raw potatoes would cure everybody here he remarked to the seeress i know it ive seen it work before  the flare of conviction in her eyes followed by bitterness and hatred told him the scent was warm  why didnt you bring in a supply of fresh potatoes on the steamer he asked  we did but coming up the river we sold them all out at a bargain at fort yukon we had plenty of the evaporated kinds and we knew theyd keep better they wouldnt even freeze  smoke groaned and you sold them all he asked  yes how were we to know  now mightnt there have been a couple of odd sacks leftaccidentally you know mislaid on the steamer  she shook her head as he thought a trifle belatedly then added we never found any  but mightnt there he persisted  how do i know she rasped angrily i didnt have charge of the commissary  and amos wentworth did he jumped to the conclusion very good now what is your private opinionjust between us two do you think wentworth has any raw potatoes stored away somewhere  no certainly not why should he  why shouldnt he  she shrugged her shoulders  struggle as he would with her smoke could not bring her to admit the possibility  wentworths a swine was shortys verdict when smoke told his suspicions  and so is laura sibley smoke added she believes he has the potatoes and is keeping it quiet and trying to get him to share with her  an he wont come across eh shorty cursed frail human nature with one of his best flights and caught his breath they both got their feet in the trough may god rot them dead with scurvy for their reward thats all i got to say except im goin right up now an knock wentworths block off  but smoke stood out for diplomacy that night when the camp groaned and slept or groaned and did not sleep he went to wentworths unlighted cabin  listen to me wentworth he said ive got a thousand dollars in dust right here in this sack im a rich man in this country and i can afford it i think im getting touched put a raw potato in my hand and the dust is yours here heft it  and smoke thrilled when amos wentworth put out his hand in the darkness and hefted the gold smoke heard him fumble in the blankets and then felt pressed into his hand not the heavy goldsack but the unmistakable potato the size of a hens egg warm from contact with the others body  smoke did not wait till morning he and shorty were expecting at any time the deaths of their worst two cases and to this cabin the partners went grated and mashed up in a cup skin and clinging specks of the earth and all was the thousanddollar potatoa thick fluid that they fed several drops at a time into the frightful orifices that had once been mouths shift by shift through the long night smoke and shorty relieved each other at administering the potato juice rubbing it into the poor swollen gums where loose teeth rattled together and compelling the swallowing of every drop of the precious elixir  by evening of the next day the change for the better in the two patients was miraculous and almost unbelievable they were no longer the worst cases in fortyeight hours with the exhaustion of the potato they were temporarily out of danger though far from being cured  ill tell you what ill do smoke said to wentworth ive got holdings in this country and my paper is good anywhere ill give you five hundred dollars a potato up to fifty thousand dollars worth thats one hundred potatoes  was that all the dust you had wentworth queried  shorty and i scraped up all we had but straight he and i are worth several millions between us  i havent any potatoes wentworth said finally wish i had that potato i gave you was the only one id been saving it all the winter for fear id get the scurvy i only sold it so as to be able to buy a passage out of the country when the river opens  despite the cessation of potatojuice the two treated cases continued to improve through the third day the untreated cases went from bad to worse on the fourth morning three horrible corpses were buried shorty went through the ordeal then turned to smoke  youve tried your way now its me for mine  he headed straight for wentworths cabin what occurred there shorty never told he emerged with knuckles skinned and bruised and not only did wentworths face bear all the marks of a bad beating but for a long time he carried his head twisted and sidling on a stiff neck this phenomenon was accounted for by a row of four fingermarks black and blue on one side of the windpipe and by a single blackandblue mark on the other side  next smoke and shorty together invaded wentworths cabin throwing him out in the snow while they turned the interior upside down laura sibley hobbled in and frantically joined them in the search  you dont get none old girl not if we find a ton shorty assured her  but she was no more disappointed than they though the very floor was dug up they discovered nothing  im for roastin him over a slow fire an make m cough up shorty proposed earnestly  smoke shook his head reluctantly  its murder shorty held on hes murderin all them poor geezers just as much as if he knocked their brains out with an ax only worse  another day passed during which they kept a steady watch on wentworths movements several times when he started out waterbucket in hand for the creek they casually approached the cabin and each time he hurried back without the water  theyre cached right there in his cabin shorty said as sure as god made little apples they are but where we sure overhauled it plenty he stood up and pulled on his mittens im goin to find em if i have to pull the blame shack down a log at a time  he glanced at smoke who with an intent absent face had not heard him  whats eatin you shorty demanded wrathfully dont tell me youve gone an got the scurvy  just trying to remember something shorty  what  i dont know thats the trouble but it has a bearing if only i could remember it  now you look here smoke dont you go an get bughouse shorty pleaded think of me let your thinkslats rip come on an help me pull that shack down id set her afire if it want for roastin them spuds  thats it smoke exploded as he sprang to his feet just what i was trying to remember wheres that kerosenecan im with you shorty the potatoes are ours  whats the game  watch me thats all smoke baffled i always told you shorty that a deficient acquaintance with literature was a handicap even in the klondike now what were going to do came out of a book i read it when i was a kid and it will work come on  several minutes later under a palegleaming greenish aurora borealis the two men crept up to amos wentworths cabin carefully and noiselessly they poured kerosene over the logs extradrenching the doorframe and windowsash then the match was applied and they watched the flaming oil gather headway they drew back beyond the growing light and waited  they saw wentworth rush out stare wildly at the conflagration and plunge back into the cabin scarcely a minute elapsed when he emerged this time slowly half doubled over his shoulders burdened by a sack heavy and unmistakable smoke and shorty sprang at him like a pair of famished wolves they hit him right and left at the same instant he crumpled down under the weight of the sack which smoke pressed over with his hands to make sure then he felt his knees clasped by wentworths arms as the man turned a ghastly face upward  give me a dozen only a dozenhalf a dozenand you can have the rest he squalled he bared his teeth and with mad rage half inclined his head to bite smokes leg then he changed his mind and fell to pleading just half a dozen he wailed just half a dozen i was going to turn them over to youtomorrow yes tomorrow that was my idea theyre life theyre life just half a dozen  wheres the other sack smoke bluffed  i ate it up was the reply unimpeachably honest that sacks all thats left give me a few you can have the rest  ate em up shorty screamed a whole sack an them geezers dyin for want of em this for you an this an this an this you swine you hog  the first kick tore wentworth away from his embrace of smokes knees the second kick turned him over in the snow but shorty went on kicking  watch out for your toes was smokes only interference  sure im usin the heel shorty answered watch me ill cave his ribs in ill kick his jaw off take that an that wisht i could give you the boot instead of the moccasin you swine  there was no sleep in camp that night hour after hour smoke and shorty went the rounds doling the liferenewing potatojuice a quarter of a spoonful at a dose into the poor ruined mouths of the population and through the following day while one slept the other kept up the work  there were no more deaths the most awful cases began to mend with an immediacy that was startling by the third day men who had not been off their backs for weeks crawled out of their bunks and tottered around on crutches and on that day the sun two months then on its journey into northern declination peeped cheerfully over the crest of the canyon for the first time  nary a potato shorty told the whining begging wentworth you aint even touched with scurvy you got outside a whole sack an youre loaded against scurvy for twenty years knowin you ive come to understand god i always wondered why he let satan live now i know he let him live just as i let you live but its a cryin shame just the same  a word of advice smoke told wentworth these men are getting well fast shorty and i are leaving in a week and there will be nobody to protect you when these men go after you theres the trail dawsons eighteen days travel  pull your freight amos shorty supplemented or what i done to you wont be a circumstance to what them convalescentsll do to you  gentlemen i beg of you listen to me wentworth whined im a stranger in this country i dont know its ways i dont know the trail let me travel with you ill give you a thousand dollars if youll let me travel with you  sure smoke grinned maliciously if shorty agrees  who me shorty stiffened for a supreme effort i aint nobody woodticks aint got nothin on me when it comes to humility im a worm a maggot brother to the pollywog an child of the blowfly i aint afraid or ashamed of nothin that creeps or crawls or stinks but travel with that mistake of creation go way man i aint proud but you turn my stomach  and amos wentworth went away alone dragging a sled loaded with provisions sufficient to last him to dawson a mile down the trail shorty overhauled him  come here to me was shortys greeting come across fork over cough up  i dont understand wentworth quavered shivering from recollection of the two beatings hand and foot he had already received from shorty  that thousand dollars d ye understand that that thousand dollars gold smoke bought that measly potato with come through  and amos wentworth passed the goldsack over  hope a skunk bites you an you get howlin hydrophoby were the terms of shortys farewell     x a flutter in eggs   it was in the a c companys big store at dawson on a morning of crisp frost that lucille arral beckoned smoke bellew over to the drygoods counter the clerk had gone on an expedition into the storerooms and despite the huge redhot stoves lucille had drawn on her mittens again  smoke obeyed her call with alacrity the man did not exist in dawson who would not have been flattered by the notice of lucille arral the singing soubrette of the tiny stock company that performed nightly at the palace opera house  things are dead she complained with pretty petulance as soon as they had shaken hands there hasnt been a stampede for a week that masked ball skiff mitchell was going to give us has been postponed theres no dust in circulation theres always standingroom now at the opera house and there hasnt been a mail from the outside for two whole weeks in short this burg has crawled into its cave and gone to sleep weve got to do something it needs liveningand you and i can do it we can give it excitement if anybody can ive broken with wild water you know  smoke caught two almost simultaneous visions one was of joy gastell the other was of himself in the midst of a bleak snowstretch under a cold arctic moon being potshotted with accurateness and dispatch by the aforesaid wild water smokes reluctance at raising excitement with the aid of lucille arral was too patent for her to miss  im not thinking what you are thinking at all thank you she chided with a laugh and a pout when i throw myself at your head youll have to have more eyes and better ones than you have now to see me  men have died of heart disease at the sudden announcement of good fortune he murmured in the unveracious gladness of relief  liar she retorted graciously you were more scared to death than anything else now take it from me mr smoke bellew im not going to make love to you and if you dare to make love to me wild water will take care of your case you know him besides ii havent really broken with him  go on with your puzzles he jeered maybe i can start guessing what youre driving at after a while  theres no guessing smoke ill give it to you straight wild water thinks ive broken with him dont you see  well have you or havent you  i haventthere but its between you and me in confidence he thinks i have i made a noise like breaking with him and he deserved it too  where do i come in stalkinghorse or fallguy  neither you make a pot of money we put across the laugh on wild water and cheer dawson up and best of all and the reason for it all he gets disciplined he needs it heswell the best way to put it is hes too turbulent just because hes a big husky because he owns more rich claims than he can keep count of  and because hes engaged to the prettiest little woman in alaska smoke interpolated  yes and because of that too thank you is no reason for him to get riotous he broke out last night again sowed the floor of the m  m with golddust all of a thousand dollars just opened his poke and scattered it under the feet of the dancers youve heard of it of course  yes this morning id like to be the sweeper in that establishment but still i dont get you where do i come in  listen he was too turbulent i broke our engagement and hes going around making a noise like a broken heart now we come to it i like eggs  theyre off smoke cried in despair which way which way  wait  but what have eggs and appetite got to do with it he demanded  everything if youll only listen  listening listening he chanted  then for heavens sake listen i like eggs theres only a limited supply of eggs in dawson  sure i know that too slavovitchs restaurant has most of them ham and one egg three dollars ham and two eggs five dollars that means two dollars an egg retail and only the swells and the arrals and the wild waters can afford them  he likes eggs too she continued but thats not the point i like them i have breakfast every morning at eleven oclock at slavovitchs i invariably eat two eggs she paused impressively suppose just suppose somebody corners eggs  she waited and smoke regarded her with admiring eyes while in his heart he backed with approval wild waters choice of her  youre not following she said  go on he replied i give up whats the answer  stupid you know wild water when he sees im languishing for eggs and i know his mind like a book and i know how to languish what will he do  you answer it go on  why hell just start stampeding for the man thats got the corner in eggs hell buy the corner no matter what it costs picture i come into slavovitchs at eleven oclock wild water will be at the next table hell make it his business to be there two eggs shirred ill say to the waiter sorry miss arral the waiter will say they aint no more eggs then up speaks wild water in that big bear voice of his waiter six eggs soft boiled and the waiter says yes sir and the eggs are brought picture wild water looks sideways at me and i look like a particularly indignant icicle and summon the waiter sorry miss arral he says but them eggs is mr wild waters you see miss he owns em picture wild water triumphant doing his best to look unconscious while he eats his six eggs  another picture slavovitch himself bringing two shirred eggs to me and saying compliments of mr wild water miss what can i do what can i possibly do but smile at wild water and then we make up of course and hell consider it cheap if he has been compelled to pay ten dollars for each and every egg in the corner  go on go on smoke urged at what station do i climb onto the choochoo cars or at what watertank do i get thrown off  ninny you dont get thrown off you ride the eggtrain straight into the union depot you make that corner in eggs you start in immediately today you can buy every egg in dawson for three dollars and sell out to wild water at almost any advance and then afterward well let the inside history come out the laugh will be on wild water his turbulence will be some subdued you and i share the glory of it you make a pile of money and dawson wakes up with a grand ha ha of courseifif you think the speculation too risky ill put up the dust for the corner  this last was too much for smoke being only a mere mortal western man with queer obsessions about money and women he declined with scorn the proffer of her dust  hey shorty smoke called across the main street to his partner who was trudging along in his swift slackjointed way a naked bottle with frozen contents conspicuously tucked under his arm smoke crossed over  where have you been all morning been looking for you everywhere  up to docs shorty answered holding out the bottle somethings wrong with sally i seen last night at feedintime the hair on her tail an flanks was fallin out the doc says  never mind that smoke broke in impatiently what i want  whats eatin you

animals shell be frostbit what are you in such a fever about anyway has that monte cristo strike proved up  i dont know shorty but i want you to do me a favor  sure shorty said gallantly immediately

in the head an was layin with both arms broke id set by your bedside day an night an wipe your nose for you but ill be everlastinly damned if ill squander twentyone hundred good iron dollars on

of them to pay his passage back to seattle ill see he gets his passage and ill get the eggs now hustle and they say that little woman down beyond the sawmill who makes moccasins has a couple of dozen  all right if you say so smoke but slavovitch seems the main squeeze ill just get an ironbound option black an white an gather in the scatterin first  all right hustle and ill tell you the scheme tonight  but shorty flourished the bottle im goin to doctor up sally first the eggs can wait that long if they aint all eaten they wont be eaten while im takin care of a poor sick dog thats saved your life an mine more n once  never was a market cornered more quickly in three days every known egg in dawson with the exception of several dozen was in the hands of smoke and shorty smoke had been more liberal in purchasing he unblushingly pleaded guilty to having given the old man in klondike city five dollars apiece for his seventytwo eggs shorty had bought most of the eggs and he had driven bargains he had given only two dollars an egg to the woman who made moccasins and he prided himself that he had come off fairly well with slavovitch whose seven hundred and fifteen eggs he had bought at a flat rate of two dollars and a half on the other hand he grumbled because the little restaurant across the street had held him up for two dollars and seventyfive cents for a paltry hundred and thirtyfour eggs  the several dozen not yet gathered in were in the hands of two persons one with whom shorty was dealing was an indian woman who lived in a cabin on the hill back of the hospital  ill get her today shorty announced next morning you wash the dishes smoke ill be back in a jiffy if i dont bust myself ashovin dust at her gimme a man to deal with every time these blamed womenits something sad the way they can hold out on a buyer the only way to get em is sellin why youd think them eggs of hern was solid nuggets  in the afternoon when smoke returned to the cabin he found shorty squatted on the floor rubbing ointment into sallys tail his countenance so expressionless that it was suspicious  what luck shorty asked carelessly after several minutes had passed  nothing doing smoke answered how did you get on with the squaw  shorty cocked his head triumphantly toward a tin pail of eggs on the table seven dollars a clatter though he confessed after another minute of silent rubbing  i offered ten dollars finally smoke said and then the fellow told me hed already sold his eggs now that looks bad shorty somebody else is in the market those twentyeight eggs are liable to cause us trouble you see the success of the corner consists in holding every last  he broke off to stare at his partner a pronounced change was coming over shortyone of agitation masked by extreme deliberation he closed the salvebox wiped his hands slowly and thoroughly on sallys furry coat stood up went over to the corner and looked at the thermometer and came back again he spoke in a low toneless and superpolite voice  do you mind kindly just repeating over how many eggs you said the man didnt sell to you he asked  twentyeight  hum shorty communed to himself with a slight duck of the head of careless acknowledgment then he glanced with slumbering anger at the stove smoke well have to dig up a new stove that firebox is burned plumb into the oven so it blacks the biscuits  let the firebox alone smoke commanded and tell me whats the matter  matter an you want to know whats the matter well kindly please direct them handsome eyes of yourn at that there pail settin on the table see it  smoke nodded  well i want to tell you one thing just one thing theys just exactly preecisely nor nothin more or anythin lessn twentyeight eggs in the pail an they cost every danged last one of em just exactly seven great big round iron dollars a throw if you stand in cryin need of any further items of information im willin and free to impart  go on smoke requested  well that geezer you was dickerin with is a big buck indian am i right  smoke nodded and continued to nod to each question  hes got one cheek half gone where a baldface grizzly swatted him am i right hes a dogtraderright eh his name is scarface jim thats so aint it dye get my drift  you mean weve been bidding  against each other sure thing that squaws his wife an they keep house on the hill back of the hospital i could a got them eggs for two a throw if you hadnt butted in  and so could i smoke laughed if youd kept out blame you but it doesnt amount to anything we know that weve got the corner thats the big thing  shorty spent the next hour wrestling with a stub of a pencil on the margin of a threeyearold newspaper and the more interminable and hieroglyphic grew his figures the more cheerful he became  there she stands he said at last pretty i guess yes lemme give you the totals you an me has right now in our possession exactly nine hundred an seventythree eggs they cost us exactly two thousand seven hundred an sixty dollars reckonin dust at sixteen an ounce an not countin time an now listen to me if we stick up wild water for ten dollars a egg we stand to win clean net an all to the good just exactly six thousand nine hundred and seventy dollars now thats a bookmakin what is if anybody should ride up on a dogsled an ask you an im in half on it put her there smoke im that thankful im sure droolin gratitude bookmakin say id sooner run with the chicks than the ponies any day  at eleven that night smoke was routed from sound sleep by shorty whose fur parka exhaled an atmosphere of keen frost and whose hand was extremely cold in its contact with smokes cheek  what is it now smoke grumbled rest of sallys hair fallen out  nope but i just had to tell you the good news i seen slavovitch or slavovitch seen me i guess because he started the seance he says to me shorty i want to speak to you about them eggs ive kept it quiet nobody knows i sold em to you but if youre speculatin i can put you wise to a good thing an he did too smoke now whatd you guess that good thing is  go on name it  well maybe it sounds incredible but that good thing was wild water charley hes lookin to buy eggs he goes around to slavovitch an offers him five dollars an egg an before he quits hes offerin eight an slavovitch aint got no eggs last thing wild water says to slavovitch is that hell beat the head offen him if he ever finds out slavovitch has eggs cached away somewheres slavovitch had to tell m hed sold the eggs but that the buyer was secret  slavovitch says to let him say the word to wild water whos got the eggs shorty he says to me wild waterll come arunnin you can hold him up for eight dollars eight dollars your grandmother i says hell fall for ten before im done with him anyway i

have him tell wild water that you and i are partners in the deal  five minutes later smoke was again aroused by shorty  say smoke oh smoke  yes  not a cent less than ten a throw do you get that  sure thingall right smoke returned sleepily  in the morning smoke chanced upon lucille arral again at the drygoods counter of the a c store  its working he jubilated its working wild waters been around to slavovitch trying to buy or bully eggs out of him and by this time slavovitch has told him that shorty and i own the corner  lucille arrals eyes sparkled with delight im going to breakfast right now she cried and ill ask the waiter for eggs and be so plaintive when there arent any as to melt a heart of stone and you know wild waters been around to slavovitch trying to buy the corner if it costs him one of his mines i know him and hold out for a stiff figure nothing less than ten dollars will satisfy me and if you sell for anything less smoke ill never forgive you  that noon up in their cabin shorty placed on the table a pot of beans a pot of coffee a pan of sourdough biscuits a tin of butter and a tin of condensed cream a smoking platter of moosemeat and bacon a plate of stewed dried peaches and called grubs ready take a slant at sally first  smoke put aside the harness on which he was sewing opened the door and saw sally and bright spiritedly driving away a bunch of foraging sleddogs that belonged to the next cabin also he saw something else that made him close the door hurriedly and dash to the stove the fryingpan still hot from the moosemeat and bacon he put back on the front lid into the fryingpan he put a generous dab of butter then reached for an egg which he broke and dropped spluttering into the pan as he reached for a second egg shorty gained his side and clutched his arm in an excited grip  hey what you doin he demanded  frying eggs smoke informed him breaking the second one and throwing off shortys detaining hand whats the matter with your eyesight did you think i was combing my hair  dont you feel well shorty queried anxiously as smoke broke a third egg and dexterously thrust him back with a stiffarm jolt on the breast or are you just plain loco thats thirty dollars worth of eggs already  and im going to make it sixty dollars worth was the answer as smoke broke the fourth get out of the way shorty wild waters coming up the hill and hell be here in five minutes  shorty sighed vastly with commingled comprehension and relief and sat down at the table by the time the expected knock came at the door smoke was facing him across the table and before each was a plate containing three hot fried eggs  come in smoke called  wild water charley a strapping young giant just a fraction of an inch under six feet in height and carrying a clean weight of one hundred and ninety pounds entered and shook hands  set down an have a bite wild water shorty invited smoke fry him some eggs ill bet he aint scoffed an egg in a coons age  smoke broke three more eggs into the hot pan and in several minutes placed them before his guest who looked at them with so strange and strained an expression that shorty confessed afterward his fear that wild water would slip them into his pocket and carry them away  say them swells down in the states aint got nothin over us in the matter of eats shorty gloated heres you an me an smoke gettin outside ninety dollars worth of eggs an not battin an eye  wild water stared at the rapidly disappearing eggs and seemed petrified  pitch in an eat smoke encouraged  theythey aint worth no ten dollars wild water said slowly  shorty accepted the challenge a things worth what you can get for it aint it he demanded  yes but  but nothin im tellin you what we can get for em ten a throw just like that were the egg trust smoke an me an dont you forget it when we say ten a throw ten a throw goes he mopped his plate with a biscuit i could almost eat a couple more he sighed then helped himself to the beans  you cant eat eggs like that wild water objected itit aint right  we just dote on eggs smoke an me was shortys excuse  wild water finished his own plate in a halfhearted way and gazed dubiously at the two comrades say you fellows can do me a great favor he began tentatively sell me or lend me or give me about a dozen of them eggs  sure smoke answered i know what a yearning for eggs is myself but were not so poor that we have to sell our hospitality theyll cost you nothing here a sharp kick under the table admonished him that shorty was getting nervous a dozen did you say wild water  wild water nodded  go ahead shorty smoke went on cook them up for him i can sympathize ive seen the time myself when i could eat a dozen straight off the bat  but wild water laid a restraining hand on the eager shorty as he explained i dont mean cooked i want them with the shells on  so that you can carry em away  thats the idea  but that aint hospitality shorty objected itsits tradin  smoke nodded concurrence thats different wild water i thought you just wanted to eat them you see we went into this for a speculation  the dangerous blue of wild waters eyes began to grow more dangerous ill pay you for them he said sharply how much  oh not a dozen smoke replied we couldnt sell a dozen were not retailers were speculators we cant break our own market weve got a hard and fast corner and when we sell out its the whole corner or nothing  how many have you got and how much do you want for them  how many have we shorty smoke inquired  shorty cleared his throat and performed mental arithmetic aloud lemme see nine hundred an seventythree minus nine that leaves nine hundred an sixtytwo an the whole shootinmatch at ten a throw will tote up just about nine thousand six hundred an twenty iron dollars of course wild water were playin fair an its money back for bad ones though they aint none thats one thing i never seen in the klondikea bad egg no mans fool enough to bring in a bad egg  thats fair smoke added money back for the bad ones wild water and theres our propositionnine thousand six hundred and twenty dollars for every egg in the klondike  you might play them up to twenty a throw an double your money shorty suggested  wild water shook his head sadly and helped himself to the beans that would be too expensive shorty i only want a few ill give you ten dollars for a couple of dozen ill give you twentybut i cant buy em all  all or none was smokes ultimatum  look here you two wild water said in a burst of confidence ill be perfectly honest with you an dont let it go any further you know miss arral an i was engaged well shes broken everything off you know it everybody knows it its for her i want them eggs  huh shorty jeered its clear an plain why you want em with the shells on but i never thought it of you  thought what  its lowdown mean thats what it is shorty rushed on virtuously indignant i wouldnt wonder somebody filled you full of lead for it an youd deserve it too  wild water began to flame toward the verge of one of his notorious berserker rages his hands clenched until the cheap fork in one of them began to bend while his blue eyes flashed warning sparks now look here shorty just what do you mean if you think anything underhanded  i mean what i mean shorty retorted doggedly an you bet your sweet life i dont mean anything underhanded overhands the only way to do it you cant throw em any other way  throw what  eggs prunes baseballs anything but wild water youre makin a mistake they aint no crowd ever sat at the opery house thatll stand for it just because shes a actress is no reason you can publicly lambaste her with henfruit  for the moment it seemed that wild water was going to burst or have apoplexy he gulped down a mouthful of scalding coffee and slowly recovered himself  youre in wrong shorty he said with cold deliberation im not going to throw eggs at her why man he cried with growing excitement i want to give them eggs to her on a platter shirredthats the way she likes em  i knowed i was wrong shorty cried generously i knowed you couldnt do a lowdown trick like that  thats all right shorty wild water forgave him but lets get down to business you see why i want them eggs i want em bad  do you want em ninetysix hundred an twenty dollars worth shorty queried  its a holdup thats what it is wild water declared irately  its business smoke retorted you dont think were peddling eggs for our health do you  aw listen to reason wild water pleaded i only want a couple of dozen ill give you twenty apiece for em what do i want with all the rest of them eggs ive went years in this country without eggs an i guess i can keep on managin without em somehow  dont get het up about it shorty counseled if you dont want em that settles it we aint aforcin em on you  but i do want em wild water complained  then you know what theyll cost youninetysix hundred an twenty dollars an if my figurins wrong ill treat  but maybe they wont turn the trick wild water objected maybe miss arrals lost her taste for eggs by this time  i should say miss arrals worth the price of the eggs smoke put in quietly  worth it wild water stood up in the heat of his eloquence shes worth a million dollars shes worth all ive got shes worth all the dust in the klondike he sat down and went on in a calmer voice but that aint no call for me to gamble ten thousand dollars on a breakfast for her now ive got a proposition lend me a couple of dozen of them eggs ill turn em over to slavovitch hell feed em to her with my compliments she aint smiled to me for a hundred years if them eggs gets a smile for me ill take the whole boiling off your hands  will you sign a contract to that effect smoke said quickly for he knew that lucille arral had agreed to smile  wild water gasped youre almighty swift with business up here on the hill he said with a hint of a snarl  were only accepting your own proposition smoke answered  all rightbring on the papermake it out hard and fast wild water cried in the anger of surrender  smoke immediately wrote out the document wherein wild water agreed to take every egg delivered to him at ten dollars per egg provided that the two dozen advanced to him brought about a reconciliation with lucille arral  wild water paused with uplifted pen as he was about to sign hold on he said when i buy eggs i buy good eggs  they aint a bad egg in the klondike shorty snorted  just the same if i find one bad egg youve got to come back with the ten i paid for it  thats all right smoke placated its only fair  an every bad egg you come back with ill eat shorty declared  smoke inserted the word good in the contract and wild water sullenly signed received the trial two dozen in a tin pail pulled on his mittens and opened the door  goodby you robbers he growled back at them and slammed the door  smoke was a witness to the play next morning in slavovitchs he sat as wild waters guest at the table adjoining lucille arrals almost to the letter as she had forecast it did the scene come off  havent you found any eggs yet she murmured plaintively to the waiter  no maam came the answer they say somebodys cornered every egg in dawson mr slavovitch is trying to buy a few just especially for you but the fellow thats got the corner wont let loose  it was at this juncture that wild water beckoned the proprietor to him and with one hand on his shoulder drew his head down look here slavovitch wild water whispered hoarsely i turned over a couple of dozen eggs to you last night where are they  in the safe all but that six i have all thawed and ready for you any time you sing out  i dont want em for myself wild water breathed in a still lower voice shir em up and present em to miss arral there  ill attend to it personally myself slavovitch assured him  an dont forgetcompliments of me wild water concluded relaxing his detaining clutch on the proprietors shoulder  pretty lucille arral was gazing forlornly at the strip of breakfast bacon and the tinned mashed potatoes on her plate when slavovitch placed before her two shirred eggs  compliments of mr wild water they at the next table heard him say  smoke acknowledged to himself that it was a fine bit of actingthe quick joyous flash in the face of her the impulsive turn of the head the spontaneous forerunner of a smile that was only checked by a superb selfcontrol which resolutely drew her face back so that she could say something to the restaurant proprietor  smoke felt the kick of wild waters moccasined foot under the table  will she eat emthats the questionwill she eat em the latter whispered agonizingly  and with sidelong glances they saw lucille arral hesitate almost push the dish from her then surrender to its lure  ill take them eggs wild water said to smoke the contract holds did you see her did you see her she almost smiled i know her its all fixed two more eggs tomorrow an shell forgive an make up if she wasnt here id shake hands smoke im that grateful you aint a robber youre a philanthropist  smoke returned jubilantly up the hill to the cabin only to find shorty playing solitaire in black despair smoke had long since learned that whenever his partner got out the cards for solitaire it was a warning signal that the bottom had dropped out of the world  go way dont talk to me was the first rebuff smoke received  but shorty soon thawed into a freshet of speech  its all off with the big swede he groaned the corners busted theyll be sellin sherry an egg in all the saloons tomorrow at a dollar a flip they aint no starvin orphan child in dawson that wont be wrappin its tummy around eggs what dye think i run intoa geezer with three thousan eggsdye get me three thousan an just freighted in from forty mile  fairy stories smoke doubted  fairy hell i seen them eggs gautereauxs his namea whackin big blueeyed frenchcanadian husky he asked for you first then took me to the side and jabbed me straight to the heart it was our cornerin eggs that got him started he knowed about them three thousan at forty mile an just went an got em show em to me i says an he did there was his dogteams an a couple of indian drivers restin down the bank where theyd just pulled in from forty mile an on the sleds was soapboxesteeny wooden soapboxes  we took one out behind a icejam in the middle of the river an busted it

man but that he knowed a good thing when he seen itmeanin you an me as i took it  its all right smoke said cheerfully keep your shirt on an let me think a moment quick action and team play is all thats needed ill get wild water here at two oclock to take delivery of eggs you buy that gautereauxs eggs try and make a bargain even if you pay ten dollars apiece for them wild water will take them off our hands at the same price if you can get them cheaper why we make a profit as well now go to it have them here by not later than two oclock borrow colonel bowies dogs and take our team have them here by two sharp  say smoke shorty called as his partner started down the hill better take an umbrella i wouldnt be none surprised to see the weather rainin eggs before you get back  smoke found wild water at the m  m and a stormy halfhour ensued  i warn you weve picked up some more eggs smoke said after wild water had agreed to bring his dust to the cabin at two oclock and pay on delivery  youre luckier at finding eggs than me wild water admitted now how many eggs have you got nowan how much dust do i tote up the hill  smoke consulted his notebook as it stands now according to shortys figures weve three thousand nine hundred and sixtytwo eggs multiply by ten  forty thousand dollars wild water bellowed you said there was only something like nine hundred eggs its a stickup i wont stand for it  smoke drew the contract from his pocket and pointed to the pay on delivery no mention is made of the number of eggs to be delivered you agreed to pay ten dollars for every egg we delivered to you well weve got the eggs and a signed contract is a signed contract honestly though wild water we didnt know about those other eggs until afterward then we had to buy them in order to make our corner good  for five long minutes in choking silence wild water fought a battle with himself then reluctantly gave in  im in bad he said brokenly the landscapes fair sproutin eggs an the quicker i get out the better there might come a landslide of em ill be there at two oclock but forty thousand dollars  its only thirtynine thousand six hundred an twenty smoke corrected itll weigh two hundred pounds wild water raved on ill have to freight it up with a dogteam  well lend you our teams to carry the eggs away smoke volunteered  but wherell i cache em never mind ill be there but as long as i live ill never eat another egg im full sick of em  at halfpast one doubling the dogteams for the steep pitch of the hill shorty arrived with gautereauxs eggs we dang near double our winnings shorty told smoke as they piled the soapboxes inside the cabin i holds m down to eight dollars an after he cussed loco in french he falls for it now thats two dollars clear profit to us for each egg an theyre three thousan of em i paid m in full heres the receipt  while smoke got out the goldscales and prepared for business shorty devoted himself to calculation  theres the figgers he announced triumphantly we win twelve thousan nine hundred an seventy dollars an we dont do wild water no harm he wins miss arral besides he gets all them eggs its sure a bargaincounter all around nobody loses  even gautereauxs twentyfour thousand to the good smoke laughed minus of course what the eggs and the freighting cost him and if wild water plays the corner he may make a profit out of the eggs himself  promptly at two oclock shorty peeping saw wild water coming up the hill when he entered he was brisk and businesslike he took off his big bearskin coat hung it on a nail and sat down at the table  bring on them eggs you pirates he commenced an after this day if you know whats good for you never mention eggs to me again  they began on the miscellaneous assortment of the original corner all three men counting when two hundred had been reached wild water suddenly cracked an egg on the edge of the table and opened it deftly with his thumbs  hey hold on shorty objected  its my egg aint it wild water snarled im paying ten dollars for it aint i but i aint buying no pig in a poke when i cough up ten bucks an egg i want to know what im gettin  if you dont like it ill eat it shorty volunteered maliciously  wild water looked and smelled and shook his head no you dont shorty thats a good egg gimme a pail im goin to eat it myself for supper  thrice again wild water cracked good eggs experimentally and put them in the pail beside him  two more than you figgered shorty he said at the end of the count nine hundred an sixtyfour not sixtytwo  my mistake shorty acknowledged handsomely well throw em in for good measure  guess you can afford to wild water accepted grimly pass the batch nine thousan six hundred an twenty dollars ill pay for it now write a receipt smoke  why not count the rest smoke suggested and pay all at once  wild water shook his head im no good at figgers one batch at a time an no mistakes  going to his fur coat from each of the side pockets he drew forth two sacks of dust so rotund and long that they resembled bologna sausages when the first batch had been paid for there remained in the goldsacks not more than several hundred dollars  a soapbox was carried to the table and the count of the three thousand began at the end of one hundred wild water struck an egg sharply against the edge of the table there was no crack the resultant sound was like that of the striking of a sphere of solid marble  frozen solid he remarked striking more sharply  he held the egg up and they could see the shell powdered to minute fragments along the line of impact  huh said shorty it ought to be solid seein it has just been freighted up from forty mile itll take an ax to bust it  me for the ax said wild water  smoke brought the ax and wild water with the clever hand and eye of the woodsman split the egg cleanly in half the appearance of the eggs interior was anything but satisfactory smoke felt a premonitory chill shorty was more valiant he held one of the halves to his nose  smells all right he said  but it looks all wrong wild water contended an how can it smell when the smells frozen along with the rest of it wait a minute  he put the two halves into a fryingpan and placed the latter on the front lid of the hot stove then the three men with distended questing nostrils waited in silence slowly an unmistakable odor began to drift through the room wild water forbore to speak and shorty remained dumb despite conviction  throw it out smoke cried gasping  whats the good asked wild water weve got to sample the rest  not in this cabin smoke coughed and conquered a qualm chop them open and we can test by looking at them throw it out shortythrow it out phew and leave the door open  box after box was opened egg after egg chosen at random was chopped in two and every egg carried the same message of hopeless irremediable decay  i wont ask you to eat em shorty wild water jeered an if you dont mind i cant get outa here too quick my contract called for good eggs if youll loan me a sled an team ill haul them good ones away before they get contaminated  smoke helped in loading the sled shorty sat at the table the cards laid before him for solitaire  say how long you been holdin that corner was wild waters parting gibe  smoke made no reply and with one glance at his absorbed partner proceeded to fling the soap boxes out into the snow  say shorty how much did you say you paid for that three thousand smoke queried gently  eight dollars go way dont talk to me i can figger as well as you we lose seventeen thousan on the flutter if anybody should ride up on a dogsled an ask you i figgered that out while waitin for the first egg to smell  smoke pondered a few minutes then again broke silence say shorty forty thousand dollars gold weighs two hundred pounds wild water borrowed our sled and team to haul away his eggs he came up the hill without a sled those two sacks of dust in his coat pockets weighed about twenty pounds each the understanding was cash on delivery he brought enough dust to pay for the good eggs he never expected to pay for those three thousand he knew they were bad now how did he know they were bad what do you make of it anyway  shorty gathered the cards started to shuffle a new deal then paused huh that aint nothin a child could answer it we lose seventeen thousan wild water wins seventeen thousan them eggs of gautereauxs was wild waters all the time anything else youre curious to know  yes why in the name of common sense didnt you find out whether those eggs were good before you paid for them  just as easy as the first question wild water swung the bunco game timed to seconds i hadnt no time to examine them eggs i had to hustle to get em here for delivery an now smoke lemme ask you one civil question what did you say was the partys name that put this egg corner idea into your head  shorty had lost the sixteenth consecutive game of solitaire and smoke was casting about to begin the preparation of supper when colonel bowie knocked at the door handed smoke a letter and went on to his own cabin  did you see his face shorty raved he was almost bustin to keep it straight its the big ha ha for you an me smoke we wont never dast show our faces again in dawson  the letter was from wild water and smoke read it aloud  dear smoke and shorty i write to ask with compliments of the season your presence at a supper tonight at slavovitchs joint miss arral will be there and so will gautereaux him and me was pardners down at circle five years ago he is all right and is going to be best man about them eggs they come into the country four years back they was bad when they come in they was bad when they left california they always was bad they stopped at carluk one winter and one winter at nutlik and last winter at forty mile where they was sold for storage and this winter i guess they stop at dawson dont keep them in a hot room lucille says to say you and her and me has sure made some excitement for dawson and i say the drinks is on you and that goes                                      respectfully your friend                                       w w  well what have you got to say smoke queried we accept the invitation of course  i got one thing to say shorty answered an that is wild water wont never suffer if he goes broke hes a good actora goshblamed good actor an i got another thing to say my figgers is all wrong wild water wins seventeen thousan all right but he wins more n that you an me has made him a present of every good egg in the klondikenine hundred an sixtyfour of em two

goldminers but when it comes to finance were sure the fattest suckers that ever fell for the getrichquick bunco after this its you an me for the high rocks an tall timber an if you ever mention eggs to me we dissolve pardnership there an then get me     xi the townsite of tralee   smoke and shorty encountered each other going in opposite directions at the corner where stood the elkhorn saloon the formers face wore a pleased expression and he was walking briskly shorty on the other hand was slouching along in a depressed and indeterminate fashion  whither away smoke challenged gaily  danged if i know came the disconsolate answer wisht i did they aint nothin to take me anywheres ive set two hours in the deadest game of drawnothing excitin no hands an broke even played a rubber of cribbage with skiff mitchell for the drinks an now im that languid for somethin doin that im perambulatin the streets on the chance of seein a dogfight or a argument or somethin  ive got something better on hand smoke answered thats why i was looking for you come on along  now  sure  where to  across the river to make a call on old dwight sanderson  never heard of him shorty said dejectedly an never heard of no one living across the river anyway whats he want to live there for aint he got no sense  hes got something to sell smoke laughed  dogs a goldmine tobacco rubber boots  smoke shook his head to each question come along on and find out because im going to buy it from him on a spec and if you want you can come in half  dont tell me its eggs shorty cried his face twisted into an expression of facetious and sarcastic alarm  come on along smoke told him and ill give you ten guesses while were crossing the ice  they dipped down the high bank at the foot of the street and came out upon the icecovered yukon threequarters of a mile away directly opposite the other bank of the stream uprose in precipitous bluffs hundreds of feet in height toward these bluffs winding and twisting in and out among broken and upthrown blocks of ice ran a slightly traveled trail shorty trudged at smokes heels beguiling the time with guesses at what dwight sanderson had to sell  reindeer coppermine or

me  then you aint buyin it for a town  but dwight sandersons selling it for a town smoke baffled come on weve got to climb this slide  the slide was steep and a narrow trail zigzagged up it on a formidable jacobs ladder shorty moaned and groaned over the sharp corners and the steep pitches  think of a townsite here they aint a flat space big enough for a postagestamp an its the wrong side of the river all the freightin goes the other way look at dawson there room to spread for forty thousand more people say smoke youre a meateater i know that an i know you aint buyin it for a town then what in heavens name are you buyin it for  to sell of course  but other folks aint as crazy as old man sanderson an you  maybe not in the same way shorty now im going to take this townsite break it up in parcels and sell it to a lot of sane people who live over in dawson  huh all dawsons still laughing at you an me an them eggs you want to make em laugh some more hey  i certainly do  but its too danged expensive smoke i helped you make em laugh on the eggs an my share of the laugh cost me nearly nine thousan dollars  all right you dont have to come in on this the profits will be all mine but youve got to help me just the same  oh ill help all right an they can laugh at me some more but nary a ounce do i drop this time  whats old sanderson holdin it at a couple of hundred  ten thousand i ought to get it for five  wisht i was a minister shorty breathed fervently  what for  so i could preach the goshdangdest eloquentest sermon on a text you may have hearnto wit a fool an his money  come in they heard dwight sanderson yell irritably when they knocked at his door and they entered to find him squatted by a stone fireplace and pounding coffee wrapped in a piece of floursacking  what dye want he demanded harshly emptying the pounded coffee into the coffeepot that stood on the coals near the front of the fireplace  to talk business smoke answered youve a townsite located here i understand what do you want for it  ten thousand dollars came the answer and now that ive told you you can laugh and get out theres the door goodby  but i dont want to laugh i know plenty of funnier things to do than to climb up this cliff of yours i want to buy your townsite  you do eh well im glad to hear sense sanderson came over and sat down facing his visitors his hands resting on the table and his eyes cocking apprehensively toward the coffeepot ive told you my price and i aint ashamed to tell you againten thousand and you can laugh or buy its all one to me  to show his indifference he drummed with his knobby knuckles on the table and stared at the coffeepot a minute later he began to hum a monotonous tralaloo tralalee tralalee tralaloo  now look here mr sanderson said smoke this townsite isnt worth ten thousand if it was worth that much it would be worth a hundred thousand just as easily if it isnt worth a hundred thousandand you know it isntthen it isnt worth ten cents  sanderson drummed with his knuckles and hummed tralaloo tralalee until the coffeepot boiled over settling it with a part cup of cold water and placing it to one side of the warm hearth he resumed his seat how much will you offer he asked of smoke  five thousand  shorty groaned  again came an interval of drumming and of tralooing and traleeing  you aint no fool sanderson announced to smoke you said if it wasnt worth a hundred thousand it wasnt worth ten cents yet you offer five thousand for it then it is worth a hundred thousand  you cant make twenty cents out of it smoke replied heatedly not if you stayed here till you rot  ill make it out of you  no you wont  then i reckon ill stay an rot sanderson answered with an air of finality  he took no further notice of his guests and went about his culinary tasks as if he were alone when he had warmed over a pot of beans and a slab of sourdough bread he set the table for one and proceeded to eat  no thank you shorty murmured we aint a bit hungry we et just before we come  lets see your papers smoke said at last sanderson fumbled under the head of his bunk and tossed out a package of documents its all tight and right he said that long one there with the big seals come all the way from ottawa nothing territorial about that the national canadian government cinches me in the possession of this townsite  how many lots you sold in the two years youve had it shorty queried  none of your business sanderson answered sourly there aint no law against a man living alone on his townsite if he wants to  ill give you five thousand smoke said sanderson shook his head  i dont know which is the craziest shorty lamented come outside a minute smoke i want to whisper to you  reluctantly smoke yielded to his partners persuasions  aint it never entered your head shorty said as they stood in the snow outside the door that theys miles an miles of cliffs on both sides of this fool townsite that dont belong to nobody an that you can have for the locatin and stakin  they wont do smoke answered  why wont they  it makes you wonder with all those miles and miles why im buying this particular spot doesnt it  it sure does shorty agreed  and thats the very point smoke went on triumphantly if it makes you wonder it will make others wonder and when they wonder theyll come arunning by your own wondering you prove its sound psychology now shorty listen to me im going to hand dawson a package that will knock the spots out of the egglaugh come on inside  hello said sanderson as they reentered i thought id seen the last of you  now what is your lowest figure smoke asked  twenty thousand  ill give you ten thousand  all right ill sell at that figure its all i wanted in the first place but when will you pay the dust over  tomorrow at the northwest bank but there are two other things i want for that ten thousand in the first place when you receive your money you pull down the river to forty mile and stay there the rest of the winter  thats easy what else  im going to pay you twentyfive thousand and you rebate me fifteen of it  im agreeable sanderson turned to shorty folks said i was a fool when i come over here an townsited he jeered well im a ten thousand dollar fool aint i  the klondikes sure full of fools was all shorty could retort an when theys so many of em some has to be lucky dont they  next morning the legal transfer of dwight sandersons townsite was madehenceforth to be known as the townsite of tralee smoke incorporated in the deed also at the northwest bank twentyfive thousand of smokes gold was weighed out by the cashier while half a dozen casual onlookers noted the weighing the amount and the recipient  in a miningcamp all men are suspicious any untoward act of any man is likely to be the cue to a secret gold strike whether the untoward act be no more than a hunting trip for moose or a stroll after dark to observe the aurora borealis and when it became known that so prominent a figure as smoke bellew had paid twentyfive thousand dollars to old dwight sanderson dawson wanted to know what he had paid it for what had dwight sanderson starving on his abandoned townsite ever owned that was worth twentyfive thousand in lieu of an answer dawson was justified in keeping smoke in feverish contemplation  by midafternoon it was common knowledge that several score of men had made up light stampedingpacks and cached them in the convenient saloons along main street wherever smoke moved he was the observed of many eyes and as proof that he was taken seriously not one man of the many of his acquaintance had the effrontery to ask him about his deal with dwight sanderson on the other hand no one mentioned eggs to smoke shorty was under similar surveillance and delicacy of friendliness  makes me feel like id killed somebody or had smallpox the way they watch me an seem afraid to speak shorty confessed when he chanced to meet smoke in front of the elkhorn look at bill saltman there acrost the wayjust dyin to look an keepin his eyes down the street all the time wouldnt think hed knowed you an me existed to look at him but i bet you the drinks smoke if you an me flop around the corner quick like we was goin somewheres an then turn back from around the next corner that we run into him ahikin hellbent  they tried the trick and doubling back around the second corner encountered saltman swinging a long trailstride in pursuit  hello bill smoke greeted which way  hello just astrollin saltman answered just astrollin weathers fine aint it  huh shorty jeered if you call that strollin what might you walk real fast at  when shorty fed the dogs that evening he was keenly conscious that from the encircling darkness a dozen pairs of eyes were boring in upon him and when he sticktied the dogs instead of letting them forage free through the night he knew that he had administered another jolt to the nervousness of dawson  according to program smoke ate supper downtown and then proceeded to enjoy himself wherever he appeared he was the center of interest and he purposely made the rounds saloons filled up after his entrance and emptied following upon his departure if he bought a stack of chips at a sleepy roulettetable inside five minutes a dozen players were around him he avenged himself in a small way on lucille arral by getting up and sauntering out of the opera house just as she came on to sing her most popular song in three minutes twothirds of her audience had vanished after him  at one in the morning he walked along an unusually populous main street and took the turning that led up the hill to his cabin and when he paused on the ascent he could hear behind him the crunch of moccasins in the snow  for an hour the cabin was in darkness then he lighted a candle and after a delay sufficient for a man to dress in he and shorty opened the door and began harnessing the dogs as the light from the cabin flared out upon them and their work a soft whistle went up from not far away this whistle was repeated down the hill  listen to it smoke chuckled theyve relayed on us and are passing the word down to town ill bet you there are forty men right now rolling out of their blankets and climbing into their pants  aint folks fools shorty giggled back say smoke they aint nothin in hard graft a geezer thatd work his hands these days is awell a geezer the worlds sure bustin full an dribblin over the edges with fools ahonin to be separated from their dust an before we start down the hill i want to announce if youre still agreeable that i come in half on this deal  the sled was lightly loaded with a sleeping and a gruboutfit a small coil of steel cable protruded inconspicuously from underneath a grubsack while a crowbar lay half hidden along the bottom of the sled next to the lashings  shorty fondled the cable with a swiftpassing mitten and gave a last affectionate touch to the crowbar huh he whispered id sure do some tall thinking myself if i seen them objects on a sled on a dark night  they drove the dogs down the hill with cautious silence and when emerged on the flat they turned the team north along main street toward the sawmill and directly away from the business part of town they observed even greater caution they had seen no one yet when this change of direction was initiated out of the dim starlit darkness behind arose a whistle past the sawmill and the hospital at lively speed they went for a quarter of a mile then they turned about and headed back over the ground they had just covered at the end of the first hundred yards they barely missed colliding with five men racing along at a quick dogtrot all were slightly stooped to the weight of stampedingpacks one of them stopped smokes leaddog and the rest clustered around  seen a sled goin the other way was asked  nope smoke answered is that you bill  well ill be danged bill saltman ejaculated in honest surprise if it aint smoke  what are you doing out this time of night smoke inquired strolling  before bill saltman could make reply two running men joined the group these were followed by several more while the crunch of feet on the snow heralded the imminent arrival of many others  who are your friends smoke asked wheres the stampede  saltman lighting his pipe which was impossible for him to enjoy with lungs panting from the run did not reply the ruse of the match was too obviously for the purpose of seeing the sled to be misunderstood and smoke noted every pair of eyes focus on the coil of cable and the crowbar then the match went out  just heard a rumor thats all just a rumor saltman mumbled with ponderous secretiveness  you might let shorty and me in on it smoke urged  somebody snickered sarcastically in the background  where are you bound saltman demanded  and who are you smoke countered committee of safety  just interested just interested saltman said  you bet your sweet life were interested another voice spoke up out of the darkness  say shorty put in i wonder whos feelin the foolishest  everybody laughed nervously  come on shorty well be getting along smoke said mushing the dogs  the crowd formed in behind and followed  say aint youall made a mistake shorty gibed when we met you you was goin an now youre comin without bein anywheres have you lost your tag  you go to the devil was saltmans courtesy we go and come just as we danged feel like we dont travel with tags  and the sled with smoke in the lead and shorty at the pole went on down main street escorted by three score men each of whom on his back bore a stampedingpack it was three in the morning and only the allnight rounders saw the procession and were able to tell dawson about it next day  half an hour later the hill was climbed and the dogs unharnessed at the cabin door the sixty stampeders grimly attendant  goodnight fellows smoke called as he closed the door  in five minutes the candle was put out but before half an hour had passed smoke and shorty emerged softly and without lights began harnessing the dogs  hello smoke saltman said stepping near enough for them to see the loom of his form  cant shake you bill i see smoke replied cheerfully wherere your friends  gone to have a drink they left me to keep an eye on you and keep it i will whats in the wind anyway smoke you cant shake us so you might as well let us in were all your friends you know that  there are times when you can let your friends in smoke evaded and times when you cant and bill this is one of the times when we cant youd better go to bed goodnight  aint goin to be no goodnight smoke you dont know us were woodticks  smoke sighed well bill if you will have your will i guess youll have to have it come on shorty we cant fool around any longer  saltman emitted a shrill whistle as the sled started and swung in behind from down the hill and across the flat came the answering whistles of the relays shorty was at the geepole and smoke and saltman walked side by side  look here bill smoke said ill make you a proposition do you want to come in alone on this  saltman did not hesitate an throw the gang down no sir well all come in  you first then smoke exclaimed lurching into a clinch and tipping the other into deep snow beside the trail  shorty hawed the dogs and swung the team to the south on the trail that led among the scattered cabins on the rolling slopes to the rear of dawson smoke and saltman locked together rolled in the snow smoke considered himself in giltedged condition but saltman outweighed him by fifty pounds of clean trailhardened muscle and repeatedly mastered him time and time again he got smoke on his back and smoke lay complacently and rested but each time saltman attempted to get off him and get away smoke reached out a detaining tripping hand that brought about a new clinch and wrestle  you can go some saltman acknowledged panting at the end of ten minutes as he sat astride smokes chest but i down you every time  and i hold you every time smoke panted back thats what im here for just to hold you where do you think shortys getting to all this time  saltman made a wild effort to go clear and all but succeeded smoke gripped his ankle and threw him in a headlong tumble from down the hill came anxious questioning whistles saltman sat up and whistled a shrill answer and was grappled by smoke who rolled him face upward and sat astride his chest his knees resting on saltmans biceps his hands on saltmans shoulders and holding him down and in this position the stampeders found them smoke laughed and got up  well goodnight fellows he said and started down the hill with sixty exasperated and grimly determined stampeders at his heels  he turned north past the sawmill and the hospital and took the river trail along the precipitous bluffs at the base of moosehide mountain circling the indian village he held on to the mouth of moose creek then turned and faced his pursuers  you make me tired he said with a good imitation of a snarl  hope we aint aforcin you saltman murmured politely  oh no not at all smoke snarled with an even better imitation as he passed among them on the backtrail to dawson twice he attempted to cross the trailless icejams of the river still resolutely followed and both times he gave up and returned to the dawson shore straight down main street he trudged crossing the ice of klondike river to klondike city and again retracing to dawson at eight oclock as gray dawn began to show he led his weary gang to slavovitchs restaurant where tables were at a premium for breakfast  goodnight fellows he said as he paid his reckoning  and again he said goodnight as he took the climb of the hill in the clear light of day they did not follow him contenting themselves with watching him up the hill to his cabin  for two days smoke lingered about town continually under vigilant espionage shorty with the sled and dogs had disappeared neither travelers up and down the yukon nor from bonanza eldorado nor the klondike had seen him remained only smoke who soon or late was certain to try to connect with his missing partner and upon smoke everybodys attention was centered on the second night he did not leave his cabin putting out the lamp at nine in the evening and setting the alarm for two next morning the watch outside heard the alarm go off so that when half an hour later he emerged from the cabin he found waiting for him a band not of sixty men but of at least three hundred a flaming aurora borealis lighted the scene and thus hugely escorted he walked down to town and entered the elkhorn the place was immediately packed and jammed by an anxious and irritated multitude that bought drinks and for four weary hours watched smoke play cribbage with his old friend breck shortly after six in the morning with an expression on his face of commingled hatred and gloom seeing no one recognizing no one smoke left the elkhorn and went up main street behind him the three hundred formed in disorderly ranks chanting hayfoot strawfoot hep hep hep  goodnight fellows he said bitterly at the edge of the yukon bank where the winter trail dipped down im going to get breakfast and then go to bed  the three hundred shouted that they were with him and followed him out upon the frozen river on the direct path he took for tralee at seven in the morning he led his stampeding cohort up the zigzag trail across the face of the slide that led to dwight sandersons cabin the light of a candle showed through the parchmentpaper window and smoke curled from the chimney shorty threw open the door  come on in smoke he greeted breakfasts ready whoall are your friends  smoke turned about on the threshold well goodnight you fellows hope you enjoyed your pasear  hold on a moment smoke bill saltman cried his voice keen with disappointment want to talk with you a moment  fire away smoke answered genially  whatd you pay old sanderson twentyfive thousan for will you answer that  bill you give me a pain was smokes reply i came over here for a country residence so to say and here are you and a gang trying to crossexamine me when im looking for peace an quietness an breakfast whats a country residence good for except for peace and quietness  you aint answered the question bill saltman came back with rigid logic  and im not going to bill that affair is peculiarly a personal affair between dwight sanderson and me any other question  how about that crowbar an steel cable then what you had on your sled the other night  its none of your blessed and ruddy business bill though if shorty here wants to tell you about it he can  sure shorty cried springing eagerly into the breach his mouth opened then he faltered and turned to his partner smoke confidentially just between you an me i dont think it is any of their darn business come on in the lifes gettin boiled outa that coffee  the door closed and the three hundred sagged into forlorn and grumbling groups  say saltman one man said i thought you was goin to lead us to it  not on your life saltman answered crustily i said smoke would lead us to it  an this is it  you know as much about it as me an we all know smokes got something salted down somewheres or else for what did he pay sanderson the twentyfive thousand not for this mangy townsite thats sure an certain  a chorus of cries affirmed saltmans judgment  well what are we goin to do now someone queried dolefully  me for one for breakfast wild water charley said cheerfully you led us up a blind alley this time bill  i tell you i didnt saltman objected smoke led us an just the same what about them twentyfive thousand  at halfpast eight when daylight had grown strong shorty carefully opened the door and peered out shucks he exclaimed theyalls hiked back to dawson i thought they was goin to camp here  dont worry theyll come sneaking back smoke reassured him if i dont miss my guess youll see half dawson over here before were done with it now jump in and lend me a hand weve got work to do  aw for heavens sake put me on shorty complained when at the end of an hour he surveyed the result of their toila windlass in the corner of the cabin with an endless rope that ran around double logrollers  smoke turned it with a minimum of effort and the rope slipped and creaked now shorty you go outside and tell me what it sounds like  shorty listening at the closed door heard all the sounds of a windlass hoisting a load and caught himself unconsciously attempting to estimate the depth of shaft out of which this load was being hoisted next came a pause and in his minds eye he saw the bucket swinging short to the windlass then he heard the quick loweraway and the dull sound as of the bucket coming to abrupt rest on the edge of the shaft he threw open the door beaming  i got you he cried i almost fell for it myself what next  the next was the dragging into the cabin of a dozen sledloads of rock and through an exceedingly busy day there were many other nexts  now you run the dogs over to dawson this evening smoke instructed when supper was finished leave them with breck hell take care of them theyll be watching what you do so get breck to go to the a c company and buy up all the blastingpowdertheres only several hundred pounds in stock and have breck order half a dozen hardrock drills from the blacksmith brecks a quartzman and hell give the blacksmith a rough idea of what he wants made and give breck these location descriptions so that he can record them at the gold commissioners tomorrow and finally at ten oclock you be on main street listening mind you i dont want them to be too loud dawson must just hear them and no more than hear them ill let off three of different quantities and you note which is more nearly the right thing  at ten that night shorty strolling down main street aware of many curious eyes his ears keyed tensely heard a faint and distant explosion thirty seconds later there was a second sufficiently loud to attract the attention of others on the street then came a third so violent that it rattled the windows and brought the inhabitants into the street  shook em up beautiful shorty proclaimed breathlessly an hour afterward when he arrived at the cabin on tralee he gripped smokes hand you should asaw em ever kick over a anthole dawsons just like that main street was crawlin an hummin when i pulled my freight you wont see tralee tomorrow for folks an if they aint some asneakin acrost right now i dont know minin nature thats all  smoke grinned stepped to the fake windlass and gave it a couple of creaking turns shorty pulled out the mosschinking from between the logs so as to make peepholes on every side of the cabin then he blew out the candle  now he whispered at the end of half an hour  smoke turned the windlass slowly paused after several minutes caught up a galvanized bucket filled with earth and struck it with slide and scrape and grind against the heap of rocks they had hauled in then he lighted a cigarette shielding the flame of the match in his hands  theys three of em shorty whispered you oughta saw em say when you made that bucketdump noise they was fair quiverin theys one at the window now tryin to peek in  smoke glowed his cigarette and glanced at his watch  weve got to do this thing regularly he breathed well haul up a bucket every fifteen minutes and in the meantime  through triple thicknesses of sacking he struck a coldchisel on the face of a rock  beautiful beautiful shorty moaned with delight he crept over noiselessly from the peephole theyve got their heads together an i can almost see em talkin  and from then until four in the morning at fifteenminute intervals the seeming of a bucket was hoisted on the windlass that creaked and ran around on itself and hoisted nothing then their visitors departed and smoke and shorty went to bed  after daylight shorty examined the moccasinmarks big bill saltman was one of them he concluded look at the size of it  smoke looked out over the river get ready for visitors there are two crossing the ice now  huh wait till breck files that string of claims at nine oclock therell be two thousand crossing over  and every mothers son of them yammering motherlode smoke laughed the source of the klondike placers found at last  shorty who had clambered to the top of a steep shoulder of rock gazed with the eye of a connoisseur at the strip they had staked  it sure looks like a true fissure vein he said a expert could almost trace the lines of it under the snow itd fool anybody the slide fills the front of it an see them outcrops look like the real thing only they aint  when the two men crossing the river climbed the zigzag trail up the slide they found a closed cabin bill saltman who led the way went softly to the door listened then beckoned wild water charley up to him from inside came the creak and whine of a windlass bearing a heavy load they waited at the final pause then heard the loweraway and the impact of a bucket on rock four times in the next hour they heard the thing repeated then wild water knocked on the door from inside came low furtive noises then silences and more furtive noises and at the end of five minutes smoke breathing heavily opened the door an inch and peered out they saw on his face and shirt powdered rockfragments his greeting was suspiciously genial  wait a minute he added and ill be with you  pulling on his mittens he slipped through the door and confronted the visitors outside in the snow their quick eyes noted his shirt across the shoulders discolored and powdery and the knees of his overalls that showed signs of dirt brushed hastily but not quite thoroughly away  rather early for a call he observed what brings you across the river going hunting  were on smoke wild water said confidentially an youd just as well come through youve got something here  if youre looking for eggs smoke began  aw forget it we mean business  you mean you want to buy lots eh smoke rattled on swiftly theres some dandy building sites here but you see we cant sell yet we havent had the town surveyed come around next week wild water and for peace and quietness ill show you something swell if youre anxious to live over here next week sure it will be surveyed goodby sorry i cant ask you inside but shortywell you know him hes peculiar he says he came over for peace and quietness and hes asleep now i wouldnt wake him for the world  as smoke talked he shook their hands warmly in farewell still talking and shaking their hands he stepped inside and closed the door  they looked at each other and nodded significantly  see the knees of his pants saltman whispered hoarsely  sure an his shoulders hes been bumpin an crawlin around in a shaft as wild water talked his eyes wandered up the snowcovered ravine until they were halted by something that brought a whistle to his lips just cast your eyes up there bill see where im pointing if that aint a prospecthole an follow it out to both sidesyou can see where they tramped in the snow if it aint rimrock on both sides i dont know what rimrock is its a fissure vein all right  an look at the size of it saltman cried theyve got something here you bet  an run your eyes down the slide theresee them bluffs standin out an slopin in the whole slides in the mouth of the vein as well  and just keep alookin on out on the ice there on the trail saltman directed looks like most of dawson dont it  wild water took one glance and saw the trail black with men clear to the far dawson bank down which the same unbroken string of men was pouring  well im goin to get a lookin at that prospecthole before they get here he said turning and starting swiftly up the ravine  but the cabin door opened and the two occupants stepped out  hey smoke called where are you going  to pick out a lot wild water called back look at the river all dawsons stampeding to buy lots an were going to beat em to it for the choice thats right aint it bill  sure thing saltman corroborated this has the makins of a jimdandy suburb an it sure looks like itll be some popular  well were not selling lots over in that section where youre heading smoke answered over to the right there and back on top of the bluffs are the lots this section running from the river and over the tops is reserved so come on back  thats the spot weve gone and selected saltman argued  but theres nothing doing i tell you smoke said sharply  any objections to our strolling then saltman persisted  decidedly your strolling is getting monotonous come on back out of that  i just reckon well stroll anyways saltman replied stubbornly come on wild water  i warn you you are trespassing was smokes final word  nope just strollin saltman gaily retorted turning his back and starting on  hey stop in your tracks bill or ill sure bore you shorty thundered drawing and leveling two colts fortyfours step another step in your steps an i let eleven holes through your danged ornery carcass get that  saltman stopped perplexed  he sure got me shorty mumbled to smoke but if he goes on im up against it hard i cant shoot whatll i do  look here shorty listen to reason saltman begged  come here to me an well talk reason was shortys retort  and they were still talking reason when the head of the stampede emerged from the zigzag trail and came upon them  you cant call a man a trespasser when hes on a townsite lookin to buy lots wild water was arguing and shorty was objecting but theys private property in townsites an that there strip is private property thats all i tell you again it aint for sale  now weve got to swing this thing on the jump smoke muttered to shorty if they ever get out of hand  youve sure got your nerve if you think you can hold them shorty muttered back theys two thousan of em an more acomin theyll break this line any minute  the line ran along the near rim of the ravine and shorty had formed it by halting the first arrivals when they got that far in their invasion in the crowd were half a dozen northwest policemen and a lieutenant with the latter smoke conferred in undertones  theyre still piling out of dawson he said and before long there will be five thousand here the danger is if they start jumping claims when you figure there are only five claims it means a thousand men to a claim and four thousand out of the five will try to jump the nearest claim it cant be done and if it ever starts therell be more dead men here than in the whole history of alaska besides those five claims were recorded this morning and cant be jumped in short claimjumping mustnt start  righto said the lieutenant ill get my men together and station them we cant have any trouble here and we wont have but youd better get up and talk to them  there must be some mistake fellows smoke began in a loud voice were not ready to sell lots the streets are not surveyed yet but next week we shall have the grand opening sale  he was interrupted by an outburst of impatience and indignation  we dont want lots a young miner cried out we dont want whats on top of the ground weve come for whats under the ground  we dont know what weve got under the ground smoke answered but we do know weve got a fine townsite on top of it  sure shorty added grand for scenery an solitude folks lovin solitude come aflockin here by thousands most popular solitude on the yukon  again the impatient cries arose and saltman who had been talking with the later comers came to the front  were here to stake claims he opened we know what youve didfiled a string of five quartz claims on end and there they are over there running across the townsite on the line of the slide and the canyon only you misplayed two of them entries is fake who is seth bierce no one ever heard of him you filed a claim this mornin in his name an you filed a claim in the name of harry maxwell now harry maxwell aint in the country hes down in seattle went out last fall them two claims is open to relocation  suppose i have his power of attorney smoke queried  you aint saltman answered an if you have you got to show it anyway heres where we relocate come on fellows  saltman stepping across the deadline had turned to encourage a following when the police lieutenants voice rang out and stopped the forward surge of the great mass  hold on there you cant do that you know  cant eh said bill saltman the law says a fake location can be relocated dont it  thets right bill stay with it the crowd cheered from the safe side of the line  its the law aint it saltman demanded truculently of the lieutenant  it may be the law came the steady answer but i cant and wont allow a mob of five thousand men to attempt to jump two claims it would be a dangerous riot and were here to see there is no riot here now on this spot the northwest police constitute the law the next man who crosses that line will be shot you bill saltman step back across it  saltman obeyed reluctantly but an ominous restlessness became apparent in the mass of men irregularly packed and scattered as it was over a landscape that was mostly upanddown  heavens the lieutenant whispered to smoke look at them like flies on the edge of the cliff there any disorder in that mass would force hundreds of them over  smoke shuddered and got up im willing to play fair fellows if you insist on town lots ill sell them to you one hundred apiece and you can raffle locations when the survey is made with raised hand he stilled the movement of disgust dont move anybody if you do therell be hundreds of you shoved over the bluff the situation is dangerous  just the same you cant hog it a voice went up we dont want lots we want to relocate  but there are only two disputed claims smoke argued when theyre relocated where will the rest of you be  he mopped his forehead with his shirtsleeve and another voice cried out  let us all in share and share alike  nor did those who roared their approbation dream that the suggestion had been made by a man primed to make it when he saw smoke mop his forehead  take your feet out of the trough an pool the townsite the man went on pool the mineral rights with the townsite too  but there isnt anything in the mineral rights i tell you smoke objected  then pool them with the rest well take our chances on it  fellows youre forcing me smoke said i wish youd stayed on your side of the river  but wavering indecision was so manifest that with a mighty roar the crowd swept him on to agreement saltman and others in the front rank demurred  bill saltman here and wild water dont want you all in smoke informed the crowd whos hogging it now  and thereat saltman and wild water became profoundly unpopular  now how are we going to do it smoke asked shorty and i ought to keep control we discovered this townsite  thats right many cried a square deal its only fair  threefifths to us smoke suggested and you fellows come in for twofifths and youve got to pay for your shares  ten cents on the dollar was a cry and nonassessable  and the president of the company to come around personally and pay you your dividends on a silver platter smoke sneered no sir you fellows have got to be reasonable ten cents on the dollar will help start things you buy twofifths of the stock hundred dollars par at ten dollars thats the best i can do and if you dont like it just start jumping the claims i cant stand more than a twofifths gouge  no big capitalization a voice called and it was this voice that crystallized the collective mind of the crowd into consent  theres about five thousand of you which will make five thousand shares smoke worked the problem aloud and five thousand is twofifths of twelve thousand five hundred therefore the tralee townsite company is capitalized for one million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars there being twelve thousand five hundred shares hundred par you fellows buying five thousand of them at ten dollars apiece and i dont care a whoop whether you accept it or not and i call you all to witness that youre forcing me against my will  with the assurance of the crowd that they had caught him with the goods on him in the shape of the two fake locations a committee was formed and the rough organization of the tralee townsite company effected scorning the proposal of delivering the shares next day in dawson and scorning it because of the objection that the portion of dawson that had not engaged in the stampede would ring in for shares the committee by a fire on the ice at the foot of the slide issued a receipt to each stampeder in return for ten dollars in dust duly weighed on two dozen goldscales which were obtained from dawson  by twilight the work was accomplished and tralee was deserted save for smoke and shorty who ate supper in the cabin and chuckled at the list of shareholders four thousand eight hundred and seventyfour strong and at the goldsacks which they knew contained approximately fortyeight thousand seven hundred and forty dollars  but you aint swung it yet shorty objected  hell be here smoke asserted with conviction hes a born gambler and when breck whispers the tip to him not even heart disease would stop him  within the hour came a knock at the door and wild water entered followed by bill saltman their eyes swept the cabin eagerly coming to rest on the windlass elaborately concealed by blankets  but suppose i did want to vote twelve hundred shares wild water was arguing half an hour later with the other five thousand sold today itd make only sixtytwo hundred shares thatd leave you and shorty with sixtythree hundred youd still control  but what d you want with all that of a townsite shorty queried  you can answer that better n me wild water replied an between you an me his gaze drifted over the blanketdraped windlass its a pretty goodlooking townsite  but bill wants some smoke said grudgingly and we simply wont part with more than five hundred shares  how much you got to invest wild water asked saltman  oh say five thousand it was all i could scare up  wild water smoke went on in the same grudging complaining voice if i didnt know you so well i wouldnt sell you a single besotted share and anyway shorty and i wont part with more than five hundred and theyll cost you fifty dollars apiece thats the last word and if you dont like it goodnight bill can take a hundred and you can have the other four hundred  next day dawson began its laugh it started early in the morning just after daylight when smoke went to the bulletinboard outside the a c company store and tacked up a notice men gathered and were reading and snickering over his shoulder ere he had driven the last tack soon the bulletinboard was crowded by hundreds who could not get near enough to read then a reader was appointed by acclamation and thereafter throughout the day many men were acclaimed to read in loud voice the notice smoke bellew had nailed up and there were numbers of men who stood in the snow and heard it read several times in order to memorize the succulent items that

continuing a conversation that had lapsed some few minutes before  smoke sitting on the edge of the sleepingrobe and examining the feet of a dog he had rolled snarling on its back in the snow did not answer and shorty turning a steaming moccasin propped on a stick before the fire studied his partners face keenly  cock your eye up at that there aurora borealis shorty went on some frivolous eh just like any shillyshallyin shirtdancing woman the best of them is frivolous when they aint foolish and theys cats all of em the littlest an the biggest the nicest and the otherwise theyre sure devourin lions an roarin hyenas when they get on the trail of a man theyve cottoned to  again the monologue languished smoke cuffed the dog when it attempted to snap his hand and went on examining its bruised and bleeding pads  huh pursued shorty mebbe i couldnt a married if id a mind to an mebbe i wouldnt a been married without a mind to if i hadnt hiked for tall timber smoke dyou want to know what saved me ill tell you my wind i just kept arunnin id like to see any skirt run me outa breath  smoke released the animal and turned his own steaming stickpropped moccasins weve got to rest over tomorrow and make moccasins he vouchsafed that little crust is playing the devil with their feet  we oughta keep goin somehow shorty objected we aint got grub enough to turn back with and we gotta strike that run of caribou or them white indians almighty soon or well be eatin the dogs sore feet an all now who ever seen them white indians anyway nothin but hearsay an how can a indian be white a black white mand be as natural smoke we just oughta travel tomorrow the countrys plumb dead of game we aint seen even a rabbittrack in a week you know that an we gotta get out of this dead streak into somewhere that meats runnin  theyll travel all the better with a days rest for their feet and moccasins all around smoke counseled if you get a chance at any low divide take a peep over at the country beyond were likely to strike open rolling country any time now thats what la perle told us to look for  huh by his own story it was ten years ago that la perle come through this section an he was that loco from hunger he couldnt know what he did see remember what he said of whoppin big flags floatin from the tops of the mountains that shows how loco he was an he said himself he never seen any white indiansthat was antons yarn an besides anton kicked the bucket two years before you an me come to alaska but ill take a look tomorrow an mebbe i might pick up a moose what d you say we turn in  smoke spent the morning in camp sewing dogmoccasins and repairing harnesses at noon he cooked a meal for two ate his share and began to look for shortys return an hour later he strapped on his snowshoes and went out on his partners trail the way led up the bed of the stream through a narrow gorge that widened suddenly into a moosepasture but no moose had been there since the first snow of the preceding fall the tracks of shortys snowshoes crossed the pasture and went up the easy slope of a low divide at the crest smoke halted the tracks continued down the other slope the first sprucetrees in the creek bed were a mile away and it was evident that shorty had passed through them and gone on smoke looked at his watch remembered the oncoming darkness the dogs and the camp and reluctantly decided against going farther but before he retraced his steps he paused for a long look all the eastern skyline was sawtoothed by the snowy backbone of the rockies the whole mountain system range upon range seemed to trend to the northwest cutting athwart the course to the open country reported by la perle the effect was as if the mountains conspired to thrust back the traveler toward the west and the yukon smoke wondered how many men in the past approaching as he had approached had been turned aside by that forbidding aspect la perle had not been turned aside but then la perle had crossed over from the eastern slope of the rockies  until midnight smoke maintained a huge fire for the guidance of shorty and in the morning waiting with camp broken and dogs harnessed for the first break of light smoke took up the pursuit in the narrow pass of the canyon his leaddog pricked up its ears and whined then smoke came upon the indians six of them coming toward him they were traveling light without dogs and on each mans back was the smallest of pack outfits surrounding smoke they immediately gave him several matters for surprise that they were looking for him was clear that they talked no indian tongue of which he knew a word was also quickly made clear they were not white indians though they were taller and heavier than the indians of the yukon basin five of them carried the oldfashioned longbarreled hudson bay company musket and in the hands of the sixth was a winchester rifle which smoke knew to be shortys  nor did they waste time in making him a prisoner unarmed himself smoke could only submit the contents of the sled were distributed among their own packs and he was given a pack composed of his and shortys sleepingfurs the dogs were unharnessed and when smoke protested one of the indians by signs indicated a trail too rough for sledtravel smoke bowed to the inevitable cached the sled endon in the snow on the bank above the stream and trudged on with his captors over the divide to the north they went down to the sprucetrees which smoke had glimpsed the preceding afternoon they followed the stream for a dozen miles abandoning it when it trended to the west and heading directly eastward up a narrow tributary  the first night was spent in a camp which had been occupied for several days here was cached a quantity of dried salmon and a sort of pemmican which the indians added to their packs from this camp a trail of many snowshoes led offshortys captors was smokes conclusion and before darkness fell he succeeded in making out the tracks shortys narrower snowshoes had left on questioning the indians by signs they nodded affirmation and pointed to the north  always in the days that followed they pointed north and always the trail turning and twisting through a jumble of upstanding peaks trended north everywhere in this bleak snowsolitude the way seemed barred yet ever the trail curved and coiled finding low divides and avoiding the higher and untraversable chains the snowfall was deeper than in the lower valleys and every step of the way was snowshoe work furthermore smokes captors all young men traveled light and fast and he could not forbear the prick of pride in the knowledge that he easily kept up with them they were travelhardened and trained to snowshoes from infancy yet such was his condition that the traverse bore no more of ordinary hardship to him than to them  in six days they gained and crossed the central pass low in comparison with the mountains it threaded yet formidable in itself and not possible for loaded sleds five days more of tortuous winding from lower altitude to lower altitude brought them to the open rolling and merely hilly country la perle had found ten years before smoke knew it with the first glimpse on a sharp cold day the thermometer forty below zero the atmosphere so clear that he could see a hundred miles far as he could see rolled the open country high in the east the rockies still thrust their snowy ramparts heavenward to the south and west extended the broken ranges of the projecting spursystem they had crossed and in this vast pocket lay the country la perle had traversedsnowblanketed but assuredly fat with game at some time in the year and in the summer a smiling forested and flowered land  before midday traveling down a broad stream past snowburied willows and naked aspens and across heavily timbered flats of spruce they came upon the site of a large camp recently abandoned glancing as he went by smoke estimated four or five hundred fires and guessed the population to be in the thousands so fresh was the trail and so well packed by the multitude that smoke and his captors took off their snowshoes and in their moccasins struck a swifter pace signs of game appeared and grew plentifultracks of wolves and lynxes that without meat could not be once one of the indians cried out with satisfaction and pointed to a large area of open snow littered with fangpolished skulls of caribou trampled and disrupted as if an army had fought upon it and smoke knew that a big killing had been made by the hunters since the last snowflurry  in the long twilight no sign was manifested of making camp they held steadily on through a deepening gloom that vanished under a sky of lightgreat glittering stars half veiled by a greenish vapor of pulsing aurora borealis his dogs first caught the noises of the camp pricking their ears and whining in low eagerness then it came to the ears of the humans a murmur dim with distance but not invested with the soothing grace that is common to distant murmurs instead it was in a high wild key a beat of shrill sound broken by shriller soundsthe long wolfhowling of many wolfdogs a screaming of unrest and pain mournful with hopelessness and rebellion smoke swung back the crystal of his watch and by the feel of fingertips on the naked hands made out eleven oclock the men about him quickened the legs that had lifted through a dozen strenuous hours lifted in a still swifter pace that was half a run and mostly a running jog through a dark spruceflat they burst upon an abrupt glare of light from many fires and upon an abrupt increase of sound the great camp lay before them  and as they entered and threaded the irregular runways of the huntingcamp a vast tumult as in a wave rose to meet them and rolled on with themcries greetings questions and answers jests and jests thrust back again the snapping snarl of wolfdogs rushing in furry projectiles of wrath upon smokes stranger dogs the scolding of squaws laughter the whimpering of children and wailing of infants the moans of the sick aroused afresh to pain all the pandemonium of a camp of nerveless primitive wilderness folk  striking with clubs and the butts of guns smokes party drove back the attacking dogs while his own dogs snapping and snarling awed by so many enemies shrank in among the legs of their human protectors and bristled along stifflegged in menacing prance  they halted in the trampled snow by an open fire where shorty and two young indians squatted on their hams were broiling strips of caribou meat three other young indians lying in furs on a mat of spruceboughs sat up shorty looked across the fire at his partner but with a sternly impassive face like those of his companions made no sign and went on broiling the meat  whats the matter smoke demanded half in irritation lost your speech  the old familiar grin twisted on shortys face nope he answered im a indian im learnin not to show surprise when did they catch you  next day after you left  hum shorty said the light of whimsy dancing in his eyes well im doin fine thank you most to death this is the bachelors camp he waved his hand to embrace its magnificence which consisted of a fire beds of spruceboughs laid on top of the snow flies of caribou skin and windshields of twisted spruce and willow withes an these are the bachelors this time his hand indicated the young men and he spat a few spoken gutturals in their own language that brought the white flash of acknowledgment from eyes and teeth theyre glad to meet you smoke set down an dry your moccasins an ill cook up some grub im gettin the hang of the lingo pretty well aint i youll have to come to it for it looks as if well be with these folks a long time theys another white man here got caught six years ago hes a irishman they picked up over great slave lake way danny mccan is what he goes by hes settled down with a squaw got two kids already but hell skin out if ever the chance opens up see that low fire over there to the right thats his camp  apparently this was smokes appointed domicile for his captors left him and his dogs and went on deeper into the big camp while he attended to his footgear and devoured strips of hot meat shorty cooked and talked  this is a sure peach of a pickle smokeyou listen to me an we got to go some to get out these is the real blowedintheglass wild indians they aint white but their chief is he talks like a mouthful of hot mush an if he aint fullblood scotch they aint no such thing as scotch in the world hes the hiyu skookum

way outlearned it on huntin tripsto the west of the way you an me came he aint had the nerve to tackle it by his lonely but we can pull it off the three of us whiskers is the real goods but hes mostly loco just the same  whos whiskers smoke queried pausing in the wolfingdown of a hot strip of meat  why hes the top geezer hes the scotcher hes gettin old an hes sure asleep now but hell see you tomorrow an show you clear as print what a measly shrimp you are on his stompingrounds these grounds belong to him you got to get that into your noodle they aint never been explored nor nothin an

gets its sting in say what whiskers dont know about salmon an caribou nobody knows take it from me   here comes whiskers lookin like hes goin somewheres shorty whispered reaching over and wiping greasy hands on the coat of one of the sleddogs  it was morning and the bachelors were squatting over a breakfast of cariboumeat which they ate as they broiled smoke glanced up and saw a small and slender man skinclad like any savage but unmistakably white striding in advance of a sled team and a following of a dozen indians smoke cracked a hot bone and while he sucked out the steaming marrow gazed at his approaching host bushy whiskers and yellowish gray hair stained by camp smoke concealed most of the face but failed wholly to hide the gaunt almost cadaverous cheeks it was a healthy leanness smoke decided as he noted the wide flare of the nostrils and the breadth and depth of chest that gave spaciousness to the guaranty of oxygen and life  how do you do the man said slipping a mitten and holding out his bare hand my name is snass he added as they shook hands  mines bellew smoke returned feeling peculiarly disconcerted as he gazed into the keensearching black eyes  getting plenty to eat i see  smoke nodded and resumed his marrowbone the purr of scottish speech strangely pleasant in his ears  rough rations but we dont starve often and its more natural than the handreared meat of the cities  i see you dont like cities smoke laughed in order to be saying something and was immediately startled by the transformation snass underwent  quite like a sensitive plant the mans entire form seemed to wilt and quiver then the recoil tense and savage concentered in the eyes in which appeared a hatred that screamed of immeasurable pain he turned abruptly away and recollecting himself remarked casually over his shoulder  ill see you later mr bellew the caribou are moving east and im going ahead to pick out a location youll all come on tomorrow  some whiskers that eh shorty muttered as snass pulled on at the head of his outfit  again shorty wiped his hands on the wolfdog which seemed to like it as it licked off the delectable grease  later on in the morning smoke went for a stroll through the camp busy with its primitive pursuits a big body of hunters had just returned and the men were scattering to their various fires women and children were departing with dogs harnessed to empty toboggansleds and women and children and dogs were hauling sleds heavy with meat fresh from the killing and already frozen an early spring coldsnap was on and the wildness of the scene was painted in a temperature of thirty below zero woven cloth was not in evidence furs and softtanned leather clad all alike boys passed with bows in their hands and quivers of bonebarbed arrows and many a skinningknife of bone or stone smoke saw in belts or neckhung sheaths women toiled over the fires smokecuring the meat on their backs infants that stared roundeyed and sucked at lumps of tallow dogs fullkin to wolves bristled up to smoke to endure the menace of the short club he carried and to whiff the odor of this newcomer whom they must accept by virtue of the club  segregated in the heart of the camp smoke came upon what was evidently snasss fire though temporary in every detail it was solidly constructed and was on a large scale a great heap of bales of skins and outfit was piled on a scaffold out of reach of the dogs a large canvas fly almost halftent sheltered the sleeping and livingquarters to one side was a silk tentthe sort favored by explorers and wealthy biggame hunters smoke had never seen such a tent and stepped closer as he stood looking the flaps parted and a young woman came out so quickly did she move so abruptly did she appear that the effect on smoke was as that of an apparition he seemed to have the same effect on her and for a long moment they gazed at each other  she was dressed entirely in skins but such skins and such magnificently beautiful furwork smoke had never dreamed of her parka the hood thrown back was of some strange fur of palest silver the mukluks with walrushide soles were composed of the silverpadded feet of many lynxes the longgauntleted mittens the tassels at the knees all the varied furs of the costume were pale silver that shimmered in the frosty light and out of this shimmering silver poised on slender delicate neck lifted her head the rosy face blonde as the eyes were blue the ears like two pink shells the light chestnut hair touched with frostdust and coruscating frostglints  all this and more as in a dream smoke saw then recollecting himself his hand fumbled for his cap at the same moment the wonderstare in the girls eyes passed into a smile and with movements quick and vital she slipped a mitten and extended her hand  how do you do she murmured gravely with a queer delightful accent her voice silvery as the furs she wore coming with a shock to smokes ears attuned as they were to the harsh voices of the camp squaws  smoke could only mumble phrases that were awkwardly reminiscent of his best society manner  i am glad to see you she went on slowly and gropingly her face a ripple of smiles my english you will please excuse it is not good i am english like you she gravely assured him my father he is scotch my mother she is dead she is french and english and a little indian too her father was a great man in the hudson bay company brrr it is cold she slipped on her mitten and rubbed her ears the pink of which had already turned to white let us go to the fire and talk my name is labiskwee what is your name  and so smoke came to know labiskwee the daughter of snass whom snass called margaret  snass is not my fathers name she informed smoke snass is only an indian name  much smoke learned that day and in the days that followed as the huntingcamp moved on in the trail of the caribou these were real wild indiansthe ones anton had encountered and escaped from long years before this was nearly the western limit of their territory and in the summer they ranged north to the tundra shores of the arctic and eastward as far as the luskwa what river the luskwa was smoke could not make out nor could labiskwee tell him nor could mccan on occasion snass with parties of strong hunters pushed east across the rockies on past the lakes and the mackenzie and into the barrens it was on the last traverse in that direction that the silk tent occupied by labiskwee had been found  it belonged to the millicentadbury expedition snass told smoke  oh i remember they went after muskoxen the rescue expedition never found a trace of them  i found them snass said but both were dead  the world still doesnt know the word never got out  the word never gets out snass assured him pleasantly  you mean if they had been alive when you found them  snass nodded they would have lived on with me and my people  anton got out smoke challenged  i do not remember the name how long ago  fourteen or fifteen years smoke answered  so he pulled through after all do you know ive wondered about him we called him long tooth he was a strong man a strong man  la perle came through here ten years ago  snass shook his head  he found traces of your camps it was summer time  that explains it snass answered we are hundreds of miles to the north in the summer  but strive as he would smoke could get no clew to snasss history in the days before he came to live in the northern wilds educated he was yet in all the intervening years he had read no books no newspapers what had happened in the world he knew not nor did he show desire to know he had heard of the miners on the yukon and of the klondike strike goldminers had never invaded his territory for which he was glad but the outside world to him did not exist he tolerated no mention of it  nor could labiskwee help smoke with earlier information she had been born on the huntinggrounds her mother had lived for six years after her mother had been very beautifulthe only white woman labiskwee had ever seen she said this wistfully and wistfully in a thousand ways she showed that she knew of the great outside world on which her father had closed the door but this knowledge was secret she had early learned that mention of it threw her father into a rage  anton had told a squaw of her mother and that her mother had been a daughter of a high official in the hudson bay company later the squaw had told labiskwee but her mothers name she had never learned  as a source of information danny mccan was impossible he did not like adventure wild life was a horror and he had had nine years of it shanghaied in san francisco he had deserted the whaleship at point barrow with three companions two had died and the third had abandoned him on the terrible traverse south two years he had lived with the eskimos before raising the courage to attempt the south traverse and then within several days of a hudson bay company post he had been gathered in by a party of snasss young men he was a small stupid man afflicted with sore eyes and all he dreamed or could talk about was getting back to his beloved san francisco and his blissful trade of bricklaying  youre the first intelligent man weve had snass complimented smoke one night by the fire except old four eyes the indians named him so he wore glasses and was shortsighted he was a professor of zoology smoke noted the correctness of the pronunciation of the word he died a year ago my young men picked him up strayed from an expedition on the upper porcupine he was intelligent yes but he was also a fool that was his weaknessstraying he knew geology though and working in metals over on the luskwa where theres coal we have several creditable handforges he made he repaired our guns and taught the young men how he died last year and we really missed him strayedthats how it happenedfroze to death within a mile of camp  it was on the same night that snass said to smoke  youd better pick out a wife and have a fire of your own you will be more comfortable than with those young bucks the maidens firesa sort of feast of the virgins you knoware not lighted until full summer and the salmon but i can give orders earlier if you say the word  smoke laughed and shook his head  remember snass concluded quietly anton is the only one that ever got away he was lucky unusually lucky  her father had a will of iron labiskwee told smoke  four eyes used to call him the frozen piratewhatever that meansthe tyrant of the frost the cave bear the beast primitive the king of the caribou the bearded pard and lots of such things four eyes loved words like these he taught me most of my english he was always making fun you could never tell he called me his cheetahchum after times when i was angry what is cheetah he always teased me with it  she chattered on with all the eager naivete of a child which smoke found hard to reconcile with the full womanhood of her form and face  yes her father was very firm everybody feared him he was terrible when angry there were the porcupines it was through them and through the luskwas that snass traded his skins at the posts and got his supplies of ammunition and tobacco he was always fair but the chief of the porcupines began to cheat and after snass had warned him twice he burned his log village and over a dozen of the porcupines were killed in the fight but there was no more cheating once when she was a little girl there was one white man killed while trying to escape no her father did not do it but he gave the order to the young men no indian ever disobeyed her father  and the more smoke learned from her the more the mystery of snass deepened  and tell me if it is true the girl was saying that there was a man and a woman whose names were paolo and francesca and who greatly loved each other  smoke nodded  four eyes told me all about it she beamed happily and so he did not make it up after all you see i was not sure i asked father but oh he was angry the indians told me he gave poor four eyes an awful talking to then there were tristan and iseulttwo iseults it was very sad but i should like to love that way do all the young men and women in the world do that they do not here they just get married they do not seem to have time i am english and i will never marry an indianwould you that is why i have not lighted my maidens fire some of the young men are bothering father to make me do it libash is one of them he is a great hunter and mahkook comes around singing songs he is funny tonight if you come by my tent after dark you will hear him singing out in the cold but father says i can do as i please and so i shall not light my fire you see when a girl makes up her mind to get married that is the way she lets young men know four eyes always said it was a fine custom but i noticed he never took a wife maybe he was too old he did not have much hair but i do not think he was really very old and how do you know when you are in lovelike paolo and francesca i mean  smoke was disconcerted by the clear gaze of her blue eyes why they say he stammered those who are in love say it that love is dearer than life when one finds out that he or she likes somebody better than everybody else in the worldwhy then they know they are in love thats the way it goes but its awfully hard to explain you just know it thats all  she looked off across the campsmoke sighed and resumed work on the fur mitten she was sewing well she announced with finality i shall never get married anyway   once we hit out well sure have some tall runnin shorty said dismally  the place is a big trap smoke agreed  from the crest of a bald knob they gazed out over snasss snowy domain east west and south they were hemmed in by the high peaks and jumbled ranges northward the rolling country seemed interminable yet they knew even in that direction that half a dozen transverse chains blocked the way  at this time of the year i could give you three days start snass told smoke that evening you cant hide your trail you see anton got away when the snow was gone my young men can travel as fast as the best white man and besides you would be breaking trail for them and when the snow is off the ground ill see to it that you dont get the chance anton had its a good life and soon the world fades i have never quite got over the surprise of finding how easy it is to get along without the world  whats eatin me is danny mccan shorty confided to smoke hes a weak brother on any trail but he swears he knows the way out to the westward an so we got to put up with him smoke or you sure get yours  were all in the same boat smoke answered  not on your life its acomin to you straight down the pike  what is  you aint heard the news  smoke shook his head  the bachelors told me they just got the word tonight it comes off though its months ahead of the calendar  smoke shrugged his shoulders  aint interested in hearin shorty teased  im waiting to hear  well dannys wife just told the bachelors shorty paused impressively an the bachelors told me of course that the maidens fires is due to be lighted tonight thats all now how do you like it  i dont get your drift shorty  dont eh why its plain open and shut theys a skirt after you an that skirt is goin to light a fire an that skirts name is labiskwee oh ive been watchin her watch you when you aint lookin she aint never lighted her fire said she wouldnt marry a indian an now when she lights her fire its a cinch its my poor old friend smoke  it sounds like a syllogism smoke said with a sinking heart reviewing labiskwees actions of the past several days  cinch is shorter to pronounce shorty returned an thats always the wayjust as were workin up our getaway along comes a skirt to complicate everything we aint got no luck hey listen to that smoke  three ancient squaws had halted midway between the bachelors camp and the camp of mccan and the oldest was declaiming in shrill falsetto  smoke recognized the names but not all the words and shorty translated with melancholy glee  labiskwee the daughter of snass the rainmaker the great chief lights her first maidens fire tonight maka the daughter of owits the wolfrunner  the recital ran through the names of a dozen maidens and then the three heralds tottered on their way to make announcement at the next fires  the bachelors who had sworn youthful oaths to speak to no maidens were uninterested in the approaching ceremony and to show their disdain they made preparations for immediate departure on a mission set them by snass and upon which they had planned to start the following morning not satisfied with the old hunters estimates of the caribou snass had decided that the run was split the task set the bachelors was to scout to the north and west in quest of the second division of the great herd  smoke troubled by labiskwees firelighting announced that he would accompany the bachelors but first he talked with shorty and with mccan  you be there on the third day smoke shorty said well have the outfit an the dogs  but remember smoke cautioned if there is any slipup in meeting me you keep on going and get out to the yukon thats flat if you make it you can come back for me in the summer if i get the chance ill make it and come back for you  mccan standing by his fire indicated with his eyes a rugged mountain where the high western range outjutted on the open country  thats the one he said a small stream on the south side we go up it on the third day you meet us well pass by on the third day anywhere you tap that stream youll meet us or our trail  but the chance did not come to smoke on the third day the bachelors had changed the direction of their scout and while shorty and mccan plodded up the stream with their dogs smoke and the bachelors were sixty miles to the northeast picking up the trail of the second caribou herd several days later through a dim twilight of falling snow they came back to the big camp a squaw ceased from wailing by a fire and darted up to smoke harsh tongued with bitter venomous eyes she cursed him waving her arms toward a silent furwrapped form that still lay on the sled which had hauled it in  what had happened smoke could only guess and as he came to mccans fire he was prepared for a second cursing instead he saw mccan himself industriously chewing a strip of caribou meat  im not a fightin man he whiningly explained but shorty got away though theyre still after him he put up a hell of a fight theyll get him too he aint got a chance he plugged two bucks thatll get around all right an he croaked one square through the chest  yes i know smoke answered i just met the widow  old snassll be wantin to see you mccan added thems his orders soon as you come in you was to go to his fire i aint squealed you dont know nothing keep that in mind shorty went off on his own along with me  at snasss fire smoke found labiskwee she met him with eyes that shone with such softness and tenderness as to frighten him  im glad you did not try to run away she said you see i she hesitated but her eyes didnt drop they swam with a light unmistakable i lighted my fire and of course it was for you it has happened i like you better than everybody else in the world better than my father better than a thousand libashes and mahkooks i love it is very strange i love as francesca loved as iseult loved old four eyes spoke true indians do not love this way but my eyes are blue and i am white we are white you and i  smoke had never been proposed to in his life and he was unable to meet the situation worse it was not even a proposal his acceptance was taken for granted so thoroughly was it all arranged in labiskwees mind so warm was the light in her eyes that he was amazed that she did not throw her arms around him and rest her head on his shoulder then he realized despite her candor of love that she did not know the pretty ways of love among the primitive savages such ways did not obtain she had had no chance to learn  she prattled on chanting the happy burden of her love while he strove to grip himself in the effort somehow to wound her with the truth this at the very first was the golden opportunity  but labiskwee listen he began are you sure you learned from four eyes all the story of the love of paolo and francesca  she clasped her hands and laughed with an immense certitude of gladness oh there is more i knew there must be more and more of love i have thought much since i lighted my fire i have  and then snass strode in to the fire through the falling snowflakes and smokes opportunity was lost  good evening snass burred gruffly your partner has made a mess of it i am glad you had better sense  you might tell me whats happened smoke urged  the flash of white teeth through the stained beard was not pleasant certainly ill tell you your partner has killed one of my people that sniveling shrimp mccan deserted at the first shot hell never run away again but my hunters have got your partner in the mountains and theyll get him hell never make the yukon basin as for you from now on you sleep at my fire and therell be no more scouting with the young men i shall have my eye on you  smokes new situation at snasss fire was embarrassing he saw more of labiskwee than ever in its sweetness and innocence the frankness of her love was terrible her glances were love glances every look was a caress a score of times he nerved himself to tell her of joy gastell and a score of times he discovered that he was a coward the damnable part of it was that labiskwee was so delightful she was good to look upon despite the hurt to his selfesteem of every moment spent with her he pleasured in every such moment for the first time in his life he was really learning woman and so clear was labiskwees soul so appalling in its innocence and ignorance that he could not misread a line of it all the pristine goodness of her sex was in her uncultured by the conventionality of knowledge or the deceit of selfprotection in memory he reread his schopenhauer and knew beyond all cavil that the sad philosopher was wrong to know woman as smoke came to know labiskwee was to know that all womanhaters were sick men  labiskwee was wonderful and yet beside her face in the flesh burned the vision of the face of joy gastell joy had control restraint all the feminine inhibitions of civilization yet by the trick of his fancy and the living preachment of the woman before him joy gastell was stripped to a goodness at par with labiskwees the one but appreciated the other and all women of all the world appreciated by what smoke saw in the soul of labiskwee at snasss fire in the snowland  and smoke learned about himself he remembered back to all he knew of joy gastell and he knew that he loved her yet he delighted in labiskwee and what was this feeling of delight but love he could demean it by no less a name love it was love it must be and he was shocked to the roots of his soul by the discovery of this polygamous strain in his nature he had heard it argued in the san francisco studios that it was possible for a man to love two women or even three women at a time but he had not believed it how could he believe it when he had not had the experience now it was different he did truly love two women and though most of the time he was quite convinced that he loved joy gastell more there were other moments when he felt with equal certainty that he loved labiskwee more  there must be many women in the world she said one day and women like men many women must have liked you tell me  he did not reply  tell me she insisted  i have never married he evaded  and there is no one else no other iseult out there beyond the mountains  then it was that smoke knew himself a coward he lied reluctantly he did it but he lied he shook his head with a slow indulgent smile and in his face was more of fondness than he dreamed as he noted labiskwees swift joytransfiguration  he excused himself to himself his reasoning was jesuitical beyond dispute and yet he was not spartan enough to strike this childwoman a quivering heartstroke  snass too was a perturbing factor in the problem little escaped his black eyes and he spoke significantly  no man cares to see his daughter married he said to smoke at least no man of imagination it hurts the thought of it hurts i tell you just the same in the natural order of life margaret must marry some time  a pause fell smoke caught himself wondering for the thousandth time what snasss history must be  i am a harsh cruel man snass went on yet the law is the law and i am just nay here with this primitive people i am the law and the justice beyond my will no man goes also i am a father and all my days i have been cursed with imagination  whither his monologue tended smoke did not learn for it was interrupted by a burst of chiding and silvery laughter from labiskwees tent where she played with a newcaught wolfcub a spasm of pain twitched snasss face  i can stand it he muttered grimly margaret must be married and it is my fortune and hers that you are here i had little hopes of four eyes mccan was so hopeless i turned him over to a squaw who had lighted her fire twenty seasons if it hadnt been you it would have been an indian libash might have become the father of my grandchildren  and then labiskwee came from her tent to the fire the wolfcub in her arms drawn as by a magnet to gaze upon the man in her eyes the love that art had never taught to hide                                                          listen to me said mccan the spring thaw is here an the crust is comin on the snow its the time to travel exceptin for the spring blizzards in the mountains i know them i would run with no less a man than you  but you cant run smoke contradicted you can keep up with no man your backbone is limber as thawed marrow if i run i run alone the world fades and perhaps i shall never run caribou meat is very good and soon will come summer and the salmon  said snass your partner is dead my hunters did not kill him they found the body frozen in the first of the spring storms in the mountains no man can escape when shall we celebrate your marriage  and labiskwee i watch you there is trouble in your eyes in your face oh i do know all your face there is a little scar on your neck just under the ear when you are happy the corners of your mouth turn up when you think sad thoughts they turn down when you smile there are three and four wrinkles at the corners of your eyes when you laugh there are six sometimes i have almost counted seven but i cannot count them now i have never read books i do not know how to read but four eyes taught me much my grammar is good he taught me and in his own eyes i have seen the trouble of the hunger for the world he was often hungry for the world yet here was good meat and fish in plenty and the berries and the roots and often flour came back for the furs through the porcupines and the luskwas yet was he hungry for the world is the world so good that you too are hungry for it four eyes had nothing but you have me she sighed and shook her head four eyes died still hungry for the world and if you lived here always would you too die hungry for the world i am afraid i do not know the world do you want to run away to the world  smoke could not speak but by his mouthcorner lines was she convinced  minutes of silence passed in which she visibly struggled while smoke cursed himself for the unguessed weakness that enabled him to speak the truth about his hunger for the world while it kept his lips tight on the truth of the existence of the other woman  again labiskwee sighed  very well i love you more than i fear my fathers anger and he is more terrible in anger than a mountain storm you told me what love is this is the test of love i shall help you to run away back to the world   smoke awakened softly and without movement warm small fingers touched his cheek and slid gently to a pressure on his lips fur with the chill of frost clinging in it next tingled his skin and the one word come was breathed in his ear he sat up carefully and listened the hundreds of wolfdogs in the camp had lifted their nocturnal song but under the volume of it close at hand he could distinguish the light regular breathing of snass  labiskwee tugged gently at smokes sleeve and he knew she wished him to follow he took his moccasins and german socks in his hand and crept out into the snow in his sleeping moccasins beyond the glow from the dying embers of the fire she indicated to him to put on his outer footgear and while he obeyed she went back under the fly where snass slept  feeling the hands of his watch smoke found it was one in the morning quite warm it was he decided not more than ten below zero labiskwee rejoined him and led him on through the dark runways of the sleeping camp walk lightly as they could the frost crunched crisply under their moccasins but the sound was drowned by the clamor of the dogs too deep in their howling to snarl at the man and woman who passed  now we can talk she said when the last fire had been left half a mile behind  and now in the starlight facing him smoke noted for the first time that her arms were burdened and on feeling discovered she carried his snowshoes a rifle two belts of ammunition and his sleepingrobes  i have everything fixed she said with a happy little laugh i have been two days making the cache there is meat even flour matches and skees which go best on the hard crust and when they break through the webs will hold up longer oh i do know snowtravel and we shall go fast my lover  smoke checked his speech that she had been arranging his escape was surprise enough but that she had planned to go with him was more than he was prepared for unable to think immediate action he gently one by one took her burdens from her he put his arm around her and pressed her close and still he could not think what to do  god is good she whispered he sent me a lover  yet smoke was brave enough not to suggest his going alone and before he spoke again he saw all his memory of the bright world and the sunlands reel and fade  we will go back labiskwee he said you will be my wife and we shall live always with the caribou people  no no she shook her head and her body in the circle of his arm resented his proposal i know i have thought much the hunger for the world would come upon you and in the long nights it would devour your heart four eyes died of hunger for the world so would you die all men from the world hunger for it and i will not have you die we will go on across the snow mountains on the south traverse  dear listen he urged we must go back  she pressed her mitten against his lips to prevent further speech you love me say that you love me  i do love you labiskwee you are my wonderful sweetheart  again the mitten was a caressing obstacle to utterance  we shall go on to the cache she said with decision it is three miles from here come  he held back and her pull on his arm could not move him almost was he tempted to tell her of the other woman beyond the south traverse  it would be a great wrong to you to go back she said ii am only a wild girl and i am afraid of the world but i am more afraid for you you see it is as you told me i love you more than anybody else in the world i love you more than myself the indian language is not a good language the english language is not a good language the thoughts in my heart for you as bright and as many as the starsthere is no language for them how can i tell you them they are theresee  as she spoke she slipped the mitten from his hand and thrust the hand inside the warmth of her parka until it rested against her heart tightly and steadily she pressed his hand in its position and in the long silence he felt the beat beat of her heart and knew that every beat of it was love and then slowly almost imperceptibly still holding his hand her body began to incline away from his and toward the direction of the cache nor could he resist it was as if he were drawn by her heart itself that so nearly lay in the hollow of his hand  so firm was the crust frozen during the night after the previous days surfacethaw that they slid along rapidly on their skees  just here in the trees is the cache labiskwee told smoke  the next moment she caught his arm with a startle of surprise the flames of a small fire were dancing merrily and crouched by the fire was mccan labiskwee muttered something in indian and so lashlike was the sound that smoke remembered she had been called cheetah by four eyes  i was minded youd run without me mccan explained when they came up his small peering eyes glimmering with cunning so i kept an eye on the girl an when i seen her caching skees an grub i was on ive brought my own skees an webs an grub the fire sure an it was no danger the camps asleep an snorin an the waitin was cold will we be startin now  labiskwee looked swift consternation at smoke as swiftly achieved a judgement on the matter and spoke and in the speaking she showed childwoman though she was in love the quick decisiveness of one who in other affairs of life would be no clinging vine  mccan you are a dog she hissed and her eyes were savage with anger i know it is in your heart to raise the camp if we do not take you very well we must take you but you know my father i am like my father you will do your share of the work you will obey and if you play one dirty trick it would be better for you if you had never run  mccan looked up at her his small pigeyes hating and cringing while in her eyes turned to smoke the anger melted into luminous softness  is it right what i have said she queried  daylight found them in the belt of foothills that lay between the rolling country and the mountains mccan suggested breakfast but they held on not until the afternoon thaw softened the crust and prevented travel would they eat  the foothills quickly grew rugged and the stream up whose frozen bed they journeyed began to thread deeper and deeper canyons the signs of spring were less frequent though in one canyon they found foaming bits of open water and twice they came upon clumps of dwarf willow upon which were the first hints of swelling buds  labiskwee explained to smoke her knowledge of the country and the way she planned to baffle pursuit there were but two ways out one west the other south snass would immediately dispatch parties of young men to guard the two trails but there was another way south true it did no more than penetrate halfway into the high mountains then twisting to the west and crossing three divides it joined the regular trail when the young men found no traces on the regular trail they would turn back in the belief that the escape had been made by the west traverse never dreaming that the runaways had ventured the harder and longer way around  glancing back at mccan in the rear labiskwee spoke in an undertone to smoke he is eating she said it is not good  smoke looked the irishman was secretly munching caribou suet from the pocketful he carried  no eating between meals mccan he commanded theres no game in the country ahead and the grub will have to be whacked in equal rations from the start the only way you can travel with us is by playing fair  by one oclock the crust had thawed so that the skees broke through and before two oclock the webshoes were breaking through camp was made and the first meal eaten smoke took stock of the food mccans supply was a disappointment so many silver foxskins had he stuffed in the bottom of the meat bag that there was little space left for meat  sure an i didnt know there was so many he explained i done it in the dark but theyre worth good money an with all this ammunition well be gettin game aplenty  the wolves will eat you aplenty was smokes hopeless comment while labiskwees eyes flashed their anger  enough food for a month with careful husbanding and appetites that never blunted their edge was smokes and labiskwees judgment smoke apportioned the weight and bulk of the packs yielding in the end to labiskwees insistence that she too should carry a pack  next day the stream shallowed out in a wide mountain valley and they were already breaking through the crust on the flats when they gained the harder surface of the slope of the divide  ten minutes later and we wouldnt have got across the flats smoke said when they paused for breath on the bald crest of the summit we must be a thousand feet higher here  but labiskwee without speaking pointed down to an open flat among the trees in the midst of it scattered abreast were five dark specks that scarcely moved  the young men said labiskwee  they are wallowing to their hips smoke said they will never gain the hard footing this day we have hours the start of them come on mccan buck up we dont eat till we cant travel  mccan groaned but there was no caribou suet in his pocket and he doggedly brought up the rear  in the higher valley in which they now found themselves the crust did not break till three in the afternoon at which time they managed to gain the shadow of a mountain where the crust was already freezing again once only they paused to get out mccans confiscated suet which they ate as they walked the meat was frozen solid and could be eaten only after thawing over a fire but the suet crumbled in their mouths and eased the palpitating faintness in their stomachs  black darkness with an overcast sky came on after a long twilight at nine oclock when they made camp in a clump of dwarf spruce mccan was whining and helpless the days march had been exhausting but in addition despite his nine years experience in the arctic he had been eating snow and was in agony with his parched and burning mouth he crouched by the fire and groaned while they made the camp  labiskwee was tireless and smoke could not but marvel at the life in her body at the endurance of mind and muscle nor was her cheerfulness forced she had ever a laugh or a smile for him and her hand lingered in caress whenever it chanced to touch his yet always when she looked at mccan her face went hard and pitiless and her eyes flashed frostily  in the night came wind and snow and through a day of blizzard they fought their way blindly missing the turn of the way that led up a small stream and crossed a divide to the west for two more days they wandered crossing other and wrong divides and in those two days they dropped spring behind and climbed up into the abode of winter  the young men have lost our trail an whats to stop us restin a day mccan begged  but no rest was accorded smoke and labiskwee knew their danger they were lost in the high mountains and they had seen no game nor signs of game day after day they struggled on through an iron configuration of landscape that compelled them to labyrinthine canyons and valleys that led rarely to the west once in such a canyon they could only follow it no matter where it led for the cold peaks and higher ranges on either side were unscalable and unendurable the terrible toil and the cold ate up energy yet they cut down the size of the ration they permitted themselves  one night smoke was awakened by a sound of struggling distinctly he heard a gasping and strangling from where mccan slept kicking the fire into flame by its light he saw labiskwee her hands at the irishmans throat and forcing from his mouth a chunk of partly chewed meat even as smoke saw this her hand went to her hip and flashed with the sheathknife in it  labiskwee smoke cried and his voice was peremptory  the hand hesitated  dont he said coming to her side  she was shaking with anger but the hand after hesitating a moment longer descended reluctantly to the sheath as if fearing she could not restrain herself she crossed to the fire and threw on more wood mccan sat up whimpering and snarling between fright and rage spluttering an inarticulate explanation  where did you get it smoke demanded  feel around his body labiskwee said  it was the first word she had spoken and her voice quivered with the anger she could not suppress  mccan strove to struggle but smoke gripped him cruelly and searched him drawing forth from under his armpit where it had been thawed by the heat of his body a strip of caribou meat a quick exclamation from labiskwee drew smokes attention she had sprung to mccans pack and was opening it instead of meat out poured moss spruceneedles chipsall the light refuse that had taken the place of the meat and given the pack its due proportion minus its weight  again labiskwees hand went to her hip and she flew at the culprit only to be caught in smokes arms where she surrendered herself sobbing with the futility of her rage  oh lover it is not the food she panted it is you your life the dog he is eating you he is eating you  we will yet live smoke comforted her hereafter he shall carry the flour he cant eat that raw and if he does ill kill him myself for he will be eating your life as well as mine he held her closer sweetheart killing is mens work women do not kill  you would not love me if i killed the dog she questioned in surprise  not so much smoke temporized  she sighed with resignation very well she said i shall not kill him   the pursuit by the young men was relentless by miracles of luck as well as by deduction from the topography of the way the runaways must take the young men picked up the blizzardblinded trail and clung to it when the snow flew smoke and labiskwee took the most improbable courses turning east when the better way opened south or west rejecting a low divide to climb a higher being lost it did not matter yet they could not throw the young men off sometimes they gained days but always the young men appeared again after a storm when all trace was lost they would cast out like a pack of hounds and he who caught the later trace made smoke signals to call his comrades on  smoke lost count of time of days and nights and storms and camps through a vast mad phantasmagoria of suffering and toil he and labiskwee struggled on with mccan somehow stumbling along in the rear babbling of san francisco his everlasting dream great peaks pitiless and serene in the chill blue towered about them they fled down black canyons with walls so precipitous that the rock frowned naked or wallowed across glacial valleys where frozen lakes lay far beneath their feet and one night between two storms a distant volcano glared the sky they never saw it again and wondered whether it had been a dream  crusts were covered with yards of new snow that crusted and were snowcovered again there were places in canyon and pocketdrifts where they crossed snow hundreds of feet deep and they crossed tiny glaciers in drafty rifts windscurried and bare of any snow they crept like silent wraiths across the faces of impending avalanches or roused from exhausted sleep to the thunder of them they made fireless camps above timberline thawing their meatrations with the heat of their bodies ere they could eat and through it all labiskwee remained labiskwee her cheer never vanished save when she looked at mccan and the greatest stupor of fatigue and cold never stilled the eloquence of her love for smoke  like a cat she watched the apportionment of the meager ration and smoke could see that she grudged mccan every munch of his jaws once she distributed the ration the first smoke knew was a wild harangue of protest from mccan not to him alone but to herself had she given a smaller portion than to smoke after that smoke divided the meat himself caught in a small avalanche one morning after a night of snow and swept a hundred yards down the mountain they emerged halfstifled and unhurt but mccan emerged without his pack in which was all the flour a second and larger snowslide buried it beyond hope of recovery after that though the disaster had been through no fault of his labiskwee never looked at mccan and smoke knew it was because she dared not  it was a morning stark still clear blue above with white sundazzle on the snow the way led up a long wide slope of crust they moved like weary ghosts in a dead world no wind stirred in the stagnant frigid calm far peaks a hundred miles away studding the backbone of the rockies up and down were as distinct as if no more than five miles away  something is going to happen labiskwee whispered dont you feel ithere there everywhere everything is strange  i feel a chill that is not of cold smoke answered nor is it of hunger  it is in your head your heart she agreed excitedly that is the way i feel it  it is not of my senses smoke diagnosed i sense something from without that is tingling me with ice it is a chill of my nerves  a quarter of an hour later they paused for breath  i can no longer see the far peaks smoke said  the air is getting thick and heavy said labiskwee it is hard to breathe  there be three suns mccan muttered hoarsely reeling as he clung to his staff for support  there was a mock sun on either side of the real sun  there are five said labiskwee and as they looked new suns formed and flashed before their eyes  by heaven the sky is filled with suns beyant all countin mccan cried in fear  which was true for look where they would half the circle of the sky dazzled and blazed with new suns forming  mccan yelped sharply with surprise and pain im stung he cried out then yelped again  then labiskwee cried out and smoke felt a prickling stab on his cheek so cold that it burned like acid it reminded him of swimming in the salt sea and being stung by the poisonous filaments of portuguese menofwar the sensations were so similar that he automatically brushed his cheek to rid it of the stinging substance that was not there  and then a shot rang out strangely muffled down the slope were the young men standing on their skees and one after another opened fire  spread out smoke commanded and climb for it were almost to the top theyre a quarter of a mile below and that means a couple of miles the start of them on the downgoing of the other side  with faces prickling and stinging from invisible atmospheric stabs the three scattered widely on the snow surface and toiled upward the muffled reports of the rifles were weird to their ears  thank the lord smoke panted to labiskwee that four of them are muskets and only one a winchester besides all these suns spoil their aim they are fooled they havent come within a hundred feet of us  it shows my fathers temper she said they have orders to kill  how strange you talk smoke said your voice sounds far away  cover your mouth labiskwee cried suddenly and do not talk i know what it is cover your mouth with your sleeve thus and do not talk  mccan fell first and struggled wearily to his feet and after that all fell repeatedly ere they reached the summit their wills exceeded their muscles they knew not why save that their bodies were oppressed by a numbness and heaviness of movement from the crest looking back they saw the young men stumbling and falling on the upward climb  they will never get here labiskwee said it is the white death i know it though i have never seen it i have heard the old men talk soon will come a mistunlike any mist or fog or frostsmoke you ever saw few have seen it and lived  mccan gasped and strangled  keep your mouth covered smoke commanded  a pervasive flashing of light from all about them drew smokes eyes upward to the many suns they were shimmering and veiling the air was filled with microscopic fireglints the near peaks were being blotted out by the weird mist the young men resolutely struggling nearer were being engulfed in it mccan had sunk down squatting on his skees his mouth and eyes covered by his arms  come on make a start smoke ordered  i cant move mccan moaned  his doubled body set up a swaying motion smoke went toward him slowly scarcely able to will movement through the lethargy that weighed his flesh he noted that his brain was clear it was only the body that was afflicted  let him be labiskwee muttered harshly  but smoke persisted dragging the irishman to his feet and facing him down the long slope they must go then he started him with a shove and mccan braking and steering with his staff shot into the sheen of diamonddust and disappeared  smoke looked at labiskwee who smiled though it was all she could do to keep from sinking down he nodded for her to push off but she came near to him and side by side a dozen feet apart they flew down through the stinging thickness of cold fire  brake as he would smokes heavier body carried him past her and he dashed on alone a long way at tremendous speed that did not slacken till he came out on a level crusted plateau here he braked till labiskwee overtook him and they went on again side by side with diminishing speed which finally ceased the lethargy had grown more pronounced the wildest effort of will could move them no more than at a snails pace they passed mccan again crouched down on his skees and smoke roused him with his staff in passing  now we must stop labiskwee whispered painfully or we will die we must cover upso the old men said  she did not delay to untie knots but began cutting her packlashings smoke cut his and with a last look at the fiery deathmist and the mockery of suns they covered themselves over with the sleepingfurs and crouched in each others arms they felt a body stumble over them and fall then heard feeble whimpering and blaspheming drowned in a violent coughing fit and knew it was mccan who huddled against them as he wrapped his robe about him  their own lungstrangling began and they were racked and torn by a dry cough spasmodic and uncontrollable smoke noted his temperature rising in a fever and labiskwee suffered similarly hour after hour the coughing spells increased in frequency and violence and not till late afternoon was the worst reached after that the mend came slowly and between spells they dozed in exhaustion  mccan however steadily coughed worse and from his groans and howls they knew he was in delirium once smoke made as if to throw the robes back but labiskwee clung to him tightly  no she begged it is death to uncover now bury your face here against my parka and breathe gently and do no talkingsee the way i am doing  they dozed on through the darkness though the decreasing fits of coughing of one invariably aroused the other it was after midnight smoke judged when mccan coughed his last after that he emitted low and bestial moanings that never ceased  smoke awoke with lips touching his lips he lay partly in labiskwees arms his head pillowed on her breast her voice was cheerful and usual the muffled sound of it had vanished  it is day she said lifting the edge of the robes a trifle see o my lover it is day we have lived through and we no longer cough let us look at the world though i could stay here thus forever and always this last hour has been sweet i have been awake and i have been loving you  i do not hear mccan smoke said and what has become of the young men that they have not found us  he threw back the robes and saw a normal and solitary sun in the sky a gentle breeze was blowing crisp with frost and hinting of warmer days to come all the world was natural again mccan lay on his back his unwashed face swarthy from campsmoke frozen hard as marble the sight did not affect labiskwee  look she cried a snow bird it is a good sign  there was no evidence of the young men either they had died on the other side of the divide or they had turned back  there was so little food that they dared not eat a tithe of what they needed nor a hundredth part of what they desired and in the days that followed wandering through the lone mountainland the sharp sting of life grew blunted and the wandering merged half into a dream smoke would become abruptly conscious to find himself staring at the neverending hated snowpeaks his senseless babble still ringing in his ears and the next he would know after seeming centuries was that again he was roused to the sound of his own maunderings labiskwee too was lightheaded most of the time in the main their efforts were unreasoned automatic and ever they worked toward the west and ever they were baffled and thrust north or south by snowpeaks and impassable ranges  there is no way south labiskwee said the old men know west only west is the way  the young men no longer pursued but famine crowded on the trail  came a day when it turned cold and a thick snow that was not snow but frost crystals of the size of grains of sand began to fall all day and night it fell and for three days and nights it continued to fall it was impossible to travel until it crusted under the spring sun so they lay in their furs and rested and ate less because they rested so small was the ration they permitted that it gave no appeasement to the hunger pang that was much of the stomach but more of the brain and labiskwee delirious maddened by the taste of her tiny portion sobbing and mumbling yelping sharp little animal cries of joy fell upon the next days portion and crammed it into her mouth  then it was given to smoke to see a wonderful thing the food between her teeth roused her to consciousness she spat it out and with a great anger struck herself with her clenched fist on the offending mouth  it was given to smoke to see many wonderful things in the days yet to come after the long snowfall came on a great wind that drove the dry and tiny frostparticles as sand is driven in a sandstorm all through the night the sandfrost drove by and in the full light of a clear and windblown day smoke looked with swimming eyes and reeling brain upon what he took to be the vision of a dream all about towered great peaks and small lone sentinels and groups and councils of mighty titans and from the tip of every peak swaying undulating flaring out broadly against the azure sky streamed gigantic snowbanners miles in length milky and nebulous ever waving lights and shadows and flashing silver from the sun  mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord smoke chanted as he gazed upon these dusts of snow winddriven into skyscarves of shimmering silken light  and still he gazed and still the bannered peaks did not vanish and still he considered that he dreamed until labiskwee sat up among the furs  i dream labiskwee he said look do you too dream within my dream  it is no dream she replied this have the old men told me and after this will blow the warm winds and we shall live and win west  smoke shot a snowbird and they divided it once in a valley where willows budded standing in the snow he shot a snowshoe rabbit another time he got a lean white weasel this much of meat they encountered and no more though once halfmile high and veering toward the west and the yukon they saw a wildduck wedge drive by  it is summer in the lower valleys said labiskwee soon it will be summer here  labiskwees face had grown thin but the bright large eyes were brighter and larger and when she looked at him she was transfigured by a wild unearthly beauty  the days lengthened and the snow began to sink each day the crust thawed each night it froze again and they were afoot early and late being compelled to camp and rest during the midday hours of thaw when the crust could not bear their weight when smoke grew snowblind labiskwee towed him on a thong tied to her waist and when she was so blinded she towed behind a thong to his waist and starving in a deeper dream they struggled on through an awakening land bare of any life save their own  exhausted as he was smoke grew almost to fear sleep so fearful and bitter were the visions of that mad twilight land always were they of food and always was the food at his lips snatched away by the malign deviser of dreams he gave dinners to his comrades of the old san francisco days himself with whetting appetite and jealous eye directing the arrangements decorating the table with crimsonleafed runners of the autumn grape the guests were dilatory and while he greeted them and all sparkled with their latest cleverness he was frantic with desire for the table he stole to it unobserved and clutched a handful of black ripe olives and turned to meet still another guest and others surrounded him and the laugh and play of wit went on while all the time hidden in his closed hand was this madness of ripe olives  he gave many such dinners all with the same empty ending he attended gargantuan feasts where multitudes fed on innumerable bullocks roasted whole prying them out of smoldering pits and with sharp knives slicing great strips of meat from the steaming carcasses he stood with mouth agape beneath long rows of turkeys which whiteaproned shopmen sold and everybody bought save smoke mouth still agape chained by a leadenness of movement to the pavement a boy again he sat with spoon poised high above great bowls of bread and milk he pursued shy heifers through upland pastures and centuries of torment in vain effort to steal from them their milk and in noisome dungeons he fought with rats for scraps and refuse there was no food that was not a madness to him and he wandered through vast stables where fat horses stood in milelong rows of stalls and sought but never found the branbins from which they fed  once only he dreamed to advantage famishing shipwrecked or marooned he fought with the big pacific surf for rockclinging mussels and carried them up the sands to the dry flotsam of the spring tides of this he built a fire and among the coals he laid his precious trove he watched the steam jet forth and the locked shells pop apart exposing the salmoncolored meat cooked to a turnhe knew it and this time there was no intruding presence to whisk the meal away at lastso he dreamed within the dreamthe dream would come true this time he would eat yet in his certitude he doubted and he was steeled for the inevitable shift of vision until the salmoncolored meat hot and savory was in his mouth his teeth closed upon it he ate the miracle had happened the shock aroused him he awoke in the dark lying on his back and heard himself mumbling little piggish squeals and grunts of joy his jaws were moving and between his teeth meat was crunching he did not move and soon small fingers felt about his lips and between them was inserted a tiny sliver of meat and in that he would eat no more rather than that he was angry labiskwee cried and in his arms sobbed herself to sleep but he lay on awake marveling at the love and the wonder of woman   the time came when the last food was gone the high peaks receded the divides became lower and the way opened promisingly to the west but their reserves of strength were gone and without food the time quickly followed when they lay down at night and in the morning did not arise smoke weakly gained his feet collapsed and on hands and knees crawled about the building of a fire but try as she would labiskwee sank back each time in an extremity of weakness and smoke sank down beside her a wan sneer on his face for the automatism that had made him struggle for an unneeded fire there was nothing to cook and the day was warm a gentle breeze sighed in the sprucetrees and from everywhere under the disappearing snow came the trickling music of unseen streamlets  labiskwee lay in a stupor her breathing so imperceptible that often smoke thought her dead in the afternoon the chattering of a squirrel aroused him dragging the heavy rifle he wallowed through the crust that had become slush he crept on hands and knees or stood upright and fell forward in the direction of the squirrel that chattered its wrath and fled slowly and tantalizingly before him he had not the strength for a quick shot and the squirrel was never still at times smoke sprawled in the wet snowmelt and cried out of weakness other times the flame of his life flickered and blackness smote him how long he lay in the last faint he did not know but he came to shivering in the chill of evening his wet clothing frozen to the reforming crust the squirrel was gone and after a weary struggle he won back to the side of labiskwee so profound was his weakness that he lay like a dead man through the night nor did dreams disturb him  the sun was in the sky the same squirrel chattering through the trees when labiskwees hand on smokes cheek awakened him  put your hand on my heart lover she said her voice clear but faint and very far away my heart is my love and you hold it in your hand  a long time seemed to go by ere she spoke again  remember always there is no way south that is well known to the caribou people westthat is the wayand you are almost thereand you will make it  and smoke drowsed in the numbness that is near to death until once more she aroused him  put your lips on mine she said i will die so  we will die together sweetheart was his answer  no a feeble flutter of her hand checked him and so thin was her voice that scarcely did he hear it yet did he hear all of it her hand fumbled and groped in the hood of her parka and she drew forth a pouch that she placed in his hand and now your lips my lover your lips on my lips and your hand on my heart  and in that long kiss darkness came upon him again and when again he was conscious he knew that he was alone and he knew that he was to die he was wearily glad that he was to die  he found his hand resting on the pouch with an inward smile at the curiosity that made him pull the drawstring he opened it out poured a tiny flood of food there was no particle of it that he did not recognize all stolen by labiskwee from labiskweebreadfragments saved far back in the days ere mccan lost the flour strips and strings of cariboumeat partly gnawed crumbles of suet the hindleg of the snowshoe rabbit untouched the hindleg and part of the foreleg of the white weasel the wing dented still by her reluctant teeth and the leg of the snowbirdpitiful remnants tragic renunciations crucifixions of life morsels stolen from her terrible hunger by her incredible love  with maniacal laughter smoke flung it all out on the hardening snowcrust and went back into the blackness  he dreamed the yukon ran dry in its bed among muddy pools of water and icescoured rocks he wandered picking up fat nuggetgold the weight of it grew to be a burden to him till he discovered that it was good to eat and greedily he ate after all of what worth was gold that men should prize it so save that it was good to eat  he awoke to another sun his brain was strangely clear no longer did his eyesight blur the familiar palpitation that had vexed him through all his frame was gone the juices of his body seemed to sing as if the spring had entered in blessed wellbeing had come to him he turned to awaken labiskwee and saw and remembered he looked for the food flung out on the snow it was gone and he knew that in delirium and dream it had been the yukon nuggetgold in delirium and dream he had taken heart of life from the life sacrifice of labiskwee who had put her heart in his hand and opened his eyes to woman and wonder  he was surprised at the ease of his movements astounded that he was able to drag her furwrapped body to the exposed thawed gravelbank which he undermined with the ax and caved upon her   three days with no further food he fought west in the mid third day he fell beneath a lone spruce beside a wide stream that ran open and which he knew must be the klondike ere blackness conquered him he unlashed his pack said goodby to the bright world and rolled himself in the robes  chirping sleepy noises awoke him the long twilight was on above him among the spruce boughs were ptarmigan hunger bit him into instant action though the action was infinitely slow five minutes passed before he was able to get his rifle to his shoulder and a second five minutes passed ere he dared lying on his back and aiming straight upward to pull the trigger it was a clean miss no bird fell but no bird flew they ruffled and rustled stupidly and drowsily his shoulder pained him a second shot was spoiled by the involuntary wince he made as he pulled trigger somewhere in the last three days though he had no recollection how he must have fallen and injured it  the ptarmigan had not flown he doubled and redoubled the robe that had covered him and humped it in the hollow between his right arm and his side resting the butt of the rifle on the fur he fired again and a bird fell he clutched it greedily and found that he had shot most of the meat out of it the largecaliber bullet had left little else than a mess of mangled feathers still the ptarmigan did not fly and he decided that it was heads or nothing he fired only at heads he reloaded and reloaded the magazine he missed he hit and the stupid ptarmigan that were loath to fly fell upon him in a rain of foodlives disrupted that his life might feed and live there had been nine of them and in the end he clipped the head of the ninth and lay and laughed and wept he knew not why  the first he ate raw then he rested and slept while his life assimilated the life of it in the darkness he awoke hungry with strength to build a fire and until early dawn he cooked and ate crunching the bones to powder between his longidle teeth he slept awoke in the darkness of another night and slept again to another sun  he noted with surprise that the fire crackled with fresh fuel and that a blackened coffeepot steamed on the edge of the coals beside the fire within arms length sat shorty smoking a brownpaper cigarette and intently watching him smokes lips moved but a throat paralysis seemed to come upon him while his chest was suffused with the menace of tears he reached out his hand for the cigarette and drew the smoke deep into his lungs again and again  i have not smoked for a long time he said at last in a low calm voice for a very long time  nor eaten from your looks shorty added gruffly  smoke nodded and waved his hand at the ptarmigan feathers that lay all about  not until recently he returned do you know id like a cup of coffee it will taste strange also flapjacks and a strip of bacon  and beans shorty tempted  they would taste heavenly i find i am quite hungry again  while the one cooked and the other ate they told briefly what had happened to them in the days since their separation  the klondike was breakin up shorty concluded his recital an we just had to wait for open water two polin boats six other menyou know em all an crackerjacksan all kinds of outfit an weve sure been acominpolin linin up and portagin but the fallsll stick em a solid week thats where i left em acuttin a trail over the tops of the bluffs for the boats i just had a sure natural hunch to keep acomin so i fills a pack with grub an starts i knew id find you adriftin an all in  smoke nodded and put forth his hand in a silent grip well lets get started he said  started hell shorty exploded we stay right here an rest you up an feed you up for a couple of days  smoke shook his head  if you could just see yourself shorty protested  and what he saw was not nice smokes face wherever the skin showed was black and purple and scabbed from repeated frostbite the cheeks were fallen in so that despite the covering of beard the upper rows of teeth ridged the shrunken flesh across the forehead and about the deepsunk eyes the skin was stretched drumtight while the scraggly beard that should have been golden was singed by fire and filthy with campsmoke  better pack up smoke said im going on  but youre feeble as a kid baby you cant hike whats the rush  shorty i am going after the biggest thing in the klondike and i cant wait thats all start packing its the biggest thing in the world its bigger than lakes of gold and mountains of gold bigger than adventure and meateating and bearkilling  shorty sat with bulging eyes in the name of the lord what is it he queried huskily or are you just simple loco  no im all right perhaps a fellow has to stop eating in order to see things at any rate i have seen things i never dreamed were in the world i know what a woman isnow  shortys mouth opened and about the lips and in the light of the eyes was the whimsical advertisement of the sneer forthcoming  dont please smoke said gently you dont know i do  shorty gulped and changed his thought huh i dont need no hunch to guess her name the rest of em has gone up to the drainin of surprise lake but joy gastell
