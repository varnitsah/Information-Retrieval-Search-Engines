a story said i as harry and i crept to his knees in the glow of the bright evening firelight while aunt lois was busily rattling the teathings and grandmamma at the other end of the fireplace was quietly setting the heel of a bluemixed yarn stocking  in those days we had no magazines and daily papers each reeling off a serial story once a week the columbian sentinel came from boston with its slender stock of news and editorial but all the multiform devicespictorial narrative and poeticalwhich keep the mind of the present generation ablaze with excitement had not then even an existence there was no theatre no opera there were in oldtown no parties or balls except perhaps the annual election or thanksgiving festival and when winter came and the sun went down at halfpast four oclock and left the long dark hours of evening to be provided for the necessity of amusement became urgent hence in those days chimneycorner storytelling became an art and an accomplishment society then was full of traditions and narratives which had all the uncertain glow and shifting mystery of the firelit hearth upon them they were told to sympathetic audiences by the rising and falling light of the solemn embers with the hearthcrickets filling up every pause then the aged told their stories to the youngtales of early life tales of war and adventure of forestdays of indian captivities and escapes of bears and wildcats and panthers of rattlesnakes of witches and wizards and strange and wonderful dreams and appearances and providences  in those days of early massachusetts faith and credence were in the very air twothirds of new england was then dark unbroken forests through whose tangled paths the mysterious winter wind groaned and shrieked and howled with weird noises and unaccountable clamors along the ironbound shore the stormful atlantic raved and thundered and dashed its moaning waters as if to deaden and deafen any voice that might tell of the settled life of the old civilized world and shut us forever into the wilderness a good storyteller in those days was always sure of a warm seat at the hearthstone and the delighted homage of children and in all oldtown there was no better storyteller than sam lawson  do do tell us a story said harry pressing upon him and opening very wide blue eyes in which undoubting faith shone as in a mirror and let it be something strange and different from common  wal i know lots o strange things said sam looking mysteriously into the fire why i know things that ef i should tellwhy people might day they want so but then they is so for all that  oh do do tell us  why i should scare ye to death mebbe said sam doubtingly  oh pooh no you wouldnt we both burst out at once  but sam was possessed by a reticent spirit and loved dearly to be wooed and importuned and go he only took up the great kitchentongs and smote on the hickory forestick when it flew apart in the middle and scattered a shower of clear bright coals all over the hearth  mercy on us sam lawson said aunt lois in an indignant voice spinning round from her dishwashing  dont you worry a grain miss lois said sam composedly i see that are stick was een amost in two and i thought id jest settle it ill sweep up the coals now he added vigorously applying a turkeywing to the purpose as he knelt on the hearth his spare lean figure glowing in the blaze of the firelight and getting quite flushed with exertion  there now he said when he had brushed over and under and between the fireirons and pursued the retreating ashes so far into the red fiery citadel that his fingerends were burning and tingling that ares done now as well as hepsy herself could a done it i allers sweeps up the haarth i think its part o the mans bisness when he makes the fire but hepsys so used to seein me adoin ont that she dont see no kind o merit int its just as parson lothrop said in his sermonfolks allers overlook their common marcies  but come sam that story said harry and i coaxingly pressing upon him and pulling him down into his seat in the corner  lordy massy these ere young uns said sam theres never no contentin on em ye tell em one story and they jest swallows it as a dog does a gob o meat and theyre all ready for another what do ye want to hear now  now the fact was that sams stories had been told us so often that they were all arranged and ticketed in our minds we knew every word in them and could set him right if he varied a hair from the usual track and still the interest in them was unabated still we shivered and clung to his knee at the mysterious parts and felt gentle cold chills run down our spines at appropriate places we were always in the most receptive and sympathetic condition tonight in particular was one of those thundering stormy ones when the winds appeared to be holding a perfect mad carnival over my grandfathers house they yelled and squealed round the corners they collected in troops and came tumbling and roaring down chimney they shook and tattled the butterydoor and the sinkroomdoor and the cellardoor and the chamberdoor with a constant undertone of squeak and clatter as if at every door were a cold discontented spirit tired of the chill outside and longing for the warmth and comfort within  wal boys said sam confidentially whatll ye have  tell us come down come down we both shouted with one voice this was in our mind an a no 1 among sams stories  ye musnt be frightened now said sam paternally  oh no we arnt frightened ever said we both in one breath  not when ye go down the cellar arler cider said sam with severe scrutiny ef ye should be down cellar and the candle should go out now  i aint said i i aint afraid of any thing i never knew what it was to be afraid in my life  wal then said sam ill tell ye this eres what capn eb sawin told me when i was a boy about your bigness i reckon  capn eb sawin was a most respectable man your granther knew him very well and he was a deacon in the church in dedham afore he died he was at lexington when the fust gun was fired agin the british he was a dreffle smart man capn eb was and driv team a good many years atween here and boston he married lois peabody that was cousin to your granther then lois was a rael sensible woman and ive heard her tell the story as he told her and it was jest as he told it to mejest exactly and i shall never forget it if i live to be nine hundred years old like mathuselah  ye see along back in them times there used to be a fellow come round these ere parts spring and fall apeddlin goods with his pack on his back and his name was jehiel lommedieu nobody rightly knew where he come from he wasnt much of a talker but the women rather liked him and kind o liked to have him round women will like some fellows when men cant see no sort o reason why they should and they liked this ere lommedieu though he was kind o mournful and thin and shadbellied and hadnt nothin to say for himself but it got to be so that the women would count and calculate so many weeks afore twas time for lommedieu to be along and theyd make up gingersnaps and preserves and pies and make him stay to tea at the houses and feed him up on the best there was and the story went round that he was acourtin phebe ann parker or phebe ann was acourtin himfolks didnt rightly know which wal all of a sudden lommedieu stopped comin round and nobody knew whyonly jest he didnt come it turned out that phebe ann parker had got a letter from him sayin hed be along afore thanksgiving but he didnt come neither afore nor at thanksgiving time nor arter nor next spring and finally the women they gin up lookin for him some said he was dead some said he was gone to canada and some said he hed gone over to the old country  wal as to phebe ann she acted like a gal o sense and married bijah moss and thought no more bout it she took the right view ont and said she was sartin that all things was ordered out for the best and it was jest as well folks couldnt always have their own way and so in time lommedieu was gone out o folkss minds much as a last years appleblossom  its relly affectin to think how little these ere folks is missed thats so much sot by there aint nobody ef theys ever so important but what the world gets to goin on without em pretty much as it did with em though theres some little flurry at fust wal the last thing that was in anybodys mind was that they ever should hear from lommedieu agin but there aint nothin but what has its time o turnin up and it seems his turn was to come  wal ye see twas the 19th o march when capn eb sawin started with a team for boston that day there come on about the biggest snowstorm that thered been in them parts sence the oldest man could remember twas this ere fine siftin snow that drives in your face like needles with a wind to cut your nose off it made teamin pretty tedious work capn eb was about the toughest man in them parts hed spent days in the woods aloggin and hed been up to the deestrict o maine alumberin and was about up to any sort o thing a man genally could be up to but these ere march winds sometimes does set on a fellow so that neither natur nor grace can stan em the capn used to say he could stan any wind that blew one way t time for five minutes but come to winds that blew all four pints at the same minitwhy they flustered him  wal that was the sort o weather it was all day and by sundown capn eb he got clean bewildered so that he lost his road and when night came on he didnt know nothin where he was ye see the country was all under drift and the air so thick with snow that he couldnt see a foot afore him and the fact was he got off the boston road without knowin it and came out at a pair o bars nigh upon sherburn where old cack sparrocks mill is  your granther used to know old cack boys he was a drefful drinkin old crittur that lived there all alone in the woods by himself atendin saw and grist mill he wasnt allers jest what he was then time was that cack was a pretty considably likely young man and his wife was a very respectable womandeacon amos petengalls dater from sherburn  but ye see the year arter his wife died cack he gin up goin to meetin sundays and all the tithingmen and selectmen could do they couldnt get him out to meetin and when a man neglects means o grace and sanctuary privileges there aint no sayin what hell do next why boys jist think ontan immortal crittur lyin round loose all day sunday and not puttin on so much as a clean shirt when all spectable folks has on their best close and is to meetin worshippin the lord what can you spect to come of it when he lies idlin round in his old weekday close fishing or some sich but what the devil should be arter him at last as he was arter old cack  here sam winked impressively to my grandfather in the opposite corner to call his attention to the moral which he was interweaving with his narrative  wal ye see capn eb he told me that when he come to them bars and looked up and saw the dark acomin down and the storm athickenin up he felt that things was gettin pretty considable serious there was a dark piece o woods on ahead of him inside the bars and he knew come to get in there the light would give out clean so he jest thought hed take the hoss out o the team and go ahead a little and see where he was so he driv his oxen up agin the fence and took out the hoss and got on him and pushed along through the woods not rightly knowin where he was goin  wal afore long he see a light through the trees and sure enough he come out to cack sparrocks old mill  it was a pretty considable gloomy sort of a place that are old mill was there was a great fall of water that come rushin down the rocks and fell in a deep pool and it sounded sort o wild and lonesome but capn eb he knocked on the door with his whiphandle and got in  there to be sure sot old cack beside a great blazin fire with his rumjug at his elbow he was a drefful fellow to drink cack was for all that there was some good in him for he was pleasantspoken and bliging and he made the capn welcome  ye see cack said capn eb i m off my road and got snowed up down by your bars says he  want ter know says cack calculate youll jest have to camp down here till mornin says he  wal so old cack he got out his tin lantern and went with capn eb back to the bars to help him fetch along his critturs he told him he could put em under the millshed so they got the critturs up to the shed and got the cart under and by that time the storm was awful  but cack he made a great roarin fire cause ye see cack allers had slabwood a plenty from his mill and a roarin fire is jest so much company it sort o keeps a fellows spirits up a good fire does so cack he sot on his old teakettle and made a swingeing lot o toddy and he and capn eb were havin a tolable comfortable time there cack was a pretty good hand to tell stories and capn eb warnt no way backward in that line and kep up his end pretty well and pretty soon they was aroarin and hawhawin inside about as loud as the storm outside when all of a sudden bout midnight there come a loud rap on the door  lordy massy whats that says cack folks is rather startled allers to be checked up sudden when they are acarryin on and laughin and it was such an awful blowy night it was a little scary to have a rap on the door  wal they waited a minit and didnt hear nothin but the wind ascreechin round the chimbley and old cack was jest goin on with his story when the rap come agin hardern ever as if itd shook the door open  wal says old cack if tis the devil wed jest as goods open and have it out with him to onst says he and so he got up and opened the door and sure enough there was old ketury there expect youve heard your grandma tell about old ketury she used to come to meetins sometimes and her husband was one o the prayin indians but ketury was one of the rael wild sort and you couldnt no more convert her than you could convert a wildcat or a painter panther lordy massy ketury used to come to meetin and sit there on them indian benches and when the second bell was atollin and when parson lothrop and his wife was comin up the broad aisle and everybody in the house ris up and stood ketury would sit there and look at em out o the corner o her eyes and folks used to say she rattled them necklaces o rattlesnakes tails and wildcat teeth and sich like heathen trumpery and looked for all the world as if the spirit of the old sarpent himself was in her ive seen her sit and look at lady lothrop out o the corner o her eyes and her old brown baggy neck would kind o twist and work and her eyes they looked so that twas enough to scare a body for all the world she looked jest as if she was aworkin up to spring at her lady lothrop was jest as kind to ketury as she always was to every poor crittur shed bow and smile as gracious to her when meetin was over and she come down the aisle passin oot o meetin but ketury never took no notice ye see keturys father was one o them great powwows down to marthas vineyard and people used to say she was set apart when she was a child to the sarvice o the devil any way she never could be made nothin of in a christian way she come down to parson lothrops study once or twice to be catechised but he couldnt get a word out o her and she kind o seemed to sit scornful while he was atalkin folks said if it was in old times ketury wouldnt have been allowed to go on so but parson lothrops so sort o mild he let her take pretty much her own way everybody thought that ketury was a witch at least she knew considable moren she ought to know and so they was kind o fraid on her capn eb says he never see a fellow seem scareder than cack did when he see ketury astandin there  why ye see boys she was as withered and wrinkled and brown as an old frosted punkinvine and her little snaky eyes sparkled and snapped and it made yer head kind o dizzy to look at em and folks used to say that anybody that ketury got mad at was sure to get the worst of it fust or last and so no matter what day or hour ketury had a mind to rap at anybodys door folks genlly thought it was best to let her in but then they never thought her coming was for any good for she was just like the windshe came when the fit was on her she staid jest so long as it pleased her and went when she got ready and not before ketury understood english and could talk it well enough but always seemed to scorn it and was allers mo win and mutterin to herself in indian and winkin and blinkin as if she saw morefolks round than you did so that she want no way pleasant company and yet everybody took good care to be polite to her so old cack asked her to come in and didnt makeno question where she come from or what she come on but he knew it was twelve good miles from where she lived to his hut and the snow was drifted above her middle and capn eb declared that there want no track nor sign o a track of anybodys coming through that snow next morning  how did she get there then said i  didnt ye never see brown leaves aridin on the wind well capn eb he says she came on the wind and im sure it was strong enough to fetch her but cack he got her down into the warm corner and he poured her out a mug o hot toddy and give her but ye see her bein there sort o stopped the conversation for she sot there arockin backards and forards asippin her toddy and amutterin and lookin up chimbley  capn eb says in all his born days he never hearn such screeches and yells as the wind give over that chimbley and old cack got so frightened you could fairly hear his teeth chatter  but capn eb he was a putty brave man and he want goin to have conversation stopped by no woman witch or no witch and so when he see her mutterin and lookin up chimbley he spoke up and says he well ketury what do you see says he come out with it dont keep it to yourself ye see capn eb was a hearty fellow and then he was a leetle warmed up with the toddy  then he said he see an evil kind o smile on keturys face and she rattled her necklace o bones and snakes tails and her eyes seemed to snap and she looked up the chimbley and called out come down come down lets see who ye be  then there was a scratchin and a rumblin and a groan and a pair of feet come down the chimbley and stood right in the middle of the haarth the toes pintin outrds with shoes and silver buckles ashinin in the firelight capn eb says he never come so near bein scared in his life and as to old cack he jest wilted right down in his chair  then old ketury got up and reached her stick up chimbley and called out louder come down come down lets see who ye be and sure enough down came a pair o legs and jined right on to the feet good fair legs they was with ribbed stockings and leather breeches  wal were in for it now says capn eb go it ketury and lets have the rest on him  ketury didnt seem to mind him she stood there as stiff as a stake and kep callin out come down come down lets see who ye be and then come down the body of a man with a brown coat and yellow vest and jined right on to the legs but there want no arms to it then ketury shook her stick up chimbley and called come down come down and there came down a pair o arms and went on each side o the body and there stood a man all finished only there want no head on him  wal ketury says capn eb this eres getting serious i spec you must finish him up and lets see what he wants of us  then ketury called out once more loudern ever come down come down lets see who ye be and sure enough down comes a mans head and settled on the shoulders straight enough and capn eb the minit he sot eyes on him knew he was jehiel lommedieu  illustration old cack knew him too page 020  old cack knew him too and he fell flat on his face and prayed the lord to have mercy on his soul but capn eb he was for gettin to the bottom of matters and not have his scare for nothin so he says to him what do you want now you hev come  the man he didnt speak he only sort o moaned and pinted to the chimbley he seemed to try to speak but couldnt for ye see it isnt often that his sort o folks is permitted to speak but just then there came a screechin blast o wind and blowed the door open and blowed the smoke and fire all out into the room and there seemed to be a whirlwind and darkness and moans and screeches and when it all cleared up ketury and the man was both gone and only old cack lay on the ground rolling and moaning as if hed die  wal capn eb he picked him up and built up the fire and sort o comforted him up cause the crittur was in distress o mind that was drefful the awful providence ye see had awakened him and his sin had been set home to his soul and he was under such conviction that it all had to come outhow old cacks father had murdered poor lommedieu for his money and cack had been privy to it and helped his father build the body up in that very chimbley and he said that he hadnt had neither peace nor rest since then and that was what had driv him away from ordinances for ye know sinnin will always make a man leave prayin wal cack didnt live but a day or two capn eb he got the minister o sherburn and one o the selectmen down to see him and they took his deposition he seemed railly quite penitent and parson carryl he prayed with him and was faithful in settin home the providence to his soul and so at the eleventh hour poor old cack might have got in at least it looks a leetle like it he was distressed to think he couldnt live to be hung he sort o seemed to think that if he was fairly tried and hung it would make it all square he made parson carryl promise to have the old mill pulled down and bury the body and after he was dead they did it  capn eb he was one of a party o eight that pulled down the chimbley and there sure enough was the skeleton of poor lommedieu  so there you see boys there cant be no iniquity so hid but what itll come out the wild indians of the forest and the stormy winds and tempests jined together to bring out this ere  for my part said aunt lois sharply i never believed that story  why lois said my grandmother capn eb sawin was a regular churchmember and a most respectable man  law mother i dont doubt he thought so i suppose he and cack got drinking toddy together till he got asleep and dreamed it i wouldnt believe such a thing if it did happen right before my face and eyes i should only think i was crazy thats all  come lois if i was you i wouldnt talk so like a sadducee said my grandmother what would become of all the accounts in dr cotton mathers magnilly if folks were like you  wal said sam lawson drooping contemplatively over the coals and gazing into the fire theres a putty considable sight o things in this world thats true and then agin theres a sight o things that aint true now my old granther used to say boys says he if ye want to lead a pleasant and prosperous life ye must contrive allers to keep jest the happy medium between truth and falsehood now that ares my doctrine  aunt lois knit severely  boys said sam dont you want ter go down with me and get a mug o cider  of course we did and took down a basket to bring up some apples to roast  boys says sam mysteriously while he was drawing the cider you jest ask your aunt lois to tell you what she knows bout ruth sullivan  why what is it  oh you must ask her these ere folks thats so kind o toppin about sperits and sich come sift em down you genlly find they knows one story that kind o puzzles em now you mind and jist ask your aunt lois about ruth sullivan  illustration tailpiece page 024  illustration the sullivan lookingglass page 025     the sullivan lookingglass  aunt lois said i what was that story about ruth sullivan  aunt loiss quick black eyes gave a surprised flash and she and my grandmother looked at each other a minute significantly who told you any thing about ruth sullivan she said sharply  nobody somebody said you knew something about her said i  i was holding a skein of yarn for aunt lois and she went on winding in silence putting the ball through loops and tangled places  little boys shouldnt ask questions she concluded at last sententiously little boys that ask too many questions get sent to bed  i knew that of old and rather wondered at my own hardihood  aunt lois wound on in silence but looking in her face i could see plainly that i had started an exciting topic  i should think pursued my grandmother in her corner that ruths case might show you lois that a good many things may happenmore than you believe  oh well mother ruths was a strange case but i suppose there are ways of accounting for it  you believed ruth didnt you  oh certainly i believed ruth why shouldnt i ruth was one of my best friends and as true a girl as lives there wasnt any nonsense about ruth she was one of the sort said aunt lois reflectively that id as soon trust as myself when she said a thing was so and so i knew it was so  then if you think ruths story was true pursued my grandmother whats the reason you are always cavilling at things just cause you cant understand how they came to be so  aunt lois set her lips firmly and wound with grim resolve she was the very impersonation of that obstinate rationalism that grew up at the newengland fireside close alongside of the most undoubting faith in the supernatural  i dont believe such things at last she snapped out and i dont disbelieve them i just let em alone what do i know about em ruth tells me a story and i believe her i know what she saw beforehand came true in a most remarkable way well im sure ive no objection one thing may be true or another for all me but just because i believe ruth sullivan im not going to believe right and left all the stories in cotton mather and all that anybody can hawk up to tell not i  this whole conversation made me all the more curious to get at the story thus dimly indicated and so we beset sam for information  so your aunt lois wouldnt tell ye nothin said sam wanter know neow sho  no she said we must go to bed if we asked her  that ares a way folks has but ye see boys said sam while a droll confidential expression crossed the lacklustre dolefulness of his visage ye see i put ye up to it cause miss lois is so large and commandin in her ways and so kind o up and down in all her doins that i like once and a while to sort o gravel her and i knowed enough to know that that are question would git her in a tight place  ye see yer aunt lois was knowin to all this ere about ruth so there wernt no gettin away from it and its about as remarkable a providence as any o them of mister cotton marthers magnilly so if youll come up in the barnchamber this arternoon where ive got a lot o flax to hatchel out ill tell ye all about it  so that afternoon beheld sam arranged at full length on a pile of toptow in the barnchamber hatchelling by proxy by putting harry and myself to the service  wal now boys its kind o refreshing to see how wal ye take hold he observed nothin like bein industrious while yer young gret sight better now than loafin off down in them medders       in books and work and useful play         let my fust years be past      so shall i give for every day         some good account at last  but sam if we work for you you must tell us that story about ruth sullivan  lordy massy yiscourse i will ive had the best kind o chances of knowin all about that are wal you see there was old gineral sullivan he lived in state and grander in the old sullivan house out to roxberry i been to roxberry and seen that are house o gineral sullivans there was one time that i was a considable spell lookin round in roxberry a kind o seein how things wuz there and whether or no there mightnt be some sort o providential openin or suthin i used to stay with aunt polly ginger she was sister to mehitable ginger gineral sullivans housekeeper and hed the in and out o the sullivan house and kind o kept the run o how things went and came in it polly she was a kind o cousin o my mothers and allers glad to see me fact was i was putty handy round house and she used to save up her broken things and sich till i come round in the fall and then id mend em up and put the clock right and split her up a lot o kindlings and board up the cellarwindows and kind o make her sort o comfortableshe bein a lone body and no man round as i said it was sort o convenient to hev me and so i jest got the run o things in the sullivan house pretty much as ef i was one on em gineral sullivan he kept a grand house i tell you you see he cum from the old country and felt sort o lordly and grand and they used to hev the gretest kind o doins there to the sullivan house ye ought ter a seen that are housegret big front hall and gret wide stairs none o your steep kind that breaks a fellers neck to get up and down but gret broad stairs with easy risers so they used to say you could a cantered a pony up that are stairway easy as not then there was gret wide rooms and sofys and curtains and gret curtained bedsteads that looked sort o like fortifications and picturs that was got in italy and rome and all them are heathen places ye see the gineral was a drefful worldly old critter and was all for the pomps and the vanities lordy massy i wonder what the poor old critter thinks about it all now when his bodys all gone to dust and ashes in the graveyard and his souls gone to tarnity wal that are aint none o my business only it shows the vanity o riches in a kind o strikin light and makes me content that i never hed none  but sam i hope general sullivan wasnt a wicked man was he  wal i wouldnt say he was railly wickeder than the run but he was one o these ere highstepping bigfeeling fellers that seem to be a hevin their portion in this life drefful proud he was and he was pretty much sot on this world and kep a sort o court goin on round him wal i dont jedge him nor nobody folks that hes the world is apt to get sot on it dont none on us do more than middlin well  but sam what about ruth sullivan  ruthoh yisruth  wal ye see the only crook in the old ginerals lot was he didnt hev no children mis sullivan she was a beautiful woman as handsome as a pictur but she never had but one child and he was a son who died when he was a baby and about broke her heart and then this ere ruth was her sisters child that was born about the same time and when the boy died they took ruth home to sort o fill his place and kind o comfort up mis sullivan and then ruths father and mother died and they adopted her for their own and brought her up  wal she grew up to be amazin handsome why everybody said that she was jest the light and glory of that are old sullivan place and worth moren all the picturs and the silver and the jewels and all there was in the house and she was jest so innercent and sweet that you never see nothing to beat it wal your aunt lois she got acquainted with ruth one summer when she was up to old town a visitin at parson lothrops your aunt lois was a gal then and a pretty goodlookin one too and somehow or other she took to ruth and ruth took to her and when ruth went home they used to be a writin backwards and forads and i guess the fact was ruth thought about as much of your aunt lois as she did o anybody ye see your aunt was a kind o strong upanddown woman that always knew certain jest what she did know and ruth she was one o them gals that seems sort o like a stray lamb or a dove thats sort o lost their way in the world and wants some one to show em where to go next for ye see the fact was the old gineral and madam they didnt agree very well he want well pleased that she didnt have no children and she was sort o jealous o him cause she got hold o some sort of story about how he was to a married somebody else over there in england so she got sort o riled up jest as wimmen will the best on em and they was pretty apt to have spats and one could give tother as good as they sent and by all accounts they fit putty lively sometimes and between the two ruth she was sort o scared and fluttered like a dove that didnt know jest where to settle ye see there she was in that are great wide house where they was a feastin and a prancin and a dancin and a goin on like ahashuerus and herodias and all them old scripture days there was acomin and goin and there was gret dinners and gret doins but no love and you know the scriptur says better is a dinner o yarbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith  wal i dont orter say hatred arter all i kind o reckon the old gineral did the best he could the fact is when a woman gits a kink in her head agin a man the best on us dont allers do jest the right thing  any way ruth she was sort o forlorn and didnt seem to take no comfort in the goins on the gineral he was mighty fond on her and proud on her and there want nothin too good for ruth he was freehanded the gineral wuz he dressed her up in silks and satins and she hed a maid to wait on her and she hed sets o pearl and dimond and madam sullivan she thought all the world on her and kind o worshipped the ground she trod on and yet ruth was sort o lonesome  ye see ruth want calculated for grander some folks aint  why that are summer she spent out to old town she was jest as chirk and chipper as a wren a wearin her little sunbunnet and goin a huckleberryin and a blackberryin and diggin sweetflag and gettin cowslops and dandelions and she hed a word for everybody and everybody liked ruth and wished her well wal she was sent for her health and she got that and more too she got a sweetheart  ye see there was a capn oliver a visitin at the ministers that summera nice handsome young man as ever was he and ruth and your aunt lois they was together a good deal and they was a ramblin and a ridin and a sailin and so ruth and the capting went the way o all the airth and fell dead in love with each other your aunt lois she was knowing to it and all about it cause ruth she was jest one of them that couldnt take a step without somebody to talk to  captain oliver was of a good family in england and so when he made bold to ask the old gineral for ruth he didnt say him nay and it was agreed as they was young they should wait a year or two if he and she was of the same mind he should be free to marry her jest right on that the captains regiment was ordered home and he had to go and the next they heard it was sent off to india and poor little ruth she kind o drooped and pined but she kept true and wouldnt have nothin to say to nobody that came arter her for there was lots and cords o fellows as did come arter her ye see ruth had a takin way with her and then she had the name of bein a great heiress and that allers draws fellers as molasses does flies  wal then the news came that captain oliver was comin home to england and the ship was took by the algerenes and he was gone into slavery there among them heathen mahomedans and what not  folks seemed to think it was all over with him and ruth might jest as well give up fust as last and the old gineral hed come to think she might do better and he kep a introducin one and another and tryin to marry her off but ruth she wouldnt she used to write sheets and sheets to your aunt lois about it and i think aunt lois she kep her grit up your aunt lois shed a stuck by a man to the end o time eft ben her case and so she told ruth  wal then there was young jeff sullivan the ginerals nephew he turned up and the gineral he took a gret fancy to him he was next heir to the gineral but hed ben a pretty rackety youngster in his young daysoff to sea and what not and sowed a considable crop o wild oats people said hed been a pirating off there in south ameriky lordy massy nobody rightly knew where he hed ben or where he hadnt all was he turned up at last all alive and chipper as a skunk blackbird wal of course he made his court to ruth and the gineral he rather backed him up in it but ruth she wouldnt have nothin to say to him wal he come and took up his lodgin at the ginerals and he was jest as slippery as an eel and sort o slid into every thing that was a goin on in the house and about it he was here and he was there and he was everywhere and a havin his say about this and that and he got everybody putty much under his thumb and they used to say he wound the gineral round and round like a skein o yarn but he couldnt come it round ruth  wal the gineral said she shouldnt be forced and jeff he was smooth as satin and said hed be willing to wait as long as jacob did for rachel and so there he sot down a watchin as patient as a cat at a mousehole cause the gineral he was thickset and shortnecked and drank pretty free and was one o the sort that might pop off any time  wal mis sullivan she beset the gineral to make a provision for ruth cause she told him very sensible that hed brought her up in luxury and that it want fair not to settle somethin on her and so the gineral he said hed make a will and part the property equally between them and he says to jeff that if he played his part as a young fellow oughter know how it would all come to him in the end cause they hadnt heard nothing from captain oliver for three or four years and folks about settled it that he must be dead  wal the gineral he got a letter about an estate that had come to him in england and he had to go over wal livin on the next estate was the very cousin of the ginerals that he was to a married when they was both young the lands joined so that the grounds run together what came between them two nobody knows but she never married and there she was there was high words between the gineral and madam sullivan about his goin over she said there want no sort o need ont and he said there was and she said she hoped she should be in her grave afore he come back and he said she might suit herself about that for all him that are was the story that the housekeeper told to aunt polly and aunt polly she told me these ere squabbles somehow allers does kind o leak out one way or tother anyhow it was a house divided agin itself at the ginerals when he was a fixin out for the voyage there was ruth a goin fust to one and then to tother and tryin all she could to keep peace beteen em and there was this ere master slick tongue talkin this way to one side and that way to tother and the old gineral kind o like a shuttlecock atween em  wal then the night afore he sailed the gineral he hed his lawyer up in his library there a lookin over all his papers and bonds and things and a witnessing his will and master jeff was there as lively as a cricket a goin into all affairs and offerin to take precious good care while he was gone and the gineral he had his papers and letters out a sortin on em over which was to be took to the old country and which was to be put in a trunk to go back to lawyer denniss office  wal abner ginger pollys boy he that was footman and waiter then at the ginerals he told me that about eight oclock that evening he went up with hot water and lemons and sperits and sich and he see the gret green table in the library all strewed and covered with piles o papers and there was tin boxes a standin round and the gineral a packin a trunk and young master jeff as lively and helpful as a rat that smells cheese and then the gineral he says abner says he can you write your namei should hope so gineral says abnerwal then abner says he this is my last will and i want you to witness it and so abner he put down his name opposite to a place with a wafer and a seal and then the gineral he says abner you tell ginger to come here that you see was his housekeeper my aunt pollys sister and a likely woman as ever was and so they had her up and she put down her name to the will and then aunt polly she was had up she was drinking tea there that night and she put down her name and all of em did it with good heart cause it had got about among em that the will was to provide for miss ruth for everybody loved ruth ye see and there was considble many stories kind o goin the rounds about master jeff and his doins and they did say he sort o kep up the strife atween the gineral and my lady and so they didnt think none too well o him and as he was next o kin and miss ruth want none o the ginerals blood ye see she was mis sullivans sisters child of course there wouldnt nothin go to miss ruth in way o law and so that was why the signin o that are will was so much talked about among em  wal you see the gineral he sailed the next day and jeff he staid by to keep watch o things  wal the old gineral he got over safe for miss sullivan she had a letter from him all right when he got away his conscience sort o nagged him and he was minded to be a good husband at any rate he wrote a good loving letter to her and sent his love to ruth and sent over lots o little keepsakes and things for her and told her that he left her under good protection and wanted her to try and make up her mind to marry jeff as that would keep the property together  wal now there couldnt be no sort o sugar sweeter than jeff was to them lone wimmen jeff was one o the sort that could be all things to all wimmen he waited and he tended and he was as humble as any snake in the grass that ever ye see and the old lady she clean fell in with him but ruth she seemed to have a regular spite agin him and she that war as gentle as a lamb that never had so much as a hard thought of a mortal critter and wouldnt tread on a worm she was so set agin jeff that she wouldnt so much as touch his hand when she got out o her kerridge  wal now comes the strange part o my story ruth was one o the kind that hes the gift o seein she was born with a veil over her face  this mysterious piece of physiological information about ruth was given with a look and air that announced something very profound and awful and we both took up the inquiry born with a veil over her face how should that make her see  wal boys how should i know but the fact is so theres those as is wal known as hes the gift o seein what others cant see they can see through walls and houses they can see peoples hearts they can see whats to come they dont know nothin how tis but this ere knowledge comes to em its a gret gift and that sorts born with the veil over their faces ruth was o these ere old granny badger she was the knowingest old nuss in all these parts and she was with ruths mother when she was born and she told lady lothrop all about it says she you may depend upon it that child ll have the secondsight says she oh that are fact was wal known wal that was the reason why jeff sullivan couldnt come it round ruth tho he was silkier than a milkweedpod and jest about as patient as a spider in his hole a watchin to get his grip on a fly ruth wouldnt argue with him and she wouldnt flout him but she jest shut herself up in herself and kept a lookout on him but she told your aunt lois jest what she thought about him  wal in about six months come the news that the gineral was dead he dropped right down in his tracks dead with apoplexy as if he had been shot and lady maxwell she writ a long letter to my lady and ruth ye see hed got to be sir thomas sullivan over there and he was a comin home to take em all over to england to live in grander wal my lady sullivan she was then ye see she took it drefful hard ef theyd a been the lovingest couple in the world she couldnt a took it harder aunt polly she said it was all cause she thought so much of him that she fit him so theres women that thinks so much o their husbands that they wont let em hev no peace o their life and i expect it war so with her poor soul any way she went right down smack when she heard he was dead she was abed sick when the news come and she never spoke nor smiled jest turned her back to everybody and kinder wilted and wilted and was dead in a week and there was poor little ruth left all alone in the world with neither kith nor kin but jeff  wal when the funeral was over and the time appinted to read the will and settle up matters there want no will to be found nowhere high nor low  lawyer dean he flew round like a parched pea on a shovel he said he thought he could a gone in the darkest night and put his hand on that ere will but when he went where he thought it was he found it warnt there and he knowed hed kep it under lock and key what he thought was the will turned out to be an old mortgage wal there was an awful row and a todo about it you may be sure ruth she jist said nothin good or bad and her not speakin made jeff a sight more uncomfortable than ef shed a hed it out with him he told her it shouldnt make no sort o difference that he should allers stand ready to give her all he hed if shed only take him with it and when it came to that she only gin him a look and went out o the room  jeff he flared and flounced and talked and went round and round a rumpussin among the papers but no will was forthcomin high or low wal now here comes whats remarkable ruth she told this ere all the particulars to yer aunt lois and lady lothrop she said that the night after the funeral she went up to her chamber ruth had the gret front chamber opposite to mis sullivans ive been in it it was a monstrous big room with outlandish furniture in it that the gineral brought over from an old palace out to italy and there was a great big lookinglass over the dressintable that they said come from venice that swung so that you could see the whole room in it wal she was a standin front o this jist goin to undress herself a hearin the rain drip on the leaves and the wind a whishin and whisperin in the old elmtrees and jist a thinkin over her lot and what should she do now all alone in the world when of a sudden she felt a kind o lightness in her head and she thought she seemed to see somebody in the glass a movin and she looked behind and there want nobody there then she looked forward in the glass and saw a strange big room that shed never seen before with a long painted winder in it and along side o this stood a tall cabinet with a good many drawers in it and she saw herself and knew that it was herself in this room along with another woman whose back was turned towards her she saw herself speak to this woman and pint to the cabinet she saw the woman nod her head she saw herself go to the cabinet and open the middle drawer and take out a bundle o papers from the very back end ont she saw her take out a paper from the middle and open it and hold it up and she knew that there was the missin will wal it all overcome her so that she fainted clean away and her maid found her a lyin front o the dressintable on the floor  she was sick of a fever for a week or fortnight ater and your aunt lois she was down takin care of her and as soon as she got able to be moved she was took out to lady lothrops jeff he was jist as attentive and good as he could be but she wouldnt bear him near her room if he so much as set a foot on the stairs that led to it shed know it and got so wild that he hed to be kept from comin into the front o the house but he was doin his best to buy up good words from everybody he paid all the servants double he kept every one in their places and did so well by em all that the genl word among em was that miss ruth couldnt do better than to marry such a nice openhanded gentleman  wal lady lothrop she wrote to lady maxwell all that hed happened and lady maxwell she sent over for ruth to come over and be a companion for her and said shed adopt her and be as a mother to her  wal then ruth she went over with some gentlefolks that was goin back to england and offered to see her safe and sound and so she was set down at lady maxwells manor it was a grand place she said and such as she never see beforelike them old gentry places in england and lady maxwell she made much of her and cosseted her up for the sake of what the old gineral had said about her and ruth she told her all her story and how she believed that the will was to be found somewhere and that she should be led to see it yet  she told her too that she felt it in her that capn oliver wasnt dead and that hed come back yet and lady maxwell she took up for her with might and main and said shed stand by her but then ye see so long as there warnt no will to be found there warnt nothin to be done jeff was the next heir and hed got every thing stock and lot and the estate in england into the bargain and folks was beginnin to think putty well of him as folks allers does when a body is up in the world and hes houses and lands lordy massy riches allers covers a multitude o sins  finally when ruth hed ben six months with her one day lady maxwell got to tellin her all about her history and what hed ben atween her and her cousin when they was young and how they hed a quarrel and he flung off to ameriky and all them things that it dont do folks no good to remember when its all over and cant be helped but she was a lone body and it seemed to do her good to talk about it  finally she says to ruth says she ill show you a room in this house you hant seen before it was the room where we hed that quarrel says she and the last i saw of him was there till he come back to die says she  so she took a gret key out of her bunch and she led ruth along a long passageway to the other end of the house and opened on a great library and the minute ruth came in she threw up her hands and gin a great cry oh says she this is the room and there is the window and there is the cabinet and there in that middle drawer at the back end in a bundle of papers is the will  and lady maxwell she said quite dazed go look says she and ruth went jest as she seed herself do and opened the drawer and drew forth from the back part a yellow pile of old letters and in the middle of those was the will sure enough ruth drew it out and opened it and showed it to her  wal you see that will give ruth the whole of the ginerals property in america tho it did leave the english estate to jeff  wal the end ont was like a storybook  jeff he made believe be mighty glad and he said it must a ben that the gineral hed got flustered with the sperit and water and put that ere will in among his letters that he was a doin up to take back to england for it was in among lady maxwells letters that she writ him when they was young and that hed a kep all these years and was a takin back to her  wal lawyer dean said he was sure that jeff made himself quite busy and useful that night a tyin up the papers with red tape and a packin the ginerals trunk and that when jeff gin him his bundle to lock up in his box he never mistrusted but what hed got it all right  wal you see it was jest one of them things that cant be known to the jedgmentday it might a ben an accident and then agin it might not and folks settled it one way or tother cordin to their pinion o jeff but ye see how mazin handy for him it happened why ef it hadnt ben for the providence ive ben a tellin about there it might a lain in them old letters that lady maxwell said she never hed the heart to look over it never would a turned up in the world  well said i what became of ruth oh capn oliver he came back all alive and escaped from the algerines and they was married in kings chapel and lived in the old sullivan house in peace and prosperity thats jest how the story was and now aunt lois can make what shes a mind ter out ont  and what became of jeff oh he started to go over to england and the ship was wrecked off the irish coast and that was the last of him he never got to his property  good enough for him said both of us wal i dont know twas pretty hard on jeff mebbe he did and mebbe he didnt im glad i warnt in his shoes tho id rather never hed nothin this ere hastin to be rich is sich a drefful temptation  wal now boys yeve done a nice lot o flax and i guess well go up to yer grandthers cellar and git a mug o cyder talkin always gits me dry  illustration tailpiece page 052  illustration the ministers housekeeper page 053      the ministers housekeeper  scenethe shady side of a blueberrypasturesam lawson with the boys picking blueberriessam loq  as you see boys twas just hereparson carryls wife she died along in the forepart o march my cousin huldy she undertook to keep house for him the way ont was that huldy she went to take care o mis carryl in the fust ont when she fust took sick huldy was a tailoress by trade but then she was one o these ere facultised persons that has a gift for most any thing and that was how mis carryl come to set sech store by her that when she was sick nothin would do for her but she must have huldy round all the time and the minister he said hed make it good to her all the same and she shouldnt lose nothin by it and so huldy she staid with mis carryl full three months afore she died and got to seein to every thing pretty much round the place  wal arter mis carryl died parson carryl hed got so kind o used to hevin on her round takin care o things that he wanted her to stay along a spell and so huldy she staid along a spell and poured out his tea and mended his close and made pies and cakes and cooked and washed and ironed and kep every thing as neat as a pin huldy was a drefful chipper sort o gal and work sort o rolled off from her like water off a ducks back there warnt no gal in sherburne that could put sich a sight o work through as huldy and yet sunday mornin she always come out in the singers seat like one o these ere june roses lookin so fresh and smilin and her voice was jest as clear and sweet as a meadow larkslordy massy i member how she used to sing some o them are places where the treble and counter used to go together her voice kind o trembled a little and it sort o went thro and thro a feller tuck him right where he lived  here sam leaned contemplatively back with his head in a clump of sweet fern and refreshed himself with a chew of young wintergreen this ere young wintergreen boys is jest like a fellers thoughts o things that happened when he was young it comes up jest so fresh and tender every year the longest time you hev to live and you cant help chawin ont tho tis sort o stingin i dont never get over likin young wintergreen  but about huldah sam  oh yes about huldy lordy massy when a feller is indianin round these ere pleasant summer days a fellers thoughts gits like a flock o young partridges theys up and down and everywhere cause one place is jest about as good as another when theys all so kind o comfortable and nice wal about huldyas i was a sayin she was jest as handsome a gal to look at as a feller could have and i think a nice wellbehaved young gal in the singers seat of a sunday is a means o grace its sort o drawin to the unregenerate you know why boys in them days ive walked ten miles over to sherburne of a sunday mornin jest to play the bassviol in the same singers seat with huldy she was very much respected huldy was and when she went out to tailorin she was allers bespoke six months ahead and sent for in waggins up and down for ten miles round for the young fellers was allers mazin anxious to be sent after huldy and was quite free to offer to go for her wal after mis carry died huldy got to be sort o housekeeper at the ministers and saw to every thing and did every thing so that there warnt a pin out o the way  but you know how tis in parishes there allers is women that thinks the ministers affairs belongs to them and they ought to have the rulin and guidin of em and if a ministers wife dies theres folks that allers has their eyes open on providenceslookin out whos to be the next one  now there was mis amaziah pipperidge a widder with snappin black eyes and a hook nosekind o like a hawk and she was one o them upanddown commandin sort o women that feel that they have a call to be seein to every thing that goes on in the parish and specially to the minister  folks did say that mis pipperidge sort o sot her eye on the parson for herself wal now that are might a been or it might not some folks thought it was a very suitable connection you see she hed a good property of her own right nigh to the ministers lot and was allers kind o active and busy so takin one thing with another i shouldnt wonder if mis pipperidge should a thought that providence pinted that way at any rate she went up to deakin blodgetts wife and they two sort o put their heads together a mournin and condolin about the way things was likely to go on at the ministers now mis carryl was dead ye see the parsons wife she was one of them women who hed their eyes everywhere and on every thing she was a little thin woman but tough as inger rubber and smart as a steel trap and there warnt a hen laid an egg or cackled but mis carryl was right there to see about it and she hed the garden made in the spring and the medders mowed in summer and the cider made and the corn husked and the apples got in the fall and the doctor he hednt nothin to do but jest sit stock still a meditatin on jerusalem and jericho and them things that ministers think about but lordy massy he didnt know nothin about where any thing he eat or drunk or wore come from or went to his wife jest led him round in temporal things and took care on him like a baby  wal to be sure mis carryl looked up to him in spirituals and thought all the world on him for there warnt a smarter minister no where round why when he preached on decrees and election they used to come clear over from south parish and west sherburne and old town to hear him and there was sich a row o waggins tied along by the meetinhouse that the stables was all full and all the hitchinposts was full clean up to the tavern so that folks said the doctor made the town look like a gineral traininday a sunday  he was gret on texts the doctor was when he hed a pint to prove hed jest go thro the bible and drive all the texts ahead o him like a flock o sheep and then if there was a text that seemed agin him why hed come out with his greek and hebrew and kind o chase it round a spell jest as ye see a fellar chase a contrary bellwether and make him jump the fence arter the rest i tell you there want no text in the bible that could stand agin the doctor when his blood was up the year arter the doctor was appinted to preach the lection sermon in boston he made such a figger that the brattlestreet church sent a committee right down to see if they couldnt get him to boston and then the sherburne folks they up and raised his salary ye see there aint nothin wakes folks up like somebody elses wantin what youve got wal that fall they made him a doctor o divinity at cambridge college and so they sot more by him than ever wal you see the doctor of course he felt kind o lonesome and afflicted when mis carryl was gone but railly and truly huldy was so up to every thing about house that the doctor didnt miss nothin in a temporal way his shirtbosoms was pleated finer than they ever was and them ruffles round his wrists was kep like the driven snow and there warnt a brack in his silk stockins and his shoe buckles was kep polished up and his coats brushed and then there warnt no bread and biscuit like huldys and her butter was like solid lumps o gold and there wernt no pies to equal hers and so the doctor never felt the loss o miss carryl at table then there was huldy allers opposite to him with her blue eyes and her cheeks like two fresh peaches she was kind o pleasant to look at and the more the doctor looked at her the better he liked her and so things seemed to be goin on quite quiet and comfortable ef it hadnt been that mis pipperidge and mis deakin blodgett and mis sawin got their heads together a talkin about things  poor man says mis pipperidge what can that child that hes got there do towards takin the care of all that place it takes a mature woman she says to tread in mis carryls shoes  that it does said mis blodgett and when things once get to runnin down hill there aint no stoppin on em says she  then mis sawin she took it up ye see mis sawin used to go out to dressmakin and was sort o jealous cause folks sot more by huldy than they did by her well says she huldy peters is well enough at her trade i never denied that though i do say i never did believe in her way o makin buttonholes and i must say if twas the dearest friend i hed that i thought huldy tryin to fit mis kittridges plumbcolored silk was a clear piece o presumption the silk was jist spiled so twarnt fit to come into the meetinhouse i must say huldys a gal thats always too ventersome about takin sponsibilities she dont know nothin about  of course she dont said mis deakin blodgett what does she know about all the lookin and seein to that there ought to be in guidin the ministers house huldys well meanin and shes good at her work and good in the singers seat but lordy massy she haint got no experience parson carryl ought to have an experienced woman to keep house for him theres the spring housecleanin and the fall housecleanin to be seen to and the things to be put away from the moths and then the gettin ready for the association and all the ministers meetins and the makin the soap and the candles and settin the hens and turkeys watchin the calves and seein after the hired men and the garden and there that are blessed man jist sets there at home as serene and has nobody round but that are gal and dont even know how things must be a runnin to waste  wal the upshot ont was they fussed and fuzzled and wuzzled till theyd drinked up all the tea in the teapot and then they went down and called on the parson and wuzzled him all up talkin about this that and tother that wanted lookin to and that it was no way to leave every thing to a young chit like huldy and that he ought to be lookin about for an experienced woman the parson he thanked em kindly and said he believed their motives was good but he didnt go no further he didnt ask mis pipperidge to come and stay there and help him nor nothin o that kind but he said hed attend to matters himself the fact was the parson had got such a likin for havin huldy round that he couldnt think o such a thing as swappin her off for the widder pipperidge  but he thought to himself huldy is a good girl but i oughtnt to be a leavin every thing to herits too hard on her i ought to be instructin and guidin and helpin of her cause taint everybody could be expected to know and do what mis carryl did and so at it he went and lordy massy didnt huldy hev a time ont when the minister began to come out of his study and want to tew round and see to things huldy you see thought all the world of the minister and she was most afraid to laugh but she told me she couldnt for the life of her help it when his back was turned for he wuzzled things up in the most singular way but huldy shed jest say yes sir and get him off into his study and go on her own way  huldy says the minister one day you aint experienced out doors and when you want to know any thing you must come to me  yes sir says huldy  now huldy says the parson you must be sure to save the turkeyeggs so that we can have a lot of turkeys for thanksgiving  yes sir says huldy and she opened the pantrydoor and showed him a nice dishful shed been a savin up wal the very next day the parsons henturkey was found killed up to old jim scroggss barn folks said scroggs killed it though scroggs he stood to it he didnt at any rate the scroggses they made a meal ont and huldy she felt bad about it cause shed set her heart on raisin the turkeys and says she oh dear i dont know what i shall do i was just ready to see set her  do huldy says the parson why theres the other turkey out there by the door and a fine bird too he is sure enough there was the old tomturkey a struttin and a sidlin and a quitterin and a floutin his tailfeathers in the sun like a lively young widower all ready to begin life over agin  but says huldy you know he cant set on eggs  he cant id like to know why says the parson he shall set on eggs and hatch em too  o doctor says huldy all in a tremble cause you know she didnt want to contradict the minister and she was afraid she should laughi never heard that a tomturkey would set on eggs  why they ought to said the parson getting quite arnest what else be they good for you just bring out the eggs now and put em in the nest and ill make him set on em  so huldy she thought there wernt no way to convince him but to let him try so she took the eggs out and fixed em all nice in the nest and then she come back and found old tom a skirmishin with the parson pretty lively i tell ye ye see old tom he didnt take the idee at all and he flopped and gobbled and fit the parson and the parsons wig got round so that his cue stuck straight out over his ear but hed got his blood up ye see the old doctor was used to carryin his pints o doctrine and he hadnt fit the arminians and socinians to be beat by a tomturkey so finally he made a dive and ketched him by the neck in spite o his floppin and stroked him down and put huldys apron round him  there huldy he says quite red in the face weve got him now and he travelled off to the barn with him as lively as a cricket  illustration huldy came behind chokin with laugh page 065  huldy came behind jist chokin with laugh and afraid the minister would look round and see her  now huldy well crook his legs and set him down says the parson when they got him to the nest you see he is getting quiet and hell set there all right  and the parson he sot him down and old tom he sot there solemn enough and held his head down all droopin lookin like a rail pious old cock as long as the parson sot by him  there you see how still he sets says the parson to huldy  huldy was most dyin for fear she should laugh im afraid hell get up says she when you do  oh no he wont says the parson quite confident there there says he layin his hands on him as if pronouncin a blessin but when the parson riz up old tom he riz up too and began to march over the eggs  stop now says the parson ill make him get down agin hand me that cornbasket well put that over him  so he crooked old toms legs and got him down agin and they put the cornbasket over him and then they both stood and waited  thatll do the thing huldy said the parson  i dont know about it says huldy  oh yes it will child i understand says he  just as he spoke the basket riz right up and stood and they could see old toms long legs  ill make him stay down confound him says the parson for ye see parsons is men like the rest on us and the doctor had got his spunk up  you jist hold him a minute and ill get something thatll make him stay i guess and out he went to the fence and brought in a long thin flat stone and laid it on old toms back  old tom he wilted down considerable under this and looked railly as if he was goin to give in he staid still there a good long spell and the minister and huldy left him there and come up to the house but they hadnt more than got in the door before they see old tom a hippin along as highsteppin as ever sayin talk talk and quitter quitter and struttin and gobblin as if hed come through the red sea and got the victory  oh my eggs says huldy im afraid hes smashed em  and sure enough there they was smashed flat enough under the stone  ill have him killed said the parson we wont have such a critter round  but the parson he slep ont and then didnt do it he only come out next sunday with a tiptop sermon on the riginal cuss that was pronounced on things in gineral when adam fell and showed how every thing was allowed to go contrary ever since there was pigweed and pusley and canady thistles cutworms and bagworms and cankerworms to say nothin of rattlesnakes the doctor made it very impressive and sort o improvin but huldy she told me goin home that she hardly could keep from laughin two or three times in the sermon when she thought of old tom a standin up with the cornbasket on his back  wal next week huldy she jist borrowed the ministers horse and sidesaddle and rode over to south parish to her aunt bascomeswidder bascomes you know that lives there by the troutbrookand got a lot o turkeyeggs o her and come back and set a hen on em and said nothin and in good time there was as nice a lot o turkeychicks as ever ye see  huldy never said a word to the minister about his experiment and he never said a word to her but he sort o kep more to his books and didnt take it on him to advise her  but not long arter he took it into his head that huldy ought to have a pig to be a fattin with the buttermilk mis pipperidge set him up to it and jist then old tim bigelow out to juniper hill told him if hed call over hed give him a little pig  so he sent for a man and told him to build a pigpen right out by the well and have it all ready when he came home with his pig  huldy she said she wished he might put a curb round the well out there because in the dark sometimes a body might stumble into it and the parson he told him he might do that  wal old aikin the carpenter he didnt come till most the middle of the arternoon and then he sort o idled so that he didnt get up the wellcurb till sundown and then he went off and said hed come and do the pigpen next day  wal arter dark parson carryl he driv into the yard full chizel with his pig hed tied up his mouth to keep him from squeelin and he see what he thought was the pigpenhe was rather nearsightedand so he ran and threw piggy over and down he dropped into the water and the minister put out his horse and pranced off into the house quite delighted  there huldy ive got you a nice little pig  dear me says huldy where have you put him  why out there in the pigpen to be sure  oh dear me says huldy thats the wellcurb there aint no pigpen built says she  lordy massy says the parson then ive thrown the pig in the well  illustration ive thrown the pig in the well page 070  wal huldy she worked and worked and finally she fished piggy out in the bucket but he was dead as a doornail and she got him out o the way quietly and didnt say much and the parson he took to a great hebrew book in his study and says he huldy i aint much in temporals says he huldy says she kind o felt her heart go out to him he was so sort o meek and helpless and lamed and says she wal parson carryl dont trouble your head no more about it ill see to things and sure enough a week arter there was a nice pen all shipshape and two little white pigs that huldy bought with the money for the butter she sold at the store  wal huldy said the parson you are a most amazin child you dont say nothin but you do more than most folks  arter that the parson set sich store by huldy that he come to her and asked her about every thing and it was amazin how every thing she put her hand to prospered huldy planted marigolds and larkspurs pinks and carnations all up and down the path to the front door and trained up mornin glories and scarletrunners round the windows and she was always a gettin a root here and a sprig there and a seed from somebody else for huldy was one o them that has the gift so that ef you jist give em the leastest sprig of any thing they make a great bush out of it right away so that in six months huldy had roses and geraniums and lilies sich as it would a took a gardener to raise the parson he took no notice at fust but when the yard was all ablaze with flowers he used to come and stand in a kind o maze at the front door and say beautiful beautiful why huldy i never see any thing like it and then when her work was done arternoons huldy would sit with her sewin in the porch and sing and trill away till shed draw the meadowlarks and the bobolinks and the orioles to answer her and the great big elmtree overhead would get perfectly rackety with the birds and the parson settin there in his study would git to kind o dreamin about the angels and golden harps and the new jerusalem but he wouldnt speak a word cause huldy she was jist like them woodthrushes she never could sing so well when she thought folks was hearin folks noticed about this time that the parsons sermons got to be like aarons rod that budded and blossomed there was things in em about flowers and birds and more special about the music o heaven and huldy she noticed that ef there was a hymn run in her head while she was round a workin the minister was sure to give it out next sunday you see huldy was jist like a bee she always sung when she was workin and you could hear her trillin now down in the cornpatch while she was pickin the corn and now in the buttery while she was workin the butter and now shed go singin down cellar and then shed be singin up over head so that she seemed to fill a house chock full o music  huldy was so sort o chipper and fair spoken that she got the hired men all under her thumb they come to her and took her orders jist as meek as so many calves and she traded at the store and kep the accounts and she hed her eyes everywhere and tied up all the ends so tight that there want no gettin round her she wouldnt let nobody put nothin off on parson carryl cause he was a minister huldy was allers up to anybody that wanted to make a hard bargain and afore he knew jist what he was about shed got the best end of it and everybody said that huldy was the most capable gal that theyd ever traded with  wal come to the meetin of the association mis deakin blodgett and mis pipperidge come callin up to the parsons all in a stew and offerin their services to get the house ready but the doctor he jist thanked em quite quiet and turned em over to huldy and huldy she told em that shed got every thing ready and showed em her pantries and her cakes and her pies and her puddins and took em all over the house and they went peekin and pokin openin cupboarddoors and lookin into drawers and they couldnt find so much as a thread out o the way from garret to cellar and so they went off quite discontented arter that the women set a new trouble a brewin then they begun to talk that it was a year now since mis carryl died and it rally wasnt proper such a young gal to be stayin there who everybody could see was a settin her cap for the minister  mis pipperidge said that so long as she looked on huldy as the hired gal she hadnt thought much about it but huldy was railly takin on airs as an equal and appearin as mistress o the house in a way that would make talk if it went on and mis pipperidge she driv round up to deakin abner snows and down to mis lijah perrys and asked them if they wasnt afraid that the way the parson and huldy was a goin on might make talk and they said they hadnt thought ont before but now come to think ont they was sure it would and they all went and talked with somebody else and asked them if they didnt think it would make talk so come sunday between meetins there warnt nothin else talked about and huldy saw folks a noddin and a winkin and a lookin arter her and she begun to feel drefful sort o disagreeable finally mis sawin she says to her my dear didnt you never think folk would talk about you and the minister  no why should they says huldy quite innocent  wal dear says she i think its a shame but they say youre tryin to catch him and that its so bold and improper for you to be courtin of him right in his own houseyou know folks will talki thought id tell you cause i think so much of you says she  huldy was a gal of spirit and she despised the talk but it made her drefful uncomfortable and when she got home at night she sat down in the morninglory porch quite quiet and didnt sing a word  the minister he had heard the same thing from one of his deakins that day and when he saw huldy so kind o silent he says to her why dont you sing my child  he hed a pleasant sort o way with him the minister had and huldy had got to likin to be with him and it all come over her that perhaps she ought to go away and her throat kind o filled up so she couldnt hardly speak and says she i cant sing tonight  says he you dont know how much good youre singin has done me nor how much good you have done me in all ways huldy i wish i knew how to show my gratitude  o sir says huldy is it improper for me to be here  no dear says the minister but illnatured folks will talk but there is one way we can stop it huldyif you will marry me youll make me very happy and ill do all i can to make you happy will you  wal huldy never told me jist what she said to the ministergals never does give you the particulars of them are things jist as youd like emonly i know the upshot and the hull ont was that huldy she did a considable lot o clear starchin and ironin the next two days and the friday o next week the minister and she rode over together to dr lothrops in old town and the doctor he jist made em man and wife spite of envy of the jews as the hymn says wal youd better believe there was a starin and a wonderin next sunday mornin when the second bell was a tollin and the minister walked up the broad aisle with huldy all in white arm in arm with him and he opened the ministers pew and handed her in as if she was a princess for you see parson carryl come of a good family and was a born gentleman and had a sort o grand way o bein polite to womenfolks wal i guess there was a ruslin among the bunnets mis pipperidge gin a great bounce like corn poppin on a shovel and her eyes glared through her glasses at huldy as if theyd a sot her afire and everybody in the meetin house was a starin i tell yew but they couldnt none of em say nothin agin huldys looks for there want a crimp nor a frill about her that want jis so and her frock was white as the driven snow and she had her bunnet all trimmed up with white ribbins and all the fellows said the old doctor had stole a march and got the handsomest gal in the parish  wal arter meetin they all come round the parson and huldy at the door shakin hands and laughin for by that time they was about agreed that theyd got to let putty well alone  why parson carryl says mis deakin blodgett how youve come it over us  yes says the parson with a kind o twinkle in his eye i thought says he as folks wanted to talk about huldy and me id give em somethin wuth talkin about  illustration tailpiece page 078  illustration the widows bandbox page 079     the widows bandbox  lordy massy stick yer hat into the noreast horace and see f ye cant stop out this ere wind im eeny most used up with it so spake sam lawson contemplating mournfully a new broadbrimmed straw hat in which my soul was rejoicing it was the dripping end of a sour november afternoon which closed up a spell o weather that had been steadily driving wind and rain for a week past and we boys sought the shelter and solace of his shop and opening the door let in the wind aforesaid  sam had been all day in one of his periodical fits of desperate industry the smoke and sparks had been seen flying out of his shopchimney in a frantic manner and the blows of his hammer had resounded with a sort of feverish persistence intermingled with a doleful wailing of psalmtunes of the most lugubrious description  these fits of industry on sams part were an affliction to us boys especially when they happened to come on saturday for sam was as much a part of our saturdayafternoon calculations as if we had a regular deed of property in him and we had been all day hanging round his shop looking in from time to time in the vague hope that he would propose something to brighten up the dreary monotony of a holiday in which it had been impossible to go anywhere or do any thing  sam aint you coming over to tell us some stories tonight  bless your soul and body boys life aint made to be spent tellin stories why i shall hev to be up here workin till arter twelve oclock said sam who was suddenly possessed with a spirit of the most austere diligence here i be up to my neck in workthings kind o comin in a heap together theres mis capn broads andirons she sent word she must have em

sometimes sweatin and not gettin yer bread that eres what i call the cuss the riginal cuss that come on man for hearkenin to the voice o his wifethat ere was what did it it allers kind o riles me up with mother eve when i think ont the women haint no bisness to fret as they do cause they sot this ere state o things goin in the fust place  but sam aunt lois and aunt nabby are both going over to mis mehitabels to tea now you just come over and eat supper with us and tell us a story do  gone out to tea be they said sam relaxing his hammering with a brightening gleam stealing gradually across his lanky visage wal that ere looks like a providential openin to be sure wal i guess ill come whats the use o never havin a good time ef you work yourself up into shoestrings you dont get no thanks for it and things in this worlds bout as broad as they is long the women ll scold turn em which way ye will a good mug o cider and some cold victuals over to the deakins ll kind o comfort a feller up and your granny shes sort o merciful she dont rub it into a fellow all the time like miss lois  now lets see boys said sam when a comfortable meal of pork and beans had been disposed of and a mug of cider was set down before the fire to warm i spect yell like to hear a downeast story tonight  of course we did and tumbled over each other in our eagerness to get the nearest place to the narrator  sams method of telling a story was as leisurely as that of some modern novelwriters he would take his time for it and proceed by easy stages it was like the course of a dreamy slowmoving river through a tangled meadowflatnot a rush nor a bush but was reflected in it in short sam gave his philosophy of matters and things in general as he went along and was especially careful to impress an edifying moral  wal ye see boys ye know i was born down to newportthere where its all ships and shipping and sich my old mother she kep a boardinhouse for sailors down there wal ye see i rolled and tumbled round the world pretty considable afore i got settled down here in oldtown  ye see my mother she wanted to bind me out to a blacksmith but i kind o sort o didnt seem to take to it it was kind o hard work and boys is apt to want to take life easy wal i used to run off to the seashore and lie stretched out on them rocks there and look off on to the water and it did use to look so sort o blue and peaceful and the ships come a sailin in and out so sort o easy and natural that i felt as if that ared be jest the easiest kind o life a fellow could have all he had to do was to get aboard one o them ships and be off seekin his fortin at tother end o the rainbow where gold grows on bushes and theres valleys o diamonds  so nothin would do but i gin my old mother the slip and away i went to sea with my duds tied up in a hankercher  i tell ye what boys ef ye want to find an easy life dont ye never go to sea i tell ye life on shipboard aint what it looks to be on shore i hadnt been aboard moren three hours afore i was the sickest critter that ever ye did see and i tell you i didnt get no kind o compassion capns and mates they allers thinks boys haint no kind o business to have no bowels nor nothin and they put it on em sick or well its jest a kick here and a cuff there and a twitch by the ear in tother place one a shovin on em this way and another hittin on em a clip and all growlin from mornin to night i believe the way my ears got so long was bein hauled out o my berth by em that ares a sailors regular way o wakin up a boy  wal by time i got to the penobscot country all i wanted to know was how to get back agin that ares jest the way folks go all their lives boys its all fuss fuss and stew stew till ye get somewhere and then its fuss fuss and stew stew to get back agin jump here and scratch yer eyes out and jump there and scratch em in aginthat ares life  wal i kind o poked round in penobscot country till i got a berth on the brilliant that was lyin at camden goin to sail to boston  ye see the brilliant she was a tight little sloop in the government service twas in the wartimes ye see and commodore tucker that is now he was capn tucker then he had the command on herused to run up and down all the coast takin observations o the british and keepin his eye out on em and givin on em a nip here and a clip there cordin as he got a good chance why your grandther knew old commodore tucker it was he that took dr franklin over minister to france and dodged all the british vessels right in the middle o the war i tell you that are was like runnin through the drops in a thundershower he got chased by the british ships pretty considable but he was too spry for em arter the war was over commodore tucker took over john adams our fust minister to england a drefful smart man the commodore was but he most like to a ben took in this ere time im a tellin ye about and all cause he was sort o softhearted to the women tom toothacre told me the story tom he was the one that got me the berth on the ship ye see i used to know tom at newport and once when he took sick there my mother nussed him up and that was why tom was friends with me and got me the berth and kep me warm in it too tom he was one of your rael maine boys thats hatched out so to speak in water like ducks he was born away down there on harpswell pint and they say if ye throw one o them harpswell babies into the sea hell take to it nateral and swim like a cork ef they hit their heads agin a rock it only dents the rock but dont hurt the baby tom he was a great character on the ship he could see farther and knew more bout wind and water than most folks the officers took toms judgment and the men all went by his say my mother she chalked a streak o good luck for me when she nussed up tom  wal we wus a lyin at camden there one arternoon goin to sail for boston that night it was a sort o soft pleasant arternoon kind o still and there want nothin a goin on but jest the hens a crawcrawin and a histin up one foot and holdin it a spell cause they didnt know when to set it down and the geese a sissin and a pickin at the grass ye see camden wasnt nothin of a placetwas jest as if somebody had emptied out a pocketful o houses and forgot em there wernt nothin a stirrin or goin on and so we was all took aback when bout four oclock in the arternoon there come a boat alongside with a tall elegant lady in it all dressed in deep mournin she rared up sort o princesslike and come aboard our ship and wanted to speak to capn tucker where she come from or what she wanted or where she was goin to we none on us knew she kep her veil down so we couldnt get sight o her face all was she must see capn tucker alone right away  wal capn tucker he was like the generality o capns he was up to bout every thing that any man could do but it was pretty easy for a woman to come it over him ye see capns they dont see women as men do ashore they dont have enough of em to get tired on em and every womans an angel to a seacapn anyway the capn he took her into his cabin and he sot her a chair and was her humble servant to command and what would she have of him and we was all a winkin and a nudgin each other and a peekin to see what was to come o it and she see it and so she asks in a sort o princess way to speak to the capn alone and so the doors was shut and we was left to our own ideas and a wonderin what it was all to be about  wal you see it come out arterwards all about what went on and things went this way jest as soon as the doors was shut and she was left alone with the capn she busted out a cryin and a sobbin fit to break her heart  wal the capn he tried to comfort her up but no she wouldnt be comforted but went on a weepin and a wailin and a wringin on her hands till the poor capns heart was amost broke for the capn was the tenderesthearted critter that could be and couldnt bear to see a child or a woman in trouble noways  o capn said she im the most unfortunate woman im all alone in the world says she and i dont know whatll become of me ef you dont keep me says she  wal the capn thought it was time to run up his colors and so says he maam im a married man and love my wife says he and so i can feel for all women in distress says he  oh well then says sheyou can feel for me and know how to pity me my dear husbands just died suddenly when he was up the river he was took with the fever in the woods i nussed him day and night says she but he died there in a misable little hut far from home and friends says she and ive brought his body down with me hopin providence would open some way to get it back to our home in boston and now capn you must help me  then the capn see what she was up to and he hated to do it and tried to cut her off o askin but she want to be put off  now capn says she ef youll take me and the body o my husband on board tonight id be willin to reward you to any amount money would be no object to me says she  wal you see the capn he kind o hated to do it and he hemmed and hawed and he tried to pologize he said twas a government vessel and he didnt know as he had a right to use it he said sailors was apt to be superstitious and he didnt want em to know as there was a corpse on board  wal says she why need they know for you see she was up to every dodge and she said shed come along with it at dusk in a box and have it just carried to a stateroom and he neednt tell nobody what it was  wal capn tucker he hung off and he tried his best to persuade her to have a funeral all quiet there at camden he promised to get a minister and tend to it and wait a day till it was all over and then take her on to boston free gratis but twas all no go she wouldnt hear a word to t and she reeled off the talk to him by the yard and when talk failed she took to her waterworks again till finally the capn said his resolution was clean washed away and he jest give up hook and line and so twas all settled and arranged that when evening come she was to be alongside with her boat and took aboard  when she come out o the capns room to go off i see tom toothacre a watchin on her he stood there by the railins a shavin up a plug o baccy to put in his pipe he didnt say a word but he sort o took the measure o that are woman with his eye and kept a follerin on her  she had a fine sort o lively look carried her head up and shoulders back and stepped as if she had steel springs in her heels  wal tom what do ye say to her says ben bowdin  i dont say nothin says tom and he lit his pipe taint my busness says he  wal what do you think says ben tom gin a hist to his trousers  my thoughts is my own says he and i calculate to keep em to myself says he and then he jest walked to the side of the vessel and watched the woman a gettin ashore there was a queer kind o look in toms eye  wal the capn he was drefful sort o oneasy arter she was gone he had a long talk in the cabin with mr more the fust officer and there was a sort o stir aboard as if somethin was a goin to happen we couldnt jest say what it was  sometimes it seems as if when things is goin to happen a body kind o feels em comin in the air we boys was all that way o course we didnt know nothin bout what the woman wanted or what she come for or whether she was comin agin n fact we didnt know nothin about it and yet we sort o expected suthin to come o it and suthin did come sure enough  come on night jest at dusk we see a boat comin alongside and there sure enough was the lady in it  there shes comin agin says i to tom toothacre  yes and brought her baggage with her says tom and he pinted down to a long narrow pine box that was in the boat beside her  jest then the capn called on mr more and he called on tom toothacre and among em they lowered a tackle and swung the box aboard and put it in the stateroom right alongside the capns cabin  the lady she thanked the capn and mr more and her voice was jest as sweet as any nightingale and she went into the stateroom arter they put the body in and was gone ever so long with it the capn and mr more they stood a whisperin to each other and every once in a while theyd kind o nod at the door where the lady was  wal by and by she come out with her hankerchief to her eyes and come on deck and begun talkin to the capn and mr more and a wishin all kinds o blessins on their heads  wal tom toothacre didnt say a word good or bad but he jest kep a lookin at her watchin her as a cat watches a mouse finally we up sail and started with a fair breeze the lady she kep a walkin up and down up and down and every time she turned on her heel i saw tom a lookin arter her and kind o noddin to himself  what makes you look arter her so tom says i to him  cause i think she wants lookin arter says tom whats more says he if the capn dont look sharp arter her the devil ll have us all afore mornin i tell ye sam theres mischief under them petticuts  why what do ye think says i  think i dont think i knows that ares no gal nor widder neither if my names tom toothacre look at her walk look at the way she turns on her heel i ive been a watchin on her there aint no woman livin with a step like that says he  wal who should the critter be then says i  wal says tom ef that are aint a british naval officer i lose my bet ive been used to the ways on em and i knows their build and their step  and what do you suppose shes got in that long box says i  what has she got says tom wal folks might say none o my bisness but i spects itll turn out some o my bisness and yourn too if he dont look sharp arter it says tom its no good that are box aint  why dont you speak to mr more says i  wal you see shes a chipperin round and a makin herself agreeable to both on em you see she dont mean to give nobody any chance for a talk with em but ive got my eye on her for all that you see i haint no sort o disposition to sarve out a time on one o them british prisonships says tom toothacre it might be almighty handy for them british to have the brilliant for a coastvessel says he but ye see it cant be spared jest yet so madam says heive got my eye on you  wal tom was as good as his word for when mr more came towards him at the wheel tom he up and says to him mr more says he that are big box in the stateroom yonder wants lookin into  tom was a sort o privileged character and had a way o speakin up that the officers took in good part cause they knew he was a fustrate hand  wal mr more he looks mysterious and says he tom do the boys know whats in that are box  i bet they dont says tom if they had you wouldnt a got em to help it aboard  wal you see poor woman says mr more to tom she was so distressed she wanted to get her husbands body to boston and there want no other way and so the capn let it come aboard he didnt want the boys to suspect what it really was  husbands body be hanged said tom guess that are corpse aint so dead but what therell be a resurrection afore mornin if it aint looked arter says he  why what do you mean tom said mr more all in a blue maze  i mean that are gal thats ben a switchin her petticuts up and down our deck aint no gal at all that ares a british officer mr more you give my duty to the capn and tell him to look into his widders bandbox and see what hell find there  wal the mate he went and had a talk with the capn and they greed between em that mr more was to hold her in talk while the capn went and took observations in the stateroom  so down the capn goes into the stateroom to give a look at the box wal he finds the stateroom door all locked to be sure and my lady had the key in her pocket but then the capn he had a master key to it and so he puts it in and opens the door quite softly and begins to take observations  sure enough he finds that the screws had been drawed from the top o the box showin that the widder had been a tinkerin ont when they thought she was a cryin over it and then lookin close he sees a bit o twine goin from a crack in the box out o the winder and up on deck  wal the capn he kind o got in the sperit o the thing and he thought hed jest let the widder play her play out and see what it would come to so he jest calls tom toothacre down to him and whispered to him tom says he you jest crawl under the berth in that are stateroom and watch that are box and tom said he would  so tom creeps under the berth and lies there still as a mouse and the capn he slips out and turns the key in the door so that when madam comes down she shouldnt spect nothin  putty soon sure enough tom heard the lock rattle and the young widder come in and then he heard a bit o conversation between her and the corpse  what time is it come in a kind o hoarse whisper out o the box  well bout nine oclock says she  how long afore youll let me out says he  oh i you must have patience says she till theyre all gone off to sleep when there aint but one man up i can knock him down says she and then ill pull the string for you  the devil you will maam says tom to himself under the berth  well its darned close here says the fellow in the box he didnt say darned boys but he said a wickeder word that i cant repeat noways said sam in a parenthesis these ere british officers was drefful swearin critters  you must have patience a while longer says the lady till i pull the string tom toothacre lay there on his back a laughin  is every thing goin on right says the man in the box  all straight says she there dont none of em suspect  you bet says tom toothacre under the berth and he said he had the greatest mind to catch the critter by the feet as she was a standin there but somehow thought it would be better fun to see the thing through cording as theyd planned it  wal then she went off switchin and mincin up to the deck agin and a flirtin with the capn for you see twas greed to let em play their play out  wal tom he lay there a waitin and he waited and waited and waited till he most got asleep but finally he heard a stirrin in the box as if the fellah was a gettin up tom he jest crawled out still and kerful and stoodup tight agin the wall putty soon he hears a grunt and he sees the top o the box a risin up and a man jest gettin out ont mighty still  wal tom he waited till he got fairly out on to the floor and had his hand on the lock o the door when he jumps on him and puts both arms round him and gin him a regular bears hug  why whats this says the man  guess yell find out darn ye says tom toothacre so ye wanted our ship did ye wal ye jest cant have our ship says tom says he and i tell you he jest run that are fellow up stairs licketysplit for tom was strong as a giant  the fust thing they saw was mr more hed got the widder by both arms and was tying on em behind her ye see madam your games up says mr more but well give ye a free passage to boston tho says he we wanted a couple o prisoners about these days and youll do nicely  the fellers they was putty chopfallen to be sure and the one in womens clothes specially cause when he was found out he felt foolish enough in his petticuts but they was both took to boston and given over as prisoners  ye see come to look into matters they found these two young fellows british officers had formed a regular plot to take capn tuckers vessel and run it into halifax and ye see capn tucker he was so sort o spry and knew all the maine coast so well and was so cute at dodgin in and out all them little bays and creeks and places all long shore that he made the british considerable trouble cause wherever they didnt want him thats where he was sure to be  so theyd hatched up this ere plan there was one or two british sailors had been and shipped aboard the brilliant a week or two aforehand and twas suspected they was to have helped in the plot if thngs had gone as they laid out but i tell you when the fellows see which way the cat jumped they took pretty good care to say that they hadnt nothin to do with it oh no by no manner o means wal o course ye know it couldnt be proved on em and so we let it go  but i tell you capn tucker he felt pretty cheap about his widder the worst ont was they do say maam tucker got hold of it and you might know if a woman got hold of a thing like that shed use it as handy as a cat would her claws the women they cant no more help hittin a fellow a clip and a rap when theyve fairly got him than a cat when shes ketched a mouse and so i shouldnt wonder if the commodore heard something about his widder every time he went home from his vyages the longest day he had to live i dont know nothin bout it ye know i only kind o jedge by what looks as human natur goes  but lordy massy boys t want nothin to be shamed of in the capn folks ll have to answer for wus things at the last day than tryin to do a kindness to a poor widder now i tell you its better to be took in doin a good thing than never try to do good and its my settled opinion said sam taking up his mug of cider and caressing it tenderly its my humble opinion that the best sort o folks is the easiest took in specially by the women i reely dont think i should a done a bit better myself  illustration tailpiece page 102  illustration captain kidds money page 108     captain kidds money  one of our most favorite legendary resorts was the old barn sam lawson preferred it on many accounts it was quiet and retired that is to say at such distance from his own house that he could not hear if hepsy called ever so loudly and farther off than it would be convenient for that industrious and painstaking woman to follow him then there was the soft fragrant cushion of hay on which his length of limb could be easily bestowed our barn had an upper loft with a swinging outer door that commanded a view of the old mill the waterfall and the distant windings of the river with its grassy green banks its graceful elm draperies and its white flocks of waterlilies and then on this saturday afternoon we had sam all to ourselves it was a drowsy dreamy october day when the hens were lazily craw crawing in a soft conversational undertone with each other as they scratched and picked the hayseed under the barn windows below in the barn black cæsar sat quietly hatchelling flax sometimes gurgling and giggling to himself with an overflow of that interior jollity with which he seemed to be always full the african in new england was a curious contrast to everybody around him in the joy and satisfaction that he seemed to feel in the mere fact of being alive every white person was glad or sorry for some appreciable cause in the past present or future which was capable of being definitely stated but black cæsar was in an eternal giggle and frizzle and simmer of enjoyment for which he could give no earthly reason he was an embodied joy like shelleys skylark  jest hear him said sam lawson looking pensively over the haymow and strewing hayseed down on his wool how that are critter seems to tickle and laugh all the while bout nothin lordy massy he dont seem never to consider that this lifes a dream an empty show  look here sam we broke in anxious to cut short a threatened stream of morality you promised to tell us about capt kidd and how you dug for his money  did i now wal boys that are history o kidds is a warnin to fellers why kidd had pious parents and bible and sanctuary privileges when he was a boy and yet come to be hanged its all in this ere song im a goin to sing ye lordy massy i wish i had my bassviol nowcæsar he said calling down from his perch cant you strike the pitch o capn kidd on your fiddle  cæsars fiddle was never far from him it was in fact tucked away in a nice little nook just over the manger and he often caught an interval from his work to scrape a dancingtune on it keeping time with his heels to our great delight  a most wailing minorkeyed tune was doled forth which seemed quite refreshing to sams pathetic vein as he sang in his most lugubrious tones       my name was robert kidd          as i sailed as i sailed      my name was robert kidd      gods laws i did forbid      and so wickedly i did          as i sailed as i sailed  now ye see boys hes a goin to tell how he abused his religious privileges just hear now       my father taught me well          as i sailed as i sailed      my father taught me well      to shun the gates of hell      but yet i did rebel          as i sailed as i sailed       he put a bible in my hand          as i sailed as i sailed      he put a bible in my hand      and i sunk it in the sand      before i left the strand          as i sailed as i sailed  did ye ever hear o such a hardened contrary critter boys its awful to think on wal ye see that ares the way fellers allers begin the ways o sin by turnin their backs on the bible and the advice o pious parents now hear what he come to       then i murdered william more          as i sailed as i sailed      i murdered william more      and left him in his gore      not many leagues from shore          as i sailed as i sailed       to execution dock          i must go i must go      to execution dock      while thousands round me flock      to see me on the block          i must go i must go  there was a good deal more ont said sam pausing but i dont seem to remember it but its real solemn and affectin  who was capt kidd sam said i  wal he was an officer in the british navy and he got to bein a pirate used to take ships and sink em and murder the folks and so they say he got no end o moneygold and silver and precious stones as many as the wise men in the east but ye see what good did it all do him he couldnt use it and darsnt keep it so he used to bury it in spots round here and there in the awfullest heathen way ye ever heard of why they say he allers used to kill one or two men or women or children of his prisoners and bury with it so that their sperits might keep watch on it ef anybody was to dig arter it that are thing has been tried and tried and tried but no man nor mothers son on em ever got a cent that dug twas tried heren oldtown and they come pretty nigh gettin ont but it gin em the slip ye see boys its the devils money and he holds a pretty tight grip ont  well how was it about digging for it tell us did you do it were you there did you see it and why couldnt they get it we both asked eagerly and in one breath  why lordy massy boys your questions tumbles over each other thick as martins out o a martinbox now you jest be moderate and let alone and ill tell you all about it from the beginnin to the end i didnt railly have no hand int though i was knowin to t as i be to most things that goes on round here but my conscience wouldnt railly a let me start on no sich undertakin  wal the one that fust sot the thing a goin was old mother hokum that used to live up in that little tumbledown shed by the cranberrypond up beyond the spring pastur they had a putty bad name them hokums how they got a livin nobody knew for they didnt seem to pay no attention to raisin nothin but childun but the duce knows there was plenty o them their old hut was like a rabbitpen there was a towhead to every crack and cranny member what old cæsar said once when the word come to the store that old hokum had got twins spose de lord knows best says cæsar but i thought dere was hokums enough afore wal even poor workin industrious folks like me finds its hard gettin along when theres so many mouths to feed lordy massy there dont never seem to be no end ont and so it aint wonderful come to think ont ef folks like them hokums gets tempted to help along in ways that aint quite right anyhow folks did use to think that old hokum was too sort o familiar with their woodpiles long in the night though they couldnt never prove it on him and when mother hokum come to houses round to wash folks use sometimes to miss pieces here and there though they never could find em on her then they was allers a gettin in debt here and a gottin in debt there why they got to owin two dollars to joe gidger for butchers meat joe was sort o goodnatured and let em have meat cause hokum he promised so fair to pay but he couldnt never get it out o him member once joe walked clear up to the cranberrypond artor that are two dollars but mother hokum she see him a comin jest as he come past the juniperbush on the corner she says to hokum get into bed old man quick and let me tell the story says she so she covered him up and when gidger come in she come up to him and says she why mr gidger im jest ashamed to see yo why mr hokum was jest a comin down to pay yo that are money last week but ye see he was took down with the smallpoxjoe didnt hear no mow he just turned round and he streaked it out that are door with his coattails flyin out straight ahind him and old mother hokum she jest stood at the window holdin her sides and laughin fit to split to see him run that ares jest a sample o the ways them hokums cut up  wal you see boys theres a queer kind o rock down on the bank o the river that looks sort o like a gravestone the biggest part ont is sunk down under ground and its pretty well growed over with blackberryvines but when you scratch the bushes away they used to make out some queer marks on that are rock they was sort o lines and crosses and folks would have it that them was kidds private marks and that there was one o the places where he hid his money  wal theres no sayin fairly how it come to be thought so but fellers used to say so and they used sometimes to talk it over to the tahvern and kind o wonder whether or no if they should dig they wouldnt come to suthin  wal old mother hokum she heard ont and she was a sort o enterprisin old crittur fact was she had to be cause the young hokums was jest like bagworms the more they growed the more they eat and i expect she found it pretty hard to fill their mouths and so she said ef there was any thing under that are rock theyd as goods have it as the devil and so she didnt give old hokum no peace o his life but he must see what there was there  wal i was with em the night they was a talkin ont up ye see hokum he got thirtyseven cents worth o lemons and sperit i see him goin by as i was out a splittin kindlins and says he sam you jest go long up to our house tonight says he toddy whitney and harry wiggins comin up and were goin to have a little suthin hot says he and he kind o showed me the lemons and sperit and i told him i guessed i would go long wal i kind o wanted to see what theyd be up to ye know  wal come to find out they was a talkin about capn kidds treasures and layin out how they should get it and a settin one another on with gret stories about it  ive heard that there was whole chists full o gold guineas says one  and ive heard o gold bracelets and earrings and fingerrings all sparklin with diamonds says another  maybe its old silver plate from some o them old west indian grandees says another  wal whatever it is says mother hokum i want to be into it says she  wal sam wont you jine says they  wal boys says i i kind o dont feel jest like jinin i sort o aint clear about the rights ont seems to me its mighty nigh like goin to the devil for money  wal says mother hokum what if tis moneys money get it how ye will and the devils money ll buy as much meat as any id go to the devil if he gave good money  wal i guess i wouldnt says i dont you member the sermon parson lothrop preached about hastin to be rich last sabba day  parson lothrop be hanged says she wal now says she i like to see a parson with his silk stockins and great goldheaded cane a lollopin on his carriage behind his fat prancin hosses comin to meetin to preach to us poor folks not to want to be rich howd he like it to have fortyleven children and nothin to put onto em or into em i wonder guess if lady lothrop had to rub and scrub and wear her fingers to the bone as i do shed want to be rich and i guess the parson if he couldnt get a bellyful for a week would be for diggin up kidds money or doing most any thing else to make the pot bile  wal says i ill kind o go with ye boys and sort o see how things turn out but i guess i wont take no shere int says i  wal they got it all planned out they was to wait till the full moon and then they was to get primus king to go with em and help do the diggin ye see hokum and toddy whitney and wiggin are all putty softly fellers and hate dreffully to work and i tell you the kidd money aint to be got without a pretty tough piece o diggin why its jest like diggin a well to get at it now primus king was the master hand for diggin wells and so they said theyd get him by givin on him a shere  harry wiggin he didnt want no nigger a sherin in it he said but toddy and hokum they said that when there was such stiff diggin to be done they didnt care if they did go in with a nigger  wal wiggin he said he hadnt no objection to havin the nigger do the diggin it was sherin the profits he objected to  wal says hokum you cant get him without says he primus knows too much says he you cant fool him finally they greed that they was to give primus twenty dollars and shere the treasure mong themselves  come to talk with primus he wouldnt stick in a spade unless theyd pay him aforehand ye see primus was up to em he knowed about gidger and there want none on em that was particular good pay and so they all jest hed to rake and scrape and pay him down the twenty dollars among em and they greed for the fust full moon at twelve oclock at night the 9th of october  wal ye see i had to tell hepsy i was goin out to watch wal so i was but not jest in the way she took it but lordy massy a feller has to tell his wife suthin to keep her quiet ye know specially hepsy  wal wal of all the moonlight nights that ever i did see i never did see one equal to that why you could see the color o every thing i member i could see how the huckleberrybushes on the rock was red as blood when the moonlight shone through em cause the leaves you see had begun to turn  goin on our way we got to talkin about the sperits  i aint afraid on em says hokum what harm can a sperit do me says he i dont care ef theres a dozen on em and he took a swig at his bottle  oh there aint no sperits says harry wiggin that are talks all nonsense and he took a swig at his bottle  wal says toddy i dont know bout that are me and ike sanders has seen the sperits in the capn brown house we thought wed jest have a peek into the window one night and there was a whole flock o black colts without no heads on come rushin on us and knocked us flat  i expect youd been at the tahvern said hokum  wal yes we had but them was sperits we want drunk now we was jest as sober as ever we was  wal they wont get away my money says primus for i put it safe away in dinahs teapot afore i come out and then he showed all his ivories from ear to ear i think all this ares sort o foolishness says primus  wal says i boys i aint a goin to have no part or lot in this ere matter but ill jest lay it off to you how its to be done ef kidds money is under this rock theres sperits that watch it and you mustnt give em no advantage there mustnt be a word spoke from the time ye get sight o the treasure till ye get it safe up on to firm ground says i ef ye do itll vanish right out o sight ive talked with them that has dug down to it and seen it but they allers lost it cause theyd call out and say suthin and the minute they spoke away it went  wal so they marked off the ground and primus he begun to dig and the rest kind o sot round it was so still it was kind o solemn ye see it was past twelve oclock and every critter in oldtown was asleep and there was two whippoorwills on the great capn brown elmtrees that kep a answerin each other back and forward sort o solitary like and then every once in a while thered come a sort o strange whisper up among the elmtree leaves jest as if there was talkin goin on and every time primus struck his spade into the ground it sounded sort o holler jest as if hed been a diggin a grave its kind o melancholy says i to think o them poor critters that had to be killed and buried jest to keep this ere treasure what awful things ll be brought to light in the judgment day them poor critters they loved to live and hated to die as much as any on us but no they hed to die jest to satisfy that critters wicked will ive heard them as thought they could tell the capn kidd places by layin their ear to the ground at midnight and theyd hear groans and wailins  why sam were there really people who could tell where kidds money was i here interposed  oh sartin why yis there was shebna basconx he was one shebna could always tell what was under the earth hed cut a hazelstick and hold it in his hand when folks was wantin to know where to dig wells and that are stick would jest turn in his hand and pint down till it would fairly grind the bark off and ef you dug in that place you was sure to find a spring oh yis shebna hes told many where the kidd money was and been with em when they dug for it but the pester ont was they allers lost it cause they would some on em speak afore they thought  but sam what about this digging lets know what came of it said we as sam appeared to lose his way in his story  wal ye see they dug down about five feet when primus he struck his spade smack on something that chincked like iron  illustration they dug down about five feet page 119  wal then hokum and toddy whitney was into the hole in a minute they made primus get out and they took the spade cause they wanted to be sure to come on it themselves  wal they begun and they dug and he scraped and sure enough they come to a gret iron pot as big as your grannys dinnerpot with an iron bale to it  wal then they put down a rope and he put the rope through the handle then hokum and toddy they clambered upon the bank and all on em began to draw up jest as still and silent as could be they drawed and they drawed till they jest got it even with the ground when toddy spoke out all in a tremble there says he weve got it and the minit he spoke they was both struck by suthin that knocked em clean over and the rope give a crack like a pistolshot and broke short off and the pot went down down down and they heard it goin jink jink jink and it went way down into the earth and the ground closed over it and then they heard the screechinest laugh ye ever did hear  i want to know sam did you see that pot i exclaimed at this part of the story  wal no i didnt ye see i jest happened to drop asleep while they was diggin i was so kind o tired and i didnt wake up till it was all over  i was waked up cause there was considable of a scuffle for hokum was so mad at toddy for speakin that he was a fistin on him and old primus he jest hawhawed and laughed wal i got my money safe anyhow says he  wal come to says i taint no use cryin for spilt milk youve jest got to turn in now and fill up this ere hole else the selectmen ll be down on ye  wal says primus i didnt engage to fill up no holes and he put his spade on his shoulder and trudged off  wal it was putty hard work fillin in that hole but hokum and toddy and wiggin had to do it cause they didnt want to have everybody a laughin at em and i kind o tried to set it home to em showin on em that twas all for the best  ef youd a been left to get that are money thered a come a cuss with it says i it shows the vanity o hastin to be rich  oh you shet up says hokum says he you never hasted to any thing says he ye see he was riled thats why he spoke so  sam said we after maturely reflecting over the story what do you suppose was in that pot  lordy massy boys ye never will be done askin questions why how should i know  illustration mis elderkins pitcher page 122     mis elderkins pitcher  ye see boys said sam lawson as we were gathering young wintergreen on a sunny hillside in juneye see folks dont allers know what their marcies is when they sees em folks is kind o blinded and when a providence comes along they dont seem to know how to take it and they growl and grumble about what turns out the best things that ever happened to em in their lives its like mis elderkins pitcher  what about mis elderkins pitcher said both of us in one breath  didnt i never tell ye now said sam why i wanter know  no we were sure he never had told us and sam as usual began clearing the ground by a thorough introduction with statistical expositions  wal ye see mis elderkin she lives now over to sherburne in about the handsomest house in sherburnea high white house with green blinds and white pillars in frontand she rides out in her own kerridge and mr elderkin he s a deakin in the church and a colonel in the malitia and a slectman and pretty much atop every thing there is goin in sherburne and it all come of that are pitcher  what pitcher we shouted in chorus  lordy massy that are s jest what im a goin to tell you about but ye see a fellers jest got to make a beginnin to all things  mis elderkin she thinks shes a gret lady nowadays i spose but i member when she was miry brown over here n oldtown and i used to be waitin on her to singingschool  miry and i was putty good friends along in them dayswe was putty considable kind o intimate fact is boys there was times in them days when i thought whether or no i wouldnt take miry myself said sam his face growing luminous with the pleasing idea of his former masculine attractions and privileges yis he continued there was a time when folks said i could a hed miry ef id asked her and i putty much think so myself but i didnt say nothin marriage is allers kind oventursome an miry had such upanddown kind o ways i was sort o fraid ont  but lordy massy boys you mustnt never tell hepsy i said so cause shed be mad enough to bite a shinglenail in two not that she sets so very gret by me neither but then womens backs is allers up ef they think anybody else could a hed you whether they want you themselves or not  ye see miry she was old black hoss john browns dater and lived up there in that are big brown house by the meetinhouse that hes the red hollyhock in the front yard miry was about the handsomest gal that went into the singers seat a sunday  i tell you she want none o your milkandsugar gals neithershe was mazin strong built she was the strongest gal in her arms that i ever see why i ve seen miry take up a barrel o flour and lift it right into the kitchen and it would jest make the pink come into her cheeks like two roses but she never seemed to mind it a grain she had a good strong back of her own and she was straight as a poplar with snappin black eyes and i tell you there was a snap to her tongue too nobody never got ahead o miry shed give every fellow as good as he sent but for all that she was a gret favorite  miry was one o your briery scratchy gals that seems to catch fellers in thorns she allers fit and flouted her beaux and the more she fit and flouted em the more they d be arter her there want a gal in all oldtown that led such a string o fellers arter her cause you see shed now and then throw em a good word over her shoulder and then they d all fight who should get it and shed jest laugh to see em do it  why there was tom sawin he was one o her beaux and jim moss and ike bacon and there was a boston boy tom beacon he came up from cambridge to rusticate with parson lothrop he thought he must have his say with miry but he got pretty well come up with you see he thought cause he was boston born that he was kind o aristocracy and hed a right jest to pick and choose mong country gals but the way he got come up with by miry was too funny for any thing  do tell us about it we said as sam made an artful pause designed to draw forth solicitation  wal ye see tom beacon he told ike bacon about it and ike he told me twas this way ye see there was a quiltin up to mis capn broads and tom beacon he was there and come to goin home with the gals tom he cut ike out and got miry all to himself and twas a putty long piece of a walk from mis capn broads up past the swamp and the stone pastur clear up to old black hoss johns  wal tom he was in high feather cause miry took him so that he didnt reelly know how to behave and so as they was walkin along past parson lothrops appleorchard tom thought hed try bein familiar and he undertook to put his arm round miry wal if she didnt jest take that little fellow by his two shoulders and whirl him over the fence into the orchard quicker n no time why says tom the fust i knew i was lyin on my back under the appletrees lookin up at the stars miry she jest walked off home and said nothin to nobodyit want her way to talk much about things and if it hednt ben for tom beacon himself nobody need a known nothin about it tom was a little fellow you see and mazin goodnatured and one o the sort that couldnt keep nothin to himself and so he let the cat out o the bag himself wal there didnt nobody think the worse o miry when fellers find a gal wont take saace from no man they kind o respect her and then fellers allers thinks ef it hed ben them now things d a been different thats jest what jim moss and ike bacon said they said why tom beacon was a fool not to know better how to get along with mirythey never had no trouble the fun of it was that tom beacon himself was more crazy after her than he was afore and they say he made miry a right upanddown offer and miry she jest wouldnt have him  wal you see that went agin old black hoss johns idees old black hoss was about as close as a nut and as contrairy as a pipperagetree you ought to a seen him why his face was all a perfect crisscross o wrinkles there want a spot where you could put a pin down that there want a wrinkle and they used to say that he held on to every cent that went through his fingers till hed pinched it into two you couldnt say that his god was his belly for he hednt none no moren an old file folks said that hed starved himself till the moond shine through him  old black hoss was awfully grouty about mirys refusin tom beacon cause there was his houses and lots o land in boston a drefful worldly old critter black hoss john was he was like the rich fool in the gospel wal hes dead and gone now poor critter and what good has it all done him its as the scriptur says he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them  miry hed a pretty hard row to hoe with old black hoss john she was up early and down late and kep every thing a goin she made the cheese and made the butter and between spells she braided herself handsome straw bunnets and fixed up her clothes and somehow she worked it so when she sold her butter and cheese that there was somethin for ribbins and flowers you know the scriptur says can a maid forget her ornaments wal miry didnt i member i used to lead the singin in them days and miry she used to sing counter so we sot putty near together in the singers seats and i used to think sunday mornins when she come to meetin in her white dress and her red cheeks and her bunnet all tipped off with laylock that twas for all the world jest like sunshine to have her come into the singers seats them was the days that i didnt improve my privileges boys said sam sighing deeply there was times that ef id a spoke theres no knowin what mightnt a happened cause you see boys i was better lookin in them days than i be now now you mind boys when you grow up ef you get to waitin on a nice gal and youre most a mind to speak up to her dont you go and put it off cause ef you do you may live to repent it  wal you see from the time that bill elderkin come and took the academy i could see plain enough that it was time for me to hang up my fiddle bill he used to set in the singers seats too and he would have it that he sung tenor he no more sung tenor than a skunkblackbird but he made blieve he did jest to git next to miry in the singers seats they used to set there in the seats a writin backward and forward to each other till they tore out all the leaves of the hymnbooks and the singinbooks besides wal i never thought that the house o the lord was jest the place to be courtin in and i used to get considable shocked at the way things went on atween em why theyd be a writin all sermontime and ive seen him a lookin at her all through the long prayer in a way that want right considerin they was both professors of religion but then the fact was old black hoss john was to blame for it cause he never let em have no chance to hum ye see old black hoss he was sot agin elderkin cause he was poor you see his mother the old widdah elderkin she was jest about the poorest peakedest old body over to sherburne and went out to days works and bill elderkin he was all for books and larnin and old black hoss john he thought it was just shiftlessness but miry she thought he was a genius and she got it sot in her mind that he was goin to be president o the united states or some sich  wal old black hoss he want none too polite to mirys beaux in gineral but when elderkin used to come to see her he was snarlier than a saw he hadnt a good word for him noways and hed rake up the fire right before his face and eyes and rattle about fastenin up the windows and tramp up to bed and call down the chamberstairs to miry to go to bed and was sort o aggravatin every way  wal ef folks wants to get a gal set on havin a man that eres the way to go to work miry had a considable stiff will of her own and ef she didnt care about tom beacon before she hated him now and if she liked bill elderkin before she was clean gone over to him now and so she took to goin to the wednesdayevenin lecture and the fridayevenin prayermeetin and the singinschool jest as regular as a clock and so did he and arterwards they allers walked home the longest way fathers may jest as well let their gals be courted in the house peaceable cause if they cant be courted there theyll find places where they can be its jest human natur  wal come fall elderkin he went to college up to brunswick and then i used to see the letters as regular up to the store every week comin in from brunswick and old black hoss john he see em too and got a way of droppin on em in his coatpocket when he come up to the store and folks used to say that the letters that went into his coatpocket didnt get to miry anyhow miry she says to me one day says she sam youre up round the postoffice a good deal says she i wish if you see any letters for me youd jest bring em along i see right into it and i told her to be sure i would and so i used to have the carryin of great thick letters every week wal i was waitin on hepsy along about them times and so miry and i kind o sympathized hepsy was a pretty gal and i thought it was all best as twas any way i knew i couldnt get miry and i could get hepsy and that made all the difference in the world  wal that next winter old black hoss was took down with rheumatism and i tell you if miry didnt have a time ont he want noways sweettempered when he was well but come to be crooked up with the rheumatis and kep awake nights it seemed as if he was determined there shouldnt nobody have no peace so long as he couldnt  hed get miry up and down with him night after night a makin her heat flannels and vinegar and then hed jaw and scold so that she was eenymost beat out he wouldnt have nobody set up with him though there was offers made no he said miry was his daughter and twas her bisness to take care on him  miry was clear worked down folks kind o pitied her she was a strong gal but theres things that wears out the strongest the worst ont was it hung on so old black hoss had a most amazin sight o constitution hed go all down to deaths door and seem hardly to have the breath o life in him and then up hed come agin these ere old folks that nobody wants to have live allers hev such a sight o wear in em they jest last and last and it really did seem as if hed wear miry out and get her into the grave fust for she got a cough with bein up so much in the cold and grew thin as a shadder member one time i went up there to offer to watch jest in the spring o the year when the laylocks was jest a buddin out and miry she come and talked with me over the fence and the poor gal she fairly broke down and sobbed as if her heart would break a tellin me her trouble  wal it reelly affected me more to have miry give up so than most gals cause shed allers held her head up and hed sich a sight o grit and resolution but she told me all about it  it seems old black hoss he want content with worryin on her and gettin on her up nights but he kep a hectorin her about bill elderkin and wantin on her to promise that she wouldnt hev bill when he was dead and gone and miry she wouldnt promise and then the old man said she shouldnt have a cent from him if she didnt and so they had it back and forth everybody in town was sayin what a shame twas that he should sarve her so for though he hed other children they was married and gone and there want none of them to do for him but jest miry  wal he hung on till jest as the pinys in the front yard was beginnin to blow out and then he began to feel he was a goin and he sent for parson lothrop to know what was to be done about his soul  wal says parson lothrop you must settle up all your worldly affairs you must be in peace and love with all mankind and if youve wronged anybody you must make it good to em  old black hoss he bounced right over in his bed with his back to the minister  the devil says he twill take all ive got and he never spoke another word though parson lothrop he prayed with him and did what he could for him  wal that night i sot up with him and he went off tween two and three in the mornin and i laid him out regular of all the racks o bone i ever see i never see a human critter so poor as he was twant nothin but his awful will kep his soul in his body so long as it was  we had the funeral in the meetinhouse a sunday and parson lothrop he preached a sarmon on contentment on the text we brought nothin into the world and its sartin we can carry nothin out and having food and raiment let us be therewith content parson lothrop he got round the subject about as handsome as he could he didnt say what a skinflint old black hoss was but he talked in a gineral way about the vanity o worryin an scrapin to heap up riches ye see parson lothrop he could say it all putty easy too cause since he married a rich wife he never hed no occasion to worry about temporal matters folks allers preaches better on the vanity o riches when theys in tolable easy circumstances ye see when folks is pestered and worried to pay their bills and dont know where the next dollars to come from its a great temptation to be kind o valooin riches and mebbe envyin those thats got em whereas when ones accounts all pays themselves and the money comes jest when its wanted regular a body feels sort o composed like and able to take the right view o things like parson lothrop  wal arter sermon the relations all went over to the old house to hear the will read and as i was kind o friend with the family i jest slipped in along with the rest  squire jones he had the will and so when they all got sot round all solemn he broke the seals and unfolded it cracklin it a good while afore he begun and it was so still you might a heard a pin drop when he begun to read fust there was the farm and stock he left to his son john brown over in sherburne then there was the household stuff and all them things spoons and dishes and beds and kiverlids and so on to his dater polly blanchard and then last of all he says he left to his dater miry the pitcher that was on the top o the shelf in his bedroom closet  that are was an old cracked pitcher that miry allers hed hated the sight of and spring and fall she used to beg her father to let her throw it away but no he wouldnt let her touch it and so it stood gatherin dust  some on em run and handed it down and it seemed jest full o scourinsand and nothin else and they handed it to miry  wal miry she was wrathy then she didnt so much mind bein left out in the will cause she expected that but to have that are old pitcher poked at her so sort o scornful was moren she could bear  she took it and gin it a throw across the room with all her might and it hit agin the wall and broke into a thousand bits when out rolled hundreds of gold pieces great gold eagles and guineas flew round the kitchen jest as thick as dandelions in a meadow i tell you she scrabbled them up pretty quick and we all helped her  come to count em over miry had the best fortin of the whole as twas right and proper she should miry she was a sensible gal and she invested her money well and so when bill elderkin got through his lawstudies he found a wife that could make a nice beginnin with him and thats the way you see they came to be doin as well as they be  so boys you jest mind and remember and allers see what there is in a providence afore you quarrel with it cause theres a good many things in this world turns out like mis elderkins pitcher  illustration ghost in capn brown house page 139     the ghost in the capn brownhouse  now sam tell us certain true is there any such things as ghosts  be there ghosts said sam immediately translating into his vernacular grammar wal now that ares jest the question ye see well grandma thinks there are and aunt lois thinks its all nonsense why aunt lois dont even believe the stories in cotton mathers magnalia  wanter know said sam with a tone of slow languid meditation  we were sitting on a bank of the charles river fishing the soft melancholy red of evening was fading off in streaks on the glassy water and the houses of oldtown were beginning to loom through the gloom solemn and ghostly there are times and tones and moods of nature that make all the vulgar daily real seem shadowy vague and supernatural as if the outlines of this hard material present were fading into the invisible and unknown so oldtown with its elmtrees its great square white houses its meetinghouse and tavern and blacksmiths shop and milly which at high noon seem as real and as commonplace as possible at this hour of the evening were dreamy and solemn they rose up blurred indistinct dark here and there winking candles sent long lines of light through the shadows and little drops of unforeseen rain rippled the sheeny darkness of the water  wal you see boys in them things its jest as well to mind your granny theres a considable sight o gumption in grandmas you look at the folks thats alius tellin you what they dont believethey dont believe this and they dont believe thatand what sort o folks is they why like yer aunt lois sort o stringy and dry there aint no sorption got out o not believin nothin  lord a massy we dont know nothin bout them things we haint ben there and cant say that there aint no ghosts and sich can we now  we agreed to that fact and sat a little closer to sam in the gathering gloom  tell us about the capn brown house sam  ye didnt never go over the capn brown house  no we had not that advantage  wal yer see capn brown he made all his money to sea in furrin parts and then come here to oldtown to settle down  now there aint no knowin bout these ere old shipmasters where theys ben or what theys ben a doin or how they got their money ask me no questions and ill tell ye no lies is bout the best philosophy for them wal it didnt do no good to ask capn brown questions too close cause you didnt git no satisfaction nobody rightly knew bout who his folks was or where they come from and ef a body asked him he used to say that the very fust he knowd bout himself he was a young man walkin the streets in london  but yer see boys he hed money and that is about all folks wanter know when a man comes to settle down and he bought that are place and built that are house he built it all seacapn fashion sos to feel as much at home as he could the parlor was like a ships cabin the table and chairs was fastened down to the floor and the closets was made with holes to set the casters and the decanters and bottles in jests they be at sea and there was stanchions to hold on by and they say that blowy nights the capn used to fire up pretty well with his grog till he hed about all he could carry and then hed set and hold on and hear the wind blow and kind o feel out to sea right there to hum there wasnt no mis capn brown and there didnt seem likely to be none and whether there ever hed been one nobody knowd he hed an old black guinea niggerwoman named quassia that did his work she was shaped pretty much like one o these ere great crooknecksquashes she want no gret beauty i can tell you and she used to wear a gret red turban and a yaller short gown and red petticoat and a gret string o gold beads round her neck and gret big gold hoops in her ears made right in the middle o africa among the heathen there for all she was black she thought a heap o herself and was considable sort o predominative over the capn lordy massy boys its alius so get a man and a woman togetherany sort o woman youre a mind to dont care who tisand one way or another she gets the rule over him and he jest has to train to her fife some does it one way and some does it another some does it by jawin and some does it by kissin and some does it by faculty and contrivance but one way or another they allers does it old capn brown was a good stout stocky kind o john bull sort o fellow and a good judge o sperits and allers kep the best in them are cupboards o hisn but fust and last things in his house went pretty much as old quassia said  folks got to kind o respectin quassia she come to meetin sunday regular and sot all fixed up in red and yaller and green with glass beads and what not lookin for all the world like one o them ugly indian idols but she was wellbehaved as any christian she was a master hand at cookin her bread and biscuits couldnt be beat and no couldnt her pies and there want no such poundcake as she made nowhere wal this ere story im a goin to tell you was told me by cinthy pendleton there aint a more respectable gal old or young than cinthy nowheres she lives over to sherburne now and i hear tell shes sot up a mantymakin business but then she used to do tailorin in oldtown she was a member o the church and a good christian as ever was wal ye see quassia she got cinthy to come up and spend a week to the capn brown house a doin tailorin and a fixin over his close twas along toward the fust o march cinthy she sot by the fire in the front parlor with her goose and her pressboard and her work for there want no company callin and the snow was drifted four feet deep right across the front door so there want much danger o any body comin in and the capn he was a perlite man to wimmen and cinthy she liked it jest as well not to have company cause the capn hed make himself entertainin tellin on her seastories and all about his adventures among the ammonites and perresites and jebusites and all sorts o heathen people hed been among  wal that are week there come on the master snowstorm of all the snowstorms that hed ben that are was the beater and i tell you the wind blew as if twas the last chance it was ever goin to hev wal its kind o scary like to be shet up in a lone house with all natur a kind o breakin out and goin on so and the snow a comin down so thick ye cant see cross the street and the wind a pipin and a squeelin and a rumblin and a tumblin fust down this chimney and then down that i tell you it sort o sets a feller thinkin o the three great thingsdeath judgment and etarnaty and i dont care who the folks is nor how good they be theres times when they must be feelin putty considable solemn  wal cinthy she said she kind o felt so along and she hed a sort o queer feelin come over her as if there was somebody or somethin round the house moren appeared she said she sort o felt it in the air but it seemed to her silly and she tried to get over it but two or three times she said when it got to be dusk she felt somebody go by her up the stairs the front entry want very light in the daytime and in the storm come five oclock it was so dark that all you could see was jest a gleam o somethin and two or three times when she started to go up stairs she see a soft white suthin that seemed goin up before her and she stopped with her heart a beatin like a triphammer and she sort o saw it go up and along the entry to the capns door and then it seemed to go right through cause the door didnt open  wal cinthy says she to old quassia says she is there anybody lives in this house but us  anybody lives here says quassia what you mean says she  says cinthy i thought somebody went past me on the stairs last night and tonight  lordy massy how old quassia did screech and laugh good lord says she how foolish white folks is somebody went past you wast the captin  no it want the capn says she it was somethin soft and white and moved very still it was like somethin in the air says she then quassia she hawhawed louder says she its hysterikes miss cinthy thats all it is  wal cinthy she was kind o shamed but for all that she couldnt help herself sometimes evenins shed be a settin with the capn and shed think shed hear somebody a movin in his room overhead and she knowed it want quassia cause quassia was ironin in the kitchen she took pains once or twice to find out that are  wal ye see the capns room was the gret front upper chamber over the parlor and then right oppisite to it was the gret spare chamber where cinthy slept it was jest as grand as could be with a gret fourpost mahogany bedstead and damask curtains brought over from england but it was cold enough to freeze a white bear solidthe way spare chambers allers is then there was the entry between run straight through the house one side was old quassias room and the other was a sort o storeroom where the old capn kep all sorts o traps  wal cinthy she kep a hevin things happen and a seein things till she didnt railly know what was in it once when she come into the parlor jest at sundown she was sure she see a white figure a vanishin out o the door that went towards the side entry she said it was so dusk that all she could see was jest this white figure and it jest went out still as a cat as she come in  wal cinthy didnt like to speak to the capn about it she was a close woman putty prudent cinthy was  but one night bout the middle o the week this ere thing kind o come to a crisis  cinthy said shed ben up putty late a sewin and a finishin off down in the parlor and the capn he sot up with her and was considable cheerful and entertainin tellin her all about things over in the bermudys and off to chiny and japan and round the world ginerally the storm that hed been a blowin all the week was about as furious as ever and the capn he stirred up a mess o flip and hed it for her hot to go to bed on he was a goodnatured critter and allers had feelins for lone women and i spose he knew twas sort o desolate for cinthy  wal takin the flip so right the last thing afore goin to bed she went right off to sleep as sound as a nut and slep on till somewhere about mornin when she said somethin waked her broad awake in a minute her eyes flew wide open like a spring and the storm hed gone down and the moon come out and there standin right in the moonlight by her bed was a woman jest as white as a sheet with black hair hangin down to her waist and the brightest mourn fullest black eyes you ever see she stood there lookin right at cinthy and cinthy thinks that was what waked her up cause you know ef anybody stands and looks steady at folks asleep its apt to wake em  illustration stood there lookin right at cinthy page 149  any way cinthy said she felt jest as ef she was turnin to stone she couldnt move nor speak she lay a minute and then she shut her eyes and begun to say her prayers and a minute after she opened em and it was gone  cinthy was a sensible gal and one that allers hed her thoughts about her and she jest got up and put a shawl round her shoulders and went first and looked at the doors and they was both on em locked jest as she left em when she went to bed then she looked under the bed and in the closet and felt all round the room where she couldnt see she felt her way and there want nothin there  wal next mornin cinthy got up and went home and she kep it to herself a good while finally one day when she was workin to our house she told hepsy about it and hepsy she told me  well sam we said after a pause in which we heard only the rustle of leaves and the ticking of branches against each other what do you suppose it was  wal there tis you know jest as much about it as i do hepsy told cinthy it might a ben a dream so it might but cinthy she was sure it want a dream cause she remembers plain hearin the old clock on the stairs strike four while she had her eyes open lookin at the woman and then she only shet em a minute jest to say now i lay me and opened em and she was gone  wal cinthy told hepsy and hepsy she kep it putty close she didnt tell it to nobody except aunt sally dickerson and the widder bije smith and your grandma badger and the ministers wife and they every one o em greed it ought to be kep close cause it would make talk wal come spring somehow or other it seemed to a got all over oldtown i heard on t to the store and up to the tavern and jake marshall he says to me one day whats this ere about the capns house and the widder loker she says to me theres ben a ghost seen in the capns house and i heard on t clear over to needham and sherburne  some o the women they drew themselves up putty stiff and proper your aunt lois was one on em  ghost says she dont tell me perhaps it would be best ef twas a ghost says she she didnt think there ought to be no sich doins in nobodys house and your grandma she shet her up and told her she didnt oughter talk so  talk how said i interrupting sam with wonder what did aunt lois mean  why you see said sam mysteriously there allers is folks in every town thats jest like the sadducees in old times they wont believe in angel nor sperit no way you can fix it and ef things is seen and done in a house why they say its cause theres somebody there theres some sort o deviltry or trick about it  so the story got round that there was a woman kep private in capn browns house and that he brought her from furrin parts and it growed and growed till there was all sorts o ways o tellin on t  some said theyd seen her a settin at an open winder some said that moonlight nights theyd seen her a walkin out in the back garden kind o in and out mong the beanpoles and squashvines  you see it come on spring and summer and the winders o the capn brown house stood open and folks was all a watchin on em day and night aunt sally dickerson told the ministers wife that shed seen in plain daylight a woman a settin at the chamber winder atween four and five oclock in the morninjist a settin a lookin out and a doin nothin like anybody else she was very white and pale and had black eyes  some said that it was a nun the capn had brought away from a roman catholic convent in spain and some said hed got her out o the inquisition  aunt sally said she thought the minister ought to call and inquire why she didnt come to meetin and who she was and all about her cause you see she said it might be all right enough ef folks only knowd jest how things was but ef they didnt why folks will talk  well did the minister do it  what parson lothrop wal no he didnt he made a call on the capn in a regular way and asked arter his health and all his family but the capn he seemed jest as jolly and chipper as a spring robin and he gin the minister some o his old jamaiky and the minister he come away and said he didnt see nothin and no he didnt folks never does see nothin when they aint lookin where tis fact is parson lothrop want fond o interferin he was a master hand to slick things over your grandma she used to mourn about it cause she said he never gin no pint to the doctrines but twas all of a piece he kind o took every thing the smooth way  but your grandma she believed in the ghost and so did lady lothrop i was up to her house tother day fixin a doorknob and says she sam your wife told me a strange story about the capn brown house  yes maam she did says i  well what do you think of it says she  wal sometimes i think and then agin i dont know says i theres cinthy shes a member o the church and a good pious gal says i  yes sam says lady lothrop says she and sam says she it is jest like something that happened once to my grandmother when she was livin in the old province house in bostin says she these ere things is the mysteries of providence and its jest as well not to have em too much talked about  jest so says ijest so that ares what every woman ive talked with says and i guess fust and last ive talked with twentygood safe churchmembersand theys every one o opinion that this ere oughtnt to be talked about why over to the deakins tother night we went it all over as much as two or three hours and we concluded that the best way was to keep quite still about it and thats jest what they say over to needham and sherburne ive been all round a hushin this ere up and i haint found but a few people that hednt the particulars one way or another this ere was what i says to lady lothrop the fact was i never did see no report spread so nor make sich sort o sarchins o heart as this ere it railly did beat all cause ef twas a ghost why there was the pint proved ye see cinthys a churchmember and she see it and got right up and sarched the room but then agin ef twas a woman why that are was kind o awful it give cause ye see for thinkin all sorts o things there was capn brown to be sure he want a churchmember but yet he was as honest and regular a man as any goin as fur as any on us could see to be sure nobody knowd where he come from but that want no reason agin him this ere might a ben a crazy sister or some poor critter that he took out o the best o motives and the scriptur says charity hopeth all things but then ye see folks will talkthat ares the pester o all these thingsand they did some on em talk considable strong about the capn but somehow or other there didnt nobody come to the pint o facin on him down and savin square out capn brown have you got a woman in your house or haint you or is it a ghost or what is it folks somehow never does come to that ye see there was the capn so respectable a settin up every sunday there in his pew with his ruffles round his hands and his red broadcloth cloak and his cocked hat why folks hearts sort o failed em when it come to say in any thing right to him they thought and kind o whispered round that the minister or the deakins oughter do it but lordy massy ministers i spose has feelins like the rest on us they dont want to eat all the hard cheeses that nobody else wont eat anyhow there wasnt nothin said direct to the capn and jest for want o that all the folks in oldtown kep a bilin and a bilin like a kettle o soap till it seemed all the time as if theyd bile over  some o the wimmen tried to get somethin out o quassy lordy massy you might as well a tried to get it out an old tomturkey thatll strut and gobble and quitter and drag his wings on the ground and fly at you but wont say nothin quassy she screeched her queer sort o laugh and she told em that they was a makin fools o themselves and that the capns matters want none o their bisness and that was true enough as to goin into quassias room or into any o the storerooms or closets she kep the keys of you might as well hev gone into a lions den she kep all her places locked up tight and there was no gettin at nothin in the capn brown house else i believe some o the wimmen would a sent a sarchwarrant  well said i what came of it didnt anybody ever find out  wal said sam it come to an end sort o and didnt come to an end it was jest this ere way you see along in october jest in the cidermakin time abel flint he was took down with dysentery and died you member the flint house it stood on a little rise o ground jest lookin over towards the brown house wal there was aunt sally dickerson and the widder bije smith they set up with the corpse he was laid out in the back chamber you see over the milkroom and kitchen but there was cold victuals and sich in the front chamber where the watchers sot wal now aunt sally she told me that between three and four oclock she heard wheels a rumblin and she went to the winder and it was clear starlight and she see a coach come up to the capn brown house and she see the capn come out bringin a woman all wrapped in a cloak and old quassy came arter with her arms full o bundles and he put her into the kerridge and shet her in and it driv off and she see old quassy stand lookin over the fence arter it she tried to wake up the widder but twas towards mornin and the widder allers was a hard sleeper so there want no witness but her  well then it wasnt a ghost said i after all and it was a woman  wal there tis you see folks dont know that are yit cause there its jest as broad as tis long now look at it theres cinthy shes a good pious gal she locks her chamberdoors both on em and goes to bed and wakes up in the night and theres a woman there she jest shets her eyes and the womans gone she gits up and looks and both doors is locked jest as she left em that ere woman want flesh and blood now no waynot such flesh and blood as we knows on but then they say cinthy might hev dreamed it  wal now look at it tother way theres aunt sally dickerson shes a good woman and a churchmember wal she sees a woman in a cloak with all her bundles brought out o capn browns house and put into a kerridge and driv off atween three and four oclock in the mornin wal that ere shows there must a ben a real live woman kep there privately and so what cinthy saw wasnt a ghost  wal now cinthy says aunt sally might a dreamed itthat she got her head so full o stories about the capn brown house and watched it till she got asleep and hed this ere dream and as there didnt nobody else see it it might a ben you know aunt sallys clear she didnt dream and then agin cinthys clear she didnt dream but which on em was awake or which on em was asleep is what aint settled in oldtown yet
