because ye are sons of the blood and call me mother still     now must ye speak to your kinsmen and they must speak to you     after the use of the english in straightflung words and few     go to your work and be strong halting not in your ways     baulking the end halfwon for an instant dole of praise     stand to your work and be wisecertain of sword and pen     who are neither children nor gods but men in a world of men     the first chantey       mine was the woman to me darkling i found her     haling her dumb from the camp held her and bound her     hot rose her tribe on our track ere i had proved her     hearing her laugh in the gloom greatly i loved her      swift through the forest we ran none stood to guard us     few were my people and far then the flood barred us     him we call son of the sea sullen and swollen     panting we waited the death stealer and stolen      yet ere they came to my lance laid for the slaughter     lightly she leaped to a log lapped in the water     holding on high and apart skins that arrayed her     called she the god of the wind that he should aid her      life had the tree at that word praise we the giver     otterlike left he the bank for the full river     far fell their axes behind flashing and ringing     wonder was on me and fear yet she was singing      low lay the land we had left now the blue bound us     even the floor of the gods level around us     whisper there was not nor word shadow nor showing     still the light stirred on the deep glowing and growing      then did he leap to his place flaring from under     he the compeller the sun bared to our wonder     nay not a league from our eyes blinded with gazing     cleared he the womb of the world huge and amazing      this we beheld and we livethe pit of the burning     then the god spoke to the tree for our returning     back to the beach of our flight fearless and slowly     back to our slayers he went but we were holy      men that were hot in that hunt women that followed     babes that were promised our bones trembled and wallowed     over the necks of the tribe crouching and fawning     prophet and priestess we came back from the dawning     the last chantey  and there was no more sea       thus said the lord in the vault above the cherubim       calling to the angels and the souls in their degree         lo earth has passed away         on the smoke of judgment day       that our word may be established shall we gather up the sea      loud sang the souls of the jolly jolly mariners       plague upon the hurricane that made us furl and flee         but the war is done between us         in the deep the lord hath seen us       our bones well leave the barracout and god may sink the sea      then said the soul of judas that betray√®d him       lord hast thou forgotten thy covenant with me         how once a year i go         to cool me on the floe       and ye take my day of mercy if ye take away the sea      then said the soul of the angel of the offshore wind       he that bits the thunder when the bullmouthed breakers flee         i have watch and ward to keep         oer thy wonders on the deep       and ye take mine honour from me if ye take away the sea      loud sang the souls of the jolly jolly mariners       nay but we were angry and a hasty folk are we         if we worked the ship together         till she foundered in foul weather       are we babes that we should clamour for a vengeance on the sea      then said the souls of the slaves that men threw overboard       kennelled in the picaroon a weary band were we         but thy arm was strong to save         and it touched us on the wave       and we drowsed the long tides idle till thy trumpets tore the sea      then cried the soul of the stout apostle paul to god       once we frapped a ship and she laboured woundily         there were fourteen score of these         and they blessed thee on their knees       when they learned thy grace and glory under malta by the sea      loud sang the souls of the jolly jolly mariners       plucking at their harps and they plucked unhandily         our thumbs are rough and tarred         and the tune is something hard       may we lift a deepsea chantey such as seamen use at sea      then said the souls of the gentlemenadventurers       fettered wrist to bar all for red iniquity         ho we revel in our chains         oer the sorrow that was spains       heave or sink it leave or drink it we were masters of the sea      up spake the soul of a gray gothavn speckshioner       he that led the flinching in the fleets of fair dundee         ho the ringer and right whale         and the fish we struck for sale       will ye whelm them all for wantonness that wallow in the sea      loud sang the souls of the jolly jolly mariners       crying under heaven here is neither lead nor lea         must we sing for evermore         on the windless glassy floor       take back your golden fiddles and well beat to open sea      then stooped the lord and he called the good sea up to him       and stablished his borders unto all eternity         that such as have no pleasure         for to praise the lord by measure       they may enter into galleons and serve him on the sea      sun wind and cloud shall fail not from the face of it       stinging ringing spindrift nor the fulmar flying free         and the ships shall go abroad         to the glory of the lord       who heard the silly sailorfolk and gave them back their sea     the merchantmen       king solomon drew merchantmen       because of his desire     for peacocks apes and ivory       from tarshish unto tyre     with cedars out of lebanon       which hiram rafted down     but we be only sailormen

beneath the tropics       in frost upon the floe     and jeopardy of every wind       that does between them go      and some we got by purchase       and some we had by trade     and some we found by

callthe poaching cry o the sea     and they raised the baltic out of the mist and an angry ship was she     and blind they groped through the whirling white and blind to the               bay again     till they heard the creak of the stralsunds boom and the clank of               her mooringchain     they laid them down by bitt and boat their pistols in their belts     and will you fight for it reuben paine or will you share the               pelts      a dogtoothed laugh laughed reuben paine and bared his flenching               knife     yea skin for skin and all that he hath a man will give for his life     but ive six thousand skins below and yeddo port to see     and theres never a law of god or man runs north of fiftythree     so go in peace to the naked seas with empty holds to fill     and ill be good to your seal this catch as many as i shall kill      answered the snap of a closing lock and the jar of a gunbutt slid     but the tender fog shut fold on fold to hide the wrong they did     the weeping fog rolled fold on fold the wrath of man to cloak     and the flamespurts pale ran down the rail as the sealingrifles               spoke     the bullets bit on bend and butt the splinter slivered free     little they trust to sparrowdust that stop the seal in his sea     the thick smoke hung and would not shift leaden it lay and blue     but three were down on the baltics deck and two of the stralsunds               crew     an arms length out and overside the banked fog held them bound     but as they heard or groan or word they fired at the sound     for one cried out on the name of god and one to have him cease     and the questing volley found them both and bade them hold their peace     and one called out on a heathen joss and one on the virgins name     and the schooling bullet leaped across and showed them whence they               came     and in the waiting silences the rudder whined beneath     and each man drew his watchful breath slow taken tween the teeth     trigger and ear and eye acock knit brow and harddrawn lips     bracing his feet by chock and cleat for the rolling of the ships     till they heard the cough of a wounded man that fought in the fog for               breath     till they heard the torment of reuben paine that wailed upon his death      the tides theyll go through fundy race but ill go never more     and see the hogs from ebbtide mark turn scampering back to shore     no more ill see the trawlers drift below the bass rock ground     or watch the tall fall steamer lights tear blazing up the sound     sorrow is me in a lonely sea and a sinful fight i fall     but if theres law o god or man youll swing for it yet tom hall      tom hall stood up by the quarterrail your words in your teeth               said he     theres never a law of god or man runs north of fifty three     so go in grace with him to face and an illspent life behind     and ill take care o your widows rube as many as i shall find     a stralsund man shot blind and large and a warlock finn was he     and he hit tom hall with a bursting ball a handsbreadth over the               knee     tom hall caught hold by the toppinglift and sat him down with an               oath     youll wait a little rube he said the devil has called for both     the devil is driving both this tide and the killinggrounds are close     and well go up to the wrath of god as the holluschickie goes     o men put back your guns again and lay your rifles by     weve fought our fight and the best are down let up and let us die     quit firing by the bow therequit call off the baltics crew     youre sure of hell as me or rubebut wait till we get through      there went no word between the ships but thick and quick and loud     the lifeblood drummed on the dripping decks with the fogdew from               the shroud     the seapull drew them side by side gunnel to gunnel laid     and they felt the sheerstrakes pound and clear but never a word was               said      then reuben paine cried out again before his spirit passed     have i followed the sea for thirty years to die in the dark at last     curse on her work that has nipped me here with a shifty trick unkind     i have gotten my death where i got my bread but i dare not face it               blind     curse on the fog is there never a wind of all the winds i knew     to clear the smother from off my chest and let me look at the blue     the good fog heardlike a splitten sail to left and right she tore     and they saw the sundogs in the haze and the seal upon the shore     silver and gray ran spit and bay to meet the steelbacked tide     and pinched and white in the clearing light the crews stared overside     o rainbowgay the red pools lay that swilled and spilled and spread     and gold raw gold the spent shell rolled between the careless dead     the dead that rocked so drunkenwise to weather and to lee     and they saw the work their hands had done as god had bade them see      and a little breeze blew over the rail that made the headsails lift     but no man stood by wheel or sheet and they let the schooners drift     and the rattle rose in reubens throat and he cast his soul with a cry     and gone already tom hall he said then its time for me to die     his eyes were heavy with great sleep and yearning for the land     and he spoke as a man that talks in dreams his wound beneath his hand     oh there comes no good in the westering wind that backs against the               sun     wash down the deckstheyre all too redand share the skins and run     baltic stralsund and northern lightclean share and share for all     youll find the fleets off tolstoi mees but you will not find tom               hall     evil he did in shoalwater and blacker sin on the deep     but now hes sick of watch and trick and now hell turn and sleep     hell have no more of the crawling sea that made him suffer so     but hell lie down on the killinggrounds where the holluschickie go     and west youll turn and south again beyond the seafogs rim     and tell the yoshiwara girls to burn a stick for him     and youll not weight him by the heels and dump him overside     but carry him up to the sandhollows to die as bering died     and make a place for reuben paine that knows the fight was fair     and leave the two that did the wrong to talk it over there      halfsteam ahead by guess and lead for the sun is mostly veiled     through fog to fog by luck and log sail ye as bering sailed     and if the light shall lift aright to give your landfall plain     north and by west from zapne crest ye raise the crosses twain     fair marks are they to the inner bay the reckless poacher knows     what time the scarred seecatchie lead their sleek seraglios     ever they hear the floepack clear and the blast of the old               bullwhale     and the deep sealroar that beats off shore above the loudest gale     ever they wait

and the stralsund fought the two     the derelict      and reports the derelict mary pollock still at sea   shipping news           i was the staunchest of our fleet         till the sea rose beneath

so we ride the iron stallions down to drink           through the ca√±ons to the waters of the west      and the tunes that mean so much to you alone       common tunes that make you choke and blow your nose     vulgar tunes that bring the laugh that brings the groan       i can rip your very heartstrings out with those     with the feasting and the folly and the fun       and the lying and the

has taken spur and blade     to dub true thomas a belted knight       and all for the sake o the songs he made      they have sought him high they have sought him low       they have sought him over down and lea     they have found him by the milkwhite thorn       that guards the gates o faerie      twas bent beneath and blue above       their eyes were held that they might not see     the kine that grazed between the knowes       oh they were the queens o faerie      now cease your song the king he said       oh cease your song and get you dight     to vow your vow and watch your arms       for i will dub you a belted knight      for i will give you a horse o pride       wi blazon and spur and page and squire     wi keep and tail and seizin and law       and land to hold at your desire      true thomas smiled above his harp       and turned his face to the naked sky     where blown before the wastrel wind       the thistledown she floated by      i ha vowed my vow in another place       and bitter oath it was on me     i ha watched my arms the leelong night       where fivescore fightingmen would flee      my lance is tipped o the hammered flame       my shield is beat o the moonlight cold     and i won my spurs in the middle world       a thousand fathoms beneath the mould      and what should i make wi a horse o pride       and what should i make wi a sword so brown     but spill the rings o the gentle folk       and flyte my kin in the fairy town      and what should i make wi blazon and belt       wi keep and tail and seizin and fee     and what should i do wi page and squire       that am a king in my own countrie      for i send east and i send west       and i send far as my will may flee     by dawn and dusk and the drinking rain       and syne my sendings return to me      they come wi news of the groanin earth       they come wi news o the roarin sea     wi word of spirit and ghost and flesh       and man thats mazed among the three      the king he bit his nether lip       and smote his hand upon his knee     by the faith o my soul true thomas he said       ye waste no wit in courtesie      as i desire unto my pride       can i make earls by three and three     to run before and ride behind       and serve the sons o my body      and what care i for your rowfoot earls       or all the sons o your body     before they win to the pride o name       i trow they all ask leave o me      for i make honour wi muckle mouth       as i make shame wi mincin feet     to sing wi the priests at the marketcross       or run wi the dogs in the naked street      and some they give me the good red gold       and some they give me the white money     and some they give me a clout o meal       for they be people o low degree      and the song i sing for the counted gold       the same i sing for the white money     but best i sing for the clout o meal       that simple people given me      the king cast down a silver groat       a silver groat o scots money     if i come with a poor mans dole he said       true thomas will ye harp to me      whenas i harp to the children small       they press me close on either hand     and who are you true thomas said       that you should ride while they must stand      light down light down from your horse o pride       i trow ye talk too loud and hie     and i will make you a triple word       and syne if ye dare ye shall noble me      he has lighted down from his horse o pride       and set his back against the stone     now guard you well true thomas said       ere i rax your heart from your breastbone      true thomas played upon his harp       the fairy harp that couldna lee     and the first least word the proud king heard       it harpit the salt tear out o his ee      oh i see the love that i lost long syne       i touch the hope that i may not see     and all that i did o hidden shame       like little snakes they hiss at me      the sun is lost at noonat noon       the dread o doom has grippit me     true thomas hide me under your cloak       god wot im little fit to dee      twas bent beneath and blue above       twas open field and running flood     where hot on heath and dyke and wall       the high sun warmed the adders brood      lie down lie down true thomas said       the god shall judge when all is done     but i will bring you a better word       and lift the cloud that i laid on      true thomas played upon his harp       that birled and brattled to his hand     and the next least word true thomas made       it garred the king take horse and brand      oh i hear the tread o the fightingmen       i see the sun on splent and spear     i mark the arrow outen the fern       that flies so low and sings so clear      advance my standards to that war       and bid my good knights prick and ride     the gled shall watch as fierce a fight       as eer was fought on the border side      twas bent beneath and blue above       twas nodding grass and naked sky     where ringing up the wastrel wind       the eyass stooped upon the pye      true thomas sighed above his harp       and turned the song on the midmost string     and the last least word true thomas made       he harpit his dead youth back to the king      now i am prince and i do well       to love my love withouten fear     to walk wi man in fellowship       and breathe my horse behind the deer      my hounds they bay unto the death       the buck has couched beyond the burn     my love she waits at her window       to wash my hands when i return      for that i live am i content       oh i have seen my true loves eyes     to stand wi adam in edenglade       and run in the woods o paradise      twas nodding grass and naked sky       twas blue above and bent below     where checked against the wastrel wind       the red deer belled to call the doe      true thomas laid his harp away       and louted low at the saddleside     he has taken stirrup and hauden rein       and set the king on his horse o pride      sleep ye or wake true thomas said       that sit so still that muse so long     sleep ye or waketill the latter sleep       i trow yell not forget my song      i ha harpit a shadow out o the sun       to stand before your face and cry     i ha armed the earth beneath your heel       and over your head i ha dusked the sky      i ha harpit ye up to the throne o god       i ha harpit your secret soul in three     i ha harpit ye down to the hinges o hell       andyewouldmakea knight o me     the story of ung       once on a glittering icefield ages and ages ago     ung a maker of pictures fashioned an image of snow     fashioned the form of a tribesmangaily he whistled and sung     working the snow with his fingers read ye the story of ung      pleased was his tribe with that imagecame in their hundreds to scan     handled it smelt it and grunted verily this is a man     thus do we carry our lancesthus is a warbelt slung     ay it is even as we are glory and honour to ung      later he pictured an aurochslater he pictured a bear     pictured the sabretooth tiger dragging a man to his lair     pictured the mountainous mammoth hairy abhorrent alone     out of the love that he bore them scribing them clearly on bone      swift came the tribe to behold them peering and pushing and still     men of the bergbattered beaches men of the boulderhatched hill     hunters and fishers and trapperspresently whispering low     yea they are likeand it may be but how does the pictureman               know      unghath he slept with the aurochswatched where the mastodon roam     spoke on the ice with the bowheadfollowed the sabretooth home     nay these are toys of his fancy if he have cheated us so     how is there truth in his imagethe man that he fashioned of snow      wroth was that maker of pictureshotly he answered the call     hunters and fishers and trappers children and fools are ye all     look at the beasts when ye hunt them swift from the tumult he broke     ran to the cave of his father and told him the shame that they spoke      and the father of ung gave answer that was old and wise in the craft     maker of pictures aforetime he leaned on his lance and laughed     if they could see as thou seest they would do what thou hast done     and each man would make him a picture andwhat would become of my               son      there would be no pelts of the reindeer flung down at thy cave for a               gift     nor dole of the oily timber that strands with the baltic drift     no store of welldrilled needles nor ouches of amber pale     no newcut tongues of the bison nor meat of the stranded whale      thou hast not toiled at the fishing when the sodden trammels freeze     nor worked the warboats outward through the rush of the rockstaked               seas     yet they bring thee fish and plunderfull meal and an easy bed     and all for the sake of thy pictures and ung held down his head      thou hast not stood to the aurochs when the red snow reeks of the               fight     men have no time at the houghing to count his curls aright     and the heart of the hairy mammoth thou sayest they do not see     yet they save it whole from the beaches and broil the best for thee      and now do they press to thy pictures with open mouth and eye     and a little gift in the doorway and the praise no gift can buy     butsure they have doubted thy pictures and that is a grievous               stain     son that can see so clearly return them their gifts again      and ung looked down at his deerskinstheir broad shelltasselled               bands     and ung drew downward his mitten and looked at his naked hands     and he gloved himself and departed and he heard his father behind     son that can see so clearly rejoice that thy tribe is blind      straight on that glittering icefield by the caves of the lost               dordogne     ung a maker of pictures fell to his scribing on bone     even to mammoth editions gaily he whistled and sung     blessing his tribe for their blindness heed ye the story of ung     the threedecker  the threevolume novel is extinct       full
