26353581	the red one     contents   the red one the hussy like argus of the ancient times the princess     story  the red one     there it was  the abrupt liberation of sound  as he timed it with his watch bassett likened it to the trump of an archangel  walls of cities he meditated might well fall down before so vast and compelling a summons  for the thousandth time vainly he tried to analyse the tonequality of that enormous peal that dominated the land far into the strongholds of the surrounding tribes  the mountain gorge which was its source rang to the rising tide of it until it brimmed over and flooded earth and sky and air  with the wantonness of a sick mans fancy he likened it to the mighty cry of some titan of the elder world vexed with misery or wrath higher and higher it arose challenging and demanding in such profounds of volume that it seemed intended for ears beyond the narrow confines of the solar system  there was in it too the clamour of protest in that there were no ears to hear and comprehend its utterance   such the sick mans fancy  still he strove to analyse the sound sonorous as thunder was it mellow as a golden bell thin and sweet as a thrummed taut cord of silverno it was none of these nor a blend of these  there were no words nor semblances in his vocabulary and experience with which to describe the totality of that sound  time passed  minutes merged into quarters of hours and quarters of hours into halfhours and still the sound persisted ever changing from its initial vocal impulse yet never receiving fresh impulsefading dimming dying as enormously as it had sprung into being  it became a confusion of troubled mutterings and babblings and colossal whisperings  slowly it withdrew sob by sob into whatever great bosom had birthed it until it whimpered deadly whispers of wrath and as equally seductive whispers of delight striving still to be heard to convey some cosmic secret some understanding of infinite import and value  it dwindled to a ghost of sound that had lost its menace and promise and became a thing that pulsed on in the sick mans consciousness for minutes after it had ceased  when he could hear it no longer bassett glanced at his watch  an hour had elapsed ere that archangels trump had subsided into tonal nothingness  was this then his dark towerbassett pondered remembering his browning and gazing at his skeletonlike and feverwasted hands and the fancy made him smileof childe roland bearing a slughorn to his lips with an arm as feeble as his was  was it months or years he asked himself since he first heard that mysterious call on the beach at ringmanu  to save himself he could not tell  the long sickness had been most long  in conscious count of time he knew of months many of them but he had no way of estimating the long intervals of delirium and stupor  and how fared captain bateman of the blackbirder nari he wondered and had captain batemans drunken mate died of delirium tremens yet  from which vain speculations bassett turned idly to review all that had occurred since that day on the beach of ringmanu when he first heard the sound and plunged into the jungle after it  sagawa had protested  he could see him yet his queer little monkeyish face eloquent with fear his back burdened with specimen cases in his hands bassetts butterfly net and naturalists shotgun as he quavered in bechedemer english  me fella too much fright along bush  bad fella boy too much stopm along bush  bassett smiled sadly at the recollection  the little new hanover boy had been frightened but had proved faithful following him without hesitancy into the bush in the quest after the source of the wonderful sound  no firehollowed treetrunk that throbbing war through the jungle depths had been bassetts conclusion erroneous had been his next conclusion namely that the source or cause could not be more distant than an hours walk and that he would easily be back by midafternoon to be picked up by the naris whaleboat  that big fella noise no good all the same devildevil sagawa had adjudged  and sagawa had been right  had he not had his head hacked off within the day  bassett shuddered  without doubt sagawa had been eaten as well by the bad fella boys too much that stopped along the bush  he could see him as he had last seen him stripped of the shotgun and all the naturalists gear of his master lying on the narrow trail where he had been decapitated barely the moment before  yes within a minute the thing had happened  within a minute looking back bassett had seen him trudging patiently along under his burdens  then bassetts own trouble had come upon him  he looked at the cruelly healed stumps of the first and second fingers of his left hand then rubbed them softly into the indentation in the back of his skull  quick as had been the flash of the long handled tomahawk he had been quick enough to duck away his head and partially to deflect the stroke with his upflung hand  two fingers and a hasty scalpwound had been the price he paid for his life  with one barrel of his ten gauge shotgun he had blown the life out of the bushman who had so nearly got him with the other barrel he had peppered the bushmen bending over sagawa and had the pleasure of knowing that the major portion of the charge had gone into the one who leaped away with sagawas head  everything had occurred in a flash  only himself the slain bushman and what remained of sagawa were in the narrow wildpig run of a path  from the dark jungle on either side came no rustle of movement or sound of life  and he had suffered distinct and dreadful shock  for the first time in his life he had killed a human being and he knew nausea as he contemplated the mess of his handiwork  then had begun the chase  he retreated up the pigrun before his hunters who were between him and the beach  how many there were he could not guess  there might have been one or a hundred for aught he saw of them  that some of them took to the trees and travelled along through the jungle roof he was certain but at the most he never glimpsed more than an occasional flitting of shadows no bowstrings twanged that he could hear but every little while whence discharged he knew not tiny arrows whispered past him or struck treeboles and fluttered to the ground beside him  they were bonetipped and feather shafted and the feathers torn from the breasts of hummingbirds iridesced like jewels  onceand now after the long lapse of time he chuckled gleefully at the recollectionhe had detected a shadow above him that came to instant rest as he turned his gaze upward  he could make out nothing but deciding to chance it had fired at it a heavy charge of number five shot  squalling like an infuriated cat the shadow crashed down through treeferns and orchids and thudded upon the earth at his feet and still squalling its rage and pain had sunk its human teeth into the ankle of his stout tramping boot  he on the other hand was not idle and with his free foot had done what reduced the squalling to silence  so inured to savagery has bassett since become that he chuckled again with the glee of the recollection  what a night had followed  small wonder that he had accumulated such a virulence and variety of fevers he thought as he recalled that sleepless night of torment when the throb of his wounds was as nothing compared with the myriad stings of the mosquitoes there had been no escaping them and he had not dared to light a fire  they had literally pumped his body full of poison so that with the coming of day eyes swollen almost shut he had stumbled blindly on not caring much when his head should be hacked off and his carcass started on the way of sagawas to the cooking fire twentyfour hours had made a wreck of himof mind as well as body he had scarcely retained his wits at all so maddened was he by the tremendous inoculation of poison he had received  several times he fired his shotgun with effect into the shadows that dogged him stinging day insects and gnats added to his torment while his bloody wounds attracted hosts of loathsome flies that clung sluggishly to his flesh and had to be brushed off and crushed off  once in that day he heard again the wonderful sound seemingly more distant but rising imperiously above the nearer wardrums in the bush  right there was where he had made his mistake  thinking that he had passed beyond it and that therefore it was between him and the beach of ringmanu he had worked back toward it when in reality he was penetrating deeper and deeper into the mysterious heart of the unexplored island  that night crawling in among the twisted roots of a banyan tree he had slept from exhaustion while the mosquitoes had had their will of him  followed days and nights that were vague as nightmares in his memory  one clear vision he remembered was of suddenly finding himself in the midst of a bush village and watching the old men and children fleeing into the jungle  all had fled but one  from close at hand and above him a whimpering as of some animal in pain and terror had startled him  and looking up he had seen hera girl or young woman rather suspended by one arm in the cooking sun  perhaps for days she had so hung  her swollen protruding tongue spoke as much  still alive she gazed at him with eyes of terror  past help he decided as he noted the swellings of her legs which advertised that the joints had been crushed and the great bones broken  he resolved to shoot her and there the vision terminated  he could not remember whether he had or not any more than could he remember how he chanced to be in that village or how he succeeded in getting away from it  many pictures unrelated came and went in bassetts mind as he reviewed that period of his terrible wanderings  he remembered invading another village of a dozen houses and driving all before him with his shotgun save for one old man too feeble to flee who spat at him and whined and snarled as he dug open a groundoven and from amid the hot stones dragged forth a roasted pig that steamed its essence deliciously through its greenleaf wrappings it was at this place that a wantonness of savagery had seized upon him  having feasted ready to depart with a hindquarter of the pig in his hand he deliberately fired the grass thatch of a house with his burning glass  but seared deepest of all in bassetts brain was the dank and noisome jungle  it actually stank with evil and it was always twilight  rarely did a shaft of sunlight penetrate its matted roof a hundred feet overhead  and beneath that roof was an aerial ooze of vegetation a monstrous parasitic dripping of decadent life forms that rooted in death and lived on death  and through all this he drifted ever pursued by the flitting shadows of the anthropophagi themselves ghosts of evil that dared not face him in battle but that knew that soon or late they would feed on him bassett remembered that at the time in lucid moments he had likened himself to a wounded bull pursued by plains coyotes too cowardly to battle with him for the meat of him yet certain of the inevitable end of him when they would be full gorged  as the bulls horns and stamping hoofs kept off the coyotes so his shot gun kept off these solomon islanders these twilight shades of bushmen of the island of guadalcanal  came the day of the grass lands  abruptly as if cloven by the sword of god in the hand of god the jungle terminated  the edge of it perpendicular and as black as the infamy of it was a hundred feet up and down  and beginning at the edge of it grew the grasssweet soft tender pasture grass that would have delighted the eyes and beasts of any husbandman and that extended on and on for leagues and leagues of velvet verdure to the backbone of the great island the towering mountain range flung up by some ancient earthcataclysm serrated and gullied but not yet erased by the erosive tropic rains  but the grass  he had crawled into it a dozen yards buried his face in it smelled it and broken down in a fit of involuntary weeping  and while he wept the wonderful sound had pealed forthif by peal he had often thought since an adequate description could be given of the enunciation of so vast a sound melting sweet  sweet it was as no sound ever heard  vast it was of so mighty a resonance that it might have proceeded from some brazenthroated monster  and yet it called to him across that leagueswide savannah and was like a benediction to his longsuffering pain racked spirit  he remembered how he lay there in the grass wetcheeked but no longer sobbing listening to the sound and wondering that he had been able to hear it on the beach of ringmanu  some freak of air pressures and air currents he reflected had made it possible for the sound to carry so far  such conditions might not happen again in a thousand days or ten thousand days but the one day it had happened had been the day he landed from the nari for several hours collecting  especially had he been in quest of the famed jungle butterfly a foot across from wingtip to wingtip as velvetdusky of lack of colour as was the gloom of the roof of such lofty arboreal habits that it resorted only to the jungle roof and could be brought down only by a dose of shot  it was for this purpose that sagawa had carried the tengauge shotgun  two days and nights he had spent crawling across that belt of grass land  he had suffered much but pursuit had ceased at the jungle edge  and he would have died of thirst had not a heavy thunderstorm revived him on the second day  and then had come balatta  in the first shade where the savannah yielded to the dense mountain jungle he had collapsed to die  at first she had squealed with delight at sight of his helplessness and was for beating his brain out with a stout forest branch perhaps it was his very utter helplessness that had appealed to her and perhaps it was her human curiosity that made her refrain at any rate she had refrained for he opened his eyes again under the impending blow and saw her studying him intently  what especially struck her about him were his blue eyes and white skin coolly she had squatted on her hams spat on his arm and with her fingertips scrubbed away the dirt of days and nights of muck and jungle that sullied the pristine whiteness of his skin  and everything about her had struck him especially although there was nothing conventional about her at all  he laughed weakly at the recollection for she had been as innocent of garb as eve before the figleaf adventure  squat and lean at the same time asymmetrically limbed stringmuscled as if with lengths of cordage dirtcaked from infancy save for casual showers she was as unbeautiful a prototype of woman as he with a scientists eye had ever gazed upon  her breasts advertised at the one time her maturity and youth and if by nothing else her sex was advertised by the one article of finery with which she was adorned namely a pigs tail thrust though a hole in her left earlobe  so lately had the tail been severed that its raw end still oozed blood that dried upon her shoulder like so much candledroppings  and her face  a twisted and wizened complex of apish features perforated by upturned skyopen mongolian nostrils by a mouth that sagged from a huge upperlip and faded precipitately into a retreating chin by peering querulous eyes that blinked as blink the eyes of denizens of monkeycages  not even the water she brought him in a forestleaf and the ancient and halfputrid chunk of roast pig could redeem in the slightest the grotesque hideousness of her  when he had eaten weakly for a space he closed his eyes in order not to see her although again and again she poked them open to peer at the blue of them  then had come the sound  nearer much nearer he knew it to be and he knew equally well despite the weary way he had come that it was still many hours distant  the effect of it on her had been startling  she cringed under it with averted face moaning and chattering with fear  but after it had lived its full life of an hour he closed his eyes and fell asleep with balatta brushing the flies from him  when he awoke it was night and she was gone  but he was aware of renewed strength and by then too thoroughly inoculated by the mosquito poison to suffer further inflammation he closed his eyes and slept an unbroken stretch till sunup  a little later balatta had returned bringing with her a halfdozen women who unbeautiful as they were were patently not so unbeautiful as she  she evidenced by her conduct that she considered him her find her property and the pride she took in showing him off would have been ludicrous had his situation not been so desperate  later after what had been to him a terrible journey of miles when he collapsed in front of the devildevil house in the shadow of the breadfruit tree she had shown very lively ideas on the matter of retaining possession of him  ngurn whom bassett was to know afterward as the devildevil doctor priest or medicine man of the village had wanted his head  others of the grinning and chattering monkeymen all as stark of clothes and bestial of appearance as balatta had wanted his body for the roasting oven at that time he had not understood their language if by language might be dignified the uncouth sounds they made to represent ideas but bassett had thoroughly understood the matter of debate especially when the men pressed and prodded and felt of the flesh of him as if he were so much commodity in a butchers stall  balatta had been losing the debate rapidly when the accident happened  one of the men curiously examining bassetts shotgun managed to cock and pull a trigger  the recoil of the butt into the pit of the mans stomach had not been the most sanguinary result for the charge of shot at a distance of a yard had blown the head of one of the debaters into nothingness  even balatta joined the others in flight and ere they returned his senses already reeling from the oncoming feverattack bassett had regained possession of the gun  whereupon although his teeth chattered with the ague and his swimming eyes could scarcely see he held on to his fading consciousness until he could intimidate the bushmen with the simple magics of compass watch burning glass and matches  at the last with due emphasis of solemnity and awfulness he had killed a young pig with his shotgun and promptly fainted  bassett flexed his armmuscles in quest of what possible strength might reside in such weakness and dragged himself slowly and totteringly to his feet  he was shockingly emaciated yet during the various convalescences of the many months of his long sickness he had never regained quite the same degree of strength as this time  what he feared was another relapse such as he had already frequently experienced  without drugs without even quinine he had managed so far to live through a combination of the most pernicious and most malignant of malarial and blackwater fevers but could he continue to endure  such was his everlasting query for like the genuine scientist he was he would not be content to die until he had solved the secret of the sound  supported by a staff he staggered the few steps to the devildevil house where death and ngurn reigned in gloom  almost as infamously dark and evilstinking as the jungle was the devildevil housein bassetts opinion  yet therein was usually to be found his favourite crony and gossip ngurn always willing for a yarn or a discussion the while he sat in the ashes of death and in a slow smoke shrewdly revolved curing human heads suspended from the rafters  for through the months interval of consciousness of his long sickness bassett had mastered the psychological simplicities and lingual difficulties of the language of the tribe of ngurn and balatta and vngngnthe latter the addleheaded young chief who was ruled by ngurn and who whispered intrigue had it was the son of ngurn  will the red one speak today bassett asked by this time so accustomed to the old mans gruesome occupation as to take even an interest in the progress of the smokecuring  with the eye of an expert ngurn examined the particular head he was at work upon  it will be ten days before i can say finish he said  never has any man fixed heads like these  bassett smiled inwardly at the old fellows reluctance to talk with him of the red one  it had always been so  never by any chance had ngurn or any other member of the weird tribe divulged the slightest hint of any physical characteristic of the red one physical the red one must be to emit the wonderful sound and though it was called the red one bassett could not be sure that red represented the colour of it  red enough were the deeds and powers of it from what abstract clues he had gleaned  not alone had ngurn informed him was the red one more bestial powerful than the neighbour tribal gods ever athirst for the red blood of living human sacrifices but the neighbour gods themselves were sacrificed and tormented before him  he was the god of a dozen allied villages similar to this one which was the central and commanding village of the federation  by virtue of the red one many alien villages had been devastated and even wiped out the prisoners sacrificed to the red one  this was true today and it extended back into old history carried down by word of mouth through the generations  when he ngurn had been a young man the tribes beyond the grass lands had made a war raid  in the counter raid ngurn and his fighting folk had made many prisoners  of children alone over five score living had been bled white before the red one and many many more men and women  the thunderer was another of ngurns names for the mysterious deity  also at times was he called the loud shouter the god voiced the birdthroated the one with the throat sweet as the throat of the honeybird the sun singer and the starborn  why the starborn  in vain bassett interrogated ngurn  according to that old devildevil doctor the red one had always been just where he was at present for ever singing and thundering his will over men  but ngurns father wrapped in decaying grassmatting and hanging even then over their heads among the smoky rafters of the devildevil house had held otherwise  that departed wise one had believed that the red one came from out of the starry night else whyso his argument had runhad the old and forgotten ones passed his name down as the starborn  bassett could not but recognize something cogent in such argument  but ngurn affirmed the long years of his long life wherein he had gazed upon many starry nights yet never had he found a star on grass land or in jungle depthand he had looked for them  true he had beheld shooting stars this in reply to bassetts contention but likewise had he beheld the phosphorescence of fungoid growths and rotten meat and fireflies on dark nights and the flames of wood fires and of blazing candlenuts yet what were flame and blaze and glow when they had flamed and blazed and glowed  answer memories memories only of things which had ceased to be like memories of matings accomplished of feasts forgotten of desires that were the ghosts of desires flaring flaming burning yet unrealized in achievement of easement and satisfaction  where was the appetite of yesterday the roasted flesh of the wild pig the hunters arrow failed to slay the maid unwed and dead ere the young man knew her  a memory was not a star was ngurns contention  how could a memory be a star  further after all his long life he still observed the starry nightsky unaltered  never had he noted the absence of a single star from its accustomed place  besides stars were fire and the red one was not firewhich last involuntary betrayal told bassett nothing  will the red one speak tomorrow he queried  ngurn shrugged his shoulders as who should say  and the day afterand the day after that bassett persisted  i would like to have the curing of your head ngurn changed the subject  it is different from any other head  no devildevil has a head like it  besides i would cure it well  i would take months and months  the moons would come and the moons would go and the smoke would be very slow and i should myself gather the materials for the curing smoke  the skin would not wrinkle  it would be as smooth as your skin now  he stood up and from the dim rafters grimed with the smoking of countless heads where day was no more than a gloom took down a mattingwrapped parcel and began to open it  it is a head like yours he said but it is poorly cured  bassett had pricked up his ears at the suggestion that it was a white mans head for he had long since come to accept that these jungledwellers in the midmost centre of the great island had never had intercourse with white men  certainly he had found them without the almost universal bechedemer english of the west south pacific  nor had they knowledge of tobacco nor of gunpowder their few precious knives made from lengths of hoopiron and their few and more precious tomahawks from cheap trade hatchets he had surmised they had captured in war from the bushmen of the jungle beyond the grass lands and that they in turn had similarly gained them from the saltwater men who fringed the coral beaches of the shore and had contact with the occasional white men  the folk in the out beyond do not know how to cure heads old ngurn explained as he drew forth from the filthy matting and placed in bassetts hands an indubitable white mans head  ancient it was beyond question white it was as the blond hair attested  he could have sworn it once belonged to an englishman and to an englishman of long before by token of the heavy gold circlets still threaded in the withered earlobes  now your head     the devildevil doctor began on his favourite topic  ill tell you what bassett interrupted struck by a new idea when i die ill let you have my head to cure if first you take me to look upon the red one  i will have your head anyway when you are dead ngurn rejected the proposition  he added with the brutal frankness of the savage  besides you have not long to live  you are almost a dead man now  you will grow less strong  in not many months i shall have you here turning and turning in the smoke  it is pleasant through the long afternoons to turn the head of one you have known as well as i know you  and i shall talk to you and tell you the many secrets you want to know  which will not matter for you will be dead  ngurn bassett threatened in sudden anger  you know the baby thunder in the iron that is mine  this was in reference to his allpotent and allawful shotgun  i can kill you any time and then you will not get my head  just the same will vngngn or some one else of my folk get it ngurn complacently assured him  and just the same will it turn here in the and turn devildevil house in the smoke  the quicker you slay me with your baby thunder the quicker will your head turn in the smoke  and bassett knew he was beaten in the discussion  what was the red onebassett asked himself a thousand times in the succeeding week while he seemed to grow stronger  what was the source of the wonderful sound  what was this sun singer this starborn one this mysterious deity as bestialconducted as the black and kinkyheaded and monkeylike human beasts who worshipped it and whose silversweet bullmouthed singing and commanding he had heard at the taboo distance for so long  ngurn had he failed to bribe with the inevitable curing of his head when he was dead  vngngn imbecile and chief that he was was too imbecilic too much under the sway of ngurn to be considered remained balatta who from the time she found him and poked his blue eyes open to recrudescence of her grotesque female hideousness had continued his adorer  woman she was and he had long known that the only way to win from her treason of her tribe was through the womans heart of her  bassett was a fastidious man  he had never recovered from the initial horror caused by balattas female awfulness  back in england even at best the charm of woman to him had never been robust  yet now resolutely as only a man can do who is capable of martyring himself for the cause of science he proceeded to violate all the fineness and delicacy of his nature by making love to the unthinkably disgusting bushwoman  he shuddered but with averted face hid his grimaces and swallowed his gorge as he put his arm around her dirtcrusted shoulders and felt the contact of her rancidoily and kinky hair with his neck and chin  but he nearly screamed when she succumbed to that caress so at the very first of the courtship and mowed and gibbered and squealed little queer piglike gurgly noises of delight  it was too much  and the next he did in the singular courtship was to take her down to the stream and give her a vigorous scrubbing  from then on he devoted himself to her like a true swain as frequently and for as long at a time as his will could override his repugnance  but marriage which she ardently suggested with due observance of tribal custom he balked at  fortunately taboo rule was strong in the tribe  thus ngurn could never touch bone or flesh or hide of crocodile  this had been ordained at his birth vngngn was denied ever the touch of woman  such pollution did it chance to occur could be purged only by the death of the offending female  it had happened once since bassetts arrival when a girl of nine running in play stumbled and fell against the sacred chief  and the girlchild was seen no more  in whispers balatta told bassett that she had been three days and nights in dying before the red one  as for balatta the breadfruit was taboo to her  for which bassett was thankful  the taboo might have been water  for himself he fabricated a special taboo  only could he marry he explained when the southern cross rode highest in the sky knowing his astronomy he thus gained a reprieve of nearly nine months and he was confident that within that time he would either be dead or escaped to the coast with full knowledge of the red one and of the source of the red ones wonderful voice  at first he had fancied the red one to be some colossal statue like memnon rendered vocal under certain temperature conditions of sunlight but when after a war raid a batch of prisoners was brought in and the sacrifice made at night in the midst of rain when the sun could play no part the red one had been more vocal than usual bassett discarded that hypothesis  in company with balatta sometimes with men and parties of women the freedom of the jungle was his for three quadrants of the compass  but the fourth quadrant which contained the red ones abiding place was taboo  he made more thorough love to balatta also saw to it that she scrubbed herself more frequently  eternal female she was capable of any treason for the sake of love  and though the sight of her was provocative of nausea and the contact of her provocative of despair although he could not escape her awfulness in his dreamhaunted nightmares of her he nevertheless was aware of the cosmic verity of sex that animated her and that made her own life of less value than the happiness of her lover with whom she hoped to mate  juliet or balatta  where was the intrinsic difference  the soft and tender product of ultra civilization or her bestial prototype of a hundred thousand years before herthere was no difference  bassett was a scientist first a humanist afterward  in the jungleheart of guadalcanal he put the affair to the test as in the laboratory he would have put to the test any chemical reaction he increased his feigned ardour for the bushwoman at the same time increasing the imperiousness of his will of desire over her to be led to look upon the red one face to face  it was the old story he recognized that the woman must pay and it occurred when the two of them one day were catching the unclassified and unnamed little black fish an inch long halfeel and halfscaled rotund with salmongolden roe that frequented the fresh water and that were esteemed raw and whole fresh or putrid a perfect delicacy prone in the muck of the decaying junglefloor balatta threw herself clutching his ankles with her hands kissing his feet and making slubbery noises that chilled his backbone up and down again she begged him to kill her rather than exact this ultimate love payment  she told him of the penalty of breaking the taboo of the red onea week of torture living the details of which she yammered out from her face in the mire until he realized that he was yet a tyro in knowledge of the frightfulness the human was capable of wreaking on the human  yet did bassett insist on having his mans will satisfied at the womans risk that he might solve the mystery of the red ones singing though she should die long and horribly and screaming and balatta being mere woman yielded  she led him into the forbidden quadrant  an abrupt mountain shouldering in from the north to meet a similar intrusion from the south tormented the stream in which they had fished into a deep and gloomy gorge after a mile along the gorge the way plunged sharply upward until they crossed a saddle of raw limestone which attracted his geologists eye  still climbing although he paused often from sheer physical weakness they scaled forestclad heights until they emerged on a naked mesa or tableland  bassett recognized the stuff of its composition as black volcanic sand and knew that a pocket magnet could have captured a full load of the sharply angular grains he trod upon  and then holding balatta by the hand and leading her onward he came to ita tremendous pit obviously artificial in the heart of the plateau  old history the south seas sailing directions scores of remembered data and connotations swift and furious surged through his brain  it was mendana who had discovered the islands and named them solomons believing that he had found that monarchs fabled mines  they had laughed at the old navigators childlike credulity and yet here stood himself bassett on the rim of an excavation for all the world like the diamond pits of south africa  but no diamond this that he gazed down upon  rather was it a pearl with the depth of iridescence of a pearl but of a size all pearls of earth and time welded into one could not have totalled and of a colour undreamed of in any pearl or of anything else for that matter for it was the colour of the red one  and the red one himself bassett knew it to be on the instant  a perfect sphere full two hundred feet in diameter the top of it was a hundred feet below the level of the rim  he likened the colour quality of it to lacquer  indeed he took it to be some sort of lacquer applied by man but a lacquer too marvellously clever to have been manufactured by the bushfolk  brighter than bright cherryred its richness of colour was as if it were red builded upon red  it glowed and iridesced in the sunlight as if gleaming up from underlay under underlay of red  in vain balatta strove to dissuade him from descending  she threw herself in the dirt but when he continued down the trail that spiralled the pitwall she followed cringing and whimpering her terror  that the red sphere had been dug out as a precious thing was patent  considering the paucity of members of the federated twelve villages and their primitive tools and methods bassett knew that the toil of a myriad generations could scarcely have made that enormous excavation  he found the pit bottom carpeted with human bones among which battered and defaced lay village gods of wood and stone  some covered with obscene totemic figures and designs were carved from solid tree trunks forty or fifty feet in length  he noted the absence of the shark and turtle gods so common among the shore villages and was amazed at the constant recurrence of the helmet motive  what did these jungle savages of the dark heart of guadalcanal know of helmets  had mendanas menatarms worn helmets and penetrated here centuries before  and if not then whence had the bushfolk caught the motive  advancing over the litter of gods and bones balatta whimpering at his heels bassett entered the shadow of the red one and passed on under its gigantic overhang until he touched it with his finger tips  no lacquer that  nor was the surface smooth as it should have been in the case of lacquer  on the contrary it was corrugated and pitted with here and there patches that showed signs of heat and fusing  also the substance of it was metal though unlike any metal or combination of metals he had ever known  as for the colour itself he decided it to be no application  it was the intrinsic colour of the metal itself  he moved his fingertips which up to that had merely rested along the surface and felt the whole gigantic sphere quicken and live and respond  it was incredible  so light a touch on so vast a mass  yet did it quiver under the fingertip caress in rhythmic vibrations that became whisperings and rustlings and mutterings of soundbut of sound so different so elusively thin that it was shimmeringly sibilant so mellow that it was maddening sweet piping like an elfin horn which last was just what bassett decided would be like a peal from some bell of the gods reaching earthward from across space  he looked at balatta with swift questioning but the voice of the red one he had evoked had flung her face downward and moaning among the bones  he returned to contemplation of the prodigy  hollow it was and of no metal known on earth was his conclusion  it was rightnamed by the ones of oldtime as the starborn  only from the stars could it have come and no thing of chance was it  it was a creation of artifice and mind  such perfection of form such hollowness that it certainly possessed could not be the result of mere fortuitousness  a child of intelligences remote and unguessable working corporally in metals it indubitably was  he stared at it in amaze his brain a racing wildfire of hypotheses to account for this farjourneyer who had adventured the night of space threaded the stars and now rose before him and above him exhumed by patient anthropophagi pitted and lacquered by its fiery bath in two atmospheres  but was the colour a lacquer of heat upon some familiar metal  or was it an intrinsic quality of the metal itself  he thrust in the bluepoint of his pocketknife to test the constitution of the stuff  instantly the entire sphere burst into a mighty whispering sharp with protest almost twanging goldenly if a whisper could possibly be considered to twang rising higher sinking deeper the two extremes of the registry of sound threatening to complete the circle and coalesce into the bullmouthed thundering he had so often heard beyond the taboo distance  forgetful of safety of his own life itself entranced by the wonder of the unthinkable and unguessable thing he raised his knife to strike heavily from a long stroke but was prevented by balatta  she upreared on her own knees in an agony of terror clasping his knees and supplicating him to desist  in the intensity of her desire to impress him she put her forearm between her teeth and sank them to the bone  he scarcely observed her act although he yielded automatically to his gentler instincts and withheld the knifehack  to him human life had dwarfed to microscopic proportions before this colossal portent of higher life from within the distances of the sidereal universe  as had she been a dog he kicked the ugly little bushwoman to her feet and compelled her to start with him on an encirclement of the base  part way around he encountered horrors even among the others did he recognize the sunshrivelled remnant of the nineyears girl who had accidentally broken chief vngngns personality taboo  and among what was left of these that had passed he encountered what was left of one who had not yet passed truly had the bushfolk named themselves into the name of the red one seeing in him their own image which they strove to placate and please with such red offerings  farther around always treading the bones and images of humans and gods that constituted the floor of this ancient charnelhouse of sacrifice he came upon the device by which the red one was made to send his call singing thunderingly across the junglebelts and grasslands to the far beach of ringmanu  simple and primitive was it as was the red ones consummate artifice  a great kingpost half a hundred feet in length seasoned by centuries of superstitious care carven into dynasties of gods each superimposed each helmeted each seated in the open mouth of a crocodile was slung by ropes twisted of climbing vegetable parasites from the apex of a tripod of three great forest trunks themselves carved into grinning and grotesque adumbrations of mans modern concepts of art and god  from the striker kingpost were suspended ropes of climbers to which men could apply their strength and direction  like a battering ram this kingpost could be driven endonward against the mighty rediridescent sphere  here was where ngurn officiated and functioned religiously for himself and the twelve tribes under him  bassett laughed aloud almost with madness at the thought of this wonderful messenger winged with intelligence across space to fall into a bushman stronghold and be worshipped by apelike maneating and head hunting savages  it was as if gods world had fallen into the muck mire of the abyss underlying the bottom of hell as if jehovahs commandments had been presented on carved stone to the monkeys of the monkey cage at the zoo as if the sermon on the mount had been preached in a roaring bedlam of lunatics   the slow weeks passed  the nights by election bassett spent on the ashen floor of the devildevil house beneath the ever swinging slowcuring heads  his reason for this was that it was taboo to the lesser sex of woman and therefore a refuge for him from balatta who grew more persecutingly and perilously loverly as the southern cross rode higher in the sky and marked the imminence of her nuptials  his days bassett spent in a hammock swung under the shade of the great breadfruit tree before the devildevil house  there were breaks in this programme when in the comas of his devastating feverattacks he lay for days and nights in the house of heads  ever he struggled to combat the fever to live to continue to live to grow strong and stronger against the day when he would be strong enough to dare the grasslands and the belted jungle beyond and win to the beach and to some labourrecruiting blackbirding ketch or schooner and on to civilization and the men of civilization to whom he could give news of the message from other worlds that lay darkly worshipped by beastmen in the black heart of guadalcanals midmost centre  on the other nights lying late under the breadfruit tree bassett spent long hours watching the slow setting of the western stars beyond the black wall of jungle where it had been thrust back by the clearing for the village  possessed of more than a cursory knowledge of astronomy he took a sick mans pleasure in speculating as to the dwellers on the unseen worlds of those incredibly remote suns to haunt whose houses of light life came forth a shy visitant from the rayless crypts of matter  he could no more apprehend limits to time than bounds to space  no subversive radium speculations had shaken his steady scientific faith in the conservation of energy and the indestructibility of matter  always and forever must there have been stars  and surely in that cosmic ferment all must be comparatively alike comparatively of the same substance or substances save for the freaks of the ferment  all must obey or compose the same laws that ran without infraction through the entire experience of man therefore he argued and agreed must worlds and life be appanages to all the suns as they were appanages to the particular of his own solar system  even as he lay here under the breadfruit tree an intelligence that stared across the starry gulfs so must all the universe be exposed to the ceaseless scrutiny of innumerable eyes like his though grantedly different with behind them by the same token intelligences that questioned and sought the meaning and the construction of the whole  so reasoning he felt his soul go forth in kinship with that august company that multitude whose gaze was forever upon the arras of infinity  who were they what were they those far distant and superior ones who had bridged the sky with their gigantic rediridescent heavensinging message  surely and long since had they too trod the path on which man had so recently by the calendar of the cosmos set his feet  and to be able to send a message across the pit of space surely they had reached those heights to which man in tears and travail and bloody sweat in darkness and confusion of many counsels was so slowly struggling  and what were they on their heights  had they won brotherhood  or had they learned that the law of love imposed the penalty of weakness and decay  was strife life  was the rule of all the universe the pitiless rule of natural selection  and and most immediately and poignantly were their far conclusions their longwon wisdoms shut even then in the huge metallic heart of the red one waiting for the first earthman to read  of one thing he was certain  no drop of red dew shaken from the lionmane of some sun in torment was the sounding sphere  it was of design not chance and it contained the speech and wisdom of the stars  what engines and elements and mastered forces what lore and mysteries and destinycontrols might be there  undoubtedly since so much could be enclosed in so little a thing as the foundation stone of a public building this enormous sphere should contain vast histories profounds of research achieved beyond mans wildest guesses laws and formulae that easily mastered would make mans life on earth individual and collective spring up from its present mire to inconceivable heights of purity and power  it was times greatest gift to blindfold insatiable and skyaspiring man  and to him bassett had been vouchsafed the lordly fortune to be the first to receive this message from mans interstellar kin   no white man much less no outland man of the other bushtribes had gazed upon the red one and lived  such the law expounded by ngurn to bassett  there was such a thing as blood brotherhood bassett in return had often argued in the past  but ngurn had stated solemnly no  even the blood brotherhood was outside the favour of the red one  only a man born within the tribe could look upon the red one and live  but now his guilty secret known only to balatta whose fear of immolation before the red one fastsealed her lips the situation was different  what he had to do was to recover from the abominable fevers that weakened him and gain to civilization  then would he lead an expedition back and although the entire population of guadalcanal he destroyed extract from the heart of the red one the message of the world from other worlds  but bassetts relapses grew more frequent his brief convalescences less and less vigorous his periods of coma longer until he came to know beyond the last promptings of the optimism inherent in so tremendous a constitution as his own that he would never live to cross the grass lands perforate the perilous coast jungle and reach the sea  he faded as the southern cross rose higher in the sky till even balatta knew that he would be dead ere the nuptial date determined by his taboo  ngurn made pilgrimage personally and gathered the smoke materials for the curing of bassetts head and to him made proud announcement and exhibition of the artistic perfectness of his intention when bassett should be dead  as for himself bassett was not shocked  too long and too deeply had life ebbed down in him to bite him with fear of its impending extinction  he continued to persist alternating periods of unconsciousness with periods of semiconsciousness dreamy and unreal in which he idly wondered whether he had ever truly beheld the red one or whether it was a nightmare fancy of delirium  came the day when all mists and cobwebs dissolved when he found his brain clear as a bell and took just appraisement of his bodys weakness  neither hand nor foot could he lift  so little control of his body did he have that he was scarcely aware of possessing one  lightly indeed his flesh sat upon his soul and his soul in its briefness of clarity knew by its very clarity that the black of cessation was near  he knew the end was close knew that in all truth he had with his eyes beheld the red one the messenger between the worlds knew that he would never live to carry that message to the worldthat message for aught to the contrary which might already have waited mans hearing in the heart of guadalcanal for ten thousand years  and bassett stirred with resolve calling ngurn to him out under the shade of the breadfruit tree and with the old devildevil doctor discussing the terms and arrangements of his last life effort his final adventure in the quick of the flesh  i know the law o ngurn he concluded the matter  whoso is not of the folk may not look upon the red one and live  i shall not live anyway  your young men shall carry me before the face of the red one and i shall look upon him and hear his voice and thereupon die under your hand o ngurn  thus will the three things be satisfied  the law my desire and your quicker possession of my head for which all your preparations wait  to which ngurn consented adding  it is better so  a sick man who cannot get well is foolish to live on for so little a while  also is it better for the living that he should go  you have been much in the way of late  not but what it was good for me to talk to such a wise one  but for moons of days we have held little talk  instead you have taken up room in the house of heads making noises like a dying pig or talking much and loudly in your own language which i do not understand this has been a confusion to me for i like to think on the great things of the light and dark as i turn the heads in the smoke your much noise has thus been a disturbance to the longlearning and hatching of the final wisdom that will be mine before i die as for you upon whom the dark has already brooded it is well that you die now  and i promise you in the long days to come when i turn your head in the smoke no man of the tribe shall come in to disturb us  and i will tell you many secrets for i am an old man and very wise and i shall be adding wisdom to wisdom as i turn your head in the smoke  so a litter was made and borne on the shoulders of half a dozen of the men bassett departed on the last little adventure that was to cap the total adventure for him of living  with a body of which he was scarcely aware for even the pain had been exhausted out of it and with a bright clear brain that accommodated him to a quiet ecstasy of sheer lucidness of thought he lay back on the lurching litter and watched the fading of the passing world beholding for the last time the breadfruit tree before the devil devil house the dim day beneath the matted jungle roof the gloomy gorge between the shouldering mountains the saddle of raw limestone and the mesa of black volcanic sand  down the spiral path of the pit they bore him encircling the sheening glowing red one that seemed ever imminent to iridesce from colour and light into sweet singing and thunder  and over bones and logs of immolated men and gods they bore him past the horrors of other immolated ones that yet lived to the threeking post tripod and the huge kingpost striker  here bassett helped by ngurn and balatta weakly sat up swaying weakly from the hips and with clear unfaltering allseeing eyes gazed upon the red one  once o ngurn he said not taking his eyes from the sheening vibrating surface whereon and wherein all the shades of cherryred played unceasingly ever aquiver to change into sound to become silken rustlings silvery whisperings golden thrummings of cords velvet pipings of elfland mellow distances of thunderings  i wait ngurn prompted after a long pause the longhandled tomahawk unassumingly ready in his hand  once o ngurn bassett repeated let the red one speak so that i may see it speak as well as hear it  then strike thus when i raise my hand for when i raise my hand i shall drop my head forward and make place for the stroke at the base of my neck  but o ngurn i who am about to pass out of the light of day for ever would like to pass with the wondervoice of the red one singing greatly in my ears  and i promise you that never will a head be so well cured as yours ngurn assured him at the same time signalling the tribesmen to man the propelling ropes suspended from the kingpost striker  your head shall be my greatest piece of work in the curing of heads  bassett smiled quietly to the old ones conceit as the great carved log drawn back through twoscore feet of space was released  the next moment he was lost in ecstasy at the abrupt and thunderous liberation of sound  but such thunder  mellow it was with preciousness of all sounding metals  archangels spoke in it it was magnificently beautiful before all other sounds it was invested with the intelligence of supermen of planets of other suns it was the voice of god seducing and commanding to be heard andthe everlasting miracle of that interstellar metal bassett with his own eyes saw colour and colours transform into sound till the whole visible surface of the vast sphere was acrawl and titillant and vaporous with what he could not tell was colour or was sound  in that moment the interstices of matter were his and the interfusings and intermating transfusings of matter and force  time passed  at the last bassett was brought back from his ecstasy by an impatient movement of ngurn  he had quite forgotten the old devildevil one  a quick flash of fancy brought a husky chuckle into bassetts throat  his shotgun lay beside him in the litter all he had to do muzzle to head was to press the trigger and blow his head into nothingness  but why cheat him was bassetts next thought  headhunting cannibal beast of a human that was as much ape as human nevertheless old ngurn had according to his lights played squarer than square  ngurn was in himself a forerunner of ethics and contract of consideration and gentleness in man  no bassett decided it would be a ghastly pity and an act of dishonour to cheat the old fellow at the last  his head was ngurns and ngurns head to cure it would be  and bassett raising his hand in signal bending forward his head as agreed so as to expose cleanly the articulation to his taut spinal cord forgot balatta who was merely a woman a woman merely and only and undesired  he knew without seeing when the razor edged hatchet rose in the air behind him  and for that instant ere the end there fell upon bassett the shadows of the unknown a sense of impending marvel of the rending of walls before the imaginable  almost when he knew the blow had started and just ere the edge of steel bit the flesh and nerves it seemed that he gazed upon the serene face of the medusa truthand simultaneous with the bite of the steel on the onrush of the dark in a flashing instant of fancy he saw the vision of his head turning slowly always turning in the devildevil house beside the breadfruit tree   waikiki honolulu may 22 1916     story  the hussy     there are some stories that have to be truethe sort that cannot be fabricated by a ready fictionreckoner  and by the same token there are some men with stories to tell who cannot be doubted such a man was julian jones  although i doubt if the average reader of this will believe the story julian jones told me nevertheless i believe it  so thoroughly am i convinced of its verity that i am willing nay eager to invest capital in the enterprise and embark personally on the adventure to a far land  it was in the australian building at the panama pacific exposition that i met him  i was standing before an exhibit of facsimiles of the record nuggets which had been discovered in the goldfields of the antipodes  knobbed misshapen and massive it was as difficult to believe that they were not real gold as it was to believe the accompanying statistics of their weights and values  thats what those kangaroohunters call a nugget boomed over my shoulder directly at the largest of the specimens  i turned and looked up into the dim blue eyes of julian jones  i looked up for he stood something like six feet four inches in height  his hair a wispy sandy yellow seemed as dimmed and faded as his eyes  it may have been the sun which had washed out his colouring at least his face bore the evidence of a prodigious and ardent sunburn which had long since faded to yellow  as his eyes turned from the exhibit and focussed on mine i noted a queer look in them as of one who vainly tries to recall some fact of supreme importance  whats the matter with it as a nugget  i demanded  the remote indwelling expression went out of his eyes as he boomed  why its size  it does seem large i admitted  but theres no doubt its authentic  the australian government would scarcely dare  large he interrupted with a sniff and a sneer  largest ever discovered i started on  ever discovered  his dim eyes smouldered hotly as he proceeded do you think that every lump of gold ever discovered has got into the newspapers and encyclopedias  well i replied judicially if theres one that hasnt i dont see how were to know about it  if a really big nugget or nugget finder elects to blush unseen  but it didnt he broke in quickly  i saw it with my own eyes and besides im too tanned to blush anyway  im a railroad man and ive been in the tropics a lot  why i used to be the colour of mahoganyreal old mahogany and have been taken for a blueeyed spaniard more than once  it was my turn to interrupt and i did  was that nugget bigger than those in there mrer  jones julian jones is my name  he dug into an inner pocket and produced an envelope addressed to such a person care of general delivery san francisco and i in turn presented him with my card  pleased to know you sir he said extending his hand his voice booming as if accustomed to loud noises or wide spaces  of course ive heard of you seen your picture in the papers and all that and though i say it that shouldnt i want to say that i didnt care a rap about those articles you wrote on mexico  youre wrong all wrong  you make the mistake of all gringos in thinking a mexican is a white man  he aint  none of them aintgreasers spiggoties latinamericans and all the rest of the cattle  why sir they dont think like we think or reason or act  even their multiplication table is different  you think seven times seven is fortynine but not them  they work it out different  and white isnt white to them either  let me give you an example  buying coffee retail for housekeeping in onepound or tenpound lots  how big was that nugget you referred to i queried firmly  as big as the biggest of those  bigger he said quietly  bigger than the whole blamed exhibit of them put together and then some  he paused and regarded me with a steadfast gaze  i dont see no reason why i shouldnt go into the matter with you  youve got a reputation a man ought to be able to trust and ive read youve done some tall skylarking yourself in outoftheway places  ive been browsing around with an eye open for some one to go in with me on the proposition  you can trust me i said  and here i am blazing out into print with the whole story just as he told it to me as we sat on a bench by the lagoon before the palace of fine arts with the cries of the sea gulls in our ears well he should have kept his appointment with me  but i anticipate  as we started to leave the building and hunt for a seat a small woman possibly thirty years of age with a washedout complexion of the farmers wife sort darted up to him in a birdlike way for all the world like the darting veering gulls over our heads and fastened herself to his arm with the accuracy and dispatch and inevitableness of a piece of machinery  there you go she shrilled  atrottin right off and never givin me a thought  i was formally introduced to her  it was patent that she had never heard of me and she surveyed me bleakly with shrewd black eyes set close together and as beady and restless as a birds  you aint goin to tell him about that hussy she complained  well now sarah this is business you see he argued plaintively  ive been lookin for a likely man this long while and now that hes shown up it seems to me i got a right to give him the hang of what happened  the small woman made no reply but set her thin lips in a needle like line  she gazed straight before her at the tower of jewels with so austere an expression that no glint of refracted sunlight could soften it  we proceeded slowly to the lagoon managed to obtain an unoccupied seat and sat down with mutual sighs of relief as we released our weights from our tortured sightseeing feet  one does get so mortal weary asserted the small woman almost defiantly  two swans waddled up from the mirroring water and investigated us when their suspicions of our niggardliness or lack of peanuts had been confirmed jones halfturned his back on his lifepartner and gave me his story  ever been in ecuador  then take my adviceand dont  though i take that back for you and me might be hitting it for there together if you can rustle up the faith in me and the backbone in yourself for the trip  well anyway it aint so many years ago that i came ambling in there on a rusty foulbottomed tramp collier from australia fortythree days from land to land  seven knots was her speed when everything favoured and wed had a two weeks gale to the northard of new zealand and broke our engines down for two days off pitcairn island  i was no sailor on her  im a locomotive engineer  but id made friends with the skipper at newcastle an come along as his guest for as far as guayaquil  you see id heard wages was way up on the american railroad runnin from that place over the andes to quito  now guayaquil  is a feverhole i interpolated  julian jones nodded  thomas nast died there of it within a month after he landedhe was our great american cartoonist i added  dont know him julian jones said shortly  but i do know he wasnt the first to pass out by a long shot  why look you the way i found it  the pilot grounds is sixty miles down the river hows the fever said i to the pilot who came aboard in the early morning  see that hamburg barque said he pointing to a sizable ship at anchor  captain and fourteen men dead of it already and the cook and two men dying right now and theyre the last left of her  and by jinks he told the truth  and right then they were dying forty a day in guayaquil of yellow jack  but that was nothing as i was to find out  bubonic plague and smallpox were raging while dysentery and pneumonia were reducing the population and the railroad was raging worst of all  i mean that  for them that insisted in riding on it it was more dangerous than all the other diseases put together  when we dropped anchor off guayaquil half a dozen skippers from other steamers came on board to warn our skipper not to let any of his crew or officers go ashore except the ones he wanted to lose a launch came off for me from duran which is on the other side of the river and is the terminal of the railroad  and it brought off a man that soared up the gangway three jumps at a time he was that eager to get aboard  when he hit the deck he hadnt time to speak to any of us  he just leaned out over the rail and shook his fist at duran and shouted  i beat you to it  i beat you to it  whod you beat to it friend i asked  the railroad he said as he unbuckled the straps and took off a big 44 colts automatic from where he wore it handy on his left side under his coat i staved as long as i agreedthree monthsand it didnt get me  i was a conductor  and that was the railroad i was to work for  all of which was nothing to what he told me in the next few minutes  the road ran from sea level at duran up to twelve thousand feet on chimborazo and down to ten thousand at quito on the other side the range  and it was so dangerous that the trains didnt run nights  the through passengers had to get off and sleep in the towns at night while the train waited for daylight  and each train carried a guard of ecuadoriano soldiers which was the most dangerous of all  they were supposed to protect the train crews but whenever trouble started they unlimbered their rifles and joined the mob  you see whenever a train wreck occurred the first cry of the spiggoties was kill the gringos  they always did that and proceeded to kill the train crew and whatever chance gringo passengers thatd escaped being killed in the accident  which is their kind of arithmetic which i told you a while back as being different from ours  shucks  before the day was out i was to find out for myself that that exconductor wasnt lying  it was over at duran  i was to take my run on the first division out to quito for which place i was to start next morningonly one through train running every twentyfour hours  it was the afternoon of my first day along about four oclock when the boilers of the governor hancock exploded and she sank in sixty feet of water alongside the dock she was the big ferry boat that carried the railroad passengers across the river to guayaquil  it was a bad accident but it was the cause of worse that followed  by halfpast four big trainloads began to arrive  it was a feast day and theyd run an excursion up country but of guayaquil and this was the crowd coming back  and the crowdthere was five thousand of themwanted to get ferried across and the ferry was at the bottom of the river which wasnt our fault  but by the spiggoty arithmetic it was  kill the gringos shouts one of them  and right there the beans were spilled  most of us got away by the skin of our teeth  i raced on the heels of the master mechanic carrying one of his babies for him for the locomotives that was just pulling out  you see way down there away from everywhere they just got to save their locomotives in times of trouble because without them a railroad cant be run  half a dozen american wives and as many children were crouching on the cab floors along with the rest of us when we pulled out and the ecuadoriano soldiers who should have been protecting our lives and property turned loose with their rifles and must have given us all of a thousand rounds before we got out of range  we camped up country and didnt come back to clean up until next day  it was some cleaning  every flatcar boxcar coach asthmatic switch engine and even handcar that mob of spiggoties had shoved off the dock into sixty feet of water on top of the governor hancock  theyd burnt the round house set fire to the coal bunkers and made a scandal of the repair shops  oh yes and there were three of our fellows theyd got that we had to bury mighty quick  its hot weather all the time down there  julian jones came to a full pause and over his shoulder studied the straightbeforeher gaze and forbidding expression of his wifes face  i aint forgotten the nugget he assured me  nor the hussy the little woman snapped apparently at the mud hens paddling on the surface of the lagoon  ive been travelling toward the nugget right along  there was never no reason for you to stay in that dangerous country his wife snapped in on him  now sarah he appealed  i was working for you right along and to me he explained  the risk was big but so was the pay some months i earned as high as five hundred gold  and here was sarah waiting for me back in nebraska  an us engaged two years she complained to the tower of jewels  what of the strike and me being blacklisted and getting typhoid down in australia and everything he went on  and luck was with me on that railroad  why i saw fellows fresh from the states pass out some of them not a week on their first run  if the diseases and the railroad didnt get them then it was the spiggoties got them  but it just wasnt my fate even that time i rode my engine down to the bottom of a fortyfoot washout  i lost my fireman and the conductor and the superintendent of rolling stock who happened to be running down to duran to meet his bride had their heads knifed off by the spiggoties and paraded around on poles  but i lay snug as a bug under a couple of feet of tender coal and they thought id headed for tall timberlay there a day and a night till the excitement cooled down  yes i was lucky the worst that happened to me was i caught a cold once and another time had a carbuncle  but the other fellows  they died like flies what of yellow jack pneumonia the spiggoties and the railroad  the trouble was i didnt have much chance to pal with them  no soonerd i get some intimate with one of them hed up and dieall but a fireman named andrews and he went loco for keeps  i made good on my job from the first and lived in quito in a dobe house with whacking big spanish tiles on the roof that id rented  and i never had much trouble with the spiggoties what of letting them sneak free rides in the tender or on the cowcatcher me throw them off  never  i took notice when jack harris put off a bunch of them that i attended his funeral muy pronto  speak english the little woman beside him snapped  sarah just cant bear to tolerate me speaking spanish he apologized  it gets so on her nerves that i promised not to well as i was saying the goose hung high and everything was going hunkydory and i was piling up my wages to come north to nebraska and marry sarah when i run on to vahna  the hussy sarah hissed  now sarah her towering giant of a husband begged i just got to mention her or i cant tell about the nuggetit was one night when i was taking a locomotiveno traindown to amato about thirty miles from quito  seth manners was my fireman  i was breaking him in to engineer for himself and i was letting him run the locomotive while i sat up in his seat meditating about sarah here  id just got a letter from her begging as usual for me to come home and hinting as usual about the dangers of an unmarried man like me running around loose in a country full of senoritas and fandangos  lord  if she could only aseen them  positive frights thats what they are their faces painted white as corpses and their lips red asas some of the train wrecks ive helped clean up  it was a lovely april night not a breath of wind and a tremendous big moon shining right over the top of chimborazosome mountain that  the railroad skirted it twelve thousand feet above sea level and the top of it ten thousand feet higher than that  mebbe i was drowsing with seth running the engine but he slammed on the brakes so sudden hard that i darn near went through the cab window  what the i started to yell and holy hell seth says as both of us looked at what was on the track  and i agreed with seth entirely in his remark  it was an indian girland take it from me indians aint spiggoties by any manner of means  seth had managed to fetch a stop within twenty feet of her and us bowling down hill at that  but the girl  she  i saw the form of mrs julian jones stiffen although she kept her gaze fixed balefully upon two mudhens that were prowling along the lagoon shallows below us  the hussy she hissed once and implacably  jones had stopped at the sound but went on immediately  she was a tall girl slim and slender you know the kind with black hair remarkably long hanging down loose behind her as she stood there no more afraid than nothing her arms spread out to stop the engine  she was wearing a slimpsy sort of garment wrapped around her that wasnt cloth but ocelot skins soft and dappled and silky  it was all she had on  the hussy breathed mrs jones  but mr jones went on making believe that he was unaware of the interruption  hell of a way to stop a locomotive i complained at seth as i climbed down on to the right of way  i walked past our engine and up to the girl and what do you think  her eyes were shut tight she was trembling that violent that you would see it by the moonlight  and she was barefoot too  whats the row i said none too gentle  she gave a start seemed to come out of her trance and opened her eyes  say  they were big and black and beautiful  believe me she was some looker   the hussy  at which hiss the two mudhens veered away a few feet  but jones was getting himself in hand and didnt even blink  what are you stopping this locomotive for i demanded in spanish  nary an answer  she stared at me then at the snorting engine and then burst into tears which youll admit is uncommon behaviour for an indian woman  if you try to get rides that way i slung at her in spiggoty spanish which they tell me is some different from regular spanish youll be taking one smeared all over our cowcatcher and headlight and itll be up to my fireman to scrape you off  my spiggoty spanish wasnt much to brag on but i could see she understood though she only shook her head and wouldnt speak  but great moses she was some looker  i glanced apprehensively at mrs jones who must have caught me out of the tail of her eye for she muttered  if she hadnt been do you think hed ataken her into his house to live  now hold on sarah he protested  that aint fair  besides im telling thisnext thing seth yells at me goin to stay here all night  come on i said to the girl and climb on board  but next time you want a ride dont flag a locomotive between stations  she followed along but when i got to the step and turned to give her a liftup she wasnt there  i went forward again  not a sign of her  above and below was sheer cliff and the track stretched ahead a hundred yards clear and empty  and then i spotted her crouched down right against the cowcatcher that close id almost stepped on her  if wed started up wed have run over her in a second  it was all so nonsensical i never could make out her actions  maybe she was trying to suicide  i grabbed her by the wrist and jerked her none too gentle to her feet  and she came along all right  women do know when a man means business  i glanced from this goliath to his little birdeyed spouse and wondered if he had ever tried to mean business with her  seth kicked at first but i boosted her into the cab and made her sit up beside me  and i suppose seth was busy running the engine mrs jones observed  i was breaking him in wasnt i  mr jones protested  so we made the run into amato  shed never opened her mouth once and no soonerd the engine stopped than shed jumped to the ground and was gone  just like that  not a thank you kindly  nothing  but next morning when we came to pull out for quito with a dozen flat cars loaded with rails there she was in the cab waiting for us and in the daylight i could see how much better a looker she was than the night before  huh shes adopted you seth grins  and it looked like it  she just stood there and looked at meat uslike a loving hound dog that you love that youve caught with a string of sausages inside of him and that just knows you aint going to lift a hand to him go chase yourself i told her pronto  mrs jones her proximity noticeable with a wince at the spanish word  you see sarah id no use for her even at the start  mrs jones stiffened  her lips moved soundlessly but i knew to what syllables  and what made it hardest was seth jeering at me  you cant shake her that way he said  you saved her life  i didnt i said sharply it was you  but she thinks you did which is the same thing he came back at me  and now she belongs to you  custom of the country as you ought to know  heathenish said mrs jones and though her steady gaze was set upon the tower of jewels i knew she was making no reference to its architecture  shes come to do light housekeeping for you seth grinned  i let him rave though afterwards i kept him throwing in the coal too fast to work his mouth very much  why say when i got to the spot where i picked her up and stopped the train for her to get off she just flopped down on her knees got a hammerlock with her arms around my knees and cried all over my shoes  what was i to do  with no perceptible movement that i was aware of mrs jones advertised her certitude of knowledge of what she would have done  and the moment we pulled into quito she did what shed done beforevanished  sarah never believes me when i say how relieved i felt to be quit of her  but it was not to be  i got to my dobe house and managed a cracking fine dinner my cook had ready for me she was mostly spiggoty and half indian and her name was paloma now sarah havent i told you she was oldern a grandmother and looked more like a buzzard than a dove  why i couldnt bear to eat with her around where i could look at her  but she did make things comfortable and she was some economical when it came to marketing  that afternoon after a big long siesta whatd i find in the kitchen just as much at home as if she belonged there but that blamed indian girl  and old paloma was squatting at the girls feet and rubbing the girls knees and legs like for rheumatism which i knew the girl didnt have from the way id sized up the walk of her and keeping time to the rubbing with a funny sort of gibberish chant  and i let loose right there and then  as sarah knows i never could abear women around the houseyoung unmarried women i mean  but it was no go  old paloma sided with the girl and said if the girl went she went too  also she called me more kinds of a fool than the english language has accommodation for  youd like the spanish lingo sarah for expressing yourself in such ways and youd have liked old paloma too  she was a good woman though she didnt have any teeth and her face could kill a strong mans appetite in the cradle  i gave in  i had to  except for the excuse that she needed vahnas help around the house which she didnt at all old paloma never said why she stuck up for the girl  anyway vahna was a quiet thing never in the way  and she never gadded  just sat in doors jabbering with paloma and helping with the chores  but i wasnt long in getting on to that she was afraid of something  she would look up that anxious it hurt whenever anybody called like some of the boys to have a gas or a game of pedro  i tried to worm it out of paloma what was worrying the girl but all the old woman did was to look solemn and shake her head like all the devils in hell was liable to precipitate a visit on us  and then one day vahna had a visitor  id just come in from a run and was passing the time of day with heri had to be polite even if she had butted in on me and come to live in my house for keeps when i saw a queer expression come into her eyes  in the doorway stood an indian boy  he looked like her but was younger and slimmer  she took him into the kitchen and they must have had a great palaver for he didnt leave until after dark  inside the week he came back but i missed him  when i got home paloma put a fat nugget of gold into my hand which vahna had sent him for  the blamed thing weighed all of two pounds and was worth more than five hundred dollars  she explained that vahna wanted me to take it to pay for her keep  and i had to take it to keep peace in the house  then after a long time came another visitor  we were sitting before the fire  him and the hussy quoth mrs jones  and paloma he added quickly  him and his cook and his light housekeeper sitting by the fire she amended  oh i admit vahna did like me a whole heap he asserted recklessly then modified with a pang of caution  a heap more than was good for her seeing that i had no inclination her way  well as i was saying she had another visitor  he was a lean tall whiteheaded old indian with a beak on him like an eagle he walked right in without knocking  vahna gave a little cry that was half like a yelp and half like a gasp and flumped down on her knees before me pleading to me with deers eyes and to him with the eyes of a deer about to be killed that dont want to be killed then for a minute that seemed as long as a lifetime she and the old fellow glared at each other  paloma was the first to talk in his own lingo for he talked back to her  but great moses if he wasnt the high and mighty one  palomas old knees were shaking and she cringed to him like a hound dog  and all this in my own house  id have thrown him out on his neck only he was so old  if the things he said to vahna were as terrible as the way he looked  say  he just spit words at her  but paloma kept whimpering and butting in till something she said got across because his face relaxed  he condescended to give me the once over and fired some question at vahna  she hung her head and looked foolish and blushed and then replied with a single word and a shake of the head  and with that he just naturally turned on his heel and beat it  i guess shed said no  for some time after that vahna used to fluster up whenever she saw me  then she took to the kitchen for a spell  but after a long time she began hanging around the big room again  she was still mighty shy but shed keep on following me about with those big eyes of hers  the hussy i heard plainly  but julian jones and i were pretty well used to it by this time  i dont mind saying that i was getting some interested myselfoh not in the way sarah never lets up letting me know she thinks that twopound nugget was what had me going  if vahnad put me wise to where it came from i could say goodbye to railroading and hit the high places for nebraska and sarah  and then the beans were spilled    by accident  come a letter from wisconsin  my aunt eliza d died and up and left me her big farm  i let out a whoop when i read it but i could have canned my joy for i was jobbed out of it by the courts and lawyers afterwardnot a cent to me and im still paying m in instalments  but i didnt know then and i prepared to pull back to gods country  paloma got sore and vahna got the weeps  dont go dont go  that was her song  but i gave notice on my job and wrote a letter to sarah heredidnt i sarah  that night sitting by the fire like at a funeral vahna really loosened up for the first time  dont go she says to me with old paloma nodding agreement with her  ill show you where my brother got the nugget if you dont go  too late said i  and i told her why  and told her about me waiting for you back in nebraska mrs jones observed in cold passionless tones  now sarah why should i hurt a poor indian girls feelings  of course i didnt  well she and paloma talked indian some more and then vahna says if you stay ill show you the biggest nugget that is the father of all other nuggets  how big i asked  as big as me  she laughed  bigger than you she says much much bigger  they dont grow that way i said  but she said shed seen it and paloma backed her up  why to listen to them youd have thought there was millions in that one nugget  paloma d never seen it herself but shed heard about it  a secret of the tribe which she couldnt share being only half indian herself  julian jones paused and heaved a sigh  and they kept on insisting until i fell for  the hussy said mrs jones pert as a bird at the ready instant  no for the nugget  what of aunt elizas farm i was rich enough to quit railroading but not rich enough to turn my back on big moneyand i just couldnt help believing them two women  gee  i could be another vanderbilt or j p morgan  thats the way i thought and i started in to pump vahna  but she wouldnt give down  you come along with me she says  we can be back here in a couple of weeks with all the gold the both of us can carry well take a burro or a packtrain of burros was my suggestion but nothing doing  and paloma agreed with her  it was too dangerous  the indians would catch us  the two of us pulled out when the nights were moonlight  we travelled only at night and laid up in the days  vahna wouldnt let me light a fire and i missed my coffee something fierce  we got up in the real high mountains of the main andes where the snow on one pass gave us some trouble but the girl knew the trails and though we didnt waste any time we were a full week getting there  i know the general trend of our travel because i carried a pocket compass and the general trend is all i need to get there again because of that peak  theres no mistaking it  there aint another peak like it in the world  now im not telling you its particular shape but when you and i head out for it from quito ill take you straight to it  its no easy thing to climb and the person doesnt live that can climb it at night  we had to take the daylight to it and didnt reach the top till after sunset  why i could take hours and hours telling you about that last climb which i wont  the top was flat as a billiard table about a quarter of an acre in size and was almost clean of snow  vahna told me that the great winds that usually blew kept the snow off of it  we were winded and i got mountain sickness so bad that i had to stretch out for a spell  then when the moon come up i took a prowl around  it didnt take long and i didnt catch a sight or a smell of anything that looked like gold  and when i asked vahna she only laughed and clapped her hands  meantime my mountain sickness tuned up something fierce and i sat down on a big rock to wait for it to ease down  come on now i said when i felt better  stop your fooling and tell me where that nugget is  its nearer to you right now than ill ever get she answered her big eyes going sudden wistful  all you gringos are alike  gold is the love of your heart and women dont count much  i didnt say anything  that was no time to tell her about sarah here  but vahna seemed to shake off her depressed feelings and began to laugh and tease again  how do you like it she asked like what  the nugget youre sitting on  i jumped up as though it was a redhot stove  and all it was was a rock  i felt nay heart sink  either she had gone clean loco or this was her idea of a joke  wrong on both counts  she gave me the hatchet and told me to take a hack at the boulder which i did again and again for yellow spots sprang up from under every blow by the great moses it was gold  the whole blamed boulder  jones rose suddenly to his full height and flung out his long arms his face turned to the southern skies  the movement shot panic into the heart of a swan that had drawn nearer with amiably predatory designs  its consequent abrupt retreat collided it with a stout old lady who squealed and dropped her bag of peanuts jones sat down and resumed  gold i tell you solid gold and that pure and soft that i chopped chips out of it  it had been coated with some sort of rainproof paint or lacquer made out of asphalt or something  no wonder id taken it for a rock  it was ten feet long all of five feet through and tapering to both ends like an egg  here  take a look at this  from his pocket he drew and opened a leather case from which he took an object wrapped in tissuepaper  unwrapping it he dropped into my hand a chip of pure soft gold the size of a tendollar goldpiece  i could make out the greyish substance on one side with which it had been painted  i chopped that from one end of the thing jones went on replacing the chip in its paper and leather case  and lucky i put it in my pocket  for right at my back came one loud wordmore like a croak than a word in my way of thinking  and there was that lean old fellow with the eagle beak that had dropped in on us one night  and there was about thirty indians with himall slim young fellows  vahnad flopped down and begun whimpering but i told her get up and make friends with them for me  no no she cried  this is death  goodbye amigo  here mrs jones winced and her husband abruptly checked the particular flow of his narrative  then get up and fight along with me i said to her  and she did  she was some hellion there on the top of the world clawing and scratching tooth and naila regular she cat  and i wasnt idle though all i had was that hatchet and my long arms  but they were too many for me and there was no place for me to put my back against a wall  when i come to minutes after theyd cracked me on the headhere feel this  removing his hat julian jones guided my finger tips through his thatch of sandy hair until they sank into an indentation  it was fully three inches long and went into the bone itself of the skull  when i come to there was vahna spreadeagled on top of the nugget and the old fellow with a beak jabbering away solemnly as if going through some sort of religious exercises  in his hand he had a stone knifeyou know a thin sharp sliver of some obsidian like stuff same as they make arrowheads out of  i couldnt lift a hand being held down and being too weak besides  andwell anyway that stone knife did for her and me they didnt even do the honour of killing there on top their sacred peak  they chucked me off of it like so much carrion  and the buzzards didnt get me either  i can see the moonlight yet shining on all those peaks of snow as i went down  why sir it was a fivehundredfoot fall only i didnt make it  i went into a big snowdrift in a crevice  and when i come to hours after i know for it was full day when i next saw the sun i found myself in a regular snowcave or tunnel caused by the water from the melting snow running along the ledge  in fact the stone above actually overhung just beyond where i first landed  a few feet more to the side either way and id almost be going yet  it was a straight miracle thats what it was  but i paid for it  it was two years and over before i knew what happened  all i knew was that i was julian jones and that id been blacklisted in the big strike and that i was married to sarah here  i mean that  i didnt know anything in between and when sarah tried to talk about it it gave me pains in the head  i mean my head was queer and i knew it was queer  and then sitting on the porch of her fathers farmhouse back in nebraska one moonlight evening sarah came out and put that gold chip into my hand  seems shed just found it in the torn lining of the trunk id brought back from ecuadori who for two years didnt even know id been to ecuador or australia or anything  well i just sat there looking at the chip in the moonlight and turning it over and over and figuring what it was and where itd come from when all of a sudden there was a snap inside my head as if something had broken and then i could see vahna spreadeagled on that big nugget and the old fellow with the beak waving the stone knife and    and everything  that is everything that had happened from the time i first left nebraska to when i crawled to the daylight out of the snow after they had chucked me off the mountaintop  but everything thatd happened after that id clean forgotten  when sarah said i was her husband i wouldnt listen to her  took all her family and the preacher thatd married us to convince me  later on i wrote to seth manners  the railroad hadnt killed him yet and he pieced out a lot for me  ill show you his letters ive got them at the hotel  one day he said making his regular run i crawled out on to the track  i didnt stand upright i just crawled  he took me for a calf or a big dog at first  i wasnt anything human he said and i didnt know him or anything  as near as i can make out it was ten days after the mountaintop to the time seth picked me up  what i ate i dont know  maybe i didnt eat  then it was doctors at quito and paloma nursing me she must have packed that gold chip in my trunk until they found out i was a man without a mind and the railroad sent me back to nebraska  at any rate thats what seth writes me  of myself i dont know  but sarah here knows  she corresponded with the railroad before they shipped me and all that  mrs jones nodded affirmation of his words sighed and evidenced unmistakable signs of eagerness to go  i aint been able to work since her husband continued  and i aint been able to figure out how to get back that big nugget sarahs got money of her own and she wont let go a penny  he wont get down to that country no more she broke forth  but sarah vahnas deadyou know that julian jones protested  i dont know anything about anything she answered decisively except that that country is no place for a married man  her lips snapped together and she fixed an unseeing stare across to where the afternoon sun was beginning to glow into sunset  i gazed for a moment at her face white plump tiny and implacable and gave her up  how do you account for such a mass of gold being there i queried of julian jones  a solidgold meteor that fell out of the sky  not for a moment  he shook his head   it was carried there by the indians  up a mountain like thatand such enormous weight and size i objected  just as easy he smiled  i used to be stumped by that proposition myself after i got my memory back  now how in sam hill i used to begin and then spend hours figuring at it  and then when i got the answer i felt downright idiotic it was that easy  he paused then announced  they didnt  but you justsaid they did  they did and they didnt was his enigmatic reply  of course they never carried that monster nugget up there  what they did was to carry up its contents  he waited until he saw enlightenment dawn in my face  and then of course melted all the gold or welded it or smelted it all into one piece  you know the first spaniards down there under a leader named pizarro were a gang of robbers and cut throats  they went through the country like the hoofandmouth disease and killed the indians off like cattle  you see the indians had lots of gold  well what the spaniards didnt get the surviving indians hid away in that one big chunk on top the mountain and its been waiting there ever since for meand for you if you want to go in on it  and here by the lagoon of the palace of fine arts ended my acquaintance with julian jones  on my agreeing to finance the adventure he promised to call on me at my hotel next morning with the letters of seth manners and the railroad and conclude arrangements  but he did not call  that evening i telephoned his hotel and was informed by the clerk that mr julian jones and wife had departed in the early afternoon with their baggage  can mrs jones have rushed him back and hidden him away in nebraska  i remember that as we said goodbye there was that in her smile that recalled the vulpine complacency of mona lisa the wise  kohala hawaii may 5 1916     story  like argus of the ancient times     it was the summer of 1897 and there was trouble in the tarwater family  grandfather tarwater after remaining properly subdued and crushed for a quiet decade had broken out again  this time it was the klondike fever  his first and one unvarying symptom of such attacks was song  one chant only he raised though he remembered no more than the first stanza and but three lines of that  and the family knew his feet were itching and his brain was tingling with the old madness when he lifted his hoarsecracked voice now falsettocracked in   like argus of the ancient times we leave this modern greece tumtum tumtum tum tum tumtum to shear the golden fleece   ten years earlier he had lifted the chant sung to the air of the doxology when afflicted with the fever to go goldmining in patagonia  the multitudinous family had sat upon him but had had a hard time doing it  when all else had failed to shake his resolution they had applied lawyers to him with the threat of getting out guardianship papers and of confining him in the state asylum for the insanewhich was reasonable for a man who had a quarter of a century before speculated away all but ten meagre acres of a california principality and who had displayed no better business acumen ever since  the application of lawyers to john tarwater was like the application of a mustard plaster  for in his judgment they were the gentry more than any other who had skinned him out of the broad tarwater acres  so at the time of his patagonian fever the very thought of so drastic a remedy was sufficient to cure him  he quickly demonstrated he was not crazy by shaking the fever from him and agreeing not to go to patagonia  next he demonstrated how crazy he really was by deeding over to his family unsolicited the ten acres on tarwater flat the house barn outbuildings and waterrights  also did he turn over the eight hundred dollars in bank that was the longsaved salvage of his wrecked fortune  but for this the family found no cause for committal to the asylum since such committal would necessarily invalidate what he had done  grandfather is sure peeved said mary his oldest daughter herself a grandmother when her father quit smoking  all he had retained for himself was a span of old horses a mountain buckboard and his one room in the crowded house further having affirmed that he would be beholden to none of them he got the contract to carry the united states mail twice a week from kelterville up over tarwater mountain to old almadenwhich was a sporadically worked quicksilver mine in the upland cattle country  with his old horses it took all his time to make the two weekly round trips  and for ten years rain or shine he had never missed a trip  nor had he failed once to pay his weeks board into marys hand  this board he had insisted on in the convalescence from his patagonian fever and he had paid it strictly though he had given up tobacco in order to be able to do it  huh he confided to the ruined water wheel of the old tarwater mill which he had built from the standing timber and which had ground wheat for the first settlers  huh  theyll never put me in the poor farm so long as i support myself  and without a penny to my name it aint likely any lawyer fellowsll come snoopin around after me  and yet precisely because of these highly rational acts it was held that john tarwater was mildly crazy  the first time he had lifted the chant of like argus of the ancient times had been in 1849 when twentytwo years of age violently attacked by the californian fever he had sold two hundred and forty michigan acres forty of it cleared for the price of four yoke of oxen and a wagon and had started across the plains  and we turned off at fort hall where the oregon emigration went northard and swung south for californy was his way of concluding the narrative of that arduous journey  and bill ping and me used to rope grizzlies out of the underbrush of cache slough in the sacramento valley  years of freighting and mining had followed and with a stake gleaned from the merced placers he satisfied the landhunger of his race and time by settling in sonoma county  during the ten years of carrying the mail across tarwater township up tarwater valley and over tarwater mountain most all of which land had once been his he had spent his time dreaming of winning back that land before he died  and now his huge gaunt form more erect than it had been for years with a glinting of blue fires in his small and closeset eyes he was lifting his ancient chant again  there he goes nowlisten to him said william tarwater  nobody at home laughed harris topping day labourer husband of annie tarwater and father of her nine children  the kitchen door opened to admit the old man returning from feeding his horses  the song had ceased from his lips but mary was irritable from a burnt hand and a grandchild whose stomach refused to digest properly diluted cows milk  now there aint no use you carryin on that way father she tackled him  the times past for you to cut and run for a place like the klondike and singing wont buy you nothing  just the same he answered quietly  i bet i could go to that klondike place and pick up enough gold to buy back the tarwater lands  old fool annie contributed  you couldnt buy them back for lessn three hundred thousand and then some was williams effort at squelching him  then i could pick up three hundred thousand and then some if i was only there the old man retorted placidly  thank god you cant walk there or youd be startin i know mary cried  ocean travel costs money  i used to have money her father said humbly  well you aint got any nowso forget it william advised them times is past like roping bear with bill ping  there aint no more bear  just the same  but mary cut him off  seizing the days paper from the kitchen table she flourished it savagely under her aged progenitors nose  what do those klondikers say  there it is in cold print  only the young and robust can stand the klondike  its worse than the north pole  and theyve left their dead aplenty there themselves look at their pictures  youre forty years older n the oldest of them  john tarwater did look but his eyes strayed to other photographs on the highly sensational front page  and look at the photys of them nuggets they brought down he said  i know gold  didnt i gopher twenty thousand outa the merced  and wouldnt it aben a hundred thousand if that cloudburst hadnt busted my wingdam  now if i was only in the klondike  crazy as a loon william sneered in open aside to the rest  a nice way to talk to your father old man tarwater censured mildly  my fatherd have walloped the tar out of me with a singletree if id spoke to him that way  but you are crazy father william began  reckon youre right son  and thats where my father wasnt crazy  hed adone it  the old mans been reading some of them magazine articles about men who succeeded after forty annie jibed  and why not daughter he asked  and why cant a man succeed after hes seventy  i was only seventy this year  and mebbe i could succeed if only i could get to the klondike  which you aint going to get to mary shut him off  oh well then he sighed seeins i aint i might just as well go to bed  he stood up tall gaunt greatboned and gnarled a splendid ruin of a man  his ragged hair and whiskers were not grey but snowy white as were the tufts of hair that stood out on the backs of his huge bony fingers  he moved toward the door opened it sighed and paused with a backward look  just the same he murmured plaintively the bottoms of my feet is itching something terrible  long before the family stirred next morning his horses fed and harnessed by lantern light breakfast cooked and eaten by lamp fight old man tarwater was off and away down tarwater valley on the road to kelterville  two things were unusual about this usual trip which he had made a thousand and forty times since taking the mail contract  he did not drive to kelterville but turned off on the main road south to santa rosa  even more remarkable than this was the paperwrapped parcel between his feet  it contained his one decent black suit which mary had been long reluctant to see him wear any more not because it was shabby but because as he guessed what was at the back of her mind it was decent enough to bury him in  and at santa rosa in a secondhand clothes shop he sold the suit outright for two dollars and a half  from the same obliging shopman he received four dollars for the wedding ring of his long dead wife  the span of horses and the wagon he disposed of for seventyfive dollars although twentyfive was all he received down in cash  chancing to meet alton granger on the street to whom never before had he mentioned the ten dollars loaned him in 74 he reminded alton granger of the little affair and was promptly paid also of all unbelievable men to be in funds he so found the town drunkard for whom he had bought many a drink in the old and palmy days  and from him john tarwater borrowed a dollar  finally he took the afternoon train to san francisco  a dozen days later carrying a halfempty canvas sack of blankets and old clothes he landed on the beach of dyea in the thick of the great klondike rush  the beach was screaming bedlam  ten thousand tons of outfit lay heaped and scattered and twice ten thousand men struggled with it and clamoured about it  freight by indianback over chilcoot to lake linderman had jumped from sixteen to thirty cents a pound which latter was a rate of six hundred dollars a ton  and the subarctic winter gloomed near at hand  all knew it and all knew that of the twenty thousand of them very few would get across the passes leaving the rest to winter and wait for the late spring thaw  such the beach old john tarwater stepped upon and straight across the beach and up the trail toward chilcoot he headed cackling his ancient chant a very grandfather argus himself with no outfit worry in the world for he did not possess any outfit  that night he slept on the flats five miles above dyea at the head of canoe navigation  here the dyea river became a rushing mountain torrent plunging out of a dark canyon from the glaciers that fed it far above  and here early next morning he beheld a little man weighing no more than a hundred staggering along a footlog under all of a hundred pounds of flour strapped on his back  also he beheld the little man stumble off the log and fall facedownward in a quiet eddy where the water was two feet deep and proceed quietly to drown  it was no desire of his to take death so easily but the flour on his back weighed as much as he and would not let him up  thank you old man he said to tarwater when the latter had dragged him up into the air and ashore  while he unlaced his shoes and ran the water out they had further talk  next he fished out a tendollar goldpiece and offered it to his rescuer  old tarwater shook his head and shivered for the icewater had wet him to his knees  but i reckon i wouldnt object to settin down to a friendly meal with you  aint had breakfast the little man who was past forty and who had said his name was anson queried with a glance frankly curious  nary bite john tarwater answered  wheres your outfit  ahead  nary outfit  expect to buy your grub on the inside  nary a dollar to buy it with friend  which aint so important as a warm bite of breakfast right now  in ansons camp a quarter of a mile on tarwater found a slender redwhiskered young man of thirty cursing over a fire of wet willow wood  introduced as charles he transferred his scowl and wrath to tarwater who genially oblivious devoted himself to the fire took advantage of the chill morning breeze to create a draught which the other had left stupidly blocked by stones and soon developed less smoke and more flame  the third member of the party bill wilson or big bill as they called him came in with a hundredandfortypound pack and what tarwater esteemed to be a very rotten breakfast was dished out by charles  the mush was half cooked and mostly burnt the bacon was charred carbon and the coffee was unspeakable  immediately the meal was wolfed down the three partners took their empty packstraps and headed down trail to where the remainder of their outfit lay at the last camp a mile away  and old tarwater became busy  he washed the dishes foraged dry wood mended a broken packstrap put an edge on the butcherknife and campaxe and repacked the picks and shovels into a more carryable parcel  what had impressed him during the brief breakfast was the sort of awe in which anson and big bill stood of charles  once during the morning while anson took a breathing spell after bringing in another hundredpound pack tarwater delicately hinted his impression  you see its this way anson said  weve divided our leadership  weve got specialities  now im a carpenter  when we get to lake linderman and the trees are chopped and whipsawed into planks ill boss the building of the boat  big bill is a logger and miner  so hell boss getting out the logs and all mining operations  most of our outfits ahead  we went broke paying the indians to pack that much of it to the top of chilcoot  our last partner is up there with it moving it along by himself down the other side  his names liverpool and hes a sailor  so when the boats built hes the boss of the outfit to navigate the lakes and rapids to klondike  and charlesthis mr craytonwhat might his speciality be tarwater asked  hes the business man  when it comes to business and organization hes boss  hum tarwater pondered  very lucky to get such a bunch of specialities into one outfit  more than luck anson agreed  it was all accident too  each of us started alone  we met on the steamer coming up from san francisco and formed the partywell i got to be goin  charles is liable to get kicking because i aint packin my share just the same you cant expect a hundredpound man to pack as much as a hundredandsixtypounder  stick around and cook us something for dinner charles on his next load in and noting the effects of the old mans handiness told tarwater  and tarwater cooked a dinner that was a dinner washed the dishes had real pork and beans for supper and bread baked in a fryingpan that was so delectable than the three partners nearly foundered themselves on it  supper dishes washed he cut shavings and kindling for a quick and certain breakfast fire showed anson a trick with footgear that was invaluable to any hiker sang his like argus of the ancient times and told them of the great emigration across the plains in fortynine  my goodness the first cheerful and heartylike camp since we hit the beach big bill remarked as he knocked out his pipe and began pulling off his shoes for bed  kind of made things easy boys eh  tarwater queried genially  all nodded  well then i got a proposition boys  you can take it or leave it but just listen kindly to it  youre in a hurry to get in before the freezeup  half the time is wasted over the cooking by one of you that he might be puttin in packin outfit if i do the cookin for you you allll get on that much faster also the cookin ll be better and thatll make you pack better and i can pack quite a bit myself in between times quite a bit yes sir quite a bit  big bill and anson were just beginning to nod their heads in agreement when charles stopped them  what do you expect of us in return he demanded of the old man  oh i leave it up to the boys  that aint business charles reprimanded sharply  you made the proposition  now finish it  well its this way  you expect us to feed you all winter eh charles interrupted  no siree i dont  all i reckon is a passage to klondike in your boat would be mighty square of you  you havent an ounce of grub old man  youll starve to death when you get there  ive been feedin some long time pretty successful old tarwater replied a whimsical light in his eyes  im seventy and aint starved to death never yet  will you sign a paper to the effect that you shift for yourself as soon as you get to dawson the business one demanded  oh sure was the response  again charles checked his two partners expressions of satisfaction with the arrangement  one other thing old man  were a party of four and we all have a vote on questions like this  young liverpool is ahead with the main outfit  hes got a say so and he isnt here to say it  what kind of a party might he be tarwater inquired  hes a roughneck sailor and hes got a quick bad temper  some turbulent anson contributed  and the way he can cuss is simply godawful big bill testified  but hes square big bill added  anson nodded heartily to this appraisal  well boys tarwater summed up i set out for californy and i got there  and im going to get to klondike  aint a thing can stop me aint a thing  im going to get three hundred thousand outa the ground too  aint a thing can stop me aint a thing because i just naturally need the money  i dont mind a bad temper so longs the boy is square  ill take my chance an ill work along with you till we catch up with him  then if he says no to the proposition i reckon ill lose  but somehow i just cant see m sayin no because thatd mean too close up to freezeup and too late for me to find another chance like this  and as im sure going to get to klondike its just plumb impossible for him to say no  old john tarwater became a striking figure on a trail unusually replete with striking figures  with thousands of men each back tripping half a ton of outfit retracing every mile of the trail twenty times all came to know him and to hail him as father christmas  and as he worked ever he raised his chant with his agefalsetto voice  none of the three men he had joined could complain about his work  true his joints were stiffhe admitted to a trifle of rheumatism  he moved slowly and seemed to creak and crackle when he moved but he kept on moving  last into the blankets at night he was first out in the morning so that the other three had hot coffee before their one beforebreakfast pack and between breakfast and dinner and between dinner and supper he always managed to backtrip for several packs himself  sixty pounds was the limit of his burden however  he could manage seventyfive but he could not keep it up  once he tried ninety but collapsed on the trail and was seriously shaky for a couple of days afterward  work  on a trail where hardworking men learned for the first time what work was no man worked harder in proportion to his strength than old tarwater  driven desperately on by the nearthrust of winter and lured madly on by the dream of gold they worked to their last ounce of strength and fell by the way  others when failure made certain blew out their brains  some went mad and still others under the irk of the mandestroying strain broke partnerships and dissolved lifetime friendships with fellows just as good as themselves and just as strained and mad  work  old tarwater could shame them all despite his creaking and crackling and the nasty hacking cough he had developed  early and late on trail or in camp beside the trail he was ever in evidence ever busy at something ever responsive to the hail of father christmas  weary backtrippers would rest their packs on a log or rock alongside of where he rested his and would say  sing us that song of yourn dad about fortynine  and when he had wheezingly complied they would arise under their loads remark that it was real heartening and hit the forward trail again  if ever a man worked his passage and earned it big bill confided to his two partners that mans our old skeezicks  you bet anson confirmed  hes a valuable addition to the party and i for one aint at all disagreeable to the notion of making him a regular partner  none of that charles crayton cut in  when we get to dawson were quit of himthats the agreement  wed only have to bury him if we let him stay on with us  besides theres going to be a famine and every ounce of grubll count  remember were feeding him out of our own supply all the way in  and if we run short in the pinch next year youll know the reason  steamboats cant get up grub to dawson till the middle of june and thats nine months away  well you put as much money and outfit in as the rest of us big bill conceded and youve a say according  and im going to have my say charles asserted with increasing irritability  and its lucky for you with your fool sentiments that youve got somebody to think ahead for you else youd all starve to death  i tell you that famines coming  ive been studying the situation  flour will be two dollars a pound or ten and no sellers  you mark my words  across the rubblecovered flats up the dark canyon to sheep camp past the overhanging and everthreatening glaciers to the scales and from the scales up the steep pitches of icescoured rock where packers climbed with hands and feet old tarwater campcooked and packed and sang  he blew across chilcoot pass above timberline in the first swirl of autumn snow  those below without firewood on the bitter rim of crater lake heard from the driving obscurity above them a weird voice chanting   like argus of the ancient times we leave this modern greece tumtum tumtum tum tum tumtum to shear the golden fleece   and out of the snow flurries they saw appear a tall gaunt form with whiskers of flying white that blended with the storm bending under a sixtypound pack of camp dunnage  father christmas was the hail  and then  three rousing cheers for father christmas  two miles beyond crater lake lay happy campso named because here was found the uppermost fringe of the timber line where men might warm themselves by fire again  scarcely could it be called timber for it was a dwarf rockspruce that never raised its loftiest branches higher than a foot above the moss and that twisted and grovelled like a pigvegetable under the moss  here on the trail leading into happy camp in the first sunshine of half a dozen days old tarwater rested his pack against a huge boulder and caught his breath  around this boulder the trail passed laden men toiling slowly forward and men with empty packstraps limping rapidly back for fresh loads  twice old tarwater essayed to rise and go on and each time warned by his shakiness sank back to recover more strength  from around the boulder he heard voices in greeting recognized charles craytons voice and realized that at last they had met up with young liverpool  quickly charles plunged into business and tarwater heard with great distinctness every word of charles unflattering description of him and the proposition to give him passage to dawson  a dam fool proposition was liverpools judgment when charles had concluded  an old granddad of seventy  if hes on his last legs why in hell did you hook up with him  if theres going to be a famine and it looks like it we need every ounce of grub for ourselves  we only outfitted for four not five  its all right tarwater heard charles assuring the other dont get excited  the old codger agreed to leave the final decision to you when we caught up with you  all youve got to do is put your foot down and say no  you mean its up to me to turn the old one down after your encouraging him and taking advantage of his work clear from dyea here  its a hard trail liverpool and only the men that are hard will get through charles strove to palliate  and im to do the dirty work liverpool complained while tarwaters heart sank  thats just about the size of it charles said  youve got the deciding  then old tarwaters heart uprose again as the air was rent by a cyclone of profanity from the midst of which crackled sentences like dirty skunks    see you in hell first    my minds made up    hells fire and corruption    the old codger goes down the yukon with us stack on that my hearty    hard you dont know what hard is unless i show you    ill bust the whole outfit to hell and gone if any of you try to sidetrack him    just try to sidetrack him that is all and youll think the day of judgment and all gods blastingness has hit the camp in one chunk  such was the invigoratingness of liverpools flow of speech that quite without consciousness of effort the old man arose easily under his load and strode on toward happy camp  from happy camp to long lake from long lake to deep lake and from deep lake up over the enormous hogback and down to linderman the mankilling race against winter kept on  men broke their hearts and backs and wept beside the trail in sheer exhaustion  but winter never faltered  the fall gales blew and amid bitter soaking rains and everincreasing snow flurries tarwater and the party to which he was attached piled the last of their outfit on the beach  there was no rest  across the lake a mile above a roaring torrent they located a patch of spruce and built their sawpit here by hand with an inadequate whipsaw they sawed the spruce trunks into lumber  they worked night and day  thrice on the nightshift underneath in the sawpit old tarwater fainted  by day he cooked as well and in the betweenwhiles helped anson in the building of the boat beside the torrent as the green planks came down  the days grew shorter  the wind shifted into the north and blew unending gales  in the mornings the weary men crawled from their blankets and in their socks thawed out their frozen shoes by the fire tarwater always had burning for them  ever arose the increasing tale of famine on the inside  the last grub steamboats up from bering sea were stalled by low water at the beginning of the yukon flats hundreds of miles north of dawson  in fact they lay at the old hudson bay companys post at fort yukon inside the arctic circle  flour in dawson was up to two dollars a pound but no one would sell  bonanza and eldorado kings with money to burn were leaving for the outside because they could buy no grub miners committees were confiscating all grub and putting the population on strict rations  a man who held out an ounce of grub was shot like a dog  a score had been so executed already  and under a strain which had broken so many younger men old tarwater began to break  his cough had become terrible and had not his exhausted comrades slept like the dead he would have kept them awake nights  also he began to take chills so that he dressed up to go to bed  when he had finished so dressing not a rag of garment remained in his clothes bag  all he possessed was on his back and swathed around his gaunt old form  gee said big bill  if he puts all hes got on now when it aint lower than twenty above whatll he do later on when it goes down to fifty and sixty below  they lined the roughmade boat down the mountain torrent nearly losing it a dozen times and rowed across the south end of lake linderman in the thick of a fall blizzard  next morning they planned to load and start squarely into the teeth of the north on their perilous traverse of half a thousand miles of lakes and rapids and box canyons  but before he went to bed that night young liverpool was out over the camp  he returned to find his whole party asleep  rousing tarwater he talked with him in low tones  listen dad he saidyouve got a passage in our boat and if ever a man earned a passage you have  but you know yourself youre pretty well along in years and your health right now aint exciting  if you go on with us youll croak surern hellnow wait till i finish dad  the price for a passage has jumped to five hundred dollars  ive been throwing my feet and ive hustled a passenger  hes an official of the alaska commercial and just has to get in  hes bid up to six hundred to go with me in our boat  now the passage is yours  you sell it to him poke the six hundred into your jeans and pull south for california while the goins good  you can be in dyea in two days and in california in a week more  what dye say  tarwater coughed and shivered for a space ere he could get freedom of breath for speech  son he said i just want to tell you one thing  i drove my four yoke of oxen across the plains in fortynine and lost nary a one  i drove them plumb to californy and i freighted with them afterward out of sutters fort to american bar  now im going to klondike  aint nothing can stop me aint nothing at all  im going to ride that boat with you at the steering sweep clean to klondike and im going to shake three hundred thousand out of the mossroots  that being so its contrary to reason and common sense for me to sell out my passage  but i thank you kindly son i thank you kindly  the young sailor shot out his hand impulsively and gripped the old mans  by god dad he cried  youre sure going to go then  youre the real stuff  he looked with undisguised contempt across the sleepers to where charles crayton snored in his red beard  they dont seem to make your kind any more dad  into the north they fought their way although oldtimers coming out shook their heads and prophesied they would be frozen in on the lakes  that the freezeup might come any day was patent and delays of safety were no longer considered  for this reason liverpool decided to shoot the rapid stream connecting linderman to lake bennett with the fully loaded boat  it was the custom to line the empty boats down and to portage the cargoes across  even then many empty boats had been wrecked  but the time was past for such precaution  climb out dad liverpool commanded as he prepared to swing from the bank and enter the rapids  old tarwater shook his white head  im sticking to the outfit he declared  its the only way to get through  you see son im going to klondike  if i stick by the boat then the boat just naturally goes to klondike too  if i get out then most likely youll lose the boat  well theres no use in overloading charles announced springing abruptly out on the bank as the boat cast off  next time you wait for my orders liverpool shouted ashore as the current gripped the boat  and there wont be any more walking around rapids and losing time waiting to pick you up  what took them ten minutes by river took charles half an hour by land and while they waited for him at the head of lake bennett they passed the time of day with several dilapidated oldtimers on their way out  the famine news was graver than ever  the north west mounted police stationed at the foot of lake marsh where the goldrushers entered canadian territory were refusing to let a man past who did not carry with him seven hundred pounds of grub  in dawson city a thousand men with dogteams were waiting the freezeup to come out over the ice  the trading companies could not fill their grubcontracts and partners were cutting the cards to see which should go and which should stay and work the claims  that settles it charles announced when he learned of the action of the mounted police on the boundary  old man you might as well start back now  climb aboard  liverpool commanded  were going to klondike and old dad is going along  a shift of gale to the south gave them a fair wind down lake bennett before which they ran under a huge sail made by liverpool the heavy weight of outfit gave such ballast that he cracked on as a daring sailor should when moments counted  a shift of four points into the southwest coming just at the right time as they entered upon caribou crossing drove them down that connecting link to lakes tagish and marsh  in stormy sunset and twilightthey made the dangerous crossing of great windy arm wherein they beheld two other boatloads of goldrushers capsize and drown  charles was for beaching for the night but liverpool held on steering down tagish by the sound of the surf on the shoals and by the occasional shorefires that advertised wrecked or timid argonauts  at four in the morning he aroused charles  old tarwater shiveringly awake heard liverpool order crayton aft beside him at the steeringsweep and also heard the onesided conversation  just listen friend charles and keep your own mouth shut liverpool began  i want you to get one thing into your head and keep it there  old dads going by the police  understand hes going by  when they examine our outfit old dads got a fifth share in it savvee  thatll put us all way under what we ought to have but we can bluff it through  now get this and get it hard  there aint going to be any falldown on this bluff  if you think id give away on the old codger charles began indignantly  you thought that liverpool checked him because i never mentioned any such thing  nowget me and get me hard  i dont care what youve been thinking  its what youre going to think well make the police post some time this afternoon and weve got to get ready to pull the bluff without a hitch and a word to the wise is plenty  if you think ive got it in my mind charles began again  look here liverpool shut him off  i dont know whats in your mind  i dont want to know  i want you to know whats in my mind if theres any slipup if old dad gets turned back by the police im going to pick out the first quiet bit of landscape and take you ashore on it  and then im going to beat you up to the queens taste  get me and get me hard  it aint going to be any halfway beating but a real twolegged twofisted heman beating  i dont expect ill kill you but ill come damn near to halfkilling you  but what can i do charles almost whimpered  just one thing was liverpools final word  you just pray  you pray so hard that old dad gets by the police that he does get by thats all  go back to your blankets  before they gained lake le barge the land was sheeted with snow that would not melt for half a year  nor could they lay their boat at will against the bank for the rimice was already forming inside the mouth of the river just ere it entered lake le barge they found a hundred stormbound boats of the argonauts  out of the north across the full sweep of the great lake blew an unending snow gale  three mornings they put out and fought it and the cresting seas it drove that turned to ice as they fell in board  while the others broke their hearts at the oars old tarwater managed to keep up just sufficient circulation to survive by chopping ice and throwing it overboard  each day for three days beaten to helplessness they turned tail on the battle and ran back into the sheltering river  by the fourth day the hundred boats had increased to three hundred and the two thousand argonauts on board knew that the great gale heralded the freezeup of le barge  beyond the rapid rivers would continue to run for days but unless they got beyond and immediately they were doomed to be frozen in for six months to come  this day we go through liverpool announced  we turn back for nothing  and those of us that dies at the oars will live again and go on pulling  and they went through winning half the length of the lake by nightfall and pulling on through all the night hours as the wind went down falling asleep at the oars and being rapped awake by liverpool toiling on through an agelong nightmare while the stars came out and the surface of the lake turned to the unruffledness of a sheet of paper and froze skinice that tinkled like broken glass as their oarblades shattered it  as day broke clear and cold they entered the river with behind them a sea of ice  liverpool examined his aged passenger and found him helpless and almost gone  when he rounded the boat to against the rimice to build a fire and warm up tarwater inside and out charles protested against such loss of time  this aint business so dont you come horning in liverpool informed him  im running the boat trip  so you just climb out and chop firewood and plenty of it  ill take care of dad  you anson make a fire on the bank  and you bill set up the yukon stove in the boat  old dad aint as young as the rest of us and for the rest of this voyage hes going to have a fire on board to sit by  all of which came to pass and the boat in the grip of the current like a river steamer with smoke rising from the two joints of stovepipe grounded on shoals hung up on split currents and charged rapids and canyons as it drove deeper into the northland winter  the big and little salmon rivers were throwing mushice into the main river as they passed and below the riffles anchor ice arose from the river bottom and coated the surface with crystal scum  night and day the rimice grew till in quiet places it extended out a hundred yards from shore  and old tarwater with all his clothes on sat by the stove and kept the fire going night and day not daring to stop for fear of the imminent freeze up they dared to run an increasing mushiness of ice running with them  what ho old hearty liverpool would call out at times  cheer o old tarwater had learned to respond  what can i ever do for you son in payment tarwater stoking the fire would sometimes ask liverpool beating now one released hand and now the other as he fought for circulation where he steered in the freezing sternsheets  just break out that regular song of yours old fortyniner was the invariable reply  and tarwater would lift his voice in the cackling chant as he lifted it at the end when the boat swung in through driving cake ice and moored to the dawson city bank and all waterfront dawson pricked its ears to hear the triumphant paean   like argus of the ancient times we leave this modern greece tumtum tumtum tum tum tumtum to shear the golden fleece   charles did it but he did it so discreetly that none of his party least of all the sailor ever learned of it  he saw two great open barges being filled up with men and on inquiry learned that these were grubless ones being rounded up and sent down the yukon by the committee of safety  the barges were to be towed by the last little steamboat in dawson and the hope was that fort yukon where lay the stranded steamboats would be gained before the river froze  at any rate no matter what happened to them dawson would be relieved of their grubconsuming presence  so to the committee of safety charles went privily to drop a flea in its ear concerning tarwaters grubless moneyless and aged condition tarwater was one of the last gathered in and when young liverpool returned to the boat from the bank he saw the barges in a run of cakeice disappearing around the bend below moosehide mountain  running in cakeice all the way and several times escaping jams in the yukon flats the barges made their hundreds of miles of progress farther into the north and froze up cheek by jowl with the grubfleet  here inside the arctic circle old tarwater settled down to pass the long winter  several hours work a day chopping firewood for the steamboat companies sufficed to keep him in food for the rest of the time there was nothing to do but hibernate in his log cabin  warmth rest and plenty to eat cured his hacking cough and put him in as good physical condition as was possible for his advanced years  but even before christmas the lack of fresh vegetables caused scurvy to break out and disappointed adventurer after disappointed adventurer took to his bunk in abject surrender to this culminating misfortune  not so tarwater  even before the first symptoms appeared on him he was putting into practice his one prescription namely exercise  from the junk of the old trading post he resurrected a number of rusty traps and from one of the steamboat captains he borrowed a rifle  thus equipped he ceased from woodchopping and began to make more than a mere living  nor was he downhearted when the scurvy broke out on his own body  ever he ran his traplines and sang his ancient chant  nor could the pessimist shake his surety of the three hundred thousand of alaskan gold he as going to shake out of the mossroots  but this aint goldcountry they told him  gold is where you find it son as i should know who was mining before you was born way back in fortynine was his reply what was bonanza creek but a moosepasture  no minerd look at it yet they washed fivehundreddollar pans and took out fifty million dollars  eldorado was just as bad  for all you know right under this here cabin or right over the next hill is millions just waiting for a lucky one like me to come and shake it out  at the end of january came his disaster  some powerful animal that he decided was a bobcat managing to get caught in one of his smaller traps dragged it away  a heavy snowfall put a stop midway to his pursuit losing the trail for him and losing himself there were but several hours of daylight each day between the twenty hours of intervening darkness and his efforts in the grey light and continually falling snow succeeded only in losing him more thoroughly  fortunately when winter snow falls in the northland the thermometer invariably rises so instead of the customary forty and fifty and even sixty degrees below zero the temperature remained fifteen below  also he was warmly clad and had a full matchbox  further to mitigate his predicament on the fifth day he killed a wounded moose that weighed over half a ton making his camp beside it on a sprucebottom he was prepared to last out the winter unless a searching party found him or his scurvy grew worse  but at the end of two weeks there had been no sign of search while his scurvy had undeniably grown worse  against his fire banked from outer cold by a shelterwall of spruceboughs he crouched long hours in sleep and long hours in waking  but the waking hours grew less becoming semiwaking or halfdreaming hours as the process of hibernation worked their way with him  slowly the sparkle point of consciousness and identity that was john tarwater sank deeper and deeper into the profounds of his being that had been compounded ere man was man and while he was becoming man when he first of all animals regarded himself with an introspective eye and laid the beginnings of morality in foundations of nightmare peopled by the monsters of his own ethic thwarted desires  like a man in fever waking to intervals of consciousness so old tarwater awoke cooked his moosemeat and fed the fire but more and more time he spent in his torpor unaware of what was daydream and what was sleepdream in the content of his unconsciousness and here in the unforgetable crypts of mans unwritten history unthinkable and unrealizable like passages of nightmare or impossible adventures of lunacy he encountered the monsters created of mans first morality that ever since have vexed him into the spinning of fantasies to elude them or do battle with them  in short weighted by his seventy years in the vast and silent loneliness of the north old tarwater as in the delirium of drug or anaesthetic recovered within himself the infantile mind of the childman of the early world  it was in the dusk of deaths fluttery wings that tarwater thus crouched and like his remote forebear the childman went to mythmaking and sunheroizing himself heromaker and the hero in quest of the immemorable treasure difficult of attainment  either must he attain the treasurefor so ran the inexorable logic of the shadowland of the unconsciousor else sink into the all devouring sea the blackness eater of the light that swallowed to extinction the sun each night    the sun that arose ever in rebirth next morning in the east and that had become to man mans first symbol of immortality through rebirth  all this in the deeps of his unconsciousness the shadowy western land of descending light was the near dusk of death down into which he slowly ebbed  but how to escape this monster of the dark that from within him slowly swallowed him  too deepsunk was he to dream of escape or feel the prod of desire to escape  for him reality had ceased nor from within the darkened chamber of himself could reality recrudesce  his years were too heavy upon him the debility of disease and the lethargy and torpor of the silence and the cold were too profound  only from without could reality impact upon him and reawake within him an awareness of reality  otherwise he would ooze down through the shadowrealm of the unconscious into the all darkness of extinction  but it came the smash of reality from without crashing upon his ear drums in a loud explosive snort  for twenty days in a temperature that had never risen above fifty below no breath of wind had blown movement no slightest sound had broken the silence like the smoker on the opium couch refocusing his eyes from the spacious walls of dream to the narrow confines of the mean little room so old tarwater stared vagueeyed before him across his dying fire at a huge moose that stared at him in startlement dragging a wounded leg manifesting all signs of extreme exhaustion it too had been straying blindly in the shadowland and had wakened to reality only just ere it stepped into tarwaters fire  he feebly slipped the large fur mitten lined with thickness of wool from his right hand  upon trial he found the trigger finger too numb for movement  carefully slowly through long minutes he worked the bare hand inside his blankets up under his fur parka through the chest openings of his shirts and into the slightly warm hollow of his left armpit  long minutes passed ere the finger could move when with equal slowness of caution he gathered his rifle to his shoulder and drew bead upon the great animal across the fire  at the shot of the two shadowwanderers the one reeled downward to the dark and the other reeled upward to the light swaying drunkenly on his scurvyravaged legs shivering with nervousness and cold rubbing swimming eyes with shaking fingers and staring at the real world all about him that had returned to him with such sickening suddenness  he shook himself together and realized that for long how long he did not know he had bedded in the arms of death  he spat with definite intention heard the spittle crackle in the frost and judged it must be below and far below sixty below  in truth that day at fort yukon the spirit thermometer registered seventyfive degrees below zero which since freezing point is thirtytwo above was equivalent to one hundred and seven degrees of frost  slowly tarwaters brain reasoned to action  here in the vast alone dwelt death  here had come two wounded moose  with the clearing of the sky after the great cold came on he had located his bearings and he knew that both wounded moose had trailed to him from the east  therefore in the east were menwhites or indians he could not tell but at any rate men who might stand by him in his need and help moor him to reality above the sea of dark  he moved slowly but he moved in reality girding himself with rifle ammunition matches and a pack of twenty pounds of moose meat  then an argus rejuvenated albeit lame of both legs and tottery he turned his back on the perilous west and limped into the sunarising rebirthing east     days laterhow many days later he was never to knowdreaming dreams and seeing visions cackling his old goldchant of forty nine like one drowning and swimming feebly to keep his consciousness above the engulfing dark he came out upon the snow slope to a canyon and saw below smoke rising and men who ceased from work to gaze at him  he tottered down the hill to them still singing and when he ceased from lack of breath they called him variously  santa claus old christmas whiskers the last of the mohicans and father christmas  and when he stood among them he stood very still without speech while great tears welled out of his eyes  he cried silently a long time till as if suddenly bethinking himself he sat down in the snow with much creaking and crackling of his joints and from this low vantage point toppled sidewise and fainted calmly and easily away  in less than a week old tarwater was up and limping about the housework of the cabin cooking and dishwashing for the five men of the creek  genuine sourdoughs pioneers they were tough and hardbitten who had been buried so deeply inside the circle that they did not know there was a klondike strike  the news he brought them was their first word of it  they lived on an almost straight meat diet of moose caribou and smoked salmon eked out with wild berries and somewhat succulent wild roots they had stocked up with in the summer  they had forgotten the taste of coffee made fire with a burning glass carried live firesticks with them wherever they travelled and in their pipes smoked dry leaves that bit the tongue and were pungent to the nostrils  three years before they had prospected from the headreaches of the koyokuk northward and clear across to the mouth of the mackenzie on the arctic ocean  here on the whaleships they had beheld their last white men and equipped themselves with the last white mans grub consisting principally of salt and smoking tobacco  striking south and west on the long traverse to the junction of the yukon and porcupine at fort yukon they had found gold on this creek and remained over to work the ground  they hailed the advent of tarwater with joy never tired of listening to his tales of fortynine and rechristened him old hero  also with tea made from spruce needles with concoctions brewed from the inner willow bark and with sour and bitter roots and bulbs from the ground they dosed his scurvy out of him so that he ceased limping and began to lay on flesh over his bony framework  further they saw no reason at all why he should not gather a rich treasure of gold from the ground  dont know about all of three hundred thousand they told him one morning at breakfast ere they departed to their work but howd a hundred thousand do old hero  thats what we figure a claim is worth the ground being badly spotted and weve already staked your location notices  well boys old tarwater answered and thanking you kindly all i can say is that a hundred thousand will do nicely and very nicely for a starter  of course i aint goin to stop till i get the full three hundred thousand  thats what i come into the country for  they laughed and applauded his ambition and reckoned theyd have to hunt a richer creek for him  and old hero reckoned that as the spring came on and he grew spryer hed have to get out and do a little snooping around himself  for all anybody knows he said pointing to a hillside across the creek bottom the moss under the snow there may be plumb rooted in nugget gold  he said no more but as the sun rose higher and the days grew longer and warmer he gazed often across the creek at the definite benchformation half way up the hill  and one day when the thaw was in full swing he crossed the stream and climbed to the bench exposed patches of ground had already thawed an inch deep  on one such patch he stopped gathered a bunch of moss in his big gnarled hands and ripped it out by the roots  the sun smouldered on dully glistening yellow  he shook the handful of moss and coarse nuggets like gravel fell to the ground  it was the golden fleece ready for the shearing  not entirely unremembered in alaskan annals is the summer stampede of 1898 from fort yukon to the bench diggings of tarwater hill and when tarwater sold his holdings to the bowdie interests for a sheer halfmillion and faced for california he rode a mule over a newcut trail with convenient road houses along the way clear to the steamboat landing at fort yukon  at the first meal on the oceangoing steamship out of st michaels a waiter greyishhaired painravaged of face scurvytwisted of body served him  old tarwater was compelled to look him over twice in order to make certain he was charles crayton  got it bad eh son tarwater queried  just my luck the other complained after recognition and greeting  only one of the party that the scurvy attacked  ive been through hell  the other three are all at work and healthy getting grubstake to prospect up white river this winter  ansons earning twentyfive a day at carpentering liverpool getting twenty logging for the sawmill and big bills getting forty a day as chief sawyer  i tried my best and if it hadnt been for scurvy     sure son you done your best which aint much you being naturally irritable and hard from too much business  now ill tell you what  you aint fit to work crippled up this way  ill pay your passage with the captain in kind remembrance of the voyage you gave me and you can lay up and take it easy the rest of the trip and what are your circumstances when you land at san francisco  charles crayton shrugged his shoulders  tell you what tarwater continued  theres work on the ranch for you till you can start business again  i could manage your business for you charles began eagerly  no siree tarwater declared emphatically  but theres always postholes to dig and cordwood to chop and the climates fine      tarwater arrived home a true prodigal grandfather for whom the fatted calf was killed and ready  but first ere he sat down at table he must stroll out and around  and sons and daughters of his flesh and of the law needs must go with him fulsomely eating out of the gnarled old hand that had half a million to disburse he led the way and no opinion he slyly uttered was preposterous or impossible enough to draw dissent from his following  pausing by the ruined water wheel which he had built from the standing timber his face beamed as he gazed across the stretches of tarwater valley and on and up the far heights to the summit of tarwater mountainnow all his again  a thought came to him that made him avert his face and blow his nose in order to hide the twinkle in his eyes  still attended by the entire family he strolled on to the dilapidated barn  he picked up an ageweathered singletree from the ground  william he said  remember that little conversation we had just before i started to klondike  sure william you remember  you told me i was crazy  and i said my fatherd have walloped the tar out of me with a singletree if id spoke to him that way  aw but that was only foolin william temporized  william was a grizzled man of fortyfive and his wife and grown sons stood in the group curiously watching grandfather tarwater take off his coat and hand it to mary to hold  williamcome here he commanded imperatively  no matter how reluctantly william came  just a taste william son of what my father give me often enough old tarwater crooned as he laid on his sons back and shoulders with the singletree  observe i aint hitting you on the head  my father had a goshwollickin temper and never drew the line at heads when he went after tardont jerk your elbows back that way  youre likely to get a crack on one by accident and just tell me one thing william son  is there nary notion in your head that im crazy  no william yelped out in pain as he danced about  you aint crazy father of course you aint crazy  you said it old tarwater remarked sententiously tossing the singletree aside and starting to struggle into his coat  now lets all go in and eat  glen ellen california september 14 1916     story  the princess     a fire burned cheerfully in the jungle camp and beside the fire lolled a cheerfulseeming though horribleappearing man  this was a hobo jungle pitched in a thin strip of woods that lay between a railroad embankment and the bank of a river  but no hobo was the man  so deepsunk was he in the social abyss that a proper hobo would not sit by the same fire with him  a gaycat who is an ignorant newcomer on the road might sit with such as he but only long enough to learn better  even low down bindlestiffs and stewbums after a onceover would have passed this man by  a genuine hobo a couple of punks or a bunch of tenderyeared road kids might have gone through his rags for any stray pennies or nickels and kicked him out into the darkness  even an alkistiff would have reckoned himself immeasurably superior  for this man was that hybrid of trampland an alkistiff that has degenerated into a stewbum with so little selfrespect that he will never boilup and with so little pride that he will eat out of a garbage can  he was truly horribleappearing  he might have been sixty years of age he might have been ninety  his garments might have been discarded by a ragpicker  beside him an unrolled bundle showed itself as consisting of a ragged overcoat and containing an empty and smokeblackened tomato can an empty and battered condensed milk can some dogmeat partly wrapped in brown paper and evidently begged from some butchershop a carrot that had been run over in the street by a wagonwheel three greenish cankered and decayed potatoes and a sugarbun with a mouthful bitten from it and rescued from the gutter as was made patent by the gutterfilth that still encrusted it  a prodigious growth of whiskers greyishdirty and untrimmed for years sprouted from his face  this hirsute growth should have been white but the season was summer and it had not been exposed to a rainshower for some time  what was visible of the face looked as if at some period it had stopped a handgrenade  the nose was so variously malformed in its healed brokenness that there was no bridge while one nostril the size of a pea opened downward and the other the size of a robins egg tilted upward to the sky  one eye of normal size dimbrown and misty bulged to the verge of popping out and as if from senility wept copiously and continuously  the other eye scarcely larger than a squirrels and as uncannily bright twisted up obliquely into the hairy scar of a bonecrushed eyebrow  and he had but one arm  yet was he cheerful  on his face in mild degree was depicted sensuous pleasure as he lethargically scratched his ribs with his one hand  he pawed over his foodscraps debated then drew a twelveounce druggist bottle from his inside coatpocket  the bottle was full of a colourless liquid the contemplation of which made his little eye burn brighter and quickened his movements picking up the tomato can he arose went down the short path to the river and returned with the can filled with notnice river water  in the condensed milk can he mixed one part of water with two parts of fluid from the bottle  this colourless fluid was druggists alcohol and as such is known in trampland as alki  slow footsteps coming down the side of the railroad embankment alarmed him ere he could drink  placing the can carefully upon the ground between his legs he covered it with his hat and waited anxiously whatever impended  out of the darkness emerged a man as filthy ragged as he  the new comer who might have been fifty and might have been sixty was grotesquely fat  he bulged everywhere  he was composed of bulges his bulbous nose was the size and shape of a turnip  his eyelids bulged and his blue eyes bulged in competition with them  in many places the seams of his garments had parted across the bulges of body  his calves grew into his feet for the broken elastic sides of his congress gaiters were swelled full with the fat of him  one arm only he sported from the shoulder of which was suspended a small and tattered bundle with the mud caked dry on the outer covering from the last place he had pitched his doss  he advanced with tentative caution made sure of the harmlessness of the man beside the fire and joined him  hello grandpa the newcomer greeted then paused to stare at the others flaring skyopen nostril  say whiskers howd ye keep the night dew out of that nose o yourn  whiskers growled an incoherence deep in his throat and spat into the fire in token that he was not pleased by the question  for the love of mike the fat man chuckled if you got caught out in a rainstorm without an umbrella youd sure drown wouldnt you  can it fatty can it whiskers muttered wearily  they aint nothin new in that line of chatter  even the bulls hand it out to me  but you can still drink i hope fatty at the same time mollified and invited with his one hand deftly pulling the slipknots that fastened his bundle  from within the bundle he brought to light a twelveounce bottle of alki  footsteps coming down the embankment alarmed him and he hid the bottle under his hat on the ground between his legs  but the next comer proved to be not merely one of their own ilk but likewise to have only one arm  so forbidding of aspect was he that greetings consisted of no more than grunts  hugeboned tall gaunt to cadaverousness his face a dirty deaths head he was as repellent a nightmare of old age as ever dore imagined  his toothless thinlipped mouth was a cruel and bitter slash under a great curved nose that almost met the chin and that was like a buzzards beak  his one hand lean and crooked was a talon  the beady grey eyes unblinking and unwavering were bitter as death as bleak as absolute zero and as merciless  his presence was a chill and whiskers and fatty instinctively drew together for protection against the unguessed threat of him  watching his chance privily whiskers snuggled a chunk of rock several pounds in weigh close to his hand if need for action should arise  fatty duplicated the performance  then both sat licking their lips guiltily embarrassed while the unblinking eyes of the terrible one bored into them now into one now into another and then down at the rockchunks of their preparedness  huh sneered the terrible one with such dreadfulness of menace as to cause whiskers and fatty involuntarily to close their hands down on their cavemans weapons  huh the other repeated reaching his one talon into his side coat pocket with swift definiteness  a hell of a chance you two cheap bums d have with me  the talon emerged clutching ready for action a sixpound iron quoit  we aint lookin for trouble slim fatty quavered  who in hell are you to call me slim came the snarling answer  me  im just fatty an seein s i never seen you before  an i suppose thats whiskers there with the gay an festive lamp tangoing into his eyebrow an the godforgiveus nose joy riding all over his mug  itll do itll do whiskers muttered uncomfortably  one monicas as good as another i find at my time of life  and everybody hands it out to me anyway  and i need an umbrella when it rains to keep from getting drowned an all the rest of it  i aint used to companydont like it slim growled  so if you guys want to stick around mind your step thats all mind your step  he fished from his pocket a cigar stump selfevidently shot from the gutter and prepared to put it in his mouth to chew  then he changed his mind glared at his companions savagely and unrolled his bundle  appeared in his hand a druggists bottle of alki  well he snarled i suppose i gotta give you cheap skates a drink when i aint got moren enough for a good petrification for myself  almost a softening flicker of light was imminent in his withered face as he beheld the others proudly lift their hats and exhibit their own supplies  heres some water for the mixins whiskers said proffering his tomatocan of river slush  stockyards just above he added apologetically  but they say  huh slim snapped short mixing the drink  ive drunk worsen stockyards in my time  yet when all was ready cans of alki in their solitary hands the three things that had once been men hesitated as if of old habit and next betrayed shame as if at selfexposure  whiskers was the first to brazen it  ive sat in at many a finer drinking he bragged  with the pewter slim sneered  with the silver whiskers corrected  slim turned a scorching eyeinterrogation on fatty  fatty nodded  beneath the salt said slim  above it came fattys correction  i was born above it and ive never travelled second class  first or steerage but no intermediate in mine  yourself whiskers queried of slim  in broken glass to the queen god bless her slim answered solemnly without snarl or sneer  in the pantry fatty insinuated  simultaneously slim reached for his quoit and whiskers and fatty for their rocks  now dont lets get feverish fatty said dropping his own weapon  we arent scum  were gentlemen  lets drink like gentlemen  let it be a real drinking whiskers approved  lets get petrified slim agreed  many a distillerys flowed under the bridge since we were gentlemen but lets forget the long road weve travelled since and hit our doss in the good old fashion in which every gentleman went to bed when we were young  my father done itdid it fatty concurred and corrected as old recollections exploded longsealed braincells of connotation and correct usage  the other two nodded a descent from similar fathers and elevated their tin cans of alcohol   by the time each had finished his own bottle and from his rags fished forth a second one their brains were wellmellowed and a glow although they had not got around to telling their real names but their english had improved  they spoke it correctly while the argo of trampland ceased from their lips  its my constitution whiskers was explaining  very few men could go through what i have and live to tell the tale  and i never took any care of myself  if what the moralists and the physiologists say were true id have been dead long ago  and its the same with you two  look at us at our advanced years carousing as the young ones dont dare sleeping out in the open on the ground never sheltered from frost nor rain nor storm never afraid of pneumonia or rheumatism that would put half the young ones on their backs in hospital  he broke off to mix another drink and fatty took up the tale  and weve had our fun he boasted and speaking of sweethearts and all he cribbed from kipling weve rogued and weve ranged   in our time slim completed the crib for him  i should say so i should say so fatty confirmed  and been loved by princessesat least i have  go on and tell us about it whiskers urged  the nights young and why shouldnt we remember back to the roofs of kings  nothing loth fatty cleared his throat for the recital and cast about in his mind for the best way to begin  it must be known that i came of good family  percival delaney let us say yes let us say percival delaney was not unknown at oxford once upon a timenot for scholarship i am frank to admit but the gay young dogs of that day if any be yet alive would remember him  my people came over with the conqueror whiskers interrupted extending his hand to fattys in acknowledgment of the introduction  what name fatty queried  i did not seem quite to catch it  delarouse chauncey delarouse  the name will serve as well as any  both completed the handshake and glanced to slim  oh well while were about it      fatty urged  bruce cadogan cavendish slim growled morosely  go on percival with your princesses and the roofs of kings  oh i was a rare young devil percival obliged after i played ducks and drakes at home and sported out over the world  and i was some figure of a man before i lost my shapepolo steeplechasing boxing  i won medals at buckjumping in australia and i held more than several swimming records from the quarter of a mile up  women turned their heads to look when i went by  the women  god bless them  and fatty alias percival delaney a grotesque of manhood put his bulgy hand to his puffed lips and kissed audibly into the starry vault of the sky  and the princess he resumed with another kiss to the stars she was as fine a figure of a woman as i was a man as high spirited and courageous as reckless and daredevilish  lord lord in the water she was a mermaid a seagoddess  and when it came to blood beside her i was parvenu  her royal line traced back into the mists of antiquity  she was not a daughter of a fairskinned folk  tawny golden was she with goldenbrown eyes and her hair that fell to her knees was blueblack and straight with just the curly tendrilly tendency that gives to womans hair its charm  oh there were no kinks in it any more than were there kinks in the hair of her entire genealogy  for she was polynesian glowing golden lovely and lovable royal polynesian  again he paused to kiss his hand to the memory of her and slim alias bruce cadogan cavendish took advantage to interject  huh  maybe you didnt shine in scholarship but at least you gleaned a vocabulary out of oxford  and in the south seas garnered a better vocabulary from the lexicon of love percival was quick on the uptake  it was the island of talofa he went on meaning love the isle of love and it was her island  her father the king an old man sat on his mats with paralysed knees and drank squareface gin all day and most of the night out of grief sheer grief  she my princess was the only issue her brother having been lost in their double canoe in a hurricane while coming up from a voyage to samoa and among the polynesians the royal women have equal right with the men to rule  in fact they trace their genealogies always by the female line  to this both chauncey delarouse and bruce cadogan cavendish nodded prompt affirmation  ah said percival i perceive you both know the south seas wherefore without undue expenditure of verbiage on my part i am assured that you will appreciate the charm of my princess the princess tuinui of talofa the princess of the isle of love  he kissed his hand to her sipped from his condensed milk can a mansize drink of druggists alcohol and to her again kissed her hand  but she was coy and ever she fluttered near to me but never near enough  when my arm went out to her to girdle her presto she was not there  i knew as never before nor since the thousand dear and delightful anguishes of love frustrated but ever resilient and beckoned on by the very goddess of love  some vocabulary bruce cadogan cavendish muttered in aside to chauncey delarouse  but percival delaney was not to be deterred he kissed his pudgy hand aloft into the night and held warmly on  no fond agonies of rapture deferred that were not lavished upon me by my dear princess herself ever a luring delight of promise flitting just beyond my reach  every sweet lovers inferno unguessed of by dante she led me through  ah  those swooning tropic nights under our palm trees the distant surf a langourous murmur as from some vast sea shell of mystery when she my princess all but melted to my yearning and with her laughter that was as silver strings by buds and blossoms smitten all but made lunacy of my lovers ardency  it was by my wrestling with the champions of talofa that i first interested her  it was by my prowess at swimming that i awoke her and it was by a certain swimming deed that i won from her more than coquettish smiles and shy timidities of feigned retreat  we were squidding that day out on the reefyou know how undoubtedly diving down the face of the wall of the reef five fathoms ten fathoms any depth within reason and shoving our squidsticks into the likely holes and crannies of the coral where squid might be lairing  with the squidstick bluntly sharp at both ends perhaps a foot long and held crosswise in the hand the trick was to gouge any lazying squid until he closed his tentacles around fist stick and armthen you had him and came to the surface with him and hit him in the head which is in the centre of him and peeled him off into the waiting canoe    and to think i used to do that  percival delaney paused a moment a glimmer of awe on his rotund face as he contemplated the mighty picture of his youth  why ive pulled out a squid with tentacles eight feet long and done it under fifty feet of water  i could stay down four minutes ive gone down with a coralrock to sink me in a hundred and ten feet to clear a fouled anchor  and i could backdive with a once over and go in feetfirst from eighty feet above the surface  quit it delete it cease it chauncey delarouse admonished testily  tell of the princess  thats what makes old blood leap again  almost can i see her  was she wonderful  percival delaney kissed unutterable affirmation  i have said she was a mermaid  she was  i know she swam thirty six hours before being rescued after her schooner was capsized in a doublesquall  i have seen her do ninety feet and bring up pearl shell in each hand  she was wonderful  as a woman she was ravishing sublime  i have said she was a seagoddess  she was oh for a phidias or a praxiteles to have made the wonder of her body immortal  and that day out for squid on the reef i was almost sick for her  madi know i was mad for her  we would step over the side from the big canoe and swim down side by side into the delicious depths of cool and colour and she would look at me as we swam and with her eyes tantalize me to further madness  and at last down far down i lost myself and reached for her  she eluded me like the mermaid she was and i saw the laughter on her face as she fled  she fled deeper and i knew i had her for i was between her and the surface but in the muck coral sand of the bottom she made a churning with her squid stick  it was the old trick to escape a shark  and she worked it on me rolling the water so that i could not see her  and when i came up she was there ahead of me clinging to the side of the canoe and laughing  almost i would not be denied  but not for nothing was she a princess  she rested her hand on my arm and compelled me to listen  we should play a game she said enter into a competition for which should get the more squid the biggest squid and the smallest squid  since the wagers were kisses you can well imagine i went down on the first next dive with soul aflame  i got no squid  never again in all my life have i dived for squid  perhaps we were five fathoms down and exploring the face of the reefwall for lurking places of our prey when it happened  i had found a likely lair and just proved it empty when i felt or sensed the nearness of something inimical  i turned  there it was alongside of me and no mere fishshark  fully a dozen feet in length with the unmistakable phosphorescent cats eye gleaming like a drowning star i knew it for what it was a tiger shark  not ten feet to the right probing a coral fissure with her squid stick was the princess and the tiger shark was heading directly for her  my totality of thought was precipitated to consciousness in a single allembracing flash  the maneater must be deflected from her and what was i except a mad lover who would gladly fight and die or more gladly fight and live for his beloved  remember she was the woman wonderful and i was aflame for her  knowing fully the peril of my act i thrust the bluntsharp end of my squidstick into the side of the shark much as one would attract a passing acquaintance with a thumbnudge in the ribs  and the maneater turned on me  you know the south seas and you know that the tiger shark like the baldface grizzly of alaska never gives trail  the combat fathoms deep under the sea was onif by combat may be named such a onesided struggle  the princess unaware caught her squid and rose to the surface the maneater rushed me  i fended him off with both hands on his nose above his thousandtoothed open mouth so that he backed me against the sharp coral  the scars are there to this day whenever i tried to rise he rushed me and i could not remain down there indefinitely without air  whenever he rushed me i fended him off with my hands on his nose  and i would have escaped unharmed except for the slip of my right hand  into his mouth it went to the elbow  his jaws closed just below the elbow  you know how a sharks teeth are  once in they cannot be released they must go through to complete the bite but they cannot go through heavy bone  so from just below the elbow he stripped the bone clean to the articulation of the wristjoint where his teeth met and my good right hand became his for an appetizer  but while he was doing this i drove the thumb of my left hand to the hilt into his eyeorifice and popped out his eye  this did not stop him  the meat had maddened him  he pursued the gushing stump of my wrist  half a dozen times i fended with my intact arm  then he got the poor mangled arm again closed down and stripped the meat off the bone from the shoulder down to the elbowjoint where his teeth met and he was free of his second mouthful of me  but at the same time with my good arm i thumbed out his remaining eye  percival delaney shrugged his shoulders ere he resumed  from above those in the canoe had beheld the entire happening and were loud in praise of my deed  to this day they still sing the song of me and tell the tale of me  and the princess  his pause was brief but significant  the princess married me    oh welladay and lackaday the whirligig of time and fortune the topsyturviness of luck the wooden shoe going up and the polished heel descending a french gunboat a conquered island kingdom of oceania today ruled over by a peasantborn unlettered colonial gendarme and      he completed the sentence and the tale by burying his face in the downtilted mouth of the condensed milk can and by gurgling the corrosive drink down his throat in thirsty gulps   after an appropriate pause chauncey delarouse otherwise whiskers took up the tale  far be it from me to boast of no matter what place of birth i have descended from to sit here by this fire with such as    as chance along  i may say however that i too was once a considerable figure of a man  i may add that it was horses plus parents too indulgent that exiled me out over the world  i may still wonder to query  are dovers cliffs still white  huh bruce cadogan cavendish sneered  next youll be asking how fares the old lord warden  and i took every liberty and vainly with a constitution that was iron whiskers hurried on  here i am with my three score and ten behind me and back on that long road have i buried many a youngster that was as rare and devilish as i but who could not stand the pace  i knew the worst too young  and now i know the worst too old  but there was a time alas all too short when i knew the best  i too kiss my hand to the princess of my heart  she was truly a princess polynesian a thousand miles and more away to the eastward and the south from delaneys isle of love  the natives of all around that part of the south seas called it the jolly island their own name the name of the people who dwelt thereon translates delicately and justly into the island of tranquil laughter  on the chart you will find the erroneous name given to it by the old navigators to be manatomana  the seafaring gentry the round ocean around called it the adamless eden  and the missionaries for a time called it gods witnessso great had been their success at converting the inhabitants  as for me it was and ever shall be paradise  it was my paradise for it was there my princess lived  john asibeli tungi was king  he was fullblooded native descended out of the oldest and highest chiefstock that traced back to manua which was the primeval sea home of the race  also was he known as john the apostate  he lived a long life and apostasized frequently  first converted by the catholics he threw down the idols broke the tabus cleaned out the native priests executed a few of the recalcitrant ones and sent all his subjects to church  next he fell for the traders who developed in him a champagne thirst and he shipped off the catholic priests to new zealand the great majority of his subjects always followed his lead and having no religion at all ensued the time of the great licentiousness when by all south seas missionaries his island in sermons was spoken of as babylon  but the traders ruined his digestion with too much champagne and after several years he fell for the gospel according to the methodists sent his people to church and cleaned up the beach and the trading crowd so spick and span that he would not permit them to smoke a pipe out of doors on sunday and fined one of the chief traders one hundred gold sovereigns for washing his schooners decks on the sabbath morn  that was the time of the blue laws but perhaps it was too rigorous for king john  off he packed the methodists one fine day exiled several hundred of his people to samoa for sticking to methodism and of all things invented a religion of his own with himself the figurehead of worship  in this he was aided and abetted by a renegade fijian  this lasted five years  maybe he grew tired of being god or maybe it was because the fijian decamped with the six thousand pounds in the royal treasury but at any rate the second reformed wesleyans got him and his entire kingdom went wesleyan  the pioneer wesleyan missionary he actually made prime minister and what he did to the trading crowd was a caution  why in the end king johns kingdom was blacklisted and boycotted by the traders till the revenues diminished to zero the people went bankrupt and king john couldnt borrow a shilling from his most powerful chief  by this time he was getting old and philosophic and tolerant and spiritually atavistic  he fired out the second reformed wesleyans called back the exiles from samoa invited in the traders held a general lovefeast took the lid off proclaimed religious liberty and high tariff and as for himself went back to the worship of his ancestors dug up the idols reinstated a few octogenarian priests and observed the tabus  all of which was lovely for the traders and prosperity reigned  of course most of his subjects followed him back into heathen worship  yet quite a sprinkling of catholics methodists and wesleyans remained true to their beliefs and managed to maintain a few squalid onehorse churches  but king john didnt mind any more than did he the high times of the traders along the beach  everything went so long as the taxes were paid  even when his wife queen mamare elected to become a baptist and invited in a little weazened sweet spirited clubfooted baptist missionary king john did not object all he insisted on was that these wandering religions should be selfsupporting and not feed a pennyworths out of the royal coffers  and now the threads of my recital draw together in the paragon of female exquisitenessmy princess  whiskers paused placed carefully on the ground his halffull condensed milk can with which he had been absently toying and kissed the fingers of his one hand audibly aloft  she was the daughter of queen mamare  she was the woman wonderful  unlike the diana type of polynesian she was almost ethereal  she was ethereal sublimated by purity as shy and modest as a violet as fragileslender as a lily and her eyes luminous and shrinking tender were as asphodels on the sward of heaven  she was all flower and fire and dew  hers was the sweetness of the mountain rose the gentleness of the dove  and she was all of good as well as all of beauty devout in her belief in her mothers worship which was the worship introduced by ebenezer naismith the baptist missionary  but make no mistake she was no mere sweet spirit ripe for the bosom of abraham  all of exquisite deliciousness of woman was she  she was woman all woman to the last sensitive quivering atom of her   and i  i was a wastrel of the beach  the wildest was not so wild as i the keenest not so keen of all that wild keen trading crowd  it was esteemed i played the stiffest hand of poker  i was the only living man white brown or black who dared run the kunikuni passage in the dark  and on a black night i have done it under reefs in a gale of wind  well anyway i had a bad reputation on a beach where there were no good reputations  i was reckless dangerous stopped at nothing in fight or frolic and the trading captains used to bring boilersheeted prodigies from the vilest holes of the south pacific to try and drink me under the table  i remember one a calcined scotchman from the new hebrides it was a great drinking  he died of it and we laded him aboard ship pickled in a cask of trade rum and sent him back to his own place  a sample a fair sample of the antic tricks we cut up on the beach of manatomana  and of all unthinkable things what did i up and do one day but look upon the princess to find her good and to fall in love with her  it was the real thing  i was as mad as a march hare and after that i got only madder  i reformed  think of that  think of what a slip of a woman can do to a busy roving manby the lord harry its true  i reformed  i went to church  hear me  i became converted  i cleared my soul before god and kept my hands i had two thenoff the ribald crew of the beach when it laughed at this my latest antic and wanted to know what was my game  i tell you i reformed and gave myself in passion and sincerity to a religious experience that has made me tolerant of all religion ever since  i discharged my best captain for immorality  so did i my cook and a better never boiled water in manatomana  for the same reason i discharged my chief clerk  and for the first time in the history of trading my schooners to the westward carried bibles in their stock  i built a little anchorite bungalow up town on a mangolined street squarely alongside the little house occupied by ebenezer naismith  and i made him my pal and comrade and found him a veritable honey pot of sweetnesses and goodnesses  and he was a man through and through a man  and he died long after like a man which i would like to tell you about were the tale of it not so deservedly long  it was the princess more than the missionary who was responsible for my expressing my faith in works and especially in that crowning work the new church our church the queenmothers church  our poor church she said to me one night after prayermeeting i had been converted only a fortnight  it is so small its congregation can never grow  and the roof leaks  and king john my hardhearted father will not contribute a penny  yet he has a big balance in the treasury  and manatomana is not poor  much money is made and squandered i know  i hear the gossip of the wild ways of the beach  less than a month ago you lost more in one night gambling at cards than the cost of the upkeep of our poor church for a year  and i told her it was true but that it was before i had seen the light  id had an infernal run of bad luck  i told her i had not tasted liquor since nor turned a card  i told her that the roof would be repaired at once by christian carpenters selected by her from the congregation  but she was filled with the thought of a great revival that ebenezer naismith could preachshe was a dear saintand she spoke of a great church saying  you are rich  you have many schooners and traders in far islands and i have heard of a great contract you have signed to recruit labour for the german plantations of upolu  they say next to sweitzer you are the richest trader here  i should love to see some use of all this money placed to the glory of god  it would be a noble thing to do and i should be proud to know the man who would do it  i told her that ebenezer naismith would preach the revival and that i would build a church great enough in which to house it  as big as the catholic church she asked  this was the ruined cathedral built at the time when the entire population was converted and it was a large order but i was afire with love and i told her that the church i would build would be even bigger  but it will take money i explained  and it takes time to make money  you have much she said  some say you have more money than my father the king  i have more credit i explained  but you do not understand money  it takes money to have credit  so with the money i have and the credit i have i will work to make more money and credit and the church shall be built  work  i was a surprise to myself  it is an amazement the amount of time a man finds on his hands after hes given up carousing and gambling and all the timeeating diversions of the beach  and i didnt waste a second of all my newfound time  instead i worked it overtime  i did the work of half a dozen men  i became a driver  my captains made faster runs than ever and earned bigger bonuses as did my supercargoes who saw to it that my schooners did not loaf and dawdle along the way  and i saw to it that my supercargoes did see to it  and good  by the lord harry i was so good it hurt  my conscience got so expansive and finestrung it lamed me across the shoulders to carry it around with me  why i even went back over my accounts and paid sweitzer fifty quid id jiggered him out of in a deal in fiji three years before  and i compounded the interest as well  work  i planted sugar canethe first commercial planting on manatomana  i ran in cargoes of kinkyheads from malaita which is in the solomons till i had twelve hundred of the blackbirds putting in cane  and i sent a schooner clear to hawaii to bring back a dismantled sugar mill and a german who said he knew the fieldend of cane  and he did and he charged me three hundred dollars screw a month and i took hold of the millend  i installed the mill myself with the help of several mechanics i brought up from queensland  of course there was a rival  his name was motomoe  he was the very highest chief blood next to king johns  he was full native a strapping handsome man with a glowering way of showing his dislikes  he certainly glowered at me when i began hanging around the palace  he went back in my history and circulated the blackest tales about me  the worst of it was that most of them were true he even made a voyage to apia to find things outas if he couldnt find a plenty right there on the beach of manatomana  and he sneered at my failing for religion and at my going to prayer meeting and most of all at my sugarplanting  he challenged me to fight and i kept off of him  he threatened me and i learned in the nick of time of his plan to have me knocked on the head you see he wanted the princess just as much as i did and i wanted her more  she used to play the piano  so did i once  but i never let her know after id heard her play the first time  and she thought her playing was wonderful the dear fond girl  you know the sort the mechanical onetwothree tumtumtum schoolgirl stuff  and now ill tell you something funnier  her playing was wonderful to me the gates of heaven opened to me when she played  i can see myself now worn out and dogtired after the long day lying on the mats of the palace veranda and gazing upon her at the piano myself in a perfect idiocy of bliss  why this idea she had of her fine playing was the one flaw in her deliciousness of perfection and i loved her for it  it kind of brought her within my human reach why when she played her onetwothree tumtumtum i was in the seventh heaven of bliss  my weariness fell from me  i loved her and my love for her was clean as flame clean as my love for god and do you know into my fond lovers fancy continually intruded the thought that god in most ways must look like her  thats right bruce cadogan cavendish sneer as you like  but i tell you thats love that ive been describing  thats all  its love  its the realest purest finest thing that can happen to a man  and i know what im talking about  it happened to me  whiskers his beady squirrels eye glittering from out his ruined eyebrow like a live coal in a jungle ambush broke off long enough to down a sedative draught from his condensed milk can and to mix another  the cane he resumed wiping his prodigious mat of face hair with the back of his hand  it matured in sixteen months in that climate and i was ready just ready and no more with the mill for the grinding  naturally it did not all mature at once but i had planted in such succession that i could grind for nine months steadily while more was being planted and the ratoons were springing up  i had my troubles the first several days  if it wasnt one thing the matter with the mill it was another  on the fourth day ferguson my engineer had to shut down several hours in order to remedy his own troubles  i was bothered by the feeder  after having the niggers who had been feeding the cane pour cream of lime on the rollers to keep everything sweet i sent them out to join the canecutting squads  so i was all alone at that end just as ferguson started up the mill just as i discovered what was the matter with the feedrollers and just as motomoe strolled up  he stood there in norfolk jacket pigskin puttees and all the rest of the fashionable getup out of a bandbox sneering at me covered with filth and grease to the eyebrows and looking like a navvy  and the rollers now white from the lime id just seen what was wrong  the rollers were not in plumb  one side crushed the cane well but the other side was too open  i shoved my fingers in on that side  the big toothed cogs on the rollers did not touch my fingers  and yet suddenly they did  with the grip of ten thousand devils my fingertips were caught drawn in and pulped towell just pulp  and like a slick of cane i had started on my way  there was no stopping me  ten thousand horses could not have pulled me back  there was nothing to stop me hand arm shoulder head and chest down to the toes of me i was doomed to feed through  it did hurt  it hurt so much it did not hurt me at all  quite detached almost may i say i looked on my hand being ground up knuckle by knuckle joint by joint the back of the hand the wrist the forearm all in order slowly and inevitably feeding in o engineer hoist by thine own petard  o sugarmaker crushed by thine own canecrusher  motomoe sprang forward involuntarily and the sneer was chased from his face by an expression of solicitude  then the beauty of the situation dawned on him and he chuckled and grinned  no i didnt expect anything of him  hadnt he tried to knock me on the head  what could he do anyway  he didnt know anything about engines  i yelled at the top of my lungs to ferguson to shut off the engine but the roar of the machinery drowned my voice  and there i stood up to the elbow and feeding right on in  yes it did hurt  there were some astonishing twinges when special nerves were shredded and dragged out by the roots  but i remember that i was surprised at the time that it did not hurt worse  motomoe made a movement that attracted my attention  at the same time he growled out loud as if he hated himself im a fool what he had done was to pick up a caneknifeyou know the kind as big as a machete and as heavy  and i was grateful to him in advance for putting me out of my misery  there wasnt any sense in slowly feeding in till my head was crushed and already my arm was pulped half way from elbow to shoulder and the pulping was going right on  so i was grateful as i bent my head to the blow  get your head out of the way you idiot he barked at me  and then i understood and obeyed  i was a big man and he took two hacks to do it but he hacked my arm off just outside the shoulder and dragged me back and laid me down on the cane  yes the sugar paidenormously and i built for the princess the church of her saintly dream and    she married me  he partly assuaged his thirst and uttered his final word  alackaday  shuttlecock and battledore  and this at the end of it all lined with boilerplate that even alcohol will not corrode and that only alcohol will tickle  yet have i lived and i kiss my hand to the dear dust of my princess long asleep in the great mausoleum of king john that looks across the vale of manona to the alien flag that floats over the bungalow of the british government house     fatty pledged him sympathetically and sympathetically drank out of his own small can  bruce cadogan cavendish glared into the fire with implacable bitterness  he was a man who preferred to drink by himself  across the thin lips that composed the cruel slash of his mouth played twitches of mockery that caught fattys eye  and fatty making sure first that his rockchunk was within reach challenged  well how about yourself bruce cadogan cavendish  its your turn  the other lifted bleak eyes that bored into fattys until he physically betrayed uncomfortableness  ive lived a hard life slim grated harshly  what do i know about love passages  no man of your build and makeup could have escaped them fatty wheedled  and what of it slim snarled  its no reason for a gentleman to boast of amorous triumphs  oh go on be a good fellow fatty urged  the nights still young  weve still some drink left  delarouse and i have contributed our share  it isnt often that three real ones like us get together for a telling  surely youve got at least one adventure in love you arent ashamed to tell about  bruce cadogan cavendish pulled forth his iron quoit and seemed to debate whether or not he should brain the other  he sighed and put back the quoit  very well if you will have it he surrendered with manifest reluctance  like you two i have had a remarkable constitution and right now speaking of armourplate lining i could drink the both of you down when you were at your prime  like you two my beginnings were far distant and different  that i am marked with the hallmark of gentlehood there is no discussion    unless either of you care to discuss the matter now      his one hand slipped into his pocket and clutched the quoit neither of his auditors spoke nor betrayed any awareness of his menace  it occurred a thousand miles to the westward of manatomana on the island of tagalag he continued abruptly with an air of saturnine disappointment in that there had been no discussion  but first i must tell you of how i got to tagalag  for reasons i shall not mention by paths of descent i shall not describe in the crown of my manhood and the prime of my devilishness in which oxford renegades and racing younger sons had nothing on me i found myself master and owner of a schooner so well known that she shall remain historically nameless  i was running blackbird labour from the west south pacific and the coral sea to the plantations of hawaii and the nitrate mines of chili  it was you who cleaned out the entire population of fatty exploded ere he could check his speech  the one hand of bruce cadogan cavendish flashed pocketward and flashed back with the quoit balanced ripe for business  proceed fatty sighed  i    i have quite forgotten what i was going to say  beastly funny country over that way the narrator drawled with perfect casualness  youve read this sea wolf stuff  you werent the sea wolf whiskers broke in with involuntary positiveness  no sir was the snarling answer  the sea wolfs dead isnt he  and im still alive arent i  of course of course whiskers conceded  he suffocated head first in the mud off a wharf in victoria a couple of years back  as i was sayingand i dont like interruptions bruce cadogan cavendish proceeded its a beastly funny country over that way i was at takitiki a low island that politically belongs to the solomons but that geologically doesnt at all for the solomons are high islands  ethnographically it belongs to polynesia melanesia and micronesia because all the breeds of the south pacific have gravitated to it by canoedrift and intricately degeneratively and amazingly interbred  the scum of the scrapings of the bottom of the human pit biologically speaking resides in takatiki  and i know the bottom and whereof i speak  it was a beastly funny time of it i had diving out shell fishing bechedemer trading hoopiron and hatchets for copra and ivory nuts running niggers and all the rest of it  why even in fiji the lotu was having a hard time of it and the chiefs still eating longpig  to the westward it was fiercefunny little black kinky heads maneaters the last jack of them and the jackpot fat and spilling over with wealth  jackpots fatty queried  at sight of an irritable movement he added  you see i never got over to the west like delarouse and you  theyre all headhunters  heads are valuable especially a white mans head  they decorate the canoehouses and devildevil houses with them  each village runs a jackpot and everybody antes whoever brings in a white mans head takes the pot  if there arent openers for a long time the pot grows to tremendous proportions  beastly funny isnt it  i know  didnt a holland mate die on me of blackwater  and didnt i win a pot myself  it was this way  we were lying at langolui at the time  i never let on and arranged the affair with johnny my boatsteerer  he was a kinkyhead himself from port moresby  he cut the dead mates head off and sneaked ashore in the might while i whanged away with my rifle as if i were trying to get him  he opened the pot with the mates head and got it too  of course next day i sent in a landing boat with two covering boats and fetched him off with the loot  how big was the pot whiskers asked  i heard of a pot at orla worth eighty quid  to commence with slim answered there were forty fat pigs each worth a fathom of prime shellmoney and shellmoney worth a quid a fathom  that was two hundred dollars right there  there were ninetyeight fathoms of shellmoney which is pretty close to five hundred in itself  and there were twentytwo gold sovereigns  i split it four ways  onefourth to johnny onefourth to the ship onefourth to me as owner and onefourth to me as skipper  johnny never complained  hed never had so much wealth all at one time in his life  besides i gave him a couple of the mates old shirts and i fancy the mates head is still there decorating the canoe house  not exactly christian burial of a christian whiskers observed  but a lucrative burial slim retorted  i had to feed the rest of the mate overside to the sharks for nothing  think of feeding an eighthundreddollar head along with it  it would have been criminal waste and stark lunacy  well anyway it was all beastly funny over there to the westward  and without telling you the scrape i got into at taki tiki except that i sailed away with two hundred kinkyheads for queensland labour and for my manner of collecting them had two british ships of war combing the pacific for me i changed my course and ran to the westward thinking to dispose of the lot to the spanish plantations on bangar  typhoon season  we caught it  the merry mist was my schooners name and i had thought she was stoutly built until she hit that typhoon  i never saw such seas  they pounded that stout craft to pieces literally so  the sticks were jerked out of her deckhouses splintered to matchwood rails ripped off and after the worst had passed the covering boards began to go  we just managed to repair what was left of one boat and keep the schooner afloat only till the sea went down barely enough to get away  and we outfitted that boat in a hurry  the carpenter and i were the last and we had to jump for it as he went down  there were only four of us  lost all the niggers whiskers inquired  some of them swam for some time slim replied  but i dont fancy they made the land  we were ten days in doing it  and we had a spanking breeze most of the way  and what do you think we had in the boat with us  cases of squareface gin and cases of dynamite  funny wasnt it  well it got funnier later on  oh there was a small beaker of water a little salt horse and some saltwatersoaked sea biscuitenough to keep us alive to tagalag  now tagalag is the disappointingest island ive ever beheld  it shows up out of the sea so as you can make its fall twenty miles off  it is a volcano cone thrust up out of deep sea with a segment of the crater wall broken out  this gives sea entrance to the crater itself and makes a fine sheltered harbour  and thats all  nothing lives there  the outside and the inside of the crater are too steep  at one place inside is a patch of about a thousand coconut palms  and thats all as i said saving a few insects  no fourlegged thing even a rat inhabits the place and its funny most awful funny with all those coconuts not even a coconut crab  the only meatfood living was schools of mullet in the harbourfattest finest biggest mullet i ever laid eyes on  and the four of us landed on the little beach and set up housekeeping among the coconuts with a larder full of dynamite and squareface  why dont you laugh  its funny i tell you  try it some timeholland gin and straight coconut diet  ive never been able to look a confectioners window in the face since  now im not strong on religion like chauncey delarouse there but i have some primitive ideas and my concept of hell is an illimitable coconut plantation stocked with cases of squareface and populated by shipwrecked mariners  funny  it must make the devil scream  you know straight coconut is what the agriculturists call an unbalanced ration  it certainly unbalanced our digestions  we got so that whenever hunger took an extra bite at us we took another drink of gin  after a couple of weeks of it olaf a squarehead sailor got an idea  it came when he was full of gin and we being in the same fix just watched him shove a cap and short fuse into a stick of dynamite and stroll down toward the boat  it dawned on me that he was going to shoot fish if there were any about but the sun was beastly hot and i just reclined there and hoped hed have luck  about half an hour after he disappeared we heard the explosion but he didnt come back  we waited till the cool of sunset and down on the beach found what had become of him  the boat was there all right grounded by the prevailing breeze but there was no olaf  he would never have to eat coconut again  we went back shakier than ever and cracked another squareface  the next day the cook announced that he would rather take his chance with dynamite than continue trying to exist on coconut and that though he didnt know anything about dynamite he knew a sight too much about coconut  so we bit the detonator down for him shoved in a fuse and picked him a good firestick while he jolted up with a couple more stiff ones of gin  it was the same programme as the day before  after a while we heard the explosion and at twilight went down to the boat from which we scraped enough of the cook for a funeral  the carpenter and i stuck it out two days more then we drew straws for it and it was his turn  we parted with harsh words for he wanted to take a squareface along to refresh himself by the way while i was set against running any chance of wasting the gin besides he had more than he could carry then and he wobbled and staggered as he walked  same thing only there was a whole lot of him left for me to bury because hed prepared only half a stick  i managed to last it out till next day when after duly fortifying myself i got sufficient courage to tackle the dynamite  i used only a third of a stick you know short fuse with the end split so as to hold the head of a safety match  thats where i mended my predecessors methods not using the matchhead theyd toolong fuses  therefore when they spotted a school of mullet and lighted the fuse they had to hold the dynamite till the fuse burned short before they threw it if they threw it too soon it wouldnt go off the instant it hit the water while the splash of it would frighten the mullet away funny stuff dynamite  at any rate i still maintain mine was the safer method  i picked up a school of mullet before id been rowing five minutes  fine big fat ones they were and i could smell them over the fire  when i stood up firestick in one hand dynamite stick in the other my knees were knocking together  maybe it was the gin or the anxiousness or the weakness and the hunger and maybe it was the result of all of them but at any rate i was all of a shake  twice i failed to touch the firestick to the dynamite then i did heard the matchhead splutter and let her go  now i dont know what happened to the others but i know what i did  i got turned about  did you ever stem a strawberry and throw the strawberry away and pop the stem into your mouth  thats what i did  i threw the firestick into the water after the mullet and held on to the dynamite  and my arm went off with the stick when it went off      slim investigated the tomatocan for water to mix himself a drink but found it empty  he stood up  heigh ho he yawned and started down the path to the river  in several minutes he was back  he mixed the due quantity of river slush with the alcohol took a long solitary drink and stared with bitter moodiness into the fire  yes but     fatty suggested  what happened then  oh sad slim  then the princess married me of course  but you were the only person left and there wasnt any princess      whiskers cried out abruptly and then let his voice trail away to embarrassed silence  slim stared unblinkingly into the fire  percival delaney and chauncey delarouse looked at each other quietly in solemn silence each with his one arm aided the one arm of the other in rolling and tying his bundle  and in silence bundles slung on shoulders they went away out of the circle of firelight  not until they reached the top of the railroad embankment did they speak  no gentleman would have done it said whiskers  no gentleman would have done it fatty agreed  glen ellen california september 26 1916
