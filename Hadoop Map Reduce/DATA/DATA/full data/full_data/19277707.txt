19277707	old granny fox   by thornton w burgess     chapter i reddy fox brings granny news     pray who is there who would refuse    to bearer be of happy news       old granny fox  snow covered the green meadows and the green forest and ice bound the smiling pool and the laughing brook reddy and granny fox were hungry most of the time it was not easy to find enough to eat these days and so they spent nearly every minute they were awake in hunting sometimes they hunted together but usually one went one way and the other went another way so as to have a greater chance of finding something if either found enough for two the one finding it took the food back to their home if it could be carried if not the other was told where to find it  for several days they had had very little indeed to eat and they were so hungry that they were willing to take almost any chance to get a good meal for two nights they had visited farmer browns henhouse hoping that they would be able to find a way inside but the biddies had been securely locked up and try as they would they couldnt find a way in  its of no use said granny as they started back home after the second try to hope to get one of those hens at night if we are going to get any at all we will have to do it in broad daylight it can be done for i have done it before but i dont like the idea we are likely to be seen and that means that bowser the hound will be set to hunting us  pooh exclaimed reddy what of it its easy enough to fool him  you think so do you snapped granny i never yet saw a young fox who didnt think he knew all there is to know and youre just like the rest when youve lived as long as i have you will have learned not to be quite so sure of your own opinions i grant you that when there is no snow on the ground any fox with a reasonable amount of fox sense in his head can fool bowser but with snow everywhere it is a very different matter if bowser once takes it into his head to follow your trail these days you will have to be smarter than i think you are to fool him the only way you will be able to get away from him will be by going into a hole in the ground and when you do that you will have given away a secret that will mean we will never have any peace at all we will never know when farmer browns boy will take it into his head to smoke us out ive seen it done no sir we are not going to try for one of those hens in the daytime unless we are starving  im starving now whined reddy  no such thing granny snapped ive been without food longer than this many a time have you been over to the big river lately  no replied reddy whats the use its frozen over there isnt anything there  perhaps not replied granny but i learned a long time ago that it is a poor plan to overlook any chance there is a place in the big river which never freezes because the water runs too swiftly to freeze and ive found more than one meal washed ashore there you go over there now while i see what i can find in the green forest if neither of us finds anything it will be time enough to think about farmer browns hens tomorrow  much against his will reddy obeyed it isnt the least bit of use he grumbled as he trotted towards the big river there wont be anything there it is just a waste of time  late that afternoon he came hurrying back and granny knew by the way that he cocked his ears and carried his tail that he had news of some kind well what is it she demanded  i found a dead fish that had been washed ashore replied reddy it wasnt big enough for two so i ate it  anything else asked granny  noo replied reddy slowly that is nothing that will do us any good quacker the wild duck was swimming about out in the open water but though i watched and watched he never once came ashore  ha exclaimed granny that is good news i think well go duck hunting    chapter ii granny and reddy fox go hunting     when youre in doubt what course is right    the thing to do is just sit tight      old granny fox  jolly round bright mr sun had just got well started on his daily climb up in the blue blue sky that morning when he spied two figures trotting across the snowcovered green meadows one behind the other they were trotting along quite as if they had made up their minds just where they were going they had you see they were granny and reddy fox and they were bound for the big river at the place where the water ran too swiftly to freeze the day before reddy had discovered quacker the wild duck swimming about there and now they were on their way to try to catch him  granny led the way and reddy meekly followed her to tell the truth reddy hadnt the least idea that they would have a chance to catch quacker because quacker kept out in the water where he was as safe from them as if they were a thousand miles away the only reason that reddy had willingly started with granny was the hope that he might find a dead fish washed up on the shore as he had the day before  granny certainly is growing foolish in her old age thought reddy as he trotted along behind her i told her that quacker never once came ashore all the time i watched yesterday i dont believe he ever comes ashore and if she knows anything at all she ought to know that she cant catch him out there in the water granny used to be smart enough when she was young i guess but she certainly is losing her mind now its a pity a great pity i can just imagine how quacker will laugh at her i have to laugh myself  he did laugh but you may be sure he took great pains that granny should not see him laughing whenever she looked around he was as sober as could be in fact he appeared to be quite as eager as if he felt sure they would catch quacker now old granny fox is very wise in the ways of the great world and if reddy could have known what was going on in her mind as she led the way to the big river he might not have felt quite so sure of his own smartness granny was doing some quiet laughing herself  he thinks im old and foolish and dont know what im about the young scamp thought she he thinks he has learned all there is to learn it isnt the least use in the world to try to tell him anything when young folks feel the way he does it is a waste of time to talk to them he has got to be shown there is nothing like experience to take the conceit out of these youngsters  now conceit is the feeling that you know more than any one else perhaps you do then again perhaps you dont so sometimes it is best not to be too sure of your own opinion reddy was sure he trotted along behind old granny fox and planned smart things to say to her when she found that there wasnt a chance to catch quacker the duck i am afraid very much afraid that reddy was planning to be saucy people who think themselves smart are quite apt to be saucy  presently they came to the bank of the big river old granny fox told reddy to sit still while she crept up behind some bushes where she could peek out over the big river he grinned as he watched her he was still grinning when she tiptoed back he expected to see her face long with disappointment instead she looked very much pleased  quacker is there said she and i think he will make us a very good dinner creep up behind those bushes and see for yourself then come back here and tell me what you think wed better do to get him  so reddy stole up behind the bushes and this time it was granny who grinned as she watched as he crept along reddy wondered if it could be that for once quacker had come ashore granny seemed so sure they could catch him that this must be the case but when he peeped through the hushes there was quacker way out in the middle of the open water just where he had been the day before    chapter iii reddy is sure granny has lost her senses     perhaps tis just as well that we    cant see ourselves as others see      old granny fox  just as i thought muttered reddy fox as he peeped through the bushes on the bank of the big river and saw quacker swimming about in the water where it ran too swiftly to freeze weve got just as much chance of catching him as i have of jumping over the moon thats what ill tell granny  he crept back carefully so as not to be seen by quacker and when he had reached the place where granny was waiting for him his face wore a very impudent look  well said granny fox what shall we do to catch him  learn to swim like a fish and fly like a bird replied reddy in such a saucy tone that granny had hard work to keep from boxing his ears  you mean that you think he cant be caught said she quietly  i dont think anything about it i know he cant snapped reddy not by us anyway he added  i suppose you wouldnt even try retorted granny  im old enough to know when im wasting my time replied reddy with a toss of his head  in other words you think im a silly old fox who has lost her senses said granny sharply  noo i didnt say that protested reddy looking very uncomfortable  but you think it declared granny now look here mr smarty you do just as i tell you you creep back there where you can watch quacker and all that happens and mind that you keep out of his sight now go  reddy went there was nothing else to do he didnt dare disobey granny watched until reddy had readied his hidingplace then what do you think she did why she walked right out on the little beach just below reddy and in plain sight of quacker yes sir that is what she did  then began such a queer performance that it is no wonder that reddy was sure granny had lost her senses she rolled over and over she chased her tail round and round until it made reddy dizzy to watch her she jumped up in the air she raced back and forth she played with a bit of stick and all the time she didnt pay the least attention to quacker the duck  reddy stared and stared whatever had come over granny she was crazy yes sir that must be the matter it must be that she had gone without food so long that she had gone crazy poor granny she was in her second childhood reddy could remember how he had done such things when he was very young just by way of showing how fine he felt but for a grownup fox to do such things was undignified to say the least you know reddy thinks a great deal of dignity it was worse than undignified it was positively disgraceful he did hope that none of his neighbors would happen along and see granny cutting up so he never would hear the end of it if they did  over and over rolled granny and around and around she chased her tail the snow flew up in a cloud and all the time she made no sound reddy was just trying to decide whether to go off and leave her until she had regained her common sense or to go out and try to stop her when he happened to look out in the open water where quacker was quacker was sitting up as straight as he could in fact he had his wings raised to help him sit up on his tail the better to see what old granny fox was doing  as i live muttered reddy i believe that fellow is nearer than he was  reddy crouched lower than ever and instead of watching granny he watched quacker the duck    chapter iv quacker the duck grows curious     the most curious thing in the world is curiosity      old granny fox  old granny fox never said a truer thing than that it is curious very curious how sometimes curiosity will get the best of even the wisest and most sensible of people even old granny fox herself has been known to be led into trouble by it we expect it of peter rabbit but peter isnt a bit more curious than some others of whom we do not expect it  now quacker the wild duck is the last one in the world you would expect to be led into trouble by curiosity quacker had spent the summer in the far north with honker the goose in fact he had been born there he had started for the far away southland at the same time honker had but when he reached the big river he had found plenty to eat and had decided to stay until he had to move on the big river had frozen over everywhere except in this one place where the water was too swift to freeze and there quacker had remained you see he was a good diver and on the bottom of the river he found plenty to eat no one could get at him out there unless it were roughleg the hawk and if roughleg did happen along all he had to do was to dive and come up far away to laugh and make fun of roughleg the water couldnt get through his oily feathers and so he didnt mind how cold it was  now in his home in the far north there were so many dangers that quacker had early learned to be always on the watch and to take the best of care of himself on his way down to the big river he had been hunted by men with terrible guns and he had learned all about them in fact he felt quite able to keep out of harms way he rather prided himself that there was no one smart enough to catch him  i suspect he thought he knew all there was to know in this respect he was a good deal like reddy fox himself that was because he was young it is the way with young ducks and foxes and with some other youngsters i know  when quacker first saw granny fox on the little beach he flirted his absurd little tail and smiled as he thought how she must wish she could catch him but so far as he could see granny didnt once look at him  she doesnt know im out here at all thought quacker then suddenly he sat up very straight and looked with all his might what under the sun was the matter with that fox she was acting as if she had suddenly lost her senses  over and over she rolled around and around she spun she turned somersaults she lay on her back and kicked her heels in the air never in his life had he known any one to act like that there must be something the matter with her  quacker began to get excited he couldnt keep his eyes off old granny fox he began to swim nearer he wanted to see better he quite forgot she was a fox she moved so fast that she was just a queer red spot on the beach whatever she was doing was very curious and very exciting he swam nearer and nearer the excitement was catching he began to swim in circles himself all the time he drew nearer and nearer to the shore he didnt have the least bit of fear he was just curious he wanted to see better  all the time granny was cutting up her antics she was watching quacker though he didnt suspect it as he swam nearer and nearer to the shore granny rolled and tumbled farther and farther back at last quacker was close to the shore if he kept on he would be right on the land in a few minutes and all the time he stared and stared no thought of danger entered his head you see there was no room because it was so filled with curiosity  in a minute more ill have him thought granny and whirled faster than ever and just then something happened    chapter v reddy fox is afraid to go home     yes sir a chicken track is good to see but    it often puts nothing but water in my mouth      old granny fox  reddy fox thought of that saying many times as he hunted through the green forest that night afraid to go home you see he had almost dined on quacker the duck over at the big river that day and then hadnt and it was all his own fault that was why he was afraid to go home from his hidingplace on the bank he had watched quacker swim in and in until he was almost on the shore where old granny fox was whirling and rolling and tumbling about as if she had entirely lost her senses indeed reddy had been quite sure that she had when she began it wasnt until he saw that curiosity was drawing quacker right in so that in a minute or two granny would be able to catch him that he understood that granny was anything but crazy and really was teaching him a new trick as well as trying to catch a dinner  when he realized this he should have been ashamed of himself for doubting the smartness of granny and for thinking that he knew all there was to know but he was too much excited for any such thoughts nearer and nearer to the shore came quacker his eyes fixed on the red whirling form of granny reddys own eyes gleamed with excitement would quacker keep on right up to the shore nearer and nearer and nearer he came reddy squirmed uneasily he couldnt see as well as he wanted to the bushes behind which he was lying were in his way he wanted to see granny make that jump which would mean a dinner for both  forgetting what granny had charged him reddy eagerly raised his head to look over the edge of the bank now it just happened that at that very minute quacker chanced to look that way his quick eyes caught the movement of reddys head and in an instant all his curiosity vanished that sharp face peering at him over the edge of the bank could mean but one thingdanger it was all a trick he saw through it now like a flash he turned there was the whistle of stiff wings beating the air and the patter of feet striking the water as he got under way then he flew out to the safety of the open water granny sprang but she was just too late and succeeded in doing no more than wet her feet  of course granny didnt know what had frightened quacker not at first anyway but she had her suspicions she turned and looked up at the place where reddy had been hiding she couldnt see him then she bounded up the bank there was no reddy there but far away across the snowcovered green meadows was a red spot growing smaller and smaller reddy was running away then she knew at first granny was very angry you know it is a dreadful thing to be hungry and have a good dinner disappear just as it is almost within reach  ill teach that young scamp a lesson he wont soon forget when i get home she muttered as she watched him then she went back to the edge of the big river and there she found a dead fish which had been washed ashore it was a very good fish and when she had eaten it granny felt better  anyway thought she i have taught him a new trick and one he is nt likely to forget he knows now that granny still knows a few tricks that he doesnt and next time he wont feel so sure he knows it all i guess it was worth while even if i didnt catch quacker my but he would have tasted good granny smacked her lips and started for home  but reddy with a guilty conscience was afraid to go home and so miserable and hungry he hunted through the green forest all the long night and wished and wished that he had heeded what old granny fox had told him    chapter vi old granny fox is caught napping     the wisest folks will make mistakes but    if they are truly wise they will profit from them      old granny fox  there is a saying among the little people of the green forest and the green meadows which runs something like this     you must your eyes wide open keep    to catch old granny fox asleep  of course this means that old granny fox is so smart so clever so keenly on the watch at all times that he must be very smart indeed who fools her or gets ahead of her reddy fox is smart very smart but reddy isnt nearly as smart as old granny fox you see he hasnt lived nearly as long so of course there is much knowledge of many things stored away in grannys head of which reddy knows little  but once in a while even the smartest people are caught napping yes sir that does happen they will be careless sometimes it was just so with old granny fox with all her smartness and cleverness and wisdom she grew careless and all the smartness and cleverness and wisdom in the world is useless if the possessor becomes careless  you see old granny fox had become so used to thinking that she was smarter than any one else unless it was old man coyote that she actually believed that no one was smart enough ever to surprise her yes sir she actually believed that now you know when a person reaches the point of thinking that no one else in all the great world is quite so smart that person is like peter rabbit when he made ready one winter day to jump out on the smooth ice of the smiling poolgetting ready for a fall it was this way with old granny fox  because she had lived near farmer browns so long and had been hunted so often by farmer browns boy and by bowser the hound she had got the idea in her head that no matter what she did they would not be able to catch her so at last she grew careless yes sir she grew careless and that is something no fox or anybody else can afford to do  now on the edge of the green forest was a warm sunny knoll which as you know is a sort of little hill it overlooked the green meadows and was quite the most pleasant and comfortable place for a sunnap that ever was at least that is what old granny fox thought she took sunnaps there very often it was her favorite resting place when bowser the hound had found her trail and had chased her until she was tired of running and had had quite all the exercise she needed or wanted she would play one of her clever tricks by which to make bowser lose her trail then she would hurry straight to that knoll to rest and grin at her own smartness  it happened that she did this one day when there was fresh snow on the ground of course every time she put a foot down she left a print in the snow and where she curled up in the sun she left the print of her body they were very plain to see were these prints and farmer browns boy saw them  he had been tramping through the green forest late in the afternoon and just by chance happened across grannys footprints just for fun he followed them and so came to the sunny knoll granny had left some time before but of course she couldnt take the print of her body with her that remained in the snow and farmer browns boy saw it and knew instantly what it meant he grinned and could granny fox have seen that grin she would have been uncomfortable you see he knew that he had found the place where granny was in the habit of taking a sunnap  so said he this is the place where you rest old mrs fox after running bowser almost off his feet i think we will give you a surprise one of these days yes indeed i think we will give you a surprise you have fooled us many times and now it is our turn  the next day farmer browns boy shouldered his terrible gun and sent bowser the hound to hunt for the trail of old granny fox it wasnt long before bowsers great voice told all the great world that he had found grannys tracks farmer browns boy grinned just as he had the day before then with his terrible gun he went over to the green forest and hid under some pine boughs right on the edge of that sunny knoll  he waited patiently a long long time he heard bowsers great voice growing more and more excited as he followed old granny fox by and by bowser stopped baying and began to yelp impatiently farmer browns boy knew exactly what that meant it meant that granny had played one of her smart tricks and bowser had lost her trail  a few minutes later out of the green forest came old granny fox and she was grinning for once more she had fooled bowser the hound and now could take a nap in peace still grinning she turned around two or three times to make herself comfortable and then with a sigh of contentment curled up for a sunnap and in a few minutes was asleep and just a little way off behind the pine boughs sat farmer browns boy holding his terrible gun and grinning at last he had caught old granny fox napping    chapter vii granny fox has a bad dream     nothing ever simply happens     bear that point in mind    if you look long and hard enough     a cause youll always find      old granny fox  old granny fox was dreaming yes sir she was dreaming there she lay curled up on the sunny little knoll on the edge of the green forest fast asleep and dreaming it was a very pleasant and very comfortable place indeed you see jolly round bright mr sun poured his warmest rays right down there from the blue blue sky when old granny fox was tired she often slipped over there for a short nap and sunbath even in winter she was quite sure that no one knew anything about it it was one of her secrets  this morning old granny fox was very tired unusually so in the first place she had been out hunting all night then before she could reach home bowser the hound had found her tracks and started to follow them of course it wouldnt have done to go home then it wouldnt have done at all bowser would have followed her straight there and so found out where she lived so she had led bowser far away across the green meadows and through the green forest and finally played one of her smart tricks which had so mixed her tracks that bowser could no longer follow them while he had sniffed and snuffed and snuffed and sniffed with that wonderful nose of his trying to find out where she had gone old granny fox had trotted straight to the sunny knoll and there curled up to rest right away she fell asleep  now old granny fox like most of the other little people of the green forest and the green meadows sleeps with her ears wide open her eyes may be closed but not her ears those are always on guard even when she is asleep and at the least sound open fly her eyes and she is ready to run if it were not for the way her sharp ears keep guard she wouldnt dare take naps in the open right in broad daylight if you ever want to catch a fox asleep you mustnt make the teeniest weeniest noise just remember that  now old granny fox had no sooner closed her eyes than she began to dream at first it was a very pleasant dream the pleasantest dream a fox can have it was of a chicken dinner all the chicken she could eat granny certainly enjoyed that dream it made her smack her lips quite as if it were a real and not a dream dinner she was enjoying  but presently the dream changed and became a bad dream yes indeed it became a bad dream it was as bad as at first it had been good it seemed to granny that bowser the hound had become very smart smarter than she had ever known him to be before do what she would she couldnt fool him not one of all the tricks she knew and she knew a great many fooled him at all they didnt puzzle him long enough for her to get her breath  bowser kept getting nearer and nearer and nearer all in the dream you know until it seemed as if his great voice sounded right at her very heels she was so tired that it seemed to her that she couldnt run another step it was a very very real dream you know dreams sometimes do seem very real indeed this was the way it was with the bad dream of old granny fox it seemed to her that she could feel the breath of bowser the hound and that his great jaws were just going to close on her and shake her to death  oh oh cried granny and waked herself up her eyes flew open then she gave a great sigh of relief as she realized that her terrible fright was only a bad dream and that she was curled up right on the dear familiar old sunny knoll and not running for her life at all  old granny fox smiled to think what a fright she had had and thenwell she didnt know whether she was really awake or still dreaming no sir she didnt for a full minute she couldnt be sure whether what she saw was real or part of that dreadful dream you see she was staring into the face of farmer browns boy and the muzzle of his dreadful gun  for just a few seconds she didnt move she couldnt she was too frightened to move then she knew what she saw was real and not a dream at all there wasnt the least bit of doubt about it that was farmer browns boy and that was his dreadful gun all in a flash she knew that farmer browns boy must have been hiding behind those pine boughs  poor old granny fox for once in her life she had been caught napping she hadnt the least hope in the world farmer browns boy had only to fire that dreadful gun and that would be the end of her she knew it    chapter viii what farmer browns boy did     in time of danger heed this rule    think hard and fast but pray keep cool      old granny fox  poor old granny fox she had thought that she had been in tight places before but never never had she been in such a tight place as this there stood farmer browns boy looking along the barrel of his dreadful gun straight at her and only such a short distance such a very short distance away it wasnt the least bit of use to run granny knew that that dreadful gun would go bang and that would be the end of her  for a few seconds she stared at farmer browns boy too frightened to move or even think then she began to wonder why that dreadful gun didnt go off what was farmer browns boy waiting for she got to her feet she was sure that the first step would be her last yet she couldnt stay there  how could fanner browns boy do such a dreadful thing somehow his freckled face didnt look cruel he was even beginning to grin that must be because he had caught her napping and knew that this time she couldnt possibly get away from him as she had so many times before oh sobbed old granny fox under her breath  and right at that very instant farmer browns boy did something what do you think it was no he didnt shoot her he didnt fire his dreadful gun what do you think he did do why he threw a snowball at old granny fox and shouted boo that is what he did and all he did except to laugh as granny gave a great leap and then made those black legs of hers fly as never before  every instant granny expected to hear that dreadful gun and it seemed as if her heart would burst with fright as she ran thinking each jump would be the last one but the dreadful gun didnt bang and after a little when she felt she was safe she turned to look back over her shoulder farmer browns boy was standing right where she had last seen him and he was laughing harder than ever yes sir he was laughing and though old granny fox didnt think so at the time his laugh was good to hear for it was goodnatured and merry and all that an honest laugh should be  go it granny go it shouted farmer browns boy and the next time you are tempted to steal my chickens just remember that i caught you napping and let you off when i might have shot you just remember that and leave my chickens alone  now it happened that tommy tit the chickadee had seen all that had happened and he fairly bubbled over with joy dee dee dee chickadee it is just as i have always saidfarmer browns boy isnt bad hed be friends with every one if every one would let him he cried  maybe maybe grumbled sammy jay who also had seen all that had happened but hes altogether too smart for me to trust oh my oh my what news this will be to tell old granny fox will never hear the end of it if ever again she boasts of how smart she is all we will have to do will be to remind her of the time farmer browns boy caught her napping ho ho ho i must hurry along and find my cousin blacky the crow this will tickle him half to death  as for old granny fox she feared farmer browns boy more than ever not because of what he had done to her but because of what he had not done you see nothing could make her believe that he wanted to be her friend she thought he had let her get away just to show her that he was smarter than she instead of thankfulness hate and fear filled grannys heart you know     people who themselves do ill    for others seldom have good will    chapter ix reddy fox hears about granny fox     though you may think another wrong     and be quite positive youre right    dont let your temper get away     and try at least to be polite      old granny fox  sammy jay hurried through the green forest chuckling as he flew sammy was brimming over with the news he had to tellhow old granny fox had been caught napping by farmer browns boy sammy wouldnt have believed it if any one had told him no sir he wouldnt but he had seen it with his own eyes and it tickled him almost to pieces to think that old granny fox whom everybody thought so sly and clever and smart had been caught actually asleep by the very one of whom she was most afraid but at whom she always had turned up her nose  presently sammy spied reddy fox trotting along the lone little path reddy was forever boasting of how smart granny fox was he had boasted of it so much that everybody was sick of hearing him when he saw reddy trotting along the lone little path sammy chuckled harder than ever he hid in a thick hemlocktree and as reddy passed he shouted   had i such a stupid old granny     as some folks who think they are smart   i never would boast of my granny     but live by myself quite apart  reddy looked up angrily he couldnt see sammy jay but he knew sammys voice there is no mistaking that everybody knows the voice of sammy jay of course it was foolish very foolish of reddy to be angry and still more foolish to show that he was angry had he stopped a minute to think he would have known that sammy was saying such a mean provoking thing just to make him angry and that the angrier he became the better pleased sammy jay would be but like a great many people reddy allowed his temper to get the better of his common sense  who says granny fox is stupid he snarled  i do replied sammy jay promptly i say she is stupid  she is smarter than anybody else in all the green forest and on all the green meadows she is smarter than anybody else in all the great world boasted reddy and he really believed it  she isnt smart enough to fool farmer browns boy taunted sammy  whats that who says so has anything happened to granny fox reddy forgot his anger in a sudden great fear could granny have been shot by farmer browns boy  nothing much only farmer browns boy caught her napping in broad daylight replied sammy and chuckled so that reddy heard him  i dont believe it snapped reddy i dont believe a word of it nobody ever yet caught old granny fox napping and nobody ever will  i dont care whether you believe it or not its so for i saw him retorted sammy jay  youyouyou began reddy fox  go ask tommy tit the chickadee if it isnt true he saw him too interrupted sammy jay  dee dee dee chickadee its so and farmer browns boy only threw a snowball at her and let her run away without shooting at her declared a new voice there sat tommy tit himself  reddy didnt know what to think or say he just couldnt believe it yet he had never known tommy tit to tell an untruth sammy jay alone he wouldnt have believed then tommy tit and sammy jay told reddy all about what they had seen how farmer browns boy had surprised old granny fox and then allowed her to go unharmed reddy had to believe it if tommy tit said it was so it must be so reddy fox started off to hunt up old granny fox and ask her about it but a sudden thought popped into his red head and he changed his mind  i wont say a thing about it until some time when granny scolds me for being careless muttered reddy with a sly grin then ill see what she has to say i guess she wont scold me so much after this  reddy grinned more than ever which wasnt a bit nice of him instead of being sorry that old granny fox had had such a fright he was planning how he would get even with her when she should scold him for his own carelessness    chapter x reddy fox is impudent     a saucy tongue is dangerous to possess    be sure some day t will get you in a mess      old granny fox  reddy fox is headstrong and like most headstrong people is given to thinking that his way is the best way just because it is his way he is smart is reddy fox yes indeed reddy fox is very very smart he has to be in order to live but a great deal of what he knows he learned from old granny fox the very best tricks he knows she taught him she began teaching him when he was so little that he tumbled over his own feet it was she who taught him how to hunt that it is better never to steal chickens near home but to go a long way off for them and how to fool bowser the hound  it was granny who taught reddy how to use his little black nose to follow the tracks of careless young rabbits and how to catch meadow mice under the snow in fact there is little reddy knows which he didnt learn from wise shrewd old granny fox  but as he grew bigger and bigger until he was quite as big as granny herself he forgot what he owed to her he grew to have a very good opinion of himself and to feel that he knew just about all there was to know so sometimes when he had done foolish or careless things and granny had scolded him telling him he was big enough and old enough to know better he would sulk and go off muttering to himself but he never quite dared to be openly disrespectful to granny and this of course was quite as it should have been  if only i could catch granny doing something foolish or careless he would say to himself but he never could and he had begun to think that he never would but now at last granny clever old granny fox had been careless she had allowed farmer browns boy to catch her napping reddy did wish he had been there to see it himself but anyway he had been told about it and he made up his mind that the next time granny said anything sharp to him about his carelessness he would have something to say back yes sir reddy fox was deliberately planning to answer back which as you know is always disrespectful to ones elders  at last the chance came reddy did a thing no truly wise fox ever will do he went two nights in succession to the same henhouse and the second time he barely escaped being shot old granny fox found out about it how she found out reddy doesnt know to this day but find out she did and she gave him such a scolding as even her sharp tongue had seldom given him  you are the stupidest fox i ever heard of scolded granny  im no more stupid than you are retorted reddy in the most impudent way  whats that demanded granny whats that you said  i said im no more stupid than you are and what is more i hope im not so stupid i know better than to take a nap in broad daylight right under the very nose of farmer browns boy reddy grinned in the most impudent way as he said this  grannys eyes snapped then things happened reddy was cuffed this way and cuffed that way and cuffed the other way until it seemed to him that the air was full of black paws every one of which landed on his head or face with a sting that made him whimper and put his tail between his legs and finally howl  there cried granny when at last she had to stop because she was quite out of breath perhaps that will teach you to be respectful to your elders i was careless and stupid and i am perfectly ready to admit it because it has taught me a lesson wisdom often is gained through mistakes but never when one is not willing to admit the mistakes no fox lives long who makes the same mistake twice and those who are impudent to their elders come to no good end ive got a fat goose hidden away for dinner but you will get none of it  ii wish id never heard of grannys mistake whined reddy to himself as he crept dinnerless to bed  you ought to wish that you hadnt been impudent whispered a small voice down inside him    chapter xi after the storm     the joys and the sunshine that make us glad    the worries and troubles that makes us sad    must come to an end so why complain    of too little sun or too much rain      old granny fox  the thing to do is to make the most of the sunshine while it lasts and when it rains to look forward to the corning of the sun again knowing that conic it surely will a dreadful storm was keeping the little people of the green forest the green meadows and the old orchard prisoners in their own homes or in such places of shelter as they had been able to find  but it couldnt last forever and they knew it knowing this was all that kept some of them alive  you see they were starving yes sir they were starving you and i would be very hungry very hungry indeed if we had to go without food for two whole days but if we were snug and warm it wouldnt do us any real harm with the little wild friends especially the little feathered folks it is a very different matter you see they are naturally so active that they have to fill their stomachs very often in order to supply their little bodies with heat and energy so when their food supply is wholly cut off they starve or else freeze to death in a very short time a great many little lives are ended this way in every long hard winter storm  it was late in the afternoon of the second day when rough brother north wind decided that he had shown his strength and fierceness long enough and rumbling and grumbling retired from the green meadows and the green forest blowing the snow clouds away with him for just a little while before it was time for him to go to bed behind the purple hills jolly round red mr sun smiled down on the white land and never was his smile more welcome out from their shelters hurried all the little prisoners for they must make the most of the short time before the coming of the cold night  little tommy tit the chickadee was so weak that he could hardly fly and he shook with chills he made straight for the appletree where farmer browns boy always keeps a piece of suet tied to a branch for tommy and his friends drummer the woodpecker was there before him now it is one of the laws of politeness among the feathered folk that when one is eating from a piece of suet a newcomer shall await his turn  dee dee dee said tommy tit faintly but cheerfully for he couldnt be other than cheery if he tried dee dee dee that looks good to me  it is good mumbled drummer pecking away at the suet greedily come on tommy tit dont wait for me for i wont be through for a long time im nearly starved and i guess you must be  i am confessed tommy as he flew over beside drummer thank you ever so much for not making me wait  dont mention it replied drummer with his mouth full this is no time for politeness here comes yank yank the nuthatch i guess there is room for him too  yank yank was promptly invited to join them and did so after apologizing for seeming so greedy  if i couldnt get my stomach full before night i certainly should freeze to death before morning said he what a blessing it is to have all this good food waiting for us if i had to hunt for my usual food on the trees i certainly should have to give up and die it took all my strength to get over here my i feel like a new bird already here comes sammy jay i wonder if he will try to drive us away as he usually does  sammy did nothing of the kind he was very meek and most polite can you make room for a starving fellow to get a bite he asked i wouldnt ask it but that i couldnt last another night without food  dee dee dee always room for one more replied tommy tit crowding over to give sammy room wasnt that a dreadful storm  worst i ever knew mumbled sammy i wonder if i ever will be warm again  until their stomachs were full not another word was said meanwhile chatterer the red squirrel had discovered that the storm was over as he floundered through the snow to another appletree he saw tommy tit and his friends and in his heart he rejoiced that they had found food waiting for them his own troubles were at an end for in the tree he was headed for was a store of corn    chapter xii granny and reddy fox hunt in vain     old mother natures plans for good    quite often are not understood      old granny fox  tommy tit and drummer the woodpecker and yank yank the nuthatch and sammy jay and chatterer the red squirrel were not the only ones who were out and about as soon as the great storm ended oh my no no indeed everybody who was not sleeping the winter away or who had not a store of food right at hand was out but not all were so fortunate as tommy tit and his friends in finding a good meal  peter rabbit and mrs peter came out of the hole in the heart of the dear old briarpatch where they had managed to keep comfortably warm and at once began to fill their stomachs with bark from young trees and tender tips of twigs it was very coarse food but it would take away that empty feeling mrs grouse burst out of the snow and hurried to get a meal before dark she had no time to be particular and so she ate spruce buds they were very bitter and not much to her liking but she was too hungry and night was too near for her to be fussy she was thankful to have that much  granny fox and reddy were out too they didnt need to hurry because as you know they could hunt all night but they were so hungry that they just had to be looking for something to eat they knew of course that everybody else would be out and they hoped that some of these little people would be so weak that they could easily be caught that seems like a dreadful hope doesnt it but one of the first laws of old mother nature is selfpreservation that means to save your own life first so perhaps granny and reddy are not to be blamed for hoping that some of their neighbors might be caught easily because of the great storm they were very hungry indeed and they could not eat bark like peter rabbit or buds like mrs grouse or seeds like whitefoot the woodmouse their teeth and stomachs are not made for such food  it was hard going for granny and reddy fox the snow was soft and deep in many places and they had to keep pretty close to those places where rough brother north wind had blown away enough of the snow to make walking fairly easy they soon found that their hope that they would find some of their neighbors too weak to escape was quite in vain when jolly round red mr sun dropped clown behind the purple hills to go to bed their stomachs were quite as empty as when they had started out  well go down to the old briarpatch i dont believe it will be of much use but you never can tell until you try peter rabbit may take it into his silly head to come outside said granny leading the way  when they reached the dear old briarpatch they found that peter was not outside in fact peering between the brambles and bushes they could see his little brown form bobbing about as he hunted for tender bark he had already made little paths along which he could hop easily peter saw them almost as soon as they saw him  hard times these said peter pleasantly i hope your stomachs are not as empty as mine he pulled a strip of bark from a young tree and began to chew it this was more than reddy could stand to see peter eating while his own stomach was just one great big ache from emptiness was too much  im going in there and catch him or drive him out where you can catch him if i tear my coat all to pieces snarled reddy  peter stopped chewing and sat up come right along reddy come right along if you want to but i would advise you to save your skin and your coat said he  reddys only reply was a snarl as he pushed his way under the brambles he yelped as they tore his coat and scratched his face but he kept on now peters paths were very cunningly made he had cut them through the very thickest of the briars just big enough for himself and mrs peter to hop along comfortably but reddy is so much bigger that he had to force his way through and in places crawl flat on his stomach which was very slow work to say nothing of the painful scratches from the briars it was no trouble at all for peter to keep out of his way and before long reddy gave up without a word granny fox led the way to the green forest they would try to find where mrs grouse was sleeping under the snow but though they hunted all night they failed to find her for she wisely had gone to bed in a sprucetree    chapter xiii granny fox admits growing old     who will not admit he is older each day    fools no one but himself      old granny fox  old granny fox is a spry old lady for her age if you dont believe it just try to catch her but spry as she is she isnt as spry as she used to be no sir granny fox isnt as spry as she used to be the truth is granny is getting old she never would admit it and reddy never had realized it until the day after the great storm all that night they had hunted in vain for something to eat and at daylight had crept into their house to rest awhile before starting on another hunt they had neither the strength nor the courage to search any longer then wading through snow is very hard work at best and very tiresome but when your stomach has been empty for so long that you almost begin to wonder what food tastes like it becomes harder work still you see it is food that makes strength and lack of food takes away strength  this was why granny and reddy fox just had to rest hungry as they were they had to give up for awhile reddy flung himself down and if ever there was a discouraged young fox he was that one i wish i were dead he moaned  tut tut tut said granny fox sharply thats no way for a young fox to talk im ashamed of you i am indeed then she added more kindly i know just how you feel just try to forget your empty stomach and rest awhile we have had a tiresome disappointing discouraging night but when you are rested things will not look quite so bad you know the old saying   never a road so long is there    but it reaches a turn at last   never a cloud that gathers swift but    disappears as fast  you think you couldnt possibly feel any worse than you do right now but you could many a time i have had to go hungry longer than this after we have rested awhile we will go over to the old pasture perhaps we will have better luck there  so reddy tried to forget the emptiness of his stomach and actually had a nap for he was very very tired when he awoke he felt better  well granny said he lets start for the old pasture the snow has crusted over and we wont find it such hard going as it was last night  granny arose and followed reddy out to the doorstep she walked stiffly the truth is she ached in every one of her old bones at least that is the way it seemed to her she looked towards the old pasture it seemed very far away she sighed wearily i dont believe ill go reddy said she you run along and luck go with you  reddy turned and stared at granny suspiciously you know his is a very suspicious nature could it be that granny had some secret plan of her own to get a meal and wanted to get rid of him  whats the matter with you he demanded roughly it was you who proposed going over to the old pasture  granny smiled it was a sad sort of smile she is wonderfully sharp and smart is granny fox and she knew what was in reddys mind as well as if he had told her  old bones dont rest and recover as quickly as young bones and i just dont feel equal to going over there now said she the truth is reddy i am growing old i am going to stay right here and rest perhaps then ill feel able to go hunting tonight you trot along now and if you get more than a stomachful just remember old granny and bring her a bite  there was something in the way granny spoke that told reddy she was speaking the truth it was the very first time she ever had admitted that she was growing old and was no longer the equal of any fox never before had he noticed how gray she had grown reddy felt a feeling of shame creep over himshame that he had suspected granny of playing a sharp trick and this little feeling of shame was followed instantly by a splendid thought he would go out and find food of some kind and he would bring it straight back to granny he had been taken care of by granny when he was little and now he would repay granny for all she had done for him by taking care of her in her old age  go back in the house and lie down granny said he kindly i am going to get something and whatever it may be you shall have your share with this he trotted off towards the old pasture and somehow he didnt mind the ache in his stomach as he had before    chapter xiv three vain and foolish wishes     theres nothing so foolishly silly and vain    as to wish for a thing you can never attain      old granny fox  we all know that yet most of us are just foolish enough to make such a wish now and then i guess you have done it i know i have peter rabbit has done it often and then laughed at himself afterwards i suspect that even shrewd clever old granny fox has been guilty of it more than once so it is not surprising that reddy fox terribly hungry as he was should do a little foolish wishing  when he left home to go to the old pasture in the hope that he would be able to find something to eat there he started off bravely it was cold very cold indeed but his fur coat kept him warm as long as he was moving the green meadows were glistening white with snow all the world at least all that part of it with which reddy was acquainted was white it was beautiful very beautiful as millions of sparkles flashed in the sun but reddy had no thought for beauty the only thought he had room for was to get something to put in the empty stomachs of himself and granny fox  jack frost had hardened the snow so that reddy no longer had to wade through it he could run on the crust now without breaking through this made it much easier so he trotted along swiftly he had intended to go straight to the old pasture but there suddenly popped into his head a memory of the shelter down in a far corner of the old orchard which farmer browns boy had built for bob white probably the bob white family were there now and he might surprise them he would go there first  reddy stopped and looked carefully to make sure that farmer browns boy and bowser the hound were nowhere in sight then he ran swiftly towards the old orchard just as he entered it he heard a merry voice just over his head dee dee dee dee reddy stopped and looked up there was tommy tit the chickadee clinging tightly to a big piece of fresh suet tied fast to a branch of a tree and tommy was stuffing himself reddy sat down right underneath that suet and looked up longingly the sight of it made his mouth water so that it was almost more than he could stand he jumped once he jumped twice he jumped three times but all his jumping was in vain that suet was beyond his reach there was no possible way of reaching it save by flying or climbing reddys tongue hung out of his mouth with longing  i wish i could climb said reddy  but he couldnt climb and all the wishing in the world wouldnt enable him to as he very well knew so after a little he started on as he drew near the far corner of the old orchard he saw bob white and mrs bob and all the young bobs picking up grain which farmer browns boy had scattered for them just in front of the shelter he had built for them reddy crouched down and very slowly an inch at a time he crept forward his eyes shining with eagerness just as he was almost within springing distance bob white gave a signal and away flew the bob whites to the safety of a hemlocktree on the edge of the green forest  tears of rage and disappointment welled up in reddys eyes i wish i could fly he muttered as he watched the brown birds disappear in the big hemlocktree  this was quite as foolish a wish as the other so reddy trotted on and decided to go down past the smiling pool when he got there he found it as he expected frozen over but just where the laughing brook joins it there was a little place where there was open water billy mink was on the ice at its edge and just as reddy got there billy dived in a minute later he climbed out with a fish in his mouth  give me a bite begged reddy  catch your own fish retorted billy mink i have to work hard enough for what i get as it is  reddy was afraid to go out on the ice where billy was and so he sat and watched him eat that fine fish then billy dived into the water again and disappeared reddy waited a long time but billy did not return i wish i could dive gulped reddy thinking of the fine fish somewhere under the ice  and this wish was quite as foolish as the other wishes    chapter xv reddy fights a battle       t is not the foes that are without      but those that are within      that give us battles that we find      the hardest are to win        old granny fox  after the last of his three foolish wishes reddy fox left the smiling pool and headed straight for the old pasture for which he had started in the first place he wished now that he had gone straight there then he wouldnt have seen the suet tied out of reach to the branch of a tree in the old orchard he wouldnt have seen the bob whites fly away to safety just as he felt almost sure of catching one he wouldnt have seen billy mink bring a fine fish out of the water and eat it right before him it is bad enough to be starving with no food in sight but to be as hungry as reddy fox was and to see food just out of reach to smell it and not be able to get it iswell it is more than most folks can stand patiently  so reddy fox was grumbling to himself as he hurried to the old pasture and his heart was very bitter it seemed to him that everything was against him his neighbors had food but he had none not so much as a crumb it was unfair old mother nature was unjust if he could climb he could get food if he could fly he could get food if he could dive he could get food but he could neither climb fly nor dive he didnt stop to think that old mother nature had given him some of the sharpest wits in all the green forest or on all the green meadows that she had given him a wonderful nose that she had given him the keenest of ears that she had given him speed excelled by few he forgot these things and was so busy thinking bitterly of the things he didnt have that he forgot to use his wits and nose and ears when he reached the old pasture the result was that he trotted right past old jed thumper the big gray rabbit who was sitting behind a little bush holding his breath the minute old jed saw that reddy was safely past he started for his bullbriar castle as fast as he could  it was not until then that reddy discovered him of course reddy started after him and this time he made good use of his speed but he was too late old jed thumper reached his castle with reddy two jumps behind him reddy knew now that there was no chance to catch old jed that day and for a few minutes he felt more bitter than ever then all in a flash reddy fox became the shrewd clever fellow that he really is he grinned  its of no use to try to fill an empty stomach on wishes said he  if i had come straight here and minded my own business id have caught old jed thumper now im going to get some food and im not going home until i do  very wisely reddy put all unpleasant thoughts out of his head and settled down to using his wits and his eyes and his ears and his nose for all they were worth as old mother nature had intended he should  all through the old pasture he hunted taking care not to miss a single place where there was the least chance of finding food but it was all in vain reddy gulped down his disappointment  now for the big river said he and started off bravely  when he reached the edge of the big river he hurried along the bank until he reached a place where the water seldom freezes as he had hoped he found that it was not frozen now it looked so black and cold that it made him shiver just to see it back and forth with his nose to the ground he ran suddenly he stopped and sniffed then he sniffed again then he followed his nose straight to the very edge of the big river there floating in the black water was a dead fish by wading in he could get it  reddy shivered at the touch of the cold water but what were wet feet compared with such an empty stomach as his in a minute he had that fish and was back on the shore it wasnt a very big fish but it would stop the ache in his stomach until he could get something more with a sigh of pure happiness he sank his teeth into it and thenwell then he remembered poor old granny fox reddy swallowed a mouthful and tried to forget granny but he couldnt he swallowed another mouthful poor old granny was back there at home as hungry as he was and too stiff and tired to hunt reddy choked then he began a battle with himself his stomach demanded that fish if he ate it no one would be the wiser but granny needed it even more than he did for a long time reddy fought with himself in the end he picked up the fish and started for home    chapter xvi reddy is made truly happy     its what you do for others    not what they do for you    that makes you feel so happy    all through and through and through      old granny fox  reddy fox ran all the way home from the big river just as fast as he could go in his mouth he carried the fish he had found and from which he had taken just two bites you remember he had had a battle with himself over that fish and now he was running away from himself that sounds funny doesnt it but it was true yes sir reddy fox was running away from himself he was afraid that if he didnt get home to old granny fox with that fish very soon he would eat every last bit of it himself so he was running his very hardest so as to get there before this could happen so really he was running away from himself from his selfish self  old granny fox was on the doorstep watching for him and he saw just how her hungry old eyes brightened when she saw him and what he had  ive brought you something to eat granny he panted as he laid the fish at her feet he was quite out of breath with running it isnt much but it is something it is all i could find for you  granny looked at the fish and then she looked sharply at reddy and into those keen yellow eyes of hers crept a soft tender look such a look as you would never have believed they could have held  what have you had to eat asked granny softly  reddy turned his head that granny might not see his face oh ive had something said he trying to speak lightly it was true he had had two bites from that fish  now you know just how shrewd and smart and wise granny fox is reddy didnt fool her just the least little bit she took two small bites from the fish  now said she well divide it and she bit in two parts what remained in a twinkling she had gulped down the smallest part for you know she was very very hungry that is your share said she as she pushed what remained over to reddy  reddy tried to refuse it i brought it all for you said he i know you did reddy replied granny and it seemed to reddy that he never had known her voice to sound so gentle you brought it to me when all you had had was the two little bites you had taken from it you cant fool me reddy fox there wasnt one good meal for either of us in that fish but there was enough to give us both a little hope and keep us from starving now you mind what i say and eat your share granny said this last very sternly  reddy looked at granny and then he bolted down that little piece of fish without another word  thats better said granny we will feel better both of us now that ive something in my stomach i feel two years younger before you came i didnt feel as if i should ever be able to go on another hunt if you hadnt brought something iim afraid i couldnt have lasted much longer by another day you probably wouldnt have had old granny to think of you may not know it but i know that you saved my life reddy i had reached a point where i just had to have a little food you know there are times when a very little food is of more good than a lot of food could be later this was one of those times  never in all his life had reddy fox felt so truly happy he was still hungryvery very hungry but he gave it no thought he had saved granny fox good old granny who had taught him all he knew and he knew that granny knew how he had had to fight with himself to do it reddy was happy through and through with the great happiness that comes from having done something for some one else  it was nothing he muttered  it was a very great deal replied granny and then she changed the subject how would you like to eat a dinner of bowser the hounds she asked    chapter xvii granny fox promises reddy bowsers dinner     to give her children what each needs    to get the most from life he can    to work and play and live his best    is wise old mother natures plan      old granny fox  old granny fox asked reddy how he would like to eat a dinner of bowser the hounds reddy looked at her sharply to see if she were joking or really meant what she said granny looked so sober and so much in earnest that reddy decided she couldnt be joking even though it did sound that way  i certainly would like it granny yes indeed i certainly would like it said he youyou dont suppose he will give us one do you  granny chuckled no reddy said she bowser isnt so generous as all that especially to foxes he isnt going to give us that dinner we are going to take it away from him yes sir we just naturally are going to take it away from him  reddy didnt for the life of him see how it could be possible to take a dinner away from bowser the hound that seemed to him almost as impossible as it was for him to climb or fly or dive but he had great faith in grannys cleverness he remembered how she had so nearly caught quacker the duck he knew that all the time he had been away trying to find something for them to eat old granny fox had been doing more than just rest her tired old bones he knew that not for one single minute had her sharp wits been idle he knew that all that time she had been studying and studying to find some way by which they could get something to eat so great was his faith in granny just then that if she had told him she would get him a slice of the moon he would have believed her  if you say we can take a dinner away from bowser the hound i suppose we can said reddy though i dont see how but if we can lets do it right away im hungry enough to dare almost anything for the sake of something to put in my stomach it is so empty that little bit of fish we divided is shaking around as if it were lost gracious i could eat a million fish the size of that one have you thought of fanner browns hens granny  of course reddy of course what a silly question replied granny we may have to come to them yet  i wish i was at them right now interrupted reddy with a sigh  but you know what i have told you went on granny the surest way of getting into trouble is to steal hens im not feeling quite up to being chased by bowser the hound just now and if we came right home we would give away the secret of where we live and might be smoked out and that would be the end of us besides those hens will be hard to get this weather because they will stay in their house and there is no way for us to get in there unless we walk right in in broad daylight and that would never do it will be a great deal better to take bowsers dinner away from him in the first place if we are careful no one but bowser will know about it and as long as he is chained up we will have nothing to worry about from him besides we will enjoy getting even with him for the times he has spoiled our chances of catching a fat chicken and for the way he has hunted us most decidedly it will be better and safer to try for bowsers dinner than to try for one of those hens  just as you say granny just as you say returned reddy you know best but how under the sun we can do it beats me  it is very simple replied granny very simple indeed most things are simple enough when you find out how to do them neither of us could do it alone but together we can do it without the least bit of risk listen  granny went close to reddy and whispered to him although there wasnt a soul within hearing a slow grin spread over reddys face as he listened when she had finished he laughed right out  granny you are a wonder he exclaimed admiringly i never should have thought of that of course we can do it my wont bowser be surprised and how mad hell be come on lets be starting  all right said granny and the two started towards farmer browns    chapter xviii why bowser the hound didnt eat his dinner     the thing youve puzzled most about    is simple once youve found it out      old granny fox  bowser the hound dearly loves to hunt just for the pleasure of the chase it isnt so much the desire to kill as it is the pleasure of using that wonderful nose of his and the excitement of trying to catch some one especially granny or reddy fox farmer browns boy had put away his dreadful gun because he no longer wanted to kill the little people of the green forest and the green meadows but rather to make them his friends bowser had missed the exciting hunts he used to enjoy so much with farmer browns boy so bowser had formed the habit of slipping away alone for a hunt every once in a while when farmer browns boy discovered this he got a chain and chained bowser to his little house to keep him from running away and hunting on the sly  of course bowser wasnt kept chained all the time oh my no when his master was about where he could keep an eye on bowser he would let him go free but whenever he was going away and didnt want to take bowser with him he would chain bowser up now bowser always had one good big meal a day to be sure he had scraps or a bone now and then besides but once a day he had one good big meal served to him in a large tin pan if he happened to be chained it was brought out to him if not it was given to him just outside the kitchen door  granny fox knew all about this sly old granny makes it her business to know the affairs of other people around her because there is no telling when such knowledge may be of use to her so granny had watched bowser the hound when he and his master had no idea at all that she was anywhere about and she had found out his ways the usual hour for his dinner and just how far that chain would allow him to go it was such things which she had stored away in that shrewd old head of hers that made her so sure she and reddy could take bowsers dinner away from him it was just about bowsers dinnertime when granny and reddy trotted across the snowcovered fields and crept behind the barn until they could peep around the corner no one was in sight not even bowser who was inside his warm little house at the end of the long shed back of farmer browns house granny saw that he was chained and a sly grin crept over her face  you stay right here and watch until his dinner is brought out to him said she to reddy as soon as whoever brings it has gone back to the house you walk right out where bowser will see you at the sight of you hell forget all about his dinner sit right down where he can see you and stay there until you see that i have got that dinner or until you hear somebody coming for you know bowser will make a great racket then slip around back of the barn and join me back of that shed  so reddy sat down to watch and granny left him by and by mrs brown came out of the house with a pan full of good things she put it down in front of bowsers little house and called to him then she turned and hurried back for it was very cold bowser came out of his little house yawned and stretched lazily  it was time for reddy to do his part out he walked and sat down right in front of bowser and grinned at him bowser stared for a minute as if he doubted his own eyes such impudence bowser growled then with a yelp he sprang towards reddy  now the chain that held him was long but reddy had taken care not to get too near and of course bowser couldnt reach him he tugged with all his might and yelped and barked frantically but reddy just sat there and grinned in the most provoking manner it was great fun to tease bowser this way  meanwhile old granny fox had stolen out from around the corner of the shed behind bowser getting hold of the edge of the pan with her teeth she pulled it back with her around the corner and out of sight if she made any noise bowser didnt hear it he was making too much noise himself and was too excited presently reddy heard the sound of an opening door mrs brown was coming to see what all the fuss was about like a flash reddy darted behind the barn and all mrs brown saw was bowser tugging at his chain as he whined and yelped excitedly  i guess he must have seen a stray cat or something said mrs brown and went back in the house bowser continued to whine and tug at his chain for a few minutes then he gave it up and growling deep in his throat turned to eat his dinner but there wasnt any dinner it had disappeared pan and all bowser couldnt understand it at all  back of the shed granny and reddy fox licked that pan clean licked it until it was polished then with little sighs of satisfaction and every once in a while a chuckle they trotted happily home

enjoyed a dinner more than that one he and granny had stolen from bowser the hound of course it would have tasted delicious anyway because they were so dreadfully hungry but to reddy it tasted better still because it had been intended for bowser bowser has hunted reddy so often that reddy has no love for him at all and it tickled him almost to death to think that they had taken his dinner from almost under his nose  with that good dinner in their stomachs reddy and granny fox felt so much better that the great world no longer seemed such a cold and cruel place funny how differently things look when your stomach is full from the way those same things look when it is empty best of all they knew they could play the same sharp trick again and steal another dinner from bowser if need be it is a comforting feeling a very comforting feeling to know for a certainty where you can get another meal it is a feeling that granny and reddy fox and many other little people of the green meadows and the green forest seldom have in winter as a rule when they have eaten one meal they havent the least idea where the next one is coming from how would you like to live that way  the very next day granny and reddy went up to farmer browns at bowsers dinner hour but this time farmer browns boy was at work near the barn and bowser was not chained granny and reddy stole away as silently as they had come on the day following they found bowser chained and stole another dinner from him then they went away laughing until their sides ached as they heard bowsers whines of surprise and disappointment when he discovered that his dinner had vanished they knew by the sound of his voice that he hadnt the least idea what had become of that dinner  now there was some one else roaming over the snowcovered meadows and through the green forest and the old pasture these days with a stomach so lean and empty that he couldnt think of anything else it was old man coyote you know he is very clever is old man coyote and he managed to find enough food of one kind and another to keep him alive but never enough to give him that comfortable feeling of a full stomach while he wasnt actually starving he was always hungry so he spent all the time when he wasnt sleeping in hunting for something to eat  of course he often ran across the tracks of granny and reddy fox and once in a while he would meet them it struck old man coyote that they didnt seem as thin as he was that set him to thinking neither of them was a smarter hunter than he in fact he prided himself on being smarter than either of them yet when he met them they seemed to be in the best of spirits and not at all worried because food was so scarce why there must be a reason they must be getting food of which he knew nothing  ill just keep an eye on them muttered old man coyote  so very slyly and cleverly old man coyote followed granny and reddy fox taking the greatest care that they should not suspect that he was doing it all one night he followed them through the green forest and over the green meadows and when at last he saw them go home appearing not at all worried because they had caught nothing he trotted off to his own home to do some more thinking  they are getting food somewhere that is sure he muttered as he scratched first one ear and then the other somehow he could think better when he was scratching his ears if they dont get it in the night and they certainly didnt get anything this night they must get it in the daytime ive done considerable hunting myself in the daytime and i havent once met them in the green forest or seen them on the green meadows or up in the old pasture i wonder if they are stealing farmer browns hens and havent been found out yet ive kept away from there myself but if they can steal hens and not be caught i certainly can there never was a fox yet smart enough to do a thing that a coyote cannot do if he tries i think ill slip up where i can watch farmer browns and see what is going on up there yes sir thats what ill do  with this old man coyote grinned and then curled himself up for a short nap for he was tired    chapter xx a twice stolen dinner     no one ever is so smart that some one else    may not prove to be smarter still      old granny fox  listen and you shall hear all about three rogues two were in red and were granny and reddy fox and one was in gray and was old man coyote they were the slyest smartest rogues on all the green meadows or in all the green forest all three had started out to steal the same dinner but the funny part is they didnt intend to steal it from the same person and still funnier is it that one of them didnt even know where that dinner was or what kind of a dinner it would be  true to his resolve to know what granny and reddy fox were getting to eat and where they were getting it old man coyote hid where he could see what was going on about farmer browns for it was there he felt sure that granny and reddy were getting food he had waited only a little while when along came granny and reddy fox past the place where old man coyote was hiding they didnt see him of course not he took care that they should have no chance but anyway they were not thinking of him their thoughts were all of that dinner they intended to have and the smart trick by which they would get it  so with their thoughts all on that dinner they slipped up behind the barn and prepared to work the trick which had been so successful before old man coyote crept after them he saw reddy fox lie down where he could peep around the corner of the barn to watch bowser the hound and to see that no one else was about he saw granny leave reddy there and hurry away old man coyotes wits worked fast  i cant be in two places at once thought he so i cant watch both granny and reddy as i can watch but one which one shall it be granny of course granny is the smartest of the two and whatever they are up to she is at the bottom of it granny is the one to follow  so like a gray shadow crafty old man coyote stole after granny fox and saw her hide behind the corner of the shed at the end of which was the little house of bowser the hound he crept as near as he dared and then lay flat down behind a little bunch of dead grass close to the shed for some time nothing happened and old man coyote was puzzled every once in a while granny fox would look behind and all about to be sure that no danger was near but she didnt see old man coyote after what seemed to him a long time he heard a door open on the other side of the shed it was mrs brown carrying bowsers dinner out to him of course old man coyote didnt know this he knew by the sounds that some one had come out of the house and it made him nervous he didnt like being so close to farmer browns house in broad daylight but he kept his eyes on granny fox and he saw her ears prick up in a way that he knew meant that those sounds were just what she had been waiting for  if she isnt afraid i dont need to be thought he craftily after a few minutes he heard a door close and knew that whoever had come out had gone back into the house almost at once bowser the hound began to yelp and whine swiftly granny fox disappeared around the corner of the shed just as swiftly old man coyote ran forward and peeped around the corner there was bowser the hound tugging at his chain and just beyond his reach was reddy fox grinning in the most provoking manner and there was granny fox backing and dragging after her bowsers dinner in a flash old man coyote understood the plan and he almost chuckled aloud at the cleverness of it then he hastily backed behind the shed and waited in a minute granny fox appeared dragging bowsers dinner she was so intent on getting that dinner that she almost backed into old man coyote without suspecting that he was anywhere about  thank you granny you neednt bother about it any longer ill take it now growled old man coyote in grannys ear  granny let go of that dinner as if it burned her tongue and with a frightened little yelp leaped to one side a minute later reddy came racing around from behind the barn eager for his share what he saw was old man coyote bolting down that twicestolen dinner while granny fox fairly danced with rage    chapter xxi granny and reddy talk things over     youll find as on through life you go    the thing you want may prove to be    the very thing you shouldnt have    then seeming loss is gain you see      old granny fox  if ever two folks were mad away through those two were granny and reddy fox as they watched old man coyote gobble up the dinner they had so cleverly stolen from bowser the hound it was bad enough to lose the dinner but it was worse to see some one else eat it after they had worked so hard to get it robber snarled granny old man coyote stopped eating long enough to grin  thief sneak coward snarled reddy once more old man coyote grinned when that dinner had disappeared down his throat to the last and smallest crumb he licked his chops and turned to granny and reddy  im very much obliged for that dinner said he pleasantly his eyes twinkling with mischief it was the best dinner i have had for a long time allow me to say that that trick of yours was as smart a trick as ever i have seen it was quite worthy of a coyote you are a very clever old lady granny fox now i hear some one coming and i would suggest that it will be better for all concerned if we are not seen about here  he darted off behind the barn like a gray streak and granny and reddy followed for it was true that some one was coming you see bowser the hound had discovered that something was going on around the corner of the shed and he made such a racket that mrs brown had come out of the house to see what it was all about by the time she got around there all she saw was the empty pan which had held bowsers dinner she was puzzled how that pan could be where it was she couldnt understand and bowser couldnt tell her although he tried his very best she had been puzzled about that pan two or three times before  old man coyote lost no time in getting back home for he never felt easy near the home of man in broad daylight granny and reddy fox went home too and there was hate in their heartshate for old man coyote but once they reached home old granny fox stopped growling and presently she began to chuckle  what are you laughing at demanded reddy  at the way old man coyote stole that dinner from us replied granny  i hate him hes a sneaking robber snapped reddy  tut tut reddy tut tut retorted granny be fairminded we stole that dinner from bowser the hound and old man coyote stole it from us i guess he is no worse than we are when you come to think it over now is he  iiwell i dont suppose he is when you put it that way reddy admitted grudgingly  and he was smart very smart to outwit two such clever people as we are continued granny you will have to agree to that  yes said reddy slowly he was smart enough but  there isnt any but reddy interrupted granny you know the law of the green meadows and the green forest it is everybody for himself and anything belongs to one who has the wit or the strength to take it we had the wit to take that dinner from bowser the hound and old man coyote had the wit to take it from us and the strength to keep it it was all fair enough and you know there isnt the least use in crying over spilled milk as the saying is we simply have got to be smart enough not to let him fool us again i guess we wont get any more of bowsers dinners for a while weve got to think of some other way of filling our stomachs when the hunting is poor i think if i could have just one of those fat hens of farmer browns it would put new strength into my old bones all summer i warned you to keep away from that henyard but the time has come now when i think we might try for a couple of those hens  reddy pricked up his ears at the mention of fat hens i think so too said he when shall we try for one  tomorrow morning replied granny now dont bother me while i think out a plan    chapter xxii granny fox plans to get a fat hen     full half success for fox or man    is won by working out a plan      old granny fox  granny fox knows this no one knows it better whatever she does is first carefully planned in her wise old head so now after she had decided that she and reddy would try for one of farmer browns fat hens she lay down to think out a plan to get that fat hen no one knew better than she how foolish it would be to go over to that henyard and just trust to luck for a chance to catch one of those biddies of course they might be lucky and get a hen that way but then again they might be unlucky and get in a peck of trouble  you see said she to reddy we must not only plan how to get that fat hen but we must also plan how to get away with it safely if only there was some way of getting in that henhouse at night there would be no trouble at all i dont suppose there is the least chance of that  not the least chance in the world replied reddy there isnt a hole anywhere big enough for even shadow the weasel to get through and farmer browns boy is very careful to lock the door every night  theres a little hole that the hens go in and out of during the day which is big enough for one of us to slip through i believe said granny thoughtfully  sure but its always closed at night snapped reddy besides to get to that or the door either you have got to get inside the henyard and theres a gate to that which we cant open  people are sometimes carelesseven you reddy said granny  reddy squirmed uneasily for he had been in trouble many times through carelessness well what of it he demanded a wee bit crossly  nothing much only if that henyard gate should happen to be left open and if farmer browns boy should happen to forget to close that little hole that the hens go through and if we happened to be around at just that time  too many ifs to get a dinner with interrupted reddy  perhaps replied granny mildly but ive noticed that it is the one who has an eye open for all the little ifs in life that fares the best now ive kept an eye on that henyard and ive noticed that very often farmer browns boy doesnt close the henyard gate at night i suppose he thinks that if the henhouse door is locked the gate doesnt matter any one who is careless about one thing is likely to be careless about another sometime he may forget to close that hole i told you that we would try for one of those hens tomorrow morning but the more i think about it the more i think it will be wiser to visit that henhouse a few nights before we run the risk of trying to catch a hen in broad daylight in fact i am pretty sure i can make farmer browns boy forget to close that gate  how demanded reddy eagerly  granny grinned ill try it first and tell you afterwards said she i believe farmer browns boy closes the henhouse up just before jolly round red mr sun goes to bed behind the purple hills doesnt he  reddy nodded many times from a safe hidingplace he had hungrily watched farmer browns boy shut the biddies up it was always just before the black shadows began to creep out from their hidingplaces  i thought so said granny the truth is she knew so there was nothing about that henhouse and what went on there that granny didnt know quite as well as reddy you stay right here this afternoon until i return ill see what i can do  let me go along begged reddy  no replied granny in such a decided tone that reddy knew it would be of no use to tease sometimes two can do what one cannot do alone and sometimes one can do what two might spoil now we may as well take a nap until it is time for mr sun to go to bed just you leave it to your old granny to take care of the first of those ifs for the other one well have to trust to luck but you know we are lucky sometimes  with this granny curled up for a nap and having nothing better to do reddy followed her example    chapter xxiii farmer browns boy forgets to close the gate     how easy t is to just forget    until alas it is too late    the most methodical of folks    sometimes forget to shut the gate      old granny fox  farmer browns boy is not usually the forgetful kind he is pretty good about not forgetting but farmer browns boy isnt perfect by any means he does forget sometimes and he is careless sometimes he would be a funny kind of boy otherwise but take it day in and day out he is pretty thoughtful and careful  the care of the hens is one of farmer browns boys duties it is one of those duties which most of the time is a pleasure he likes the biddies and he likes to take care of them every morning one of the first things he does is to feed them and open the henhouse so that they can run in the henyard if they want to every night he goes out just before dark collects the eggs and locks the henhouse so that no harm can come to the biddies while they are asleep on their roosts after the big snowstorm he had shovelled a place in the henyard where the hens could come out and exercise and get a sunbath when they wanted to and in the very warmest part of the clay they would do this always in the daytime he took the greatest care to see that the henyard gate was fastened for no one knew better than he how bold granny and reddy fox can be when they are very hungry and in winter they are very apt to be very hungry most of the time so he didnt intend to give them a chance to slip into that henyard while the biddies were out or to give the biddies a chance to stray outside where they might be still more easily caught  but at night he sometimes left that gate open as granny fox had found out you see he thought it didnt matter because the hens were locked in their warm house and so were safe anyway  it was just at dusk of the afternoon of the day when granny and reddy fox had talked over a plan to get one of those fat hens that farmer browns boy collected the eggs and saw to it that the biddies had gone to roost for the night he had just started to close the little sliding door across the hole through which the hens went in and out in the daytime when bowser the hound began to make a great racket as if terribly excited about something  farmer browns boy gave the little sliding door a hasty push picked up his basket of eggs locked the henhouse door and hurried out through the gate without stopping to close it you see he was in a hurry to find out what bowser was making such a fuss about bowser was yelping and whining and tugging at his chain and it was plain to see that he was terribly eager to be set free  what is it bowser old boy did you see something asked farmer browns boy as he patted bowser on the head i cant let you go you know because you probably would go off hunting all night and come home in the morning all tired out and with sore feet whatever it was i guess youve scared it out of a years growth old fellow so well let it go at that  bowser still tugged at his chain and whined but after a little he quieted down his master looked around behind the barn to see if he could see what had so stirred up bowser but nothing was to be seen and he returned patted bowser once more and went into the house never once giving that open henyard gate another thought  half an hour later old granny fox joined reddy fox who was waiting on the doorstep of their home it is all right reddy that gate is open said she  how did you do it granny asked reddy eagerly  easily enough replied granny i let bowser get a glimpse of me just as his master was locking up the henhouse bowser made a great fuss and of course farmer browns boy hurried out to see what it was all about he was in too much of a hurry to close that gate and afterwards he forgot all about it or else he thought it didnt matter of course i didnt let him get so much as a glimpse of me  of course said reddy    chapter xxiv a midnight visit     by those who win t is well agreed    hell try and try who would succeed      old granny fox  it seemed to reddy fox as if time never had dragged so slowly as it did this particular night while he and granny fox waited until granny thought it safe to visit farmer browns henhouse and see if by any chance there was a way of getting into it reddy tried not to hope too much granny had found a way to get the gate to the henyard left open but this would do them no good unless there was some way of getting into the house and this he very much doubted but if there was a way he wanted to know it and he was impatient to start  but granny was in no hurry not that she wasnt just as hungry for a fat hen as was reddy but she was too wise and clever and altogether too sly to run any risks  there is nothing gained by being in too much of a hurry reddy said she and often a great deal is lost in that way a fat hen will taste just as good a little later as it would now and it will be foolish to go up to farmer browns until we are sure that everybody up there is asleep but to ease your mind ill tell you what we will do well go where we can see farmer browns house and watch until the last light winks out  so they trotted to a point where they could see farmer browns house and there they sat down to watch it seemed to reddy that those lights never would wink out but at last they did  come on granny he cried jumping to his feet  not yet reddy not yet replied granny weve got to give folks time to get sound asleep if we should get into that henhouse those hens might make a racket and if anything like that is going to happen we want to be sure that farmer brown and farmer browns boy are asleep  this was sound advice and reddy knew it so with a groan he once more threw himself down on the snow to wait at last granny arose stretched and looked up at the twinkling stars come on said she and led the way  up back of the barn and around it they stole like two shadows and quite as noiselessly as shadows they heard bowser the hound sighing in his sleep in his snug little house and grinned at each other silently they stole over to the henyard the gate was open just as granny had told reddy it would be across the henyard they trotted swiftly straight to where more than once in the daytime they had seen the hens come out of the house through a little hole it was closed reddy had expected it would be still he was dreadfully disappointed he gave it merely a glance  i knew it wouldnt be any use said he with a half whine  but granny paid no attention to him she went close to the hole and pushed gently against the little door that closed it it didnt move then she noticed that at one edge there was a tiny crack she tried to push her nose through but the crack was too narrow then she tried a paw a claw caught on the edge of the door and it moved ever so little then granny knew that the little door wasnt fastened granny stretched herself flat on the ground and went to work first with one paw then with the other by and by she caught her claws in it just right again and it moved a wee bit more no most certainly that door wasnt fastened and that crack was a little wider  what are you wasting your time there for demanded reddy crossly wed better be off hunting if we would have anything to eat this night  granny said nothing but kept on working she had discovered that this was a sliding door presently the crack was wide enough for her to get her nose in then she pushed and twisted her head this way and that the little door slowly slid back and when reddy turned to speak to her again for he had had his back to her she was nowhere to be seen reddy just gaped and gaped foolishly there was no granny fox but there was a black hole where she had been working and from it came the most delicious smellthe smell of fat hens it seemed to reddy that his stomach fairly flopped over with longing he rubbed his eyes to be sure that he was awake then in a twinkling he was inside that hole himself  shhh be still whispered old granny fox    chapter xxv a dinner for two     dark deeds are done in the stilly night    and who shall say if theyre wrong or right      old granny fox  it all depends on how you look at things of course granny and reddy fox had no business to be in farmer browns henhouse in the middle of the night or at any other time for that matter that is they had no business to be there as farmer brown would look at the matter he would have called them two red thieves perhaps that is just what they were but looking at the matter as they did i am not so sure about it to granny and reddy fox those hens were simply big rather stupid birds splendid eating if they could be caught and bound to be eaten by somebody the fact that they were in farmer browns henhouse didnt make them his any more than the fact that mrs grouse was in a part of the green forest owned by farmer brown made her his  you see among the little meadow and forest people there is no such thing as property rights excepting in the matter of storehouses and because these hens were alive it didnt occur to granny and reddy that the henhouse was a sort of storehouse it would have made no difference if it had among the little people it is considered quite right to help yourself from anothers storehouse if you are smart enough to find it and really need the food  besides reddy and granny knew that fanner brown and his boy would eat some of those hens themselves and they didnt begin to need them as reddy and granny did so as they looked at the matter there was nothing wrong in being in that henhouse in the middle of the night they were there simply because they needed food very very much and food was there  they stared up at the roosts where the biddies were huddled together fast asleep they were too high up to be reached from the floor even when reddy and granny stood on their hind legs and stretched as far as they could  weve got to wake them up and scare them so that some of the silly things will fly down where we can catch them said reddy licking his lips hungrily  that wont do at all snapped granny they would make a great racket and waken bowser the hound and he would waken his master and that is just what we mustnt do if we hope to ever get in here again i thought you had more sense reddy  reddy looked a little shamefaced well if we dont do that how are we going to get them we cant fly he grumbled  you stay right here where you are snapped granny and take care that you dont make a sound  then granny jumped lightly to a little shelf that ran along in front of the nesting boxes from this she could reach the lower roost on which four fat hens were asleep very gently she pushed her head in between two of these and crowded them apart sleepily they protested and moved along a little granny continued to crowd them at last one of them stretched out her head to see who was crowding so like a flash granny seized that head and biddy never knew what had wakened her nor did she have a chance to waken the others  dropping this hen at reddys feet granny crowded another until she did the same thing and just the same thing happened once more then granny jumped lightly down picked up one of the hens by the neck slung the body over her shoulder and told reddy to do the same with the other and start for home  arent you going to get any more while we have the chance grumbled reddy  enough is enough retorted granny weve got a dinner for two and so far no one is any the wiser perhaps these two wont be missed and well have a chance to get some more another night now come on  this was plain common sense and reddy knew it so without another word he followed old granny fox out by the way they had entered and then home to the best dinner he had had for a long long time    chapter xxvi farmer browns boy sets a trap     the trouble is that troubles are    more frequently than not    brought on by naught but carelessness    by some one who forgot      old granny fox  granny fox had hoped that those two hens she and reddy had stolen from farmer browns henhouse would not be missed but they were they were missed the very first thing the next morning when farmer browns boy went to feed the biddies he discovered right away that the little sliding door which should have closed the opening through which the hens went in and out of the house was open and then he remembered that he had left the henyard gate open the night before carefully farmer browns boy examined the hole with the sliding door  ha said he presently and held up two red hairs which he had found on the edge of the door ha i thought as much i was careless last night and didnt fasten this door and i left the gate open reddy fox has been here and now i know what has become of those two hens i suppose it serves me right for my carelessness and i suppose if the truth were known those hens were of more real good to him than they ever could have been to me because the poor fellow must be having pretty hard work to get a living these hard winter days still i cant have him stealing any more that would never do at all if i shut them up every night and am not careless he cant get them but accidents will happen and i might do just as i did last nightthink i had locked up when i hadnt i dont like to set a trap for reddy but i must teach the rascal a lesson if i dont he will get so bold that those chickens wont be safe even in broad daylight  now at just that very time over in their home granny and reddy fox were talking over plans for the future and shrewd old granny was pointing out to reddy how necessary it was that they should keep away from that henyard for some time weve had a good dinner a splendid dinner and if we are smart enough we may be able to get more good dinners where this one came from said she but we certainly wont if we are too greedy  but i dont believe farmer browns boy has missed those two chickens and i dont see any reason at all why we shouldnt go back there tonight and get two more if he is stupid enough to leave that gate and little door open whined reddy  maybe he hasnt missed those two but if we should take two more he certainly would miss them and he would guess what had become of them and that might get us into no end of trouble snapped granny we are not starving now and the best thing for us to do is to keep away from that henhouse until we cant get anything to eat anywhere else now you mind what i tell you reddy and dont you dare go near there  reddy promised and so it came about that farmer browns boy hunted up a trap all for nothing so far as reddy and granny were concerned very carefully he bound strips of cloth around the jaws of the trap for he couldnt bear to think of those cruel jaws cutting into the leg of reddy should he happen to get caught you see farmer browns boy didnt intend to kill reddy if he should catch him but to make him a prisoner for a while and so keep him out of mischief that night he hid the trap very cunningly just inside the henhouse where any one creeping through that little hole made for the hens to go in and out would be sure to step in it then he purposely left the little sliding door open part way as if it had been forgotten and he also left the henyard gate open just as he had done the night before  there now master reddy said he talking to himself i rather think that you are going to get into trouble before morning  and doubtless reddy would have done just that thing but for the wisdom of sly old granny    chapter xxvii prickly porky takes a sun bath     danger comes when least expected    t is often near when not expected      old granny fox  the long hard winter had passed and spring had come prickly porky the porcupine came down from a tall poplartree and slowly stretched himself he was tired of eating he was tired of swinging in the treetop  i believe ill have a sunbath said prickly porky and lazily walked toward the edge of the green forest in search of a place where the sun lay warm and bright  now prickly porkys stomach was very very full he was fat and naturally lazy so when he came to the doorstep of an old house just on the edge of the green forest he sat down to rest it was sunny and warm there and the longer he sat the less like moving he felt he looked about him with his dull eyes and grunted to himself  its a deserted house nobody lives here and i guess nobodyll care if i take a nap right here on the doorstep said prickly porky to himself and i dont care if they do he added for prickly porky the porcupine was afraid of nobody and nothing  so prickly porky made himself as comfortable as possible yawned once or twice tried to wink at jolly round red mr sun who was winking and smiling down at him and then fell fast asleep right on the doorstep of the old house  now the old house had been deserted no one had lived in it for a long long time a very long time indeed but it happened that the night before old granny fox and reddy fox had had to move out of their nice home on the edge of the green meadows because farmer browns boy had found it reddy was very stiff and sore for he had been shot by a hunter he was so sore he could hardly walk and could not go very far so old granny fox had led him to the old deserted house and put him to bed in that  no one will think of looking for us here for every one knows that no one lives here said old granny fox as she made reddy as comfortable as possible  as soon as it was daylight granny fox slipped out to watch for farmer browns boy for she felt sure that he would come back to the house they had left and sure enough he did he brought a spade and dug the house open and all the time old granny fox was watching him from behind a fence corner and laughing to think that she had been smart enough to move in the night  but reddy fox didnt know anything about this he was so tired that he slept and slept and slept it was the middle of the morning when finally he awoke he yawned and stretched and when he stretched he groaned because he was so stiff and sore then he hobbled up toward the doorway to see if old granny fox had left any breakfast outside for him  it was dark very dark reddy was puzzled could it be that he had gotten up before daylightthat he hadnt slept as long as he thought perhaps he had slept the whole day through and it was night again my how hungry he was  i hope granny has caught a fine fat chicken for me thought reddy and his mouth watered  just then he ran bump into something wow screamed reddy fox and clapped both hands to his nose something was sticking into it it was one of the sharp little spears that prickly porky hides in his coat reddy fox knew then why the old house was so dark prickly porky was blocking up the doorway    chapter xxviii prickly porky enjoys himself     a boasting tongue as sure as fate    will trip its owner soon or late      old granny fox  prickly porky the porcupine was enjoying himself there was no doubt about that he was stretched across the doorway of that old house the very house in which old granny fox had been born when he had lain down on the doorstep for a nap and sunbath he had thought that the old house was still deserted then he had fallen asleep only to be wakened by reddy fox who bad been asleep in the old house and who couldnt get out because prickly porky was in the way  now prickly porky does not love reddy fox and the more reddy begged and scolded and called him names the more prickly porky chuckled it was such a good joke to think that he had trapped reddy fox and he made up his mind that he would keep reddy in there a long time just to tease him and make him uncomfortable you see prickly porky remembered how often reddy fox played mean tricks on little meadow and forest folks who are smaller and weaker than himself  it will do him good it certainly will do him good said prickly porky and rattled the thousand little spears hidden in his long coat for he knew that the very sound of them would make reddy fox shiver with fright  suddenly prickly porky pricked up his funny little short ears he heard the deep voice of bowser the hound and it was coming nearer and nearer prickly porky chuckled again  i guess mr bowser is going to have a surprise i certainly think he is said prickly porky as he made all the thousand little spears stand out from his long coat till he looked like a funny great chestnut burr  bowser the hound did have a surprise he was hunting reddy fox and he almost ran into prickly porky before he saw him the very sight of those thousand little spears sent little cold chills chasing each other down bowsers backbone clear to the tip of his tail for he remembered how he had gotten some of them in his lips and mouth once upon a time and how it had hurt to have them pulled out ever since then he had had the greatest respect for prickly porky  wow yelped bowser the hound stopping short i beg your pardon prickly porky i beg your pardon i didnt know you were taking a nap here  all the time bowser the hound was backing away as fast as he could then he turned around put his tail between his legs and actually ran away  slowly prickly porky unrolled and his little eyes twinkled as he watched bowser the hound run away   bowsers very big and strong    his voice is deep his legs are long   his bark scares some almost to death    but as for me he wastes his breath   i just roll up and shake my spears    and bowser is the one who fears  so said prickly porky and laughed aloud just then he heard a light footstep and turned to see who was coming it was old granny fox she had seen bowser run away and now she was anxious to find out if reddy fox were safe  good morning said granny fox taking care not to come too near  good morning replied prickly porky hiding a smile  im very tired and would like to go inside my house had you just as soon move asked granny fox  oh exclaimed prickly porky is this your house i thought you lived over on the green meadows  i did but ive moved please let me in replied granny fox  certainly certainly dont mind me granny fox step right over me said prickly porky and smiled once more and at the same time rattled his little spears  instead of stepping over him granny fox backed away    chapter xxix the new home in the old pasture     who keeps a watch upon his toes    need never fear hell bump his nose      old granny fox  now there is nothing like being shut in alone in the dark to make one think a voice inside of reddy began to whisper to him if you hadnt tried to be smart and show off you wouldnt have brought all this trouble on yourself and old granny fox said the voice  i know it replied reddy right out loud forgetting that it was only a small voice inside of him  what do you know asked prickly porky he was still keeping reddy in and granny out and he had overheard what reddy said  it is none of your business snapped reddy  reddy could hear prickly porky chuckle then prickly porky repeated as if to himself in a queer cracked voice the following   rudeness never never pays   nor is there gain in saucy ways   its always best to be polite   and neer give way to ugly spite   if thats the way you feel inside   youd better all such feelings hide   for he must smile who hopes to win   and he who loses best will grin  reddy pretended that he hadnt heard prickly porky continued to chuckle for a while and finally reddy fell asleep when he awoke it was to find that prickly porky had left and old granny fox had brought him something to eat  just as soon as reddy fox was able to travel he and granny had moved to the old pasture the old pasture is very different from the green meadows or the green forest yes indeed it is very very different reddy fox thought so and reddy didnt like the changenot a bit all about were great rocks and around and over them grew bushes and young trees and bullbriars with long ugly thorns and blackberry and raspberry canes that seemed to have a million little hooked hands reaching to catch in and tear his red coat and to scratch his face and hands there were little open places where wildeyed young cattle fed on the short grass they had made many little paths all crisscross among the bushes and when you tried to follow one of these paths you never could tell where you were coming out  no reddy fox did not like the old pasture at all there was no long soft green grass to lie down in and it was lonesome up there he missed the little people of the green meadows and the green forest there was no one to bully and tease and it was such a long long way from farmer browns henyard that old granny fox wouldnt even try to bring him a fat hen at least thats what she told reddy  the truth is wise old granny fox knew that the very best thing she could do was to stay away from farmer browns for a long time she knew that reddy couldnt go down there because he was still too lame and sore to travel such a long way and she hoped that by the time reddy was well enough to go he would have learned better than to do such a foolish thing as to try to show off by stealing a chicken in broad daylight as he had when he brought all this trouble on them  down on the green meadows the home of granny and reddy fox had been on a little knoll which you know is a little low hill right where they could sit on their doorstep and look all over the green meadows it had been very very beautiful down there they had made lovely little paths through the tall green meadow grass and the buttercups and daisies had grown close up to their very doorstep but up here in the old pasture granny fox had chosen the thickest clump of bushes and young trees she could find and in the middle was a great pile of rocks way in among these rocks granny fox had dug their new house it was right down under the rocks even in the middle of the day jolly round red mr sun could hardly find it with a few of his long bright beams all the rest of the time it was dark and gloomy there  no reddy fox didnt like his new home at all but when he said so old granny fox boxed his ears  its your own fault that weve got to live here now said she its the only place where we are safe farmer browns boy never will find this home and even if he did he couldnt dig into it as he did into our old home on the green meadows here we are and here weve got to stay all because a foolish little fox thought himself smarter than anybody else and tried to show off  reddy hung his head i dont care he said which was very very foolish because you know he did care a very great deal  and here we will leave wise old granny fox and reddy safe even if they do not like their new home you see lightfoot the deer is getting jealous he thinks there should be some books about the people of the green forest and that the first one should be about him and because we all love lightfoot the deer the very next book is to bear his name
