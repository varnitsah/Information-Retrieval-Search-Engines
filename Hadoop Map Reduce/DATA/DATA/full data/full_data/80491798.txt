80491798	some reminiscences  by joseph conrad     a familiar preface  as a general rule we do not want much encouragement to talk about ourselves yet this little book is the result of a friendly suggestion and even of a little friendly pressure i defended myself with some spirit but with characteristic tenacity the friendly voice insisted you know you really must  it was not an argument but i submitted at once if one must     you perceive the force of a word he who wants to persuade should put his trust not in the right argument but in the right word the power of sound has always been greater than the power of sense i dont say this by way of disparagement it is better for mankind to be impressionable than reflective nothing humanely greatgreat i mean as affecting a whole mass of liveshas come from reflection on the other hand you cannot fail to see the power of mere words such words as glory for instance or pity i wont mention any more they are not far to seek shouted with perseverance with ardour with conviction these two by their sound alone have set whole nations in motion and upheaved the dry hard ground on which rests our whole social fabric theres virtue for you if you like    of course the accent must be attended to the right accent thats very important the capacious lung the thundering or the tender vocal chords dont talk to me of your archimedes lever he was an absentminded person with a mathematical imagination mathematics command all my respect but i have no use for engines give me the right word and the right accent and i will move the world  what a dreamfor a writer because written words have their accent too yes let me only find the right word surely it must be lying somewhere amongst the wreckage of all the plaints and all the exultations poured out aloud since the first day when hope the undying came down on earth it may be there close by disregarded invisible quite at hand but its no good i believe there are men who can lay hold of a needle in a pottle of hay at the first try for myself i have never had such luck  and then there is that accent another difficulty for who is going to tell whether the accent is right or wrong till the word is shouted and fails to be heard perhaps and goes downwind leaving the world unmoved once upon a time there lived an emperor who was a sage and something of a literary man he jotted down on ivory tablets thoughts maxims reflections which chance has preserved for the edification of posterity amongst other sayingsi am quoting from memoryi remember this solemn admonition let all thy words have the accent of heroic truth the accent of heroic truth this is very fine but i am thinking that it is an easy matter for an austere emperor to jot down grandiose advice most of the working truths on this earth are humble not heroic and there have been times in the history of mankind when the accents of heroic truth have moved it to nothing but derision  nobody will expect to find between the covers of this little book words of extraordinary potency or accents of irresistible heroism however humiliating for my selfesteem i must confess that the counsels of marcus aurelius are not for me they are more fit for a moralist than for an artist truth of a modest sort i can promise you and also sincerity that complete praiseworthy sincerity which while it delivers one into the hands of ones enemies is as likely as not to embroil one with ones friends  embroil is perhaps too strong an expression i cant imagine either amongst my enemies or my friends a being so hard up for something to do as to quarrel with me to disappoint ones friends would be nearer the mark most almost all friendships of the writing period of my life have come to me through my books and i know that a novelist lives in his work he stands there the only reality in an invented world amongst imaginary things happenings and people writing about them he is only writing about himself but the disclosure is not complete he remains to a certain extent a figure behind the veil a suspected rather than a seen presencea movement and a voice behind the draperies of fiction in these personal notes there is no such veil and i cannot help thinking of a passage in the imitation of christ where the ascetic author who knew life so profoundly says that there are persons esteemed on their reputation who by showing themselves destroy the opinion one had of them this is the danger incurred by an author of fiction who sets out to talk about himself without disguise  while these reminiscent pages were appearing serially i was remonstrated with for bad economy as if such writing were a form of selfindulgence wasting the substance of future volumes it seems that i am not sufficiently literary indeed a man who never wrote a line for print till he was thirtysix cannot bring himself to look upon his existence and his experience upon the sum of his thoughts sensations and emotions upon his memories and his regrets and the whole possession of his past as only so much material for his hands once before some three years ago when i published the mirror of the sea a volume of impressions and memories the same remarks were made to me practical remarks but truth to say i have never understood the kind of thrift they recommended i wanted to pay my tribute to the sea its ships and its men to whom i remain indebted for so much which has gone to make me what i am that seemed to me the only shape in which i could offer it to their shades there could not be a question in my mind of anything else it is quite possible that i am a bad economist but it is certain that i am incorrigible  having matured in the surroundings and under the special conditions of sealife i have a special piety towards that form of my past for its impressions were vivid its appeal direct its demands such as could be responded to with the natural elation of youth and strength equal to the call there was nothing in them to perplex a young conscience having broken away from my origins under a storm of blame from every quarter which had the merest shadow of right to voice an opinion removed by great distances from such natural affections as were still left to me and even estranged in a measure from them by the totally unintelligible character of the life which had seduced me so mysteriously from my allegiance i may safely say that through the blind force of circumstances the sea was to be all my world and the merchant service my only home for a long succession of years no wonder then that in my two exclusively sea books the nigger of the narcissus and the mirror of the sea and in the few short sea stories like youth and typhoon i have tried with an almost filial regard to render the vibration of life in the great world of waters in the hearts of the simple men who have for ages traversed its solitudes and also that something sentient which seems to dwell in shipsthe creatures of their hands and the objects of their care  ones literary life must turn frequently for sustenance to memories and seek discourse with the shades unless one has made up ones mind to write only in order to reprove mankind for what it is or praise it for what it is not orgenerallyto teach it how to behave being neither quarrelsome nor a flatterer nor a sage i have done none of these things and i am prepared to put up serenely with the insignificance which attaches to persons who are not meddlesome in some way or other but resignation is not indifference i would not like to be left standing as a mere spectator on the bank of the great stream carrying onwards so many lives i would fain claim for myself the faculty of so much insight as can be expressed in a voice of sympathy and compassion  it seems to me that in one at least authoritative quarter of criticism i am suspected of a certain unemotional grim acceptance of facts of what the french would call secheresse du coeur fifteen years of unbroken silence before praise or blame testify sufficiently to my respect for criticism that fine flower of personal expression in the garden of letters but this is more of a personal matter reaching the man behind the work and therefore it may be alluded to in a volume which is a personal note in the margin of the public page not that i feel hurt in the least the chargeif it amounted to a charge at allwas made in the most considerate terms in a tone of regret  my answer is that if it be true that every novel contains an element of autobiographyand this can hardly be denied since the creator can only express himself in his creationthen there are some of us to whom an open display of sentiment is repugnant i would not unduly praise the virtue of restraint it is often merely temperamental but it is not always a sign of coldness it may be pride there can be nothing more humiliating than to see the shaft of ones emotion miss the mark either of laughter or tears nothing more humiliating and this for the reason that should the mark be missed should the open display of emotion fail to move then it must perish unavoidably in disgust or contempt no artist can be reproached for shrinking from a risk which only fools run to meet and only genius dare confront with impunity in a task which mainly consists in laying ones soul more or less bare to the world a regard for decency even at the cost of success is but the regard for ones own dignity which is inseparably united with the dignity of ones work  and thenit is very difficult to be wholly joyous or wholly sad on this earth the comic when it is human soon takes upon itself a face of pain and some of our griefs some only not all for it is the capacity for suffering which makes man august in the eyes of men have their source in weaknesses which must be recognised with smiling compassion as the common inheritance of us all joy and sorrow in this world pass into each other mingling their forms and their murmurs in the twilight of life as mysterious as an overshadowed ocean while the dazzling brightness of supreme hopes lies far off fascinating and still on the distant edge of the horizon  yes i too would like to hold the magic wand giving that command over laughter and tears which is declared to be the highest achievement of imaginative literature only to be a great magician one must surrender oneself to occult and irresponsible powers either outside or within ones own breast we have all heard of simple men selling their souls for love or power to some grotesque devil the most ordinary intelligence can perceive without much reflection that anything of the sort is bound to be a fools bargain i dont lay claim to particular wisdom because of my dislike and distrust of such transactions it may be my seatraining acting upon a natural disposition to keep good hold on the one thing really mine but the fact is that i have a positive horror of losing even for one moving moment that full possession of myself which is the first condition of good service and i have carried my notion of good service from my earlier into my later existence i who have never sought in the written word anything else but a form of the beautiful i have carried over that article of creed from the decks of ships to the more circumscribed space of my desk and by that act i suppose i have become permanently imperfect in the eyes of the ineffable company of pure esthetes  as in political so in literary action a man wins friends for himself mostly by the passion of his prejudices and by the consistent narrowness of his outlook but i have never been able to love what was not lovable or hate what was not hateful out of deference for some general principle whether there be any courage in making this admission i know not after the middle turn of lifes way we consider dangers and joys with a tranquil mind so i proceed in peace to declare that i have always suspected in the effort to bring into play the extremities of emotions the debasing touch of insincerity in order to move others deeply we must deliberately allow ourselves to be carried away beyond the bounds of our normal sensibilityinnocently enough perhaps and of necessity like an actor who raises his voice on the stage above the pitch of natural conversationbut still we have to do that and surely this is no great sin but the danger lies in the writer becoming the victim of his own exaggeration losing the exact notion of sincerity and in the end coming to despise truth itself as something too cold too blunt for his purposeas in fact not good enough for his insistent emotion from laughter and tears the descent is easy to snivelling and giggles  these may seem selfish considerations but you cant in sound morals condemn a man for taking care of his own integrity it is his clear duty and least of all you can condemn an artist pursuing however humbly and imperfectly a creative aim in that interior world where his thought and his emotions go seeking for the experience of imagined adventures there are no policemen no law no pressure of circumstance or dread of opinion to keep him within bounds who then is going to say nay to his temptations if not his conscience  and besidesthis remember is the place and the moment of perfectly open talki think that all ambitions are lawful except those which climb upwards on the miseries or credulities of mankind all intellectual and artistic ambitions are permissible up to and even beyond the limit of prudent sanity they can hurt no one if they are mad then so much the worse for the artist indeed as virtue is said to be such ambitions are their own reward is it such a very mad presumption to believe in the sovereign power of ones art to try for other means for other ways of affirming this belief in the deeper appeal of ones work to try to go deeper is not to be insensible an historian of hearts is not an historian of emotions yet he penetrates further restrained as he may be since his aim is to reach the very fount of laughter and tears the sight of human affairs deserves admiration and pity they are worthy of respect too and he is not insensible who pays them the undemonstrative tribute of a sigh which is not a sob and of a smile which is not a grin resignation not mystic not detached but resignation openeyed conscious and informed by love is the only one of our feelings for which it is impossible to become a sham  not that i think resignation the last word of wisdom i am too much the creature of my time for that but i think that the proper wisdom is to will what the gods will without perhaps being certain what their will isor even if they have a will of their own and in this matter of life and art it is not the why that matters so much to our happiness as the how as the frenchman said il y a toujours la maniere very true yes there is the manner the manner in laughter in tears in irony in indignations and enthusiasms in judgmentsand even in love the manner in which as in the features and character of a human face the inner truth is foreshadowed for those who know how to look at their kind  those who read me know my conviction that the world the temporal world rests on a few very simple ideas so simple that they must be as old as the hills it rests notably amongst others on the idea of fidelity at a time when nothing which is not revolutionary in some way or other can expect to attract much attention i have not been revolutionary in my writings the revolutionary spirit is mighty convenient in this that it frees one from all scruples as regards ideas its hard absolute optimism is repulsive to my mind by the menace of fanaticism and intolerance it contains no doubt one should smile at these things but imperfect esthete i am no better philosopher all claim to special righteousness awakens in me that scorn and anger from which a philosophical mind should be free    i fear that trying to be conversational i have only managed to be unduly discursive i have never been very well acquainted with the art of conversationthat art which i understand is supposed to be lost now my young days the days when ones habits and character are formed have been rather familiar with long silences such voices as broke into them were anything but conversational no i havent got the habit yet this discursiveness is not so irrelevant to the handful of pages which follow they too have been charged with discursiveness with disregard of chronological order which is in itself a crime with unconventionality of form which is an impropriety i was told severely that the public would view with displeasure the informal character of my recollections alas i protested mildly could i begin with the sacramental words i was born on such a date in such a place the remoteness of the locality would have robbed the statement of all interest i havent lived through wonderful adventures to be related seriatim i havent known distinguished men on whom i could pass fatuous remarks i havent been mixed up with great or scandalous affairs this is but a bit of psychological document and even so i havent written it with a view to put forward any conclusion of my own  but my objector was not placated these were good reasons for not writing at allnot a defence of what stood written already he said  i admit that almost anything anything in the world would serve as a good reason for not writing at all but since i have written them all i want to say in their defence is that these memories put down without any regard for established conventions have not been thrown off without system and purpose they have their hope and their aim the hope that from the reading of these pages there may emerge at last the vision of a personality the man behind the books so fundamentally dissimilar as for instance almayers folly and the secret agentand yet a coherent justifiable personality both in its origin and in its action this is the hope the immediate aim closely associated with the hope is to give the record of personal memories by presenting faithfully the feelings and sensations connected with the writing of my first book and with my first contact with the sea  in the purposely mingled resonance of this double strain a friend here and there will perhaps detect a subtle accord  jck   chapter i  books may be written in all sorts of places verbal inspiration may enter the berth of a mariner on board a ship frozen fast in a river in the middle of a town and since saints are supposed to look benignantly on humble believers i indulge in the pleasant fancy that the shade of old flaubertwho imagined himself to be amongst other things a descendant of vikingsmight have hovered with amused interest over the decks of a 2000ton steamer called the adowa on board of which gripped by the inclement winter alongside a quay in rouen the tenth chapter of almayers folly was begun with interest i say for was not the kind norman giant with enormous moustaches and a thundering voice the last of the romantics was he not in his unworldly almost ascetic devotion to his art a sort of literary saintlike hermit  it has set at last said nina to her mother pointing to the hills behind which the sun had sunk    these words of almayers romantic daughter i remember tracing on the grey paper of a pad which rested on the blanket of my bedplace they referred to a sunset in malayan isles and shaped themselves in my mind in a hallucinated vision of forests and rivers and seas far removed from a commercial and yet romantic town of the northern hemisphere but at that moment the mood of visions and words was cut short by the third officer a cheerful and casual youth coming in with a bang of the door and the exclamation youve made it jolly warm in here  it was warm i had turned on the steamheater after placing a tin under the leaky watercockfor perhaps you do not know that water will leak where steam will not i am not aware of what my young friend had been doing on deck all that morning but the hands he rubbed together vigorously were very red and imparted to me a chilly feeling by their mere aspect he has remained the only banjoist of my acquaintance and being also a younger son of a retired colonel the poem of mr kipling by a strange aberration of associated ideas always seems to me to have been written with an exclusive view to his person when he did not play the banjo he loved to sit and look at it he proceeded to this sentimental inspection and after meditating a while over the strings under my silent scrutiny inquired airily  what are you always scribbling there if its fair to ask  it was a fair enough question but i did not answer him and simply turned the pad over with a movement of instinctive secrecy i could not have told him he had put to flight the psychology of nina almayer her opening speech of the tenth chapter and the words of mrs almayers wisdom which were to follow in the ominous oncoming of a tropical night i could not have told him that nina had said it has set at last he would have been extremely surprised and perhaps have dropped his precious banjo neither could i have told him that the sun of my seagoing was setting too even as i wrote the words expressing the impatience of passionate youth bent on its desire i did not know this myself and it is safe to say he would not have cared though he was an excellent young fellow and treated me with more deference than in our relative positions i was strictly entitled to  he lowered a tender gaze on his banjo and i went on looking through the porthole the round opening framed in its brass rim a fragment of the quays with a row of casks ranged on the frozen ground and the tailend of a great cart a rednosed carter in a blouse and a woollen nightcap leaned against the wheel an idle strolling customhouse guard belted over his blue capote had the air of being depressed by exposure to the weather and the monotony of official existence the background of grimy houses found a place in the picture framed by my porthole across a wide stretch of paved quay brown with frozen mud the colouring was sombre and the most conspicuous feature was a little cafe with curtained windows and a shabby front of white woodwork corresponding with the squalor of these poorer quarters bordering the river we had been shifted down there from another berth in the neighbourhood of the opera house where that same porthole gave me a view of quite another sort of cafethe best in the town i believe and the very one where the worthy bovary and his wife the romantic daughter of old pere renault had some refreshment after the memorable performance of an opera which was the tragic story of lucia di lammermoor in a setting of light music  i could recall no more the hallucination of the eastern archipelago which i certainly hoped to see again the story of almayers folly got put away under the pillow for that day i do not know that i had any occupation to keep me away from it the truth of the matter is that on board that ship we were leading just then a contemplative life i will not say anything of my privileged position i was there just to oblige as an actor of standing may take a small part in the benefit performance of a friend  as far as my feelings were concerned i did not wish to be in that steamer at that time and in those circumstances and perhaps i was not even wanted there in the usual sense in which a ship wants an officer it was the first and last instance in my sea life when i served shipowners who have remained completely shadowy to my apprehension i do not mean this for the wellknown firm of london shipbrokers which had chartered the ship to the i will not say shortlived but ephemeral francocanadian transport company a death leaves something behind but there was never anything tangible left from the fctc it flourished no longer than roses live and unlike the roses it blossomed in the dead of winter emitted a sort of faint perfume of adventure and died before spring set in but indubitably it was a company it had even a houseflag all white with the letters fctc artfully tangled up in a complicated monogram we flew it at our mainmast head and now i have come to the conclusion that it was the only flag of its kind in existence all the same we on board for many days had the impression of being a unit of a large fleet with fortnightly departures for montreal and quebec as advertised in pamphlets and prospectuses which came aboard in a large package in victoria dock london just before we started for rouen france and in the shadowy life of the fctc lies the secret of that my last employment in my calling which in a remote sense interrupted the rhythmical development of nina almayers story  the then secretary of the london shipmasters society with its modest rooms in fenchurch street was a man of indefatigable activity and the greatest devotion to his task he is responsible for what was my last association with a ship i call it that because it can hardly be called a seagoing experience dear captain froudit is impossible not to pay him the tribute of affectionate familiarity at this distance of yearshad very sound views as to the advancement of knowledge and status for the whole body of the officers of the mercantile marine he organised for us courses of professional lectures st john ambulance classes corresponded industriously with public bodies and members of parliament on subjects touching the interests of the service and as to the oncoming of some inquiry or commission relating to matters of the sea and to the work of seamen it was a perfect godsend to his need of exerting himself on our corporate behalf together with this high sense of his official duties he had in him a vein of personal kindness a strong disposition to do what good he could to the individual members of that craft of which in his time he had been a very excellent master and what greater kindness can one do to a seaman than to put him in the way of employment captain froud did not see why the shipmasters society besides its general guardianship of our interests should not be unofficially an employment agency of the very highest class  i am trying to persuade all our great shipowning firms to come to us for their men there is nothing of a tradeunion spirit about our society and i really dont see why they should not he said once to me i am always telling the captains too that all things being equal they ought to give preference to the members of the society in my position i can generally find for them what they want amongst our members or our associate members  in my wanderings about london from west to east and back again i was very idle then the two little rooms in fenchurch street were a sort of restingplace where my spirit hankering after the sea could feel itself nearer to the ships the men and the life of its choicenearer there than on any other spot of the solid earth this restingplace used to be at about five oclock in the afternoon full of men and tobacco smoke but captain froud had the smaller room to himself and there he granted private interviews whose principal motive was to render service thus one murky november afternoon he beckoned me in with a crooked finger and that peculiar glance above his spectacles which is perhaps my strongest physical recollection of the man  i have had in here a shipmaster this morning he said getting back to his desk and motioning me to a chair who is in want of an officer its for a steamship you know nothing pleases me more than to be asked but unfortunately i do not quite see my way    as the outer room was full of men i cast a wondering glance at the closed door but he shook his head  oh yes i should be only too glad to get that berth for one of them but the fact of the matter is the captain of that ship wants an officer who can speak french fluently and thats not so easy to find i do not know anybody myself but you its a second officers berth and of course you would not care    would you now i know that it isnt what you are looking for  it was not i had given myself up to the idleness of a haunted man who looks for nothing but words wherein to capture his visions but i admit that outwardly i resembled sufficiently a man who could make a second officer for a steamer chartered by a french company i showed no sign of being haunted by the fate of nina and by the murmurs of tropical forests and even my intimate intercourse with almayer a person of weak character had not put a visible mark upon my features for many years he and the world of his story had been the companions of my imagination without i hope impairing my ability to deal with the realities of sea life i had had the man and his surroundings with me ever since my return from the eastern waters some four years before the day of which i speak  it was in the front sittingroom of furnished apartments in a pimlico square that they first began to live again with a vividness and poignancy quite foreign to our former real intercourse i had been treating myself to a long stay on shore and in the necessity of occupying my mornings almayer that old acquaintance came nobly to the rescue before long as was only proper his wife and daughter joined him round my table and then the rest of that pantai band came full of words and gestures unknown to my respectable landlady it was my practice directly after my breakfast to hold animated receptions of malays arabs and halfcastes they did not clamour aloud for my attention they came with a silent and irresistible appealand the appeal i affirm here was not to my selflove or my vanity it seems now to have had a moral character for why should the memory of these beings seen in their obscure sunbathed existence demand to express itself in the shape of a novel except on the ground of that mysterious fellowship which unites in a community of hopes and fears all the dwellers on this earth  i did not receive my visitors with boisterous rapture as the bearers of any gifts of profit or fame there was no vision of a printed book before me as i sat writing at that table situated in a decayed part of belgravia after all these years each leaving its evidence of slowly blackened pages i can honestly say that it is a sentiment akin to piety which prompted me to render in words assembled with conscientious care the memory of things far distant and of men who had lived  but coming back to captain froud and his fixed idea of never disappointing shipowners or shipcaptains it was not likely that i should fail him in his ambitionto satisfy at a few hours notice the unusual demand for a frenchspeaking officer he explained to me that the ship was chartered by a french company intending to establish a regular monthly line of sailings from rouen for the transport of french emigrants to canada but frankly this sort of thing did not interest me very much i said gravely that if it were really a matter of keeping up the reputation of the shipmasters society i would consider it but the consideration was just for forms sake the next day i interviewed the captain and i believe we were impressed favourably with each other he explained that his chief mate was an excellent man in every respect and that he could not think of dismissing him so as to give me the higher position but that if i consented to come as second officer i would be given certain special advantagesand so on  i told him that if i came at all the rank really did not matter  i am sure he insisted you will get on first rate with mr paramor  i promised faithfully to stay for two trips at least and it was in those circumstances that what was to be my last connection with a ship began and after all there was not even one single trip it may be that it was simply the fulfilment of a fate of that written word on my forehead which apparently forbade me through all my sea wanderings ever to achieve the crossing of the western oceanusing the words in that special sense in which sailors speak of western ocean trade of western ocean packets of western ocean hard cases the new life attended closely upon the old and the nine chapters of almayers folly went with me to the victoria dock whence in a few days we started for rouen i wont go so far as saying that the engaging of a man fated never to cross the western ocean was the absolute cause of the francocanadian transport companys failure to achieve even a single passage it might have been that of course but the obvious gross obstacle was clearly the want of money four hundred and sixty bunks for emigrants were put together in the tween decks by industrious carpenters while we lay in the victoria dock but never an emigrant turned up in rouenof which being a humane person i confess i was glad some gentlemen from parisi think there were three of them and one was said to be the chairmanturned up indeed and went from end to end of the ship knocking their silk hats cruelly against the deckbeams i attended them personally and i can vouch for it that the interest they took in things was intelligent enough though obviously they had never seen anything of the sort before their faces as they went ashore wore a cheerfully inconclusive expression notwithstanding that this inspecting ceremony was supposed to be a preliminary to immediate sailing it was then as they filed down our gangway that i received the inward monition that no sailing within the meaning of our charterparty would ever take place  it must be said that in less than three weeks a move took place when we first arrived we had been taken up with much ceremony well towards the centre of the town and all the street corners being placarded with the tricolour posters announcing the birth of our company the petit bourgeois with his wife and family made a sunday holiday from the inspection of the ship i was always in evidence in my best uniform to give information as though i had been a cooks tourists interpreter while our quartermasters reaped a harvest of small change from personally conducted parties but when the move was madethat move which carried us some mile and a half down the stream to be tied up to an altogether muddier and shabbier quaythen indeed the desolation of solitude became our lot it was a complete and soundless stagnation for as we had the ship ready for sea to the smallest detail as the frost was hard and the days short we were absolutely idleidle to the point of blushing with shame when the thought struck us that all the time our salaries went on young cole was aggrieved because as he said we could not enjoy any sort of fun in the evening after loafing like this all day even the banjo lost its charm since there was nothing to prevent his strumming on it all the time between the meals the good paramorhe was really a most excellent fellowbecame unhappy as far as was possible to his cheery nature till one dreary day i suggested out of sheer mischief that he should employ the dormant energies of the crew in hauling both cables up on deck and turning them end for end  for a moment mr paramor was radiant excellent idea but directly his face fell why    yes but we cant make that job last more than three days he muttered discontentedly i dont know how long he expected us to be stuck on the riverside outskirts of rouen but i know that the cables got hauled up and turned end for end according to my satanic suggestion put down again and their very existence utterly forgotten i believe before a french river pilot came on board to take our ship down empty as she came into the havre roads you may think that this state of forced idleness favoured some advance in the fortunes of almayer and his daughter yet it was not so as if it were some sort of evil spell my banjoist cabinmates interruption as related above had arrested them short at the point of that fateful sunset for many weeks together it was always thus with this book begun in 89 and finished in 94with that shortest of all the novels which it was to be my lot to write between its opening exclamation calling almayer to his dinner in his wifes voice and abdullahs his enemy mental reference to the god of islamthe merciful the compassionatewhich closes the book there were to come several long sea passages a visit to use the elevated phraseology suitable to the occasion to the scenes some of them of my childhood and the realisation of childhoods vain words expressing a lighthearted and romantic whim  it was in 1868 when nine years old or thereabouts that while looking at a map of africa of the time and putting my finger on the blank space then representing the unsolved mystery of that continent i said to myself with absolute assurance and an amazing audacity which are no longer in my character now  when i grow up i shall go there  and of course i thought no more about it till after a quarter of a century or so an opportunity offered to go thereas if the sin of childish audacity were to be visited on my mature head yes i did go there there being the region of stanley falls which in 68 was the blankest of blank spaces on the earths figured surface and the ms of almayers folly carried about me as if it were a talisman or a treasure went there too that it ever came out of there seems a special dispensation of providence because a good many of my other properties infinitely more valuable and useful to me remained behind through unfortunate accidents of transportation i call to mind for instance a specially awkward turn of the congo between kinchassa and leopoldsvillemore particularly when one had to take it at night in a big canoe with only half the proper number of paddlers i failed in being the second white man on record drowned at that interesting spot through the upsetting of a canoe the first was a young belgian officer but the accident happened some months before my time and he too i believe was going home not perhaps quite so ill as myselfbut still he was going home i got round the turn more or less alive though i was too sick to care whether i did or not and always with almayers folly amongst my diminishing baggage i arrived at that delectable capital boma where before the departure of the steamer which was to take me home i had the time to wish myself dead over and over again with perfect sincerity at that date there were in existence only seven chapters of almayers folly but the chapter in my history which followed was that of a long long illness and very dismal convalescence geneva or more precisely the hydropathic establishment of champel is rendered for ever famous by the termination of the eighth chapter in the history of almayers decline and fall the events of the ninth are inextricably mixed up with the details of the proper management of a waterside warehouse owned by a certain city firm whose name does not matter but that work undertaken to accustom myself again to the activities of a healthy existence soon came to an end the earth had nothing to hold me with for very long and then that memorable story like a cask of choice madeira got carried for three years to and fro upon the sea whether this treatment improved its flavour or not of course i would not like to say as far as appearance is concerned it certainly did nothing of the kind the whole ms acquired a faded look and an ancient yellowish complexion it became at last unreasonable to suppose that anything in the world would ever happen to almayer and nina and yet something most unlikely to happen on the high seas was to wake them up from their state of suspended animation  what is it that novalis says it is certain my conviction gains infinitely the moment another soul will believe in it and what is a novel if not a conviction of our fellowmens existence strong enough to take upon itself a form of imagined life clearer than reality and whose accumulated verisimilitude of selected episodes puts to shame the pride of documentary history providence which saved my ms from the congo rapids brought it to the knowledge of a helpful soul far out on the open sea it would be on my part the greatest ingratitude ever to forget the sallow sunken face and the deepset dark eyes of the young cambridge man he was a passenger for his health on board the good ship torrens outward bound to australia who was the first reader of almayers follythe very first reader i ever had would it bore you very much reading a ms in a handwriting like mine i asked him one evening on a sudden impulse at the end of a longish conversation whose subject was gibbons history jacques that was his name was sitting in my cabin one stormy dogwatch below after bringing me a book to read from his own travelling store  not at all he answered with his courteous intonation and a faint smile as i pulled a drawer open his suddenly aroused curiosity gave him a watchful expression i wonder what he expected to see a poem maybe all thats beyond guessing now he was not a cold but a calm man still more subdued by diseasea man of few words and of an unassuming modesty in general intercourse but with something uncommon in the whole of his person which set him apart from the undistinguished lot of our sixty passengers his eyes had a thoughtful introspective look in his attractive reserved manner and in a veiled sympathetic voice he asked  what is this it is a sort of tale i answered with an effort it is not even finished yet nevertheless i would like to know what you think of it he put the ms in the breastpocket of his jacket i remember perfectly his thin brown fingers folding it lengthwise i will read it tomorrow he remarked seizing the doorhandle and then watching the roll of the ship for a propitious moment he opened the door and was gone in the moment of his exit i heard the sustained booming of the wind the swish of the water on the decks of the torrens and the subdued as if distant roar of the rising sea i noted the growing disquiet in the great restlessness of the ocean and responded professionally to it with the thought that at eight oclock in another halfhour or so at the furthest the topgallant sails would have to come off the ship  next day but this time in the first dogwatch jacques entered my cabin he had a thick woollen muffler round his throat and the ms was in his hand he tendered it to me with a steady look but without a word i took it in silence he sat down on the couch and still said nothing i opened and shut a drawer under my desk on which a filledup logslate lay wide open in its wooden frame waiting to be copied neatly into the sort of book i was accustomed to write with care the ships logbook i turned my back squarely on the desk and even then jacques never offered a word well what do you say i asked at last is it worth finishing this question expressed exactly the whole of my thoughts  distinctly he answered in his sedate veiled voice and then coughed a little  were you interested i inquired further almost in a whisper  very much  in a pause i went on meeting instinctively the heavy rolling of the ship and jacques put his feet upon the couch the curtain of my bedplace swung to and fro as it were a punkah the bulkhead lamp circled in its gimbals and now and then the cabin door rattled slightly in the gusts of wind it was in latitude 40 south and nearly in the longitude of greenwich as far as i can remember that these quiet rites of almayers and ninas resurrection were taking place in the prolonged silence it occurred to me that there was a good deal of retrospective writing in the story as far as it went was it intelligible in its action i asked myself as if already the storyteller were being born into the body of a seaman but i heard on deck the whistle of the officer of the watch and remained on the alert to catch the order that was to follow this call to attention it reached me as a faint fierce shout to square the yards aha i thought to myself a westerly blow coming on then i turned to my very first reader who alas was not to live long enough to know the end of the tale  now let me ask you one more thing is the story quite clear to you as it stands  he raised his dark gentle eyes to my face and seemed surprised  yes perfectly  this was all i was to hear from his lips concerning the merits of almayers folly we never spoke together of the book again a long period of bad weather set in and i had no thoughts left but for my duties whilst poor jacques caught a fatal cold and had to keep close in his cabin when we arrived in adelaide the first reader of my prose went at once upcountry and died rather suddenly in the end either in australia or it may be on the passage while going home through the suez canal i am not sure which it was now and i do not think i ever heard precisely though i made inquiries about him from some of our return passengers who wandering about to see the country during the ships stay in port had come upon him here and there at last we sailed homeward bound and still not one line was added to the careless scrawl of the many pages which poor jacques had had the patience to read with the very shadows of eternity gathering already in the hollows of his kind steadfast eyes  the purpose instilled into me by his simple and final distinctly remained dormant yet alive to await its opportunity i dare say i am compelled unconsciously compelled now to write volume after volume as in past years i was compelled to go to sea voyage after voyage leaves must follow upon each other as leagues used to follow in the days gone by on and on to the appointed end which being truth itself is oneone for all men and for all occupations  i do not know which of the two impulses has appeared more mysterious and more wonderful to me still in writing as in going to sea i had to wait my opportunity let me confess here that i was never one of those wonderful fellows that would go afloat in a washtub for the sake of the fun and if i may pride myself upon my consistency it was ever just the same with my writing some men i have heard write in railway carriages and could do it perhaps sitting crosslegged on a clothesline but i must confess that my sybaritic disposition will not consent to write without something at least resembling a chair line by line rather than page by page was the growth of almayers folly  and so it happened that i very nearly lost the ms advanced now to the first words of the ninth chapter in the friedrichstrasse railway station thats in berlin you know on my way to poland or more precisely to ukraine on an early sleepy morning changing trains in a hurry i left my gladstone bag in a refreshmentroom a worthy and intelligent koffertrager rescued it yet in my anxiety i was not thinking of the ms but of all the other things that were packed in the bag  in warsaw where i spent two days those wandering pages were never exposed to the light except once to candlelight while the bag lay open on a chair i was dressing hurriedly to dine at a sporting club a friend of my childhood he had been in the diplomatic service but had turned to growing wheat on paternal acres and we had not seen each other for over twenty years was sitting on the hotel sofa waiting to carry me off there  you might tell me something of your life while you are dressing he suggested kindly  i do not think i told him much of my lifestory either then or later the talk of the select little party with which he made me dine was extremely animated and embraced most subjects under heaven from biggame shooting in africa to the last poem published in a very modernist review edited by the very young and patronised by the highest society but it never touched upon almayers folly and next morning in uninterrupted obscurity this inseparable companion went on rolling with me in the southeast direction towards the government of kiev  at that time there was an eighthours drive if not more from the railway station to the country house which was my destination  dear boy these words were always written in english so ran the last letter from that house received in londonget yourself driven to the only inn in the place dine as well as you can and some time in the evening my own confidential servant factotum and majordomo a mr vs i warn you he is of noble extraction will present himself before you reporting the arrival of the small sledge which will take you here on the next day i send with him my heaviest fur which i suppose with such overcoats as you may have with you will keep you from freezing on the road  sure enough as i was dining served by a hebrew waiter in an enormous barnlike bedroom with a freshly painted floor the door opened and in a travelling costume of long boots big sheepskin cap and a short coat girt with a leather belt the mr vs of noble extraction a man of about thirtyfive appeared with an air of perplexity on his open and moustachioed countenance i got up from the table and greeted him in polish with i hope the right shade of consideration demanded by his noble blood and his confidential position his face cleared up in a wonderful way it appeared that notwithstanding my uncles earnest assurances the good fellow had remained in doubt of our understanding each other he imagined i would talk to him in some foreign language i was told that his last words on getting into the sledge to come to meet me shaped an anxious exclamation  well well here i am going but god only knows how i am to make myself understood to our masters nephew  we understood each other very well from the first he took charge of me as if i were not quite of age i had a delightful boyish feeling of coming home from school when he muffled me up next morning in an enormous bearskin travellingcoat and took his seat protectively by my side the sledge was a very small one and it looked utterly insignificant almost like a toy behind the four big bays harnessed two and two we three counting the coachman filled it completely he was a young fellow with clear blue eyes the high collar of his livery fur coat framed his cheery countenance and stood all round level with the top of his head  now joseph my companion addressed him do you think we shall manage to get home before six his answer was that we would surely with gods help and providing there were no heavy drifts in the long stretch between certain villages whose names came with an extremely familiar sound to my ears he turned out an excellent coachman with an instinct for keeping the road amongst the snowcovered fields and a natural gift of getting the best out of his horses  he is the son of that joseph that i suppose the captain remembers he who used to drive the captains late grandmother of holy memory remarked vs busy tucking fur rugs about my feet  i remembered perfectly the trusty joseph who used to drive my grandmother why he it was who let me hold the reins for the first time in my life and allowed me to play with the great fourinhand whip outside the doors of the coachhouse  what became of him i asked he is no longer serving i suppose  he served our master was the reply but he died of cholera ten years ago nowthat great epidemic we had and his wife died at the same timethe whole houseful of them and this is the only boy that was left  the ms of almayers folly was reposing in the bag under our feet  i saw again the sun setting on the plains as i saw it in the travels of my childhood it set clear and red dipping into the snow in full view as if it were setting on the sea it was twentythree years since i had seen the sun set over that land and we drove on in the darkness which fell swiftly upon the livid expanse of snows till out of the waste of a white earth joining a bestarred sky surged up black shapes the clumps of trees about a village of the ukrainian plain a cottage or two glided by a low interminable wall and then glimmering and winking through a screen of firtrees the lights of the masters house  that very evening the wandering ms of almayers folly was unpacked and unostentatiously laid on the writingtable in my room the guestroom which had been i was informed in an affectedly careless tone awaiting me for some fifteen years or so it attracted no attention from the affectionate presence hovering round the son of the favourite sister  you wont have many hours to yourself while you are staying with me brother he saidthis form of address borrowed from the speech of our peasants being the usual expression of the highest good humour in a moment of affectionate elation i shall be always coming in for a chat  as a matter of fact we had the whole house to chat in and were everlastingly intruding upon each other i invaded the retirement of his study where the principal feature was a colossal silver inkstand presented to him on his fiftieth year by a subscription of all his wards then living he had been guardian of many orphans of landowning families from the three southern provincesever since the year 1860 some of them had been my schoolfellows and playmates but not one of them girls or boys that i know of has ever written a novel one or two were older than myselfconsiderably older too one of them a visitor i remember in my early years was the man who first put me on horseback and his fourhorse bachelor turnout his perfect horsemanship and general skill in manly exercises was one of my earliest admirations i seem to remember my mother looking on from a colonnade in front of the diningroom windows as i was lifted upon the pony held for all i know by the very josephthe groom attached specially to my grandmothers servicewho died of cholera it was certainly a young man in a dark blue tailless coat and huge cossack trousers that being the livery of the men about the stables it must have been in 1864 but reckoning by another mode of calculating time it was certainly in the year in which my mother obtained permission to travel south and visit her family from the exile into which she had followed my father for that too she had had to ask permission and i know that one of the conditions of that favour was that she should be treated exactly as a condemned exile herself yet a couple of years later in memory of her eldest brother who had served in the guards and dying early left hosts of friends and a loved memory in the great world of st petersburg some influential personages procured for her this permissionit was officially called the highest graceof a three months leave from exile  this is also the year in which i first begin to remember my mother with more distinctness than a mere loving widebrowed silent protecting presence whose eyes had a sort of commanding sweetness and i also remember the great gathering of all the relations from near and far and the grey heads of the family friends paying her the homage of respect and love in the house of her favourite brother who a few years later was to take the place for me of both my parents  i did not understand the tragic significance of it all at the time though indeed i remember that doctors also came there were no signs of invalidism about herbut i think that already they had pronounced her doom unless perhaps the change to a southern climate could reestablish her declining strength for me it seems the very happiest period of my existence there was my cousin a delightful quicktempered little girl some months younger than myself whose life lovingly watched over as if she were a royal princess came to an end with her fifteenth year there were other children too many of whom are dead now and not a few whose very names i have forgotten over all this hung the oppressive shadow of the great russian empirethe shadow lowering with the darkness of a newborn national hatred fostered by the moscow school of journalists against the poles after the illomened rising of 1863  this is a far cry back from the ms of almayers folly but the public record of these formative impressions is not the whim of an uneasy egotism these too are things human already distant in their appeal it is meet that something more should be left for the novelists children than the colours and figures of his own hardwon creation that which in their grownup years may appear to the world about them as the most enigmatic side of their natures and perhaps must remain for ever obscure even to themselves will be their unconscious response to the still voice of that inexorable past from which his work of fiction and their personalities are remotely derived  only in mens imagination does every truth find an effective and undeniable existence imagination not invention is the supreme master of art as of life an imaginative and exact rendering of authentic memories may serve worthily that spirit of piety towards all things human which sanctions the conceptions of a writer of tales and the emotions of the man reviewing his own experience    chapter ii  as i have said i was unpacking my luggage after a journey from london into ukraine the ms of almayers follymy companion already for some three years or more and then in the ninth chapter of its agewas deposited unostentatiously on the writingtable placed between two windows it didnt occur to me to put it away in the drawer the table was fitted with but my eye was attracted by the good form of the same drawers brass handles two candelabra with four candles each lighted up festally the room which had waited so many years for the wandering nephew the blinds were down  within five hundred yards of the chair on which i sat stood the first peasant hut of the villagepart of my maternal grandfathers estate the only part remaining in the possession of a member of the family and beyond the village in the limitless blackness of a winters night there lay the great unfenced fieldsnot a flat and severe plain but a kindly breadgiving land of low rounded ridges all white now with the black patches of timber nestling in the hollows the road by which i had come ran through the village with a turn just outside the gates closing the short drive somebody was abroad on the deep snowtrack a quick tinkle of bells stole gradually into the stillness of the room like a tuneful whisper  my unpacking had been watched over by the servant who had come to help me and for the most part had been standing attentive but unnecessary at the door of the room i did not want him in the least but i did not like to tell him to go away he was a young fellow certainly more than ten years younger than myself i had not beeni wont say in that place but within sixty miles of it ever since the year 67 yet his guileless physiognomy of the open peasant type seemed strangely familiar it was quite possible that he might have been a descendant a son or even a grandson of the servants whose friendly faces had been familiar to me in my early childhood as a matter of fact he had no such claim on my consideration he was the product of some village near by and was there on his promotion having learned the service in one or two houses as pantryboy i know this because i asked the worthy v next day i might well have spared the question i discovered before long that all the faces about the house and all the faces in the village the grave faces with long moustaches of the heads of families the downy faces of the young men the faces of the little fairhaired children the handsome tanned widebrowed faces of the mothers seen at the doors of the huts were as familiar to me as though i had known them all from childhood and my childhood were a matter of the day before yesterday  the tinkle of the travellers bels after growing louder had faded away quickly and the tumult of barking dogs in the village had calmed down at last my uncle lounging in the corner of a small couch smoked his long turkish chibouk in silence  this is an extremely nice writingtable you have got for my room i remarked  it is really your property he said keeping his eyes on me with an interested and wistful expression as he had done ever since i had entered the house forty years ago your mother used to write at this very table in our house in oratow it stood in the little sittingroom which by a tacit arrangement was given up to the girlsi mean to your mother and her sister who died so young it was a present to them jointly from our uncle nicholas b when your mother was seventeen and your aunt two years younger she was a very dear delightful girl that aunt of yours of whom i suppose you know nothing more than the name she did not shine so much by personal beauty and a cultivated mind in which your mother was far superior it was her good sense the admirable sweetness of her nature her exceptional facility and ease in daily relations that endeared her to everybody her death was a terrible grief and a serious moral loss for us all had she lived she would have brought the greatest blessings to the house it would have been her lot to enter as wife mother and mistress of a household she would have created round herself an atmosphere of peace and content which only those who can love unselfishly are able to evoke your motherof far greater beauty exceptionally distinguished in person manner and intellecthad a less easy disposition being more brilliantly gifted she also expected more from life at that trying time especially we were greatly concerned about her state suffering in her health from the shock of her fathers death she was alone in the house with him when he died suddenly she was torn by the inward struggle between her love for the man whom she was to marry in the end and her knowledge of her dead fathers declared objection to that match unable to bring herself to disregard that cherished memory and that judgment she had always respected and trusted and on the other hand feeling the impossibility to resist a sentiment so deep and so true she could not have been expected to preserve her mental and moral balance at war with herself she could not give to others that feeling of peace which was not her own it was only later when united at last with the man of her choice that she developed those uncommon gifts of mind and heart which compelled the respect and admiration even of our foes meeting with calm fortitude the cruel trials of a life reflecting all the national and social misfortunes of the community she realised the highest conceptions of duty as a wife a mother and a patriot sharing the exile of her husband and representing nobly the ideal of polish womanhood our uncle nicholas was not a man very accessible to feelings of affection apart from his worship for napoleon the great he loved really i believe only three people in the world his motheryour greatgrandmother whom you have seen but cannot possibly remember his brother our father in whose house he lived for so many years and of all of us his nephews and nieces grown up round him your mother alone the modest lovable qualities of the youngest sister he did not seem able to see it was i who felt most profoundly this unexpected stroke of death falling upon the family less than a year after i had become its head it was terribly unexpected driving home one wintry afternoon to keep me company in our empty house where i had to remain permanently administering the estate and attending to the complicated affairsthe girls took it in turn week and week aboutdriving as i said from the house of the countess tekla potochka where our invalid mother was staying then to be near a doctor they lost the road and got stuck in a snowdrift she was alone with the coachman and old valery the personal servant of our late father impatient of delay while they were trying to dig themselves out she jumped out of the sledge and went to look for the road herself all this happened in 51 not ten miles from the house in which we are sitting now the road was soon found but snow had begun to fall thickly again and they were four more hours getting home both the men took off their sheepskinlined greatcoats and used all their own rugs to wrap her up against the cold notwithstanding her protests positive orders and even struggles as valery afterwards related to me how could i he remonstrated with her go to meet the blessed soul of my late master if i let any harm come to you while theres a spark of life left in my body when they reached home at last the poor old man was stiff and speechless from exposure and the coachman was in not much better plight though he had the strength to drive round to the stables himself to my reproaches for venturing out at all in such weather she answered characteristically that she could not bear the thought of abandoning me to my cheerless solitude it is incomprehensible how it was that she was allowed to start i suppose it had to be she made light of the cough which came on next day but shortly afterwards inflammation of the lungs set in and in three weeks she was no more she was the first to be taken away of the young generation under my care behold the vanity of all hopes and fears i was the most frail at birth of all the children for years i remained so delicate that my parents had but little hope of bringing me up and yet i have survived five brothers and two sisters and many of my contemporaries i have outlived my wife and daughter tooand from all those who have had some knowledge at least of these old times you alone are left it has been my lot to lay in an early grave many honest hearts many brilliant promises many hopes full of life  he got up brusquely sighed and left me saying we will dine in half an hour without moving i listened to his quick steps resounding on the waxed floor of the next room traversing the anteroom lined with bookshelves where he paused to put his chibouk in the pipestand before passing into the drawingroom these were all en suite where he became inaudible on the thick carpet but i heard the door of his studybedroom close he was then sixtytwo years old and had been for a quarter of a century the wisest the firmest the most indulgent of guardians extending over me a paternal care and affection a moral support which i seemed to feel always near me in the most distant parts of the earth  as to mr nicholas b sublieutenant of 1808 lieutenant of 1813 in the french army and for a short time officier dordonnance of marshal marmont afterwards captain in the 2nd regiment of mounted rifles in the polish armysuch as it existed up to 1830 in the reduced kingdom established by the congress of viennai must say that from all that more distant past known to me traditionally and a little de visu and called out by the words of the man just gone away he remains the most incomplete figure it is obvious that i must have seen him in 64 for it is certain that he would not have missed the opportunity of seeing my mother for what he must have known would be the last time from my early boyhood to this day if i try to call up his image a sort of mist rises before my eyes a mist in which i perceive vaguely only a neatly brushed head of white hair which is exceptional in the case of the b family where it is the rule for men to go bald in a becoming manner before thirty and a thin curved dignified nose a feature in strict accordance with the physical tradition of the b family but it is not by these fragmentary remains of perishable mortality that he lives in my memory i knew at a very early age that my granduncle nicholas b was a knight of the legion of honour and that he had also the polish cross for valour virtuti militari the knowledge of these glorious facts inspired in me an admiring veneration yet it is not that sentiment strong as it was which resumes for me the force and the significance of his personality it is overborne by another and complex impression of awe compassion and horror mr nicholas b remains for me the unfortunate and miserable but heroic being who once upon a time had eaten a dog  it is a good forty years since i heard the tale and the effect has not worn off yet i believe this is the very first say realistic story i heard in my life but all the same i dont know why i should have been so frightfully impressed of course i know what our village dogs look likebut still    no at this very day recalling the horror and compassion of my childhood i ask myself whether i am right in disclosing to a cold and fastidious world that awful episode in the family history i ask myselfis it rightespecially as the b family had always been honourably known in a wide countryside for the delicacy of their tastes in the matter of eating and drinking but upon the whole and considering that this gastronomical degradation overtaking a gallant young officer lies really at the door of the great napoleon i think that to cover it up by silence would be an exaggeration of literary restraint let the truth stand here the responsibility rests with the man of st helena in view of his deplorable levity in the conduct of the russian campaign it was during the memorable retreat from moscow that mr nicholas b in company of two brother officersas to whose morality and natural refinement i know nothingbagged a dog on the outskirts of a village and subsequently devoured him as far as i can remember the weapon used was a cavalry sabre and the issue of the sporting episode was rather more of a matter of life and death than if it had been an encounter with a tiger a picket of cossacks was sleeping in that village lost in the depths of the great lithuanian forest the three sportsmen had observed them from a hidingplace making themselves very much at home amongst the huts just before the early winter darkness set in at four oclock they had observed them with disgust and perhaps with despair late in the night the rash counsels of hunger overcame the dictates of prudence crawling through the snow they crept up to the fence of dry branches which generally encloses a village in that part of lithuania what they expected to get and in what manner and whether this expectation was worth the risk goodness only knows however these cossack parties in most cases wandering without an officer were known to guard themselves badly and often not at all in addition the village lying at a great distance from the line of french retreat they could not suspect the presence of stragglers from the grand army the three officers had strayed away in a blizzard from the main column and had been lost for days in the woods which explains sufficiently the terrible straits to which they were reduced their plan was to try and attract the attention of the peasants in that one of the huts which was nearest to the enclosure but as they were preparing to venture into the very jaws of the lion so to speak a dog it is mighty strange that there was but one a creature quite as formidable under the circumstances as a lion began to bark on the other side of the fence     at this stage of the narrative which i heard many times by request from the lips of captain nicholas bs sisterinlaw my grandmother i used to tremble with excitement  the dog barked and if he had done no more than bark three officers of the great napoleons army would have perished honourably on the points of cossacks lances or perchance escaping the chase would have died decently of starvation but before they had time to think of running away that fatal and revolting dog being carried away by the excess of his zeal dashed out through a gap in the fence he dashed out and died his head i understand was severed at one blow from his body i understand also that later on within the gloomy solitudes of the snowladen woods when in a sheltering hollow a fire had been lit by the party the condition of the quarry was discovered to be distinctly unsatisfactory it was not thinon the contrary it seemed unhealthily obese its skin showed bare patches of an unpleasant character however they had not killed that dog for the sake of the pelt he was large    he was eaten    the rest is silence     a silence in which a small boy shudders and says firmly  i could not have eaten that dog  and his grandmother remarks with a smile  perhaps you dont know what it is to be hungry  i have learned something of it since not that i have been reduced to eat dog i have fed on the emblematical animal which in the language of the volatile gauls is called la vache enragee i have lived on ancient salt junk i know the taste of shark of trepang of snake of nondescript dishes containing things without a namebut of the lithuanian village dognever i wish it to be distinctly understood that it is not i but my granduncle nicholas of the polish landed gentry chevalier de la legion dhonneur c c who in his young days had eaten the lithuanian dog  i wish he had not the childish horror of the deed clings absurdly to the grizzled man i am perfectly helpless against it still if he really had to let us charitably remember that he had eaten him on active service while bearing up bravely against the greatest military disaster of modern history and in a manner for the sake of his country he had eaten him to appease his hunger no doubt but also for the sake of an unappeasable and patriotic desire in the glow of a great faith that lives still and in the pursuit of a great illusion kindled like a false beacon by a great man to lead astray the effort of a brave nation  pro patria  looked at in that light it appears a sweet and decorous meal  and looked at in the same light my own diet of la vache enragee appears a fatuous and extravagant form of selfindulgence for why should i the son of a land which such men as these have turned up with their ploughshares and bedewed with their blood undertake the pursuit of fantastic meals of salt junk and hard tack upon the wide seas on the kindest view it seems an unanswerable question alas i have the conviction that there are men of unstained rectitude who are ready to murmur scornfully the word desertion thus the taste of innocent adventure may be made bitter to the palate the part of the inexplicable should be allowed for in appraising the conduct of men in a world where no explanation is final no charge of faithlessness ought to be lightly uttered the appearances of this perishable life are deceptive like everything that falls under the judgment of our imperfect senses the inner voice may remain true enough in its secret counsel the fidelity to a special tradition may last through the events of an unrelated existence following faithfully too the traced way of an inexplicable impulse  it would take too long to explain the intimate alliance of contradictions in human nature which makes love itself wear at times the desperate shape of betrayal and perhaps there is no possible explanation indulgenceas somebody saidis the most intelligent of all the virtues i venture to think that it is one of the least common if not the most uncommon of all i would not imply by this that men are foolishor even most men far from it the barber and the priest backed by the whole opinion of the village condemned justly the conduct of the ingenious hidalgo who sallying forth from his native place broke the head of the muleteer put to death a flock of inoffensive sheep and went through very doleful experiences in a certain stable god forbid that an unworthy churl should escape merited censure by hanging on to the stirrupleather of the sublime caballero his was a very noble a very unselfish fantasy fit for nothing except to raise the envy of baser mortals but there is more than one aspect to the charm of that exalted and dangerous figure he too had his frailties after reading so many romances he desired naively to escape with his very body from the intolerable reality of things he wished to meet eye to eye the valorous giant brandabarbaran lord of arabia whose armour is made of the skin of a dragon and whose shield strapped to his arm is the gate of a fortified city o amiable and natural weakness o blessed simplicity of a gentle heart without guile who would not succumb to such a consoling temptation nevertheless it was a form of selfindulgence and the ingenious hidalgo of la mancha was not a good citizen the priest and the barber were not unreasonable in their strictures without going so far as the old king louisphilippe who used to say in his exile the people are never in faultone may admit that there must be some righteousness in the assent of a whole village mad mad he who kept in pious meditation the ritual vigilofarms by the well of an inn and knelt reverently to be knighted at daybreak by the fat sly rogue of a landlord has come very near perfection he rides forth his head encircled by a halothe patron saint of all lives spoiled or saved by the irresistible grace of imagination but he was not a good citizen  perhaps that and nothing else was meant by the wellremembered exclamation of my tutor  it was in the jolly year 1873 the very last year in which i have had a jolly holiday there have been idle years afterwards jolly enough in a way and not altogether without their lesson but this year of which i speak was the year of my last schoolboy holiday there are other reasons why i should remember that year but they are too long to state formally in this place moreover they have nothing to do with that holiday what has to do with the holiday is that before the day on which the remark was made we had seen vienna the upper danube munich the falls of the rhine the lake of constancein fact it was a memorable holiday of travel of late we had been tramping slowly up the valley of the reuss it was a delightful time it was much more like a stroll than a tramp landing from a lake of lucerne steamer in fluellen we found ourselves at the end of the second day with the dusk overtaking our leisurely footsteps a little way beyond hospenthal this is not the day on which the remark was made in the shadows of the deep valley and with the habitations of men left some way behind our thoughts ran not upon the ethics of conduct but upon the simpler human problem of shelter and food there did not seem anything of the kind in sight and we were thinking of turning back when suddenly at a bend of the road we came upon a building ghostly in the twilight  at that time the work on the st gothard tunnel was going on and that magnificent enterprise of burrowing was directly responsible for the unexpected building standing all alone upon the very roots of the mountains it was long though not big at all it was low it was built of boards without ornamentation in barrackhut style with the white windowframes quite flush with the yellow face of its plain front and yet it was an hotel it had even a name which i have forgotten but there was no goldlaced doorkeeper at its humble door a plain but vigorous servantgirl answered our inquiries then a man and woman who owned the place appeared it was clear that no travellers were expected or perhaps even desired in this strange hostelry which in its severe style resembled the house which surmounts the unseaworthylooking hulls of the toy noahs arks the universal possession of european childhood however its roof was not hinged and it was not full to the brim of slabsided and painted animals of wood even the live tourist animal was nowhere in evidence we had something to eat in a long narrow room at one end of a long narrow table which to my tired perception and to my sleepy eyes seemed as if it would tilt up like a seesaw plank since there was no one at the other end to balance it against our two dusty and travelstained figures then we hastened upstairs to bed in a room smelling of pine planks and i was fast asleep before my head touched the pillow  in the morning my tutor he was a student of the cracow university woke me up early and as we were dressing remarked there seems to be a lot of people staying in this hotel i have heard a noise of talking up till 11 oclock this statement surprised me i had heard no noise whatever having slept like a top  we went downstairs into the long and narrow diningroom with its long and narrow table there were two rows of plates on it at one of the many uncurtained windows stood a tall bony man with a bald head set off by a bunch of black hair above each ear and with a long black beard he glanced up from the paper he was reading and seemed genuinely astonished at our intrusion byandby more men came in not one of them looked like a tourist not a single woman appeared these men seemed to know each other with some intimacy but i cannot say they were a very talkative lot the baldheaded man sat down gravely at the head of the table it all had the air of a family party byandby from one of the vigorous servantgirls in national costume we discovered that the place was really a boardinghouse for some english engineers engaged at the works of the st gothard tunnel and i could listen my fill to the sounds of the english language as far as it is used at a breakfasttable by men who do not believe in wasting many words on the mere amenities of life  this was my first contact with british mankind apart from the tourist kind seen in the hotels of zurich and lucernethe kind which has no real existence in a workaday world i know now that the baldheaded man spoke with a strong scotch accent i have met many of his kind since both ashore and afloat the second engineer of the steamer mavis for instance ought to have been his twin brother i cannot help thinking that he really was though for some reasons of his own he assured me that he never had a twin brother anyway the deliberate baldheaded scot with the coalblack beard appeared to my boyish eyes a very romantic and mysterious person  we slipped out unnoticed our mappedout route led over the furca pass towards the rhone glacier with the further intention of following down the trend of the hasli valley the sun was already declining when we found ourselves on the top of the pass and the remark alluded to was presently uttered  we sat down by the side of the road to continue the argument begun half a mile or so before i am certain it was an argument because i remember perfectly how my tutor argued and how without the power of reply i listened with my eyes fixed obstinately on the ground a stir on the road made me look upand then i saw my unforgettable englishman there are acquaintances of later years familiars shipmates whom i remember less clearly he marched rapidly towards the east attended by a hangdog swiss guide with the mien of an ardent and fearless traveller he was clad in a knickerbocker suit but as at the same time he wore short socks under his laced boots for reasons which whether hygienic or conscientious were surely imaginative his calves exposed to the public gaze and to the tonic air of high altitudes dazzled the beholder by the splendour of their marblelike condition and their rich tone of young ivory he was the leader of a small caravan the light of a headlong exalted satisfaction with the world of men and the scenery of mountains illumined his cleancut very red face his short silverwhite whiskers his innocently eager and triumphant eyes in passing he cast a glance of kindly curiosity and a friendly gleam of big sound shiny teeth towards the man and the boy sitting like dusty tramps by the roadside with a modest knapsack lying at their feet his white calves twinkled sturdily the uncouth swiss guide with a surly mouth stalked like an unwilling bear at his elbow a small train of three mules followed in single file the lead of this inspiring enthusiast two ladies rode past one behind the other but from the way they sat i saw only their calm uniform backs and the long ends of blue veils hanging behind far down over their identical hatbrims his two daughters surely an industrious luggagemule with unstarched ears and guarded by a slouching sallow driver brought up the rear my tutor after pausing for a look and a faint smile resumed his earnest argument  i tell you it was a memorable year one does not meet such an englishman twice in a lifetime was he in the mystic ordering of common events the ambassador of my future sent out to turn the scale at a critical moment on the top of an alpine pass with the peaks of the bernese oberland for mute and solemn witnesses his glance his smile the unextinguishable and comic ardour of his strivingforward appearance helped me to pull myself together it must be stated that on that day and in the exhilarating atmosphere of that elevated spot i had been feeling utterly crushed it was the year in which i had first spoken aloud of my desire to go to sea at first like those sounds that ranging outside the scale to which mens ears are attuned remain inaudible to our sense of hearing this declaration passed unperceived it was as if it had not been later on by trying various tones i managed to arouse here and there a surprised momentary attentionthe what was that funny noise sort of inquiry later on it wasdid you hear what that boy said what an extraordinary outbreak presently a wave of scandalised astonishment it could not have been greater if i had announced the intention of entering a carthusian monastery ebbing out of the educational and academical town of cracow spread itself over several provinces it spread itself shallow but farreaching it stirred up a mass of remonstrance indignation pitying wonder bitter irony and downright chaff i could hardly breathe under its weight and certainly had no words for an answer people wondered what mr tb would do now with his worrying nephew and i dare say hoped kindly that he would make short work of my nonsense  what he did was to come down all the way from ukraine to have it out with me and to judge by himself unprejudiced impartial and just taking his stand on the ground of wisdom and affection as far as is possible for a boy whose power of expression is still unformed i opened the secret of my thoughts to him and he in return allowed me a glimpse into his mind and heart the first glimpse of an inexhaustible and noble treasure of clear thought and warm feeling which through life was to be mine to draw upon with a neverdeceived love and confidence practically after several exhaustive conversations he concluded that he would not have me later on reproach him for having spoiled my life by an unconditional opposition but i must take time for serious reflection and i must not only think of myself but of others weigh the claims of affection and conscience against my own sincerity of purpose think well what it all means in the larger issues my boy he exhorted me finally with special friendliness and meantime try to get the best place you can at the yearly examinations  the scholastic year came to an end i took a fairly good place at the exams which for me for certain reasons happened to be a more difficult task than for other boys in that respect i could enter with a good conscience upon that holiday which was like a long visit pour prendre conge of the mainland of old europe i was to see so little of for the next four and twenty years such however was not the avowed purpose of that tour it was rather i suspect planned in order to distract and occupy my thoughts in other directions nothing had been said for months of my going to sea but my attachment to my young tutor and his influence over me were so well known that he must have received a confidential mission to talk me out of my romantic folly it was an excellently appropriate arrangement as neither he nor i had ever had a single glimpse of the sea in our lives that was to come byandby for both of us in venice from the outer shore of lido meantime he had taken his mission to heart so well that i began to feel crushed before we reached zurich he argued in railway trains in lake steamboats he had argued away for me the obligatory sunrise on the righi by jove of his devotion to his unworthy pupil there can be no doubt he had proved it already by two years of unremitting and arduous care i could not hate him but he had been crushing me slowly and when he started to argue on the top of the furca pass he was perhaps nearer a success than either he or i imagined i listened to him in despairing silence feeling that ghostly unrealised and desired sea of my dreams escape from the unnerved grip of my will  the enthusiastic old englishman had passedand the argument went on what reward could i expect from such a life at the end of my years either in ambition honour or conscience an unanswerable question but i felt no longer crushed then our eyes met and a genuine emotion was visible in his as well as in mine the end came all at once he picked up the knapsack suddenly and got on to his feet  you are an incorrigible hopeless don quixote thats what you are  i was surprised i was only fifteen and did not know what he meant exactly but i felt vaguely flattered at the name of the immortal knight turning up in connection with my own folly as some people would call it to my face alas i dont think there was anything to be proud of mine was not the stuff the protectors of forlorn damsels the redressers of this worlds wrongs are made of and my tutor was the man to know that best therein in his indignation he was superior to the barber and the priest when he flung at me an honoured name like a reproach  i walked behind him for full five minutes then without looking back he stopped the shadows of distant peaks were lengthening over the furca pass when i came up to him he turned to me and in full view of the finsteraarhorn with his band of giant brothers rearing their monstrous heads against a brilliant sky put his hand on my shoulder affectionately  well thats enough we will have no more of it  and indeed there was no more question of my mysterious vocation between us there was to be no more question of it at all nowhere or with any one we began the descent of the furca pass conversing merrily eleven years later month for month i stood on tower hill on the steps of the st katherines dockhouse a master in the british merchant service but the man who put his hand on my shoulder at the top of the furca pass was no longer living  that very year of our travels he took his degree of the philosophical facultyand only then his true vocation declared itself obedient to the call he entered at once upon the fouryear course of the medical schools a day came when on the deck of a ship moored in calcutta i opened a letter telling me of the end of an enviable existence he had made for himself a practice in some obscure little town of austrian galicia and the letter went on to tell me how all the bereaved poor of the district christians and jews alike had mobbed the good doctors coffin with sobs and lamentations at the very gate of the cemetery  how short his years and how clear his vision what greater reward in ambition honour and conscience could he have hoped to win for himself when on the top of the furca pass he bade me look well to the end of my opening life    chapter iii  the devouring in a dismal forest of a luckless lithuanian dog by my granduncle nicholas b in company of two other military and famished scarecrows symbolised to my childish imagination the whole horror of the retreat from moscow and the immorality of a conquerors ambition an extreme distaste for that objectionable episode has tinged the views i hold as to the character and achievements of napoleon the great i need not say that these are unfavourable it was morally reprehensible for that great captain to induce a simpleminded polish gentleman to eat dog by raising in his breast a false hope of national independence it has been the fate of that credulous nation to starve for upwards of a hundred years on a diet of false hopes andwelldog it is when one thinks of it a singularly poisonous regimen some pride in the national constitution which has survived a long course of such dishes is really excusable but enough of generalising returning to particulars mr nicholas b confided to his sisterinlaw my grandmother in his misanthropically laconic manner that this supper in the woods had been nearly the death of him this is not surprising what surprises me is that the story was ever heard of for granduncle nicholas differed in this from the generality of military men of napoleons time and perhaps of all time that he did not like to talk of his campaigns which began at friedland and ended somewhere in the neighbourhood of barleduc his admiration of the great emperor was unreserved in everything but expression like the religion of earnest men it was too profound a sentiment to be displayed before a world of little faith apart from that he seemed as completely devoid of military anecdotes as though he had hardly ever seen a soldier in his life proud of his decorations earned before he was twentyfive he refused to wear the ribbons at the buttonhole in the manner practised to this day in europe and even was unwilling to display the insignia on festive occasions as though he wished to conceal them in the fear of appearing boastful it is enough that i have them he used to mutter in the course of thirty years they were seen on his breast only twiceat an auspicious marriage in the family and at the funeral of an old friend that the wedding which was thus honoured was not the wedding of my mother i learned only late in life too late to bear a grudge against mr nicholas b who made amends at my birth by a long letter of congratulation containing the following prophecy he will see better times even in his embittered heart there lived a hope but he was not a true prophet  he was a man of strange contradictions living for many years in his brothers house the home of many children a house full of life of animation noisy with a constant coming and going of many guests he kept his habits of solitude and silence considered as obstinately secretive in all his purposes he was in reality the victim of a most painful irresolution in all matters of civil life under his taciturn phlegmatic behaviour was hidden a faculty of shortlived passionate anger i suspect he had no talent for narrative but it seemed to afford him sombre satisfaction to declare that he was the last man to ride over the bridge of the river elster after the battle of leipsic lest some construction favourable to his valour should be put on the fact he condescended to explain how it came to pass it seems that shortly after the retreat began he was sent back to the town where some divisions of the french army and amongst them the polish corps of prince joseph poniatowski jammed hopelessly in the streets were being simply exterminated by the troops of the allied powers when asked what it was like in there mr nicholas b muttered the only word shambles having delivered his message to the prince he hastened away at once to render an account of his mission to the superior who had sent him by that time the advance of the enemy had enveloped the town and he was shot at from houses and chased all the way to the river bank by a disorderly mob of austrian dragoons and prussian hussars the bridge had been mined early in the morning and his opinion was that the sight of the horsemen converging from many sides in the pursuit of his person alarmed the officer in command of the sappers and caused the premature firing of the charges he had not gone more than 200 yards on the other side when he heard the sound of the fatal explosions mr nicholas b concluded his bald narrative with the word imbecile uttered with the utmost deliberation it testified to his indignation at the loss of so many thousands of lives but his phlegmatic physiognomy lighted up when he spoke of his only wound with something resembling satisfaction you will see that there was some reason for it when you learn that he was wounded in the heel like his majesty the emperor napoleon himself he reminded his hearers with assumed indifference there can be no doubt that the indifference was assumed if one thinks what very distinguished sort of wound it was in all the history of warfare there are i believe only three warriors publicly known to have been wounded in the heelachilles and napoleondemigods indeedto whom the familial piety of an unworthy descendant adds the name of the simple mortal nicholas b  the hundred days found mr nicholas b staying with a distant relative of ours owner of a small estate in galicia how he got there across the breadth of an armed europe and after what adventures i am afraid will never be known now all his papers were destroyed shortly before his death but if there was amongst them as he affirmed a concise record of his life then i am pretty sure it did not take up more than a halfsheet of foolscap or so this relative of ours happened to be an austrian officer who had left the service after the battle of austerlitz unlike mr nicholas b who concealed his decorations he liked to display his honourable discharge in which he was mentioned as unschreckbar fearless before the enemy no conjunction could seem more unpromising yet it stands in the family tradition that these two got on very well together in their rural solitude  when asked whether he had not been sorely tempted during the hundred days to make his way again to france and join the service of his beloved emperor mr nicholas b used to mutter no money no horse too far to walk  the fall of napoleon and the ruin of national hopes affected adversely the character of mr nicholas b he shrank from returning to his province but for that there was also another reason mr nicholas b and his brothermy maternal grandfatherhad lost their father early while they were quite children their mother young still and left very well off married again a man of great charm and of an amiable disposition but without a penny he turned out an affectionate and careful stepfather it was unfortunate though that while directing the boys education and forming their character by wise counsel he did his best to get hold of the fortune by buying and selling land in his own name and investing capital in such a manner as to cover up the traces of the real ownership it seems that such practices can be successful if one is charming enough to dazzle ones own wife permanently and brave enough to defy the vain terrors of public opinion the critical time came when the elder of the boys on attaining his majority in the year 1811 asked for the accounts and some part at least of the inheritance to begin life upon it was then that the stepfather declared with calm finality that there were no accounts to render and no property to inherit the whole fortune was his very own he was very goodnatured about the young mans misapprehension of the true state of affairs but of course felt obliged to maintain his position firmly old friends came and went busily voluntary mediators appeared travelling on most horrible roads from the most distant corners of the three provinces and the marshal of the nobility exofficio guardian of all wellborn orphans called a meeting of landowners to ascertain in a friendly way how the misunderstanding between x and his stepsons had arisen and devise proper measures to remove the same a deputation to that effect visited x who treated them to excellent wines but absolutely refused his ear to their remonstrances as to the proposals for arbitration he simply laughed at them yet the whole province must have been aware that fourteen years before when he married the widow all his visible fortune consisted apart from his social qualities in a smart fourhorse turnout with two servants with whom he went about visiting from house to house and as to any funds he might have possessed at that time their existence could only be inferred from the fact that he was very punctual in settling his modest losses at cards but by the magic power of stubborn and constant assertion there were found presently here and there people who mumbled that surely there must be something in it however on his next nameday which he used to celebrate by a great threedays shootingparty of all the invited crowd only two guests turned up distant neighbours of no importance one notoriously a fool and the other a very pious and honest person but such a passionate lover of the gun that on his own confession he could not have refused an invitation to a shootingparty from the devil himself x met this manifestation of public opinion with the serenity of an unstained conscience he refused to be crushed yet he must have been a man of deep feeling because when his wife took openly the part of her children he lost his beautiful tranquillity proclaimed himself heartbroken and drove her out of the house neglecting in his grief to give her enough time to pack her trunks  this was the beginning of a lawsuit an abominable marvel of chicane which by the use of every legal subterfuge was made to last for many years it was also the occasion for a display of much kindness and sympathy all the neighbouring houses flew open for the reception of the homeless neither legal aid nor material assistance in the prosecution of the suit was ever wanting x on his side went about shedding tears publicly over his stepchildrens ingratitude and his wifes blind infatuation but as at the same time he displayed great cleverness in the art of concealing material documents he was even suspected of having burnt a lot of historically interesting family papers this scandalous litigation had to be ended by a compromise lest worse should befall it was settled finally by a surrender out of the disputed estate in full satisfaction of all claims of two villages with the names of which i do not intend to trouble my readers after this lame and impotent conclusion neither the wife nor the stepsons had anything to say to the man who had presented the world with such a successful example of selfhelp based on character determination and industry and my greatgrandmother her health completely broken down died a couple of years later in carlsbad legally secured by a decree in the possession of his plunder x regained his wonted serenity and went on living in the neighbourhood in a comfortable style and in apparent peace of mind his big shoots were fairly well attended again he was never tired of assuring people that he bore no grudge for what was past he protested loudly of his constant affection for his wife and stepchildren it was true he said that they had tried their best to strip him as naked as a turkish saint in the decline of his days and because he had defended himself from spoliation as anybody else in his place would have done they had abandoned him now to the horrors of a solitary old age nevertheless his love for them survived these cruel blows and there might have been some truth in his protestations very soon he began to make overtures of friendship to his eldest stepson my maternal grandfather and when these were peremptorily rejected he went on renewing them again and again with characteristic obstinacy for years he persisted in his efforts at reconciliation promising my grandfather to execute a will in his favour if he only would be friends again to the extent of calling now and then it was fairly close neighbourhood for these parts forty miles or so or even of putting in an appearance for the great shoot on the nameday my grandfather was an ardent lover of every sport his temperament was as free from hardness and animosity as can be imagined pupil of the liberalminded benedictines who directed the only public school of some standing then in the south he had also read deeply the authors of the eighteenth century in him christian charity was joined to a philosophical indulgence for the failings of human nature but the memory of these miserably anxious early years his young mans years robbed of all generous illusions by the cynicism of the sordid lawsuit stood in the way of forgiveness he never succumbed to the fascination of the great shoot and x his heart set to the last on reconciliation with the draft of the will ready for signature kept by his bedside died intestate the fortune thus acquired and augmented by a wise and careful management passed to some distant relatives whom he had never seen and who even did not bear his name  meantime the blessing of general peace descended upon europe mr nicholas b bidding goodbye to his hospitable relative the fearless austrian officer departed from galicia and without going near his native place where the odious lawsuit was still going on proceeded straight to warsaw and entered the army of the newly constituted polish kingdom under the sceptre of alexander i autocrat of all the russias  this kingdom created by the vienna congress as an acknowledgment to a nation of its former independent existence included only the central provinces of the old polish patrimony a brother of the emperor the grand duke constantine pavlovitch its viceroy and commanderinchief married morganatically to a polish lady to whom he was fiercely attached extended this affection to what he called my poles in a capricious and savage manner sallow in complexion with a tartar physiognomy and fierce little eyes he walked with his fists clenched his body bent forward darting suspicious glances from under an enormous cocked hat his intelligence was limited and his sanity itself was doubtful the hereditary taint expressed itself in his case not by mystic leanings as in his two brothers alexander and nicholas in their various ways for one was mystically liberal and the other mystically autocratic but by the fury of an uncontrollable temper which generally broke out in disgusting abuse on the parade ground he was a passionate militarist and an amazing drillmaster he treated his polish army as a spoiled child treats a favourite toy except that he did not take it to bed with him at night it was not small enough for that but he played with it all day and every day delighting in the variety of pretty uniforms and in the fun of incessant drilling this childish passion not for war but for mere militarism achieved a desirable result the polish army in its equipment in its armament and in its battlefield efficiency as then understood became by the end of the year 1830 a firstrate tactical instrument polish peasantry not serfs served in the ranks by enlistment and the officers belonged mainly to the smaller nobility mr nicholas b with his napoleonic record had no difficulty in obtaining a lieutenancy but the promotion in the polish army was slow because being a separate organisation it took no part in the wars of the russian empire against persia or turkey its first campaign against russia itself was to be its last in 1831 on the outbreak of the revolution mr nicholas b was the senior captain of his regiment some time before he had been made head of the remount establishment quartered outside the kingdom in our southern provinces whence almost all the horses for the polish cavalry were drawn for the first time since he went away from home at the age of eighteen to begin his military life by the battle of friedland mr nicholas b breathed the air of the border his native air unkind fate was lying in wait for him amongst the scenes of his youth at the first news of the rising in warsaw all the remount establishment officers vets and the very troopers were put promptly under arrest and hurried off in a body beyond the dnieper to the nearest town in russia proper from there they were dispersed to the distant parts of the empire on this occasion poor mr nicholas b penetrated into russia much farther than he ever did in the times of napoleonic invasion if much less willingly astrakhan was his destination he remained there three years allowed to live at large in the town but having to report himself every day at noon to the military commandant who used to detain him frequently for a pipe and a chat it is difficult to form a just idea of what a chat with mr nicholas b could have been like there must have been much compressed rage under his taciturnity for the commandant communicated to him the news from the theatre of war and this news was such as it could be that is very bad for the poles mr nicholas b received these communications with outward phlegm but the russian showed a warm sympathy for his prisoner as a soldier myself i understand your feelings you of course would like to be in the thick of it by heavens i am fond of you if it were not for the terms of the military oath i would let you go on my own responsibility what difference could it make to us one more or less of you  at other times he wondered with simplicity  tell me nicholas stepanovitchmy greatgrandfathers name was stephen and the commandant used the russian form of polite addresstell me why is it that you poles are always looking for trouble what else could you expect from running up against russia  he was capable too of philosophical reflections  look at your napoleon now a great man there is no denying it that he was a great man as long as he was content to thrash those germans and austrians and all those nations but no he must go to russia looking for trouble and whats the consequence such as you see me i have rattled this sabre of mine on the pavements of paris  after his return to poland mr nicholas b described him as a worthy man but stupid whenever he could be induced to speak of the conditions of his exile declining the option offered him to enter the russian army he was retired with only half the pension of his rank his nephew my uncle and guardian told me that the first lasting impression on his memory as a child of four was the glad excitement reigning in his parents house on the day when mr nicholas b arrived home from his detention in russia  every generation has its memories the first memories of mr nicholas b might have been shaped by the events of the last partition of poland and he lived long enough to suffer from the last armed rising in 1863 an event which affected the future of all my generation and has coloured my earliest impressions his brother in whose house he had sheltered for some seventeen years his misanthropical timidity before the commonest problems of life having died in the early fifties mr nicholas b had to screw his courage up to the stickingpoint and come to some decision as to the future after a long and agonising hesitation he was persuaded at last to become the tenant of some fifteen hundred acres out of the estate of a friend in the neighbourhood the terms of the lease were very advantageous but the retired situation of the village and a plain comfortable house in good repair were i fancy the greatest inducements he lived there quietly for about ten years seeing very few people and taking no part in the public life of the province such as it could be under an arbitrary bureaucratic tyranny his character and his patriotism were above suspicion but the organisers of the rising in their frequent journeys up and down the province scrupulously avoided coming near his house it was generally felt that the repose of the old mans last years ought not to be disturbed even such intimates as my paternal grandfather a comradeinarms during napoleons moscow campaign and later on a fellowofficer in the polish army refrained from visiting his crony as the date of the outbreak approached my paternal grandfathers two sons and his only daughter were all deeply involved in the revolutionary work he himself was of that type of polish squire whose only ideal of patriotic action was to get into the saddle and drive them out but even he agreed that dear nicholas must not be worried all this considerate caution on the part of friends both conspirators and others did not prevent mr nicholas b being made to feel the misfortunes of that illomened year  less than fortyeight hours after the beginning of the rebellion in that part of the country a squadron of scouting cossacks passed through the village and invaded the homestead most of them remained formed between the house and the stables while several dismounting ransacked the various outbuildings the officer in command accompanied by two men walked up to the front door all the blinds on that side were down the officer told the servant who received him that he wanted to see his master he was answered that the master was away from home which was perfectly true  i follow here the tale as told afterwards by the servant to my granduncles friends and relatives and as i have heard it repeated  on receiving this answer the cossack officer who had been standing in the porch stepped into the house  where is the master gone then  our master went to j the government town some fifty miles off the day before yesterday  there are only two horses in the stables where are the others  our master always travels with his own horses meaning not by post he will be away a week or more he was pleased to mention to me that he had to attend to some business in the civil court  while the servant was speaking the officer looked about the hall there was a door facing him a door to the right and a door to the left the officer chose to enter the room on the left and ordered the blinds to be pulled up it was mr nicholas bs study with a couple of tall bookcases some pictures on the walls and so on besides the big centre table with books and papers there was a quite small writingtable with several drawers standing between the door and the window in a good light and at this table my granduncle usually sat either to read or write  on pulling up the blind the servant was startled by the discovery that the whole male population of the village was massed in front trampling down the flowerbeds there were also a few women amongst them he was glad to observe the village priest of the orthodox church coming up the drive the good man in his haste had tucked up his cassock as high as the top of his boots  the officer had been looking at the backs of the books in the bookcases then he perched himself on the edge of the centretable and remarked easily  your master did not take you to town with him then  i am the head servant and he leaves me in charge of the house its a strong young chap that travels with our master ifgod forbidthere was some accident on the road he would be of much more use than i  glancing through the window he saw the priest arguing vehemently in the thick of the crowd which seemed subdued by his interference three or four men however were talking with the cossacks at the door  and you dont think your master has gone to join the rebels maybeeh asked the officer  our master would be too old for that surely hes well over seventy and hes getting feeble too its some years now since hes been on horseback and he cant walk much either now  the officer sat there swinging his leg very quiet and indifferent by that time the peasants who had been talking with the cossack troopers at the door had been permitted to get into the hall one or two more left the crowd and followed them in they were seven in all and amongst them the blacksmith an exsoldier the servant appealed deferentially to the officer  wont your honour be pleased to tell the people to go back to their homes what do they want to push themselves into the house like this for its not proper for them to behave like this while our masters away and i am responsible for everything here  the officer only laughed a little and after a while inquired  have you any arms in the house  yes we have some old things  bring them all here on to this table  the servant made another attempt to obtain protection  wont your honour tell these chaps     but the officer looked at him in silence in such a way that he gave it up at once and hurried off to call the pantryboy to help him collect the arms meantime the officer walked slowly through all the rooms in the house examining them attentively but touching nothing the peasants in the hall fell back and took off their caps when he passed through he said nothing whatever to them when he came back to the study all the arms to be found in the house were lying on the table there was a pair of big flintlock holster pistols from napoleonic times two cavalry swords one of the french the other of the polish army pattern with a fowlingpiece or two  the officer opening the window flung out pistols swords and guns one after another and his troopers ran to pick them up the peasants in the hall encouraged by his manner had stolen after him into the study he gave not the slightest sign of being conscious of their existence and his business being apparently concluded strode out of the house without a word directly he left the peasants in the study put on their caps and began to smile at each other  the cossacks rode away passing through the yards of the home farm straight into the fields the priest still arguing with the peasants moved gradually down the drive and his earnest eloquence was drawing the silent mob after him away from the house this justice must be rendered to the parish priests of the greek church that strangers to the country as they were being all drawn from the interior of russia the majority of them used such influence as they had over their flocks in the cause of peace and humanity true to the spirit of their calling they tried to soothe the passions of the excited peasantry and opposed rapine and violence whenever they could with all their might and this conduct they pursued against the express wishes of the authorities later on some of them were made to suffer for this disobedience by being removed abruptly to the far north or sent away to siberian parishes  the servant was anxious to get rid of the few peasants who had got into the house what sort of conduct was that he asked them towards a man who was only a tenant had been invariably good and considerate to the villagers for years and only the other day had agreed to give up two meadows for the use of the village herd he reminded them too of mr nicholas bs devotion to the sick in the time of cholera every word of this was true and so far effective that the fellows began to scratch their heads and look irresolute the speaker then pointed at the window exclaiming look theres all your crowd going away quietly and you silly chaps had better go after them and pray god to forgive you your evil thoughts  this appeal was an unlucky inspiration in crowding clumsily to the window to see whether he was speaking the truth the fellows overturned the little writingtable as it fell over a chink of loose coin was heard theres money in that thing cried the blacksmith in a moment the top of the delicate piece of furniture was smashed and there lay exposed in a drawer eighty halfimperials gold coin was a rare sight in russia even at that time it put the peasants beside themselves there must be more of that in the house and we shall have it yelled the exsoldier blacksmith this is war time the others were already shouting out of the window urging the crowd to come back and help the priest abandoned suddenly at the gate flung his arms up and hurried away so as not to see what was going to happen  in their search for money that bucolic mob smashed everything in the house ripping with knives splitting with hatchets so that as the servant said there were no two pieces of wood holding together left in the whole house they broke some very fine mirrors all the windows and every piece of glass and china they threw the books and papers out on the lawn and set fire to the heap for the mere fun of the thing apparently absolutely the only one solitary thing which they left whole was a small ivory crucifix which remained hanging on the wall in the wrecked bedroom above a wild heap of rags broken mahogany and splintered boards which had been mr nicholas bs bedstead detecting the servant in the act of stealing away with a japanned tin box they tore it from him and because he resisted they threw him out of the diningroom window the house was on one floor but raised well above the ground and the fall was so serious that the man remained lying stunned till the cook and a stableboy ventured forth at dusk from their hidingplaces and picked him up by that time the mob had departed carrying off the tin box which they supposed to be full of paper money some distance from the house in the middle of a field they broke it open they found inside documents engrossed on parchment and the two crosses of the legion of honour and for valour at the sight of these objects which the blacksmith explained were marks of honour given only by the tsar they became extremely frightened at what they had done they threw the whole lot away into a ditch and dispersed hastily  on learning of this particular loss mr nicholas b broke down completely the mere sacking of his house did not seem to affect him much while he was still in bed from the shock the two crosses were found and returned to him it helped somewhat his slow convalescence but the tin box and the parchments though searched for in all the ditches around never turned up again he could not get over the loss of his legion of honour patent whose preamble setting forth his services he knew by heart to the very letter and after this blow volunteered sometimes to recite tears standing in his eyes the while its terms haunted him apparently during the last two years of his life to such an extent that he used to repeat them to himself this is confirmed by the remark made more than once by his old servant to the more intimate friends what makes my heart heavy is to hear our master in his room at night walking up and down and praying aloud in the french language  it must have been somewhat over a year afterwards that i saw mr nicholas b or more correctly that he saw me for the last time it was as i have already said at the time when my mother had a three months leave from exile which she was spending in the house of her brother and friends and relations were coming from far and near to do her honour it is inconceivable that mr nicholas b should not have been of the number the little child a few months old he had taken up in his arms on the day of his homecoming after years of war and exile was confessing her faith in national salvation by suffering exile in her turn i do not know whether he was present on the very day of our departure i have already admitted that for me he is more especially the man who in his youth had eaten roast dog in the depths of a gloomy forest of snowloaded pines my memory cannot place him in any remembered scene a hooked nose some sleek white hair an unrelated evanescent impression of a meagre slight rigid figure militarily buttoned up to the throat is all that now exists on earth of mr nicholas b only this vague shadow pursued by the memory of his grandnephew the last surviving human being i suppose of all those he had seen in the course of his taciturn life  but i remember well the day of our departure back to exile the elongated bizarre shabby travellingcarriage with four posthorses standing before the long front of the house with its eight columns four on each side of the broad flight of stairs on the steps groups of servants a few relations one or two friends from the nearest neighbourhood a perfect silence on all the faces an air of sober concentration my grandmother all in black gazing stoically my uncle giving his arm to my mother down to the carriage in which i had been placed already at the top of the flight my little cousin in a short skirt of a tartan pattern with a deal of red in it and like a small princess attended by the women of her own household the head gourvernante our dear corpulent francesca who had been for thirty years in the service of the b family the former nurse now outdoor attendant a handsome peasant face wearing a compassionate expression and the good ugly mlle durand the governess with her black eyebrows meeting over a short thick nose and a complexion like pale brown paper of all the eyes turned towards the carriage her goodnatured eyes only were dropping tears and it was her sobbing voice alone that broke the silence with an appeal to me noublie pas ton francais mon cheri in three months simply by playing with us she had taught me not only to speak french but to read it as well she was indeed an excellent playmate in the distance half way down to the great gates a light open trap harnessed with three horses in russian fashion stood drawn up on one side with the policecaptain of the district sitting in it the vizor of his flat cap with a red band pulled down over his eyes  it seems strange that he should have been there to watch our going so carefully without wishing to treat with levity the just timidities of imperialists all the world over i may allow myself the reflection that a woman practically condemned by the doctors and a small boy not quite six years old could not be regarded as seriously dangerous even for the largest of conceivable empires saddled with the most sacred of responsibilities and this good man i believe did not think so either  i learned afterwards why he was present on that day i dont remember any outward signs but it seems that about a month before my mother became so unwell that there was a doubt whether she could be made fit to travel in the time in this uncertainty the governorgeneral in kiev was petitioned to grant her a fortnights extension of stay in her brothers house no answer whatever was returned to this prayer but one day at dusk the policecaptain of the district drove up to the house and told my uncles valet who ran out to meet him that he wanted to speak with the master in private at once very much impressed he thought it was going to be an arrest the servant more dead than alive with fright as he related afterwards smuggled him through the big drawingroom which was dark that room was not lighted every evening on tiptoe so as not to attract the attention of the ladies in the house and led him by way of the orangery to my uncles private apartments  the policeman without any preliminaries thrust a paper into my uncles hands  there pray read this i have no business to show this paper to you it is wrong of me but i cant either eat or sleep with such a job hanging over me  that policecaptain a native of great russia had been for many years serving in the district  my uncle unfolded and read the document it was a service order issued from the governorgenerals secretariat dealing with the matter of the petition and directing the policecaptain to disregard all remonstrances and explanations in regard to that illness either from medical men or others and if she has not left her brothers houseit went on to sayon the morning of the day specified on her permit you are to despatch her at once under escort direct underlined to the prisonhospital in kiev where she will be treated as her case demands  for gods sake mr b see that your sister goes away punctually on that day dont give me this work to do with a womanand with one of your family too i simply cannot bear to think of it  he was absolutely wringing his hands my uncle looked at him in silence  thank you for this warning i assure you that even if she were dying she would be carried out to the carriage  yesindeedand what difference would it maketravel to kiev or back to her husband for she would have to godeath or no death and mind mr b i will be here on the day not that i doubt your promise but because i must i have got to duty all the same my trade is not fit for a dog since some of you poles will persist in rebelling and all of you have got to suffer for it  this is the reason why he was there in an open threehorse trap pulled up between the house and the great gates i regret not being able to give up his name to the scorn of all believers in the rights of conquest as a reprehensibly sensitive guardian of imperial greatness on the other hand i am in a position to state the name of the governorgeneral who signed the order with the marginal note to be carried out to the letter in his own handwriting the gentlemans name was bezak a high dignitary an energetic official the idol for a time of the russian patriotic press  each generation has its memories    chapter iv  it must not be supposed that in setting forth the memories of this halfhour between the moment my uncle left my room till we met again at dinner i am losing sight of almayers folly having confessed that my first novel was begun in idlenessa holiday taski think i have also given the impression that it was a muchdelayed book it was never dismissed from my mind even when the hope of ever finishing it was very faint many things came in its way daily duties new impressions old memories it was not the outcome of a needthe famous need of selfexpression which artists find in their search for motives the necessity which impelled me was a hidden obscure necessity a completely masked and unaccountable phenomenon or perhaps some idle and frivolous magician there must be magicians in london had cast a spell over me through his parlour window as i explored the maze of streets east and west in solitary leisurely walks without chart and compass till i began to write that novel i had written nothing but letters and not very many these i never made a note of a fact of an impression or of an anecdote in my life the conception of a planned book was entirely outside my mental range when i sat down to write the ambition of being an author had never turned up amongst these gracious imaginary existences one creates fondly for oneself at times in the stillness and immobility of a daydream yet it stands clear as the sun at noonday that from the moment i had done blackening over the first manuscript page of almayers folly it contained about two hundred words and this proportion of words to a page has remained with me through the fifteen years of my writing life from the moment i had in the simplicity of my heart and the amazing ignorance of my mind written that page the die was cast never had rubicon been more blindly forded without invocation to the gods without fear of men  that morning i got up from my breakfast pushing the chair back and rang the bell violently or perhaps i should say resolutely or perhaps i should say eagerly i do not know but manifestly it must have been a special ring of the bell a common sound made impressive like the ringing of a bell for the raising of the curtain upon a new scene it was an unusual thing for me to do generally i dawdled over my breakfast and i solemn took the trouble to ring the bell for the table to be cleared away but on that morning for some reason hidden in the general mysteriousness of the event i did not dawdle and yet i was not in a hurry i pulled the cord casually and while the faint tinkling somewhere down in the basement went on i charged my pipe in the usual way and i looked for the matchbox with glances distraught indeed but exhibiting i am ready to swear no signs of a fine frenzy i was composed enough to perceive after some considerable time the matchbox lying there on the mantelpiece right under my nose and all this was beautifully and safely usual before i had thrown down the match my landladys daughter appeared with her calm pale face and an inquisitive look in the doorway of late it was the landladys daughter who answered my bell i mention this little fact with pride because it proves that during the thirty or forty days of my tenancy i had produced a favourable impression for a fortnight past i had been spared the unattractive sight of the domestic slave the girls in that bessborough gardens house were often changed but whether short or long fair or dark they were always untidy and particularly bedraggled as if in a sordid version of the fairy tale the ashbin cat had been changed into a maid i was infinitely sensible of the privilege of being waited on by my landladys daughter she was neat if anaemic  will you please clear away all this at once i addressed her in convulsive accents being at the same time engaged in getting my pipe to draw this i admit was an unusual request generally on getting up from breakfast i would sit down in the window with a book and let them clear the table when they liked but if you think that on that morning i was in the least impatient you are mistaken i remember that i was perfectly calm as a matter of fact i was not at all certain that i wanted to write or that i meant to write or that i had anything to write about no i was not impatient i lounged between the mantelpiece and the window not even consciously waiting for the table to be cleared it was ten to one that before my landladys daughter was done i would pick up a book and sit down with it all the morning in a spirit of enjoyable indolence i affirm it with assurance and i dont even know now what were the books then lying about the room whatever they were they were not the works of great masters where the secret of clear thought and exact expression can be found since the age of five i have been a great reader as is not perhaps wonderful in a child who was never aware of learning to read at ten years of age i had read much of victor hugo and other romantics i had read in polish and in french history voyages novels i knew gil blas and don quixote in abridged editions i had read in early boyhood polish poets and some french poets but i cannot say what i read on the evening before i began to write myself i believe it was a novel and it is quite possible that it was one of anthony trollopes novels it is very likely my acquaintance with him was then very recent he is one of the english novelists whose works i read for the first time in english with men of european reputation with dickens and walter scott and thackeray it was otherwise my first introduction to english imaginative literature was nicholas nickleby it is extraordinary how well mrs nickleby could chatter disconnectedly in polish and the sinister ralph rage in that language as to the crummles family and the family of the learned squeers it seemed as natural to them as their native speech it was i have no doubt an excellent translation this must have been in the year 70 but i really believe that i am wrong that book was not my first introduction to english literature my first acquaintance was or were the two gentlemen of verona and that in the very ms of my fathers translation it was during our exile in russia and it must have been less than a year after my mothers death because i remember myself in the black blouse with a white border of my heavy mourning we were living together quite alone in a small house on the outskirts of the town of t that afternoon instead of going out to play in the large yard which we shared with our landlord i had lingered in the room in which my father generally wrote what emboldened me to clamber into his chair i am sure i dont know but a couple of hours afterwards he discovered me kneeling in it with my elbows on the table and my head held in both hands over the ms of loose pages i was greatly confused expecting to get into trouble he stood in the doorway looking at me with some surprise but the only thing he said after a moment of silence was  read the page aloud  luckily the page lying before me was not overblotted with erasures and corrections and my fathers handwriting was otherwise extremely legible when i got to the end he nodded and i flew out of doors thinking myself lucky to have escaped reproof for that piece of impulsive audacity i have tried to discover since the reason of this mildness and i imagine that all unknown to myself i had earned in my fathers mind the right to some latitude in my relations with his writingtable it was only a month before or perhaps it was only a week before that i had read to him aloud from beginning to end and to his perfect satisfaction as he lay on his bed not being very well at the time the proofs of his translation of victor hugos toilers of the sea such was my title to consideration i believe and also my first introduction to the sea in literature if i do not remember where how and when i learned to read i am not likely to forget the process of being trained in the art of reading aloud my poor father an admirable reader himself was the most exacting of masters i reflect proudly that i must have read that page of two gentlemen of verona tolerably well at the age of eight the next time i met them was in a 5s onevolume edition of the dramatic works of william shakespeare read in falmouth at odd moments of the day to the noisy accompaniment of caulkers mallets driving oakum into the deckseams of a ship in dry dock we had run in in a sinking condition and with the crew refusing duty after a month of weary battling with the gales of the north atlantic books are an integral part of ones life and my shakespearean associations are with that first year of our bereavement the last i spent with my father in exile he sent me away to poland to my mothers brother directly he could brace himself up for the separation and with the year of hard gales the year in which i came nearest to death at sea first by water and then by fire  those things i remember but what i was reading the day before my writing life began i have forgotten i have only a vague notion that it might have been one of trollopes political novels and i remember too the character of the day it was an autumn day with an opaline atmosphere a veiled semiopaque lustrous day with fiery points and flashes of red sunlight on the roofs and windows opposite while the trees of the square with all their leaves gone were like tracings of indian ink on a sheet of tissue paper it was one of those london days that have the charm of mysterious amenity of fascinating softness the effect of opaline mist was often repeated at bessborough gardens on account of the nearness to the river  there is no reason why i should remember that effect more on that day than on any other day except that i stood for a long time looking out of the window after the landladys daughter was gone with her spoil of cups and saucers i heard her put the tray down in the passage and finally shut the door and still i remained smoking with my back to the room it is very clear that i was in no haste to take the plunge into my writing life if as plunge this first attempt may be described my whole being was steeped deep in the indolence of a sailor away from the sea the scene of neverending labour and of unceasing duty for utter surrender to indolence you cannot beat a sailor ashore when that mood is on him the mood of absolute irresponsibility tasted to the full it seems to me that i thought of nothing whatever but this is an impression which is hardly to be believed at this distance of years what i am certain of is that i was very far from thinking of writing a story though it is possible and even likely that i was thinking of the man almayer  i had seen him for the first time some four years before from the bridge of a steamer moored to a rickety little wharf forty miles up more or less a bornean river it was very early morning and a slight mist an opaline mist as in bessborough gardens only without the fiery flicks on roof and chimneypot from the rays of the red london sun promised to turn presently into a woolly fog barring a small dugout canoe on the river there was nothing moving within sight i had just come up yawning from my cabin the serang and the malay crew were overhauling the cargo chains and trying the winches their voices sounded subdued on the deck below and their movements were languid that tropical daybreak was chilly the malay quartermaster coming up to get something from the lockers on the bridge shivered visibly the forests above and below and on the opposite bank looked black and dank wet dripped from the rigging upon the tightly stretched deck awnings and it was in the middle of a shuddering yawn that i caught sight of almayer he was moving across a patch of burnt grass a blurred shadowy shape with the blurred bulk of a house behind him a low house of mats bamboos and palmleaves with a highpitched roof of grass  he stepped upon the jetty he was clad simply in flapping pyjamas of cretonne pattern enormous flowers with yellow petals on a disagreeable blue ground and a thin cotton singlet with short sleeves his arms bare to the elbow were crossed on his chest his black hair looked as if it had not been cut for a very long time and a curly wisp of it strayed across his forehead i had heard of him at singapore i had heard of him on board i had heard of him early in the morning and late at night i had heard of him at tiffin and at dinner i had heard of him in a place called pulo laut from a halfcaste gentleman there who described himself as the manager of a coalmine which sounded civilised and progressive till you heard that the mine could not be worked at present because it was haunted by some particularly atrocious ghosts i had heard of him in a place called dongola in the island of celebes when the rajah of that littleknown seaport you can get no anchorage there in less than fifteen fathom which is extremely inconvenient came on board in a friendly way with only two attendants and drank bottle after bottle of sodawater on the afterskylight with my good friend and commander captain c at least i heard his name distinctly pronounced several times in a lot of talk in malay language oh yes i heard it quite distinctlyalmayer almayerand saw captain c smile while the fat dingy rajah laughed audibly to hear a malay rajah laugh outright is a rare experience i can assure you and i overhead more of almayers name amongst our deck passengers mostly wandering traders of good repute as they sat all over the shipeach man fenced round with bundles and boxeson mats on pillows on quilts on billets of wood conversing of island affairs upon my word i heard the mutter of almayers name faintly at midnight while making my way aft from the bridge to look at the patent taffraillog tinkling its quartermiles in the great silence of the sea i dont mean to say that our passengers dreamed aloud of almayer but it is indubitable that two of them at least who could not sleep apparently and were trying to charm away the trouble of insomnia by a little whispered talk at that ghostly hour were referring in some way or other to almayer it was really impossible on board that ship to get away definitely from almayer and a very small pony tied up forward and whisking its tail inside the galley to the great embarrassment of our chinaman cook was destined for almayer what he wanted with a pony goodness only knows since i am perfectly certain he could not ride it but here you have the man ambitious aiming at the grandiose importing a pony whereas in the whole settlement at which he used to shake daily his impotent fist there was only one path that was practicable for a pony a quarter of a mile at most hedged in by hundreds of square leagues of virgin forest but who knows the importation of that bali pony might have been part of some deep scheme of some diplomatic plan of some hopeful intrigue with almayer one could never tell he governed his conduct by considerations removed from the obvious by incredible assumptions which rendered his logic impenetrable to any reasonable person i learned all this later that morning seeing the figure in pyjamas moving in the mist i said to myself thats the man  he came quite close to the ships side and raised a harassed countenance round and flat with that curl of black hair over the forehead and a heavy pained glance  good morning  good morning  he looked hard at me i was a new face having just replaced the chief mate he was accustomed to see and i think that this novelty inspired him as things generally did with deepseated mistrust  didnt expect you in till this evening he remarked suspiciously  i dont know why he should have been aggrieved but he seemed to be i took pains to explain to him that having picked up the beacon at the mouth of the river just before dark and the tide serving captain c was enabled to cross the bar and there was nothing to prevent him going up river at night  captain c knows this river like his own pocket i concluded discursively trying to get on terms  better said almayer  leaning over the rail of the bridge i looked at almayer who looked down at the wharf in aggrieved thought he shuffled his feet a little he wore straw slippers with thick soles the morning fog had thickened considerably everything round us dripped the derricks the rails every single rope in the shipas if a fit of crying had come upon the universe  almayer again raised his head and in the accents of a man accustomed to the buffets of evil fortune asked hardly audibly  i suppose you havent got such a thing as a pony on board  i told him almost in a whisper for he attuned my communications to his minor key that we had such a thing as a pony and i hinted as gently as i could that he was confoundedly in the way too i was very anxious to have him landed before i began to handle the cargo almayer remained looking up at me for a long while with incredulous and melancholy eyes as though it were not a safe thing to believe my statement this pathetic mistrust in the favourable issue of any sort of affair touched me deeply and i added  he doesnt seem a bit the worse for the passage hes a nice pony too  almayer was not to be cheered up for all answer he cleared his throat and looked down again at his feet i tried to close with him on another tack  by jove i said arent you afraid of catching pneumonia or bronchitis or something walking about in a singlet in such a wet fog  he was not to be propitiated by a show of interest in his health his answer was a sinister no fear as much as to say that even that way of escape from inclement fortune was closed to him  i just came down    he mumbled after a while  well then now youre here i will land that pony for you at once and you can lead him home i really dont want him on deck hes in the way  almayer seemed doubtful i insisted  why i will just swing him out and land him on the wharf right in front of you id much rather do it before the hatches are off the little devil may jump down the hold or do some other deadly thing  theres a halter postulated almayer  yes of course theres a halter and without waiting any more i leaned over the bridge rail  serang land tuan almayers pony  the cook hastened to shut the door of the galley and a moment later a great scuffle began on deck the pony kicked with extreme energy the kalashes skipped out of the way the serang issued many orders in a cracked voice suddenly the pony leaped upon the forehatch his little hoofs thundered tremendously he plunged and reared he had tossed his mane and his forelock into a state of amazing wildness he dilated his nostrils bits of foam flecked his broad little chest his eyes blazed he was something under eleven hands he was fierce terrible angry warlike he said ha ha distinctly he raged and thumpedand sixteen ablebodied kalashes stood round him like disconcerted nurses round a spoilt and passionate child he whisked his tail incessantly he arched his pretty neck he was perfectly delightful he was charmingly naughty there was not an atom of vice in that performance no savage baring of teeth and lying back of ears on the contrary he pricked them forward in a comically aggressive manner he was totally unmoral and lovable i would have liked to give him bread sugar carrots but life is a stern thing and the sense of duty the only safe guide so i steeled my heart and from my elevated position on the bridge i ordered the men to fling themselves upon him in a body  the elderly serang emitting a strange inarticulate cry gave the example he was an excellent petty officervery competent indeed and a moderate opium smoker the rest of them in one great rush smothered that pony they hung on to his ears to his mane to his tail they lay in piles across his back seventeen in all the carpenter seizing the hook of the cargochain flung himself on top of them a very satisfactory petty officer too but he stuttered have you ever heard a lightyellow lean sad earnest chinaman stutter in pidginenglish its very weird indeed he made the eighteenth i could not see the pony at all but from the swaying and heaving of that heap of men i knew that there was something alive inside  from the wharf almayer hailed in quavering tones  oh i say  where he stood he could not see what was going on on deck unless perhaps the tops of the mens heads he could only hear the scuffle the mighty thuds as if the ship were being knocked to pieces i looked over what is it  dont let them break his legs he entreated me plaintively  oh nonsense hes all right now he cant move  by that time the cargochain had been hooked to the broad canvas belt round the ponys body the kalashes sprang off simultaneously in all directions rolling over each other and the worthy serang making a dash behind the winch turned the steam on  steady i yelled in great apprehension of seeing the animal snatched up to the very head of the derrick  on the wharf almayer shuffled his straw slippers uneasily the rattle of the winch stopped and in a tense impressive silence that pony began to swing across the deck  how limp he was directly he felt himself in the air he relaxed every muscle in a most wonderful manner his four hoofs knocked together in a bunch his head hung down and his tail remained pendent in a nerveless and absolute immobility he reminded me vividly of the pathetic little sheep which hangs on the collar of the order of the golden fleece i had no idea that anything in the shape of a horse could be so limp as that either living or dead his wild mane hung down lumpily a mere mass of inanimate horsehair his aggressive ears had collapsed but as he went swaying slowly across the front of the bridge i noticed an astute gleam in his dreamy halfclosed eye a trustworthy quartermaster his glance anxious and his mouth on the broad grin was easing over the derrick watchfully i superintended greatly interested  so that will do  the derrickhead stopped the kalashes lined the rail the rope of the halter hung perpendicular and motionless like a bellpull in front of almayer everything was very still i suggested amicably that he should catch hold of the rope and mind what he was about he extended a provokingly casual and superior hand  look out then lower away  almayer gathered in the rope intelligently enough but when the ponys hoofs touched the wharf he gave way all at once to a most foolish optimism without pausing without thinking almost without looking he disengaged the hook suddenly from the sling and the cargochain after hitting the ponys quarters swung back against the ships side with a noisy rattling slap i suppose i must have blinked i know i missed something because the next thing i saw was almayer lying flat on his back on the jetty he was alone  astonishment deprived me of speech long enough to give almayer time to pick himself up in a leisurely and painful manner the kalashes lining the rail had all their mouths open the mist flew in the light breeze and it had come over quite thick enough to hide the shore completely  how on earth did you manage to let him get away i asked scandalised  almayer looked into the smarting palm of his right hand but did not answer my inquiry  where do you think he will get to i cried are there any fences anywhere in this fog can he bolt into the forest whats to be done now  almayer shrugged his shoulders  some of my men are sure to be about they will get hold of him sooner or later  sooner or later thats all very fine but what about my canvas slinghes carried it off i want it now at once to land two celebes cows  since dongola we had on board a pair of the pretty little island cattle in addition to the pony tied up on the other side of the fore deck they had been whisking their tails into the other door of the galley these cows were not for almayer however they were invoiced to abdullah bin selim his enemy almayers disregard of my requisites was complete  if i were you i would try to find out where hes gone i insisted hadnt you better call your men together or something he will throw himself down and cut his knees he may even break a leg you know  but almayer plunged in abstracted thought did not seem to want that pony any more amazed at this sudden indifference i turned all hands out on shore to hunt for him on my own account or at any rate to hunt for the canvas sling which he had round his body the whole crew of the steamer with the exception of firemen and engineers rushed up the jetty past the thoughtful almayer and vanished from my sight the white fog swallowed them up and again there was a deep silence that seemed to extend for miles up and down the stream still taciturn almayer started to climb on board and i went down from the bridge to meet him on the after deck  would you mind telling the captain that i want to see him very particularly he asked me in a low tone letting his eyes stray all over the place  very well i will go and see  with the door of his cabin wide open captain c just back from the bathroom big and broadchested was brushing his thick damp irongrey hair with two large brushes  mr almayer told me he wanted to see you very particularly sir  saying these words i smiled i dont know why i smiled except that it seemed absolutely impossible to mention almayers name without a smile of a sort it had not to be necessarily a mirthful smile turning his head towards me captain c smiled too rather joylessly  the pony got away from himeh  yes sir he did  where is he  goodness only knows  no i mean almayer let him come along  the captains stateroom opening straight on deck under the bridge i had only to beckon from the doorway to almayer who had remained aft with downcast eyes on the very spot where i had left him he strolled up moodily shook hands and at once asked permission to shut the cabin door  i have a pretty story to tell you were the last words i heard the bitterness of tone was remarkable  i went away from the door of course for the moment i had no crew on board only the chinaman carpenter with a canvas bag hung round his neck and a hammer in his hand roamed about the empty decks knocking out the wedges of the hatches and dropping them into the bag conscientiously having nothing to do i joined our two engineers at the door of the engineroom it was near breakfast time  hes turned up early hasnt he commented the second engineer and smiled indifferently he was an abstemious man with a good digestion and a placid reasonable view of life even when hungry  yes i said shut up with the old man some very particular business  he will spin him a damned endless yarn observed the chief engineer  he smiled rather sourly he was dyspeptic and suffered from gnawing hunger in the morning the second smiled broadly a smile that made two vertical folds on his shaven cheeks and i smiled too but i was not exactly amused in that man whose name apparently could not be uttered anywhere in the malay archipelago without a smile there was nothing amusing whatever that morning he breakfasted with us silently looking mostly into his cup i informed him that my men came upon his pony capering in the fog on the very brink of the eightfootdeep well in which he kept his store of guttah the cover was off with no one near by and the whole of my crew just missed going heels over head into that beastly hole jurumudi itam our best quartermaster deft at fine needlework he who mended the ships flags and sewed buttons on our coats was disabled by a kick on the shoulder  both remorse and gratitude seemed foreign to almayers character he mumbled  do you mean that pirate fellow  what pirate fellow the man has been in the ship eleven years i said indignantly  its his looks almayer muttered for all apology  the sun had eaten up the fog from where we sat under the after awning we could see in the distance the pony tied up in front of almayers house to a post of the verandah we were silent for a long time all at once almayer alluding evidently to the subject of his conversation in the captains cabin exclaimed anxiously across the table  i really dont know what i can do now  captain c only raised his eyebrows at him and got up from his chair we dispersed to our duties but almayer half dressed as he was in his cretonne pyjamas and the thin cotton singlet remained on board lingering near the gangway as though he could not make up his mind whether to go home or stay with us for good our chinamen boys gave him side glances as they went to and fro and ah sing our young chief steward the handsomest and most sympathetic of chinamen catching my eye nodded knowingly at his burly back in the course of the morning i approached him for a moment  well mr almayer i addressed him easily you havent started on your letters yet  we had brought him his mail and he had held the bundle in his hand ever since we got up from breakfast he glanced at it when i spoke and for a moment it looked as if he were on the point of opening his fingers and letting the whole lot fall overboard i believe he was tempted to do so i shall never forget that man afraid of his letters  have you been long out from europe he asked me  not very not quite eight months i told him i left a ship in samarang with a hurt back and have been in the hospital in singapore some weeks  he sighed  trade is very bad here  indeed  hopeless    see these geese  with the hand holding the letters he pointed out to me what resembled a patch of snow creeping and swaying across the distant part of his compound it disappeared behind some bushes  the only geese on the east coast almayer informed me in a perfunctory mutter without a spark of faith hope or pride thereupon with the same absence of any sort of sustaining spirit he declared his intention to silence a fat bird and send him on board for us not later than next day  i had heard of these largesses before he conferred a goose as if it were a sort of court decoration given only to the tried friends of the house i had expected more pomp in the ceremony the gift had surely its special quality multiple and rare from the only flock on the east coast he did not make half enough of it that man did not understand his opportunities however i thanked him at some length  you see he interrupted abruptly in a very peculiar tone the worst of this country is that one is not able to realise    its impossible to realise    his voice sank into a languid mutter and when one has very large interests    very important interests    he finished faintly    up the river  we looked at each other he astonished me by giving a start and making a very queer grimace  well i must be off he burst out hurriedly so long  at the moment of stepping over the gangway he checked himself though to give me a mumbled invitation to dine at his house that evening with my captain an invitation which i accepted i dont think it could have been possible for me to refuse  i like the worthy folk who will talk to you of the exercise of free will at any rate for practical purposes free is it for practical purposes bosh how could i have refused to dine with that man i did not refuse simply because i could not refuse curiosity a healthy desire for a change of cooking common civility the talk and the smiles of the previous twenty days every condition of my existence at that moment and place made irresistibly for acceptance and crowning all that there was the ignorance the ignorance i say the fatal want of foreknowledge to counterbalance these imperative conditions of the problem a refusal would have appeared perverse and insane nobody unless a surly lunatic would have refused but if i had not got to know almayer pretty well it is almost certain there would never have been a line of mine in print  i accepted thenand i am paying yet the price of my sanity the possessor of the only flock of geese on the east coast is responsible for the existence of some fourteen volumes so far the number of geese he had called into being under adverse climatic conditions was considerably more than fourteen the tale of volumes will never overtake the counting of heads i am safe to say but my ambitions point not exactly that way and whatever the pangs the toil of writing has cost me i have always thought kindly of almayer  i wonder had he known anything of it what his attitude would have been this is something not to be discovered in this world but if we ever meet in the elysian fieldswhere i cannot depict him to myself otherwise than attended in the distance by his flock of geese birds sacred to jupiterand he addresses me in the stillness of that passionless region neither light nor darkness neither sound nor silence and heaving endlessly with billowy mists from the impalpable multitudes of the swarming dead i think i know what answer to make  i would say after listening courteously to the unvibrating tone of his measured remonstrances which should not disturb of course the solemn eternity of stillness in the leasti would say something like this  it is true almayer that in the world below i have converted your name to my own uses but that is a very small larceny whats in a name o shade if so much of your old mortal weakness clings to you yet as to make you feel aggrieved it was the note of your earthly voice almayer then i entreat you seek speech without delay with our sublime fellowshadewith him who in his transient existence as a poet commented upon the smell of the rose he will comfort you you came to me stripped of all prestige by mens queer smiles and the disrespectful chatter of every vagrant trader in the islands your name was the common property of the winds it as it were floated naked over the waters about the equator i wrapped round its unhonoured form the royal mantle of the tropics and have essayed to put into the hollow sound the very anguish of paternityfeats which you did not demand from mebut remember that all the toil and all the pain were mine in your earthly life you haunted me almayer consider that this was taking a great liberty since you were always complaining of being lost to the world you should remember that if i had not believed enough in your existence to let you haunt my rooms in bessborough gardens you would have been much more lost you affirm that had i been capable of looking at you with a more perfect detachment and a greater simplicity i might have perceived better the inward marvellousness which you insist attended your career upon that tiny pinpoint of light hardly visible far far below us where both our graves lie no doubt but reflect o complaining shade that this was not so much my fault as your crowning misfortune i believed in you in the only way it was possible for me to believe it was not worthy of your merits so be it but you were always an unlucky man almayer nothing was ever quite worthy of you what made you so real to me was that you held this lofty theory with some force of conviction and with an admirable consistency  it is with some such words translated into the proper shadowy expressions that i am prepared to placate almayer in the elysian abode of shades since it has come to pass that having parted many years ago we are never to meet again in this world    chapter v  in the career of the most unliterary of writers in the sense that literary ambition had never entered the world of his imagination the coming into existence of the first book is quite an inexplicable event in my own case i cannot trace it back to any mental or psychological cause which one could point out and hold to the greatest of my gifts being a consummate capacity for doing nothing i cannot even point to boredom as a rational stimulus for taking up a pen the pen at any rate was there and there is nothing wonderful in that everybody keeps a pen the cold steel of our days in his rooms in this enlightened age of penny stamps and halfpenny postcards in fact this was the epoch when by means of postcard and pen mr gladstone had made the reputation of a novel or two and i too had a pen rolling about somewherethe seldomused the reluctantlytakenup pen of a sailor ashore the pen rugged with the dried ink of abandoned attempts of answers delayed longer than decency permitted of letters begun with infinite reluctance and put off suddenly till next daytell next week as likely as not the neglected uncaredfor pen flung away at the slightest provocation and under the stress of dire necessity hunted for without enthusiasm in a perfunctory grumpy worry in the where the devil is the beastly thing gone to ungracious spirit where indeed it might have been reposing behind the sofa for a day or so my landladys anaemic daughter as ollendorff would have expressed it though commendably neat had a lordly careless manner of approaching her domestic duties or it might even be resting delicately poised on its point by the side of the tableleg and when picked up show a gaping inefficient beak which would have discouraged any man of literary instincts but not me never mind this will do  o days without guile if anybody had told me then that a devoted household having a generally exaggerated idea of my talents and importance would be put into a state of tremor and flurry by the fuss i would make because of a suspicion that somebody had touched my sacrosanct pen of authorship i would have never deigned as much as the contemptuous smile of unbelief there are imaginings too unlikely for any kind of notice too wild for indulgence itself too absurd for a smile perhaps had that seer of the future been a friend i should have been secretly saddened alas i would have thought looking at him with an unmoved face the poor fellow is going mad  i would have been without doubt saddened for in this world where the journalists read the signs of the sky and the wind of heaven itself blowing where it listeth does so under the prophetical management of the meteorological office but where the secret of human hearts cannot be captured either by prying or praying it was infinitely more likely that the sanest of my friends should nurse the germ of incipient madness than that i should turn into a writer of tales  to survey with wonder the changes of ones own self is a fascinating pursuit for idle hours the field is so wide the surprises so varied the subject so full of unprofitable but curious hints as to the work of unseen forces that one does not weary easily of it i am not speaking here of megalomaniacs who rest uneasy under the crown of their unbounded conceitwho really never rest in this world and when out of it go on fretting and fuming on the straitened circumstances of their last habitation where all men must lie in obscure equality neither am i thinking of those ambitious minds who always looking forward to some aim of aggrandisement can spare no time for a detached impersonal glance upon themselves  and thats a pity they are unlucky these two kinds together with the much larger band of the totally unimaginative of those unfortunate beings in whose empty and unseeing gaze as a great french writer has put it the whole universe vanishes into blank nothingness miss perhaps the true task of us men whose day is short on this earth the abode of conflicting opinions the ethical view of the universe involves us at last in so many cruel and absurd contradictions where the last vestiges of faith hope charity and even of reason itself seem ready to perish that i have come to suspect that the aim of creation cannot be ethical at all i would fondly believe that its object is purely spectacular a spectacle for awe love adoration or hate if you like but in this viewand in this view alonenever for despair those visions delicious or poignant are a moral end in themselves the rest is our affairthe laughter the tears the tenderness the indignation the high tranquillity of a steeled heart the detached curiosity of a subtle mindthats our affair and the unwearied selfforgetful attention to every phase of the living universe reflected in our consciousness may be our appointed task on this earth a task in which fate has perhaps engaged nothing of us except our conscience gifted with a voice in order to bear true testimony to the visible wonder the haunting terror the infinite passion and the illimitable serenity to the supreme law and the abiding mystery of the sublime spectacle  chi lo sa it may be true in this view there is room for every religion except for the inverted creed of impiety the mask and cloak of arid despair for every joy and every sorrow for every fair dream for every charitable hope the great aim is to remain true to the emotions called out of the deep encircled by the firmament of stars whose infinite numbers and awful distances may move us to laughter or tears was it the walrus or the carpenter in the poem who wept to see such quantities of sand or again to a properly steeled heart may matter nothing at all  the casual quotation which had suggested itself out of a poem full of merit leads me to remark that in the conception of a purely spectacular universe where inspiration of every sort has a rational existence the artist of every kind finds a natural place and amongst them the poet as the seer par excellence even the writer of prose who in his less noble and more toilsome task should be a man with the steeled heart is worthy of a place providing he looks on with undimmed eyes and keeps laughter out of his voice let who will laugh or cry yes even he the prose artist of fiction which after all is but truth often dragged out of a well and clothed in the painted robe of imaged phraseseven he has his place amongst kings demagogues priests charlatans dukes giraffes cabinet ministers fabians bricklayers apostles ants scientists kaffirs soldiers sailors elephants lawyers dandies microbes and constellations of a universe whose amazing spectacle is a moral end in itself  here i perceive speaking without offence the reader assuming a subtle expression as if the cat were out of the bag i take the novelists freedom to observe the readers mind formulating the exclamation thats it the fellow talks pro domo  indeed it was not the intention when i shouldered the bag i was not aware of the cat inside but after all why not the fair courtyards of the house of art are thronged by many humble retainers and there is no retainer so devoted as he who is allowed to sit on the doorstep the fellows who have got inside are apt to think too much of themselves this last remark i beg to state is not malicious within the definition of the law of libel its fair comment on a matter of public interest but never mind pro domo so be it for his house tant que vous voudrez and yet in truth i was by no means anxious to justify my existence the attempt would have been not only needless and absurd but almost inconceivable in a purely spectacular universe where no such disagreeable necessity can possibly arise it is sufficient for me to say and i am saying it at some length in these pages jai vecu i have existed obscure amongst the wonders and terrors of my time as the abbe sieyes the original utterer of the quoted words had managed to exist through the violences the crimes and the enthusiasms of the french revolution jai vecu as i apprehend most of us manage to exist missing all along the varied forms of destruction by a hairsbreadth saving my body thats clear and perhaps my soul also but not without some damage here and there to the fine edge of my conscience that heirloom of the ages of the race of the group of the family colourable and plastic fashioned by the words the looks the acts and even by the silences and abstentions surrounding ones childhood tinged in a complete scheme of delicate shades and crude colours by the inherited traditions beliefs or prejudicesunaccountable despotic persuasive and often in its texture romantic  and often romantic    the matter in hand however is to keep these reminiscences from turning into confessions a form of literary activity discredited by jean jacques rousseau on account of the extreme thoroughness he brought to the work of justifying his own existence for that such was his purpose is palpably even grossly visible to an unprejudiced eye but then you see the man was not a writer of fiction he was an artless moralist as is clearly demonstrated by his anniversaries being celebrated with marked emphasis by the heirs of the french revolution which was not a political movement at all but a great outburst of morality he had no imagination as the most casual perusal of emile will prove he was no novelist whose first virtue is the exact understanding of the limits traced by the reality of his time to the play of his invention inspiration comes from the earth which has a past a history a future not from the cold and immutable heaven a writer of imaginative prose even more than any other sort of artist stands confessed in his works his conscience his deeper sense of things lawful and unlawful gives him his attitude before the world indeed every one who puts pen to paper for the reading of strangers unless a moralist who generally speaking has no conscience except the one he is at pains to produce for the use of others can speak of nothing else it is m anatole france the most eloquent and just of french prose writers who says that we must recognise at last that failing the resolution to hold our peace we can only talk of ourselves  this remark if i remember rightly was made in the course of a sparring match with the late ferdinand brunetiere over the principles and rules of literary criticism as was fitting for a man to whom we owe the memorable saying the good critic is he who relates the adventures of his soul amongst masterpieces m anatole france maintained that there were no rules and no principles and that may be very true rules principles and standards die and vanish every day perhaps they are all dead and vanished by this time these if ever are the brave free days of destroyed landmarks while the ingenious minds are busy inventing the forms of the new beacons which it is consoling to think will be set up presently in the old places but what is interesting to a writer is the possession of an inward certitude that literary criticism will never die for man so variously defined is before everything else a critical animal and as long as distinguished minds are ready to treat it in the spirit of high adventure literary criticism shall appeal to us with all the charm and wisdom of a welltold tale of personal experience  for englishmen especially of all the races of the earth a task any task undertaken in an adventurous spirit acquires the merit of romance but the critics as a rule exhibit but little of an adventurous spirit they take risks of courseone can hardly live without that the daily bread is served out to us however sparingly with a pinch of salt otherwise one would get sick of the diet one prays for and that would be not only improper but impious from impiety of that or any other kindsave us an ideal of reserved manner adhered to from a sense of proprieties from shyness perhaps or caution or simply from weariness induces i suspect some writers of criticism to conceal the adventurous side of their calling and then the criticism becomes a mere notice as it were the relation of a journey where nothing but the distances and the geology of a new country should be set down the glimpses of strange beasts the dangers of flood and field the hairsbreadth escapes and the sufferings oh the sufferings too i have no doubt of the sufferings of the traveller being carefully kept out no shady spot no fruitful plant being ever mentioned either so that the whole performance looks like a mere feat of agility on the part of a trained pen running in a desert a cruel spectaclea most deplorable adventure life in the words of an immortal thinker of i should say bucolic origin but whose perishable name is lost to the worship of posteritylife is not all beer and skittles neither is the writing of novels it isnt really je vous donne ma parole dhonneur that itisnot not all i am thus emphatic because some years ago i remember the daughter of a general    sudden revelations of the profane world must have come now and then to hermits in their cells to the cloistered monks of middle ages to lonely sages men of science reformers the revelations of the worlds superficial judgment shocking to the souls concentrated upon their own bitter labour in the cause of sanctity or of knowledge or of temperance let us say or of art if only the art of cracking jokes or playing the flute and thus this generals daughter came to meor i should say one of the generals daughters did there were three of these bachelor ladies of nicely graduated ages who held a neighbouring farmhouse in a united and more or less military occupation the eldest warred against the decay of manners in the village children and executed frontal attacks upon the village mothers for the conquest of curtseys it sounds futile but it was really a war for an idea the second skirmished and scouted all over the country and it was that one who pushed a reconnaissance right to my very tablei mean the one who wore standup collars she was really calling upon my wife in the soft spirit of afternoon friendliness but with her usual martial determination she marched into my room swinging her stick    but noi mustnt exaggerate it is not my speciality i am not a humoristic writer in all soberness then all i am certain of is that she had a stick to swing  no ditch or wall encompassed my abode the window was open the door too stood open to that best friend of my work the warm still sunshine of the wide fields they lay around me infinitely helpful but truth to say i had not known for weeks whether the sun shone upon the earth and whether the stars above still moved on their appointed courses i was just then giving up some days of my allotted span to the last chapters of the novel nostromo a tale of an imaginary but true seaboard which is still mentioned now and again and indeed kindly sometimes in connection with the word failure and sometimes in conjunction with the word astonishing i have no opinion on this discrepancy its the sort of difference that can never be settled all i know is that for twenty months neglecting the common joys of life that fall to the lot of the humblest on this earth i had like the prophet of old wrestled with the lord for my creation for the headlands of the coast for the darkness of the placid gulf the light on the snows the clouds on the sky and for the breath of life that had to be blown into the shapes of men and women of latin and saxon of jew and gentile these are perhaps strong words but it is difficult to characterise otherwise the intimacy and the strain of a creative effort in which mind and will and conscience are engaged to the full hour after hour day after day away from the world and to the exclusion of all that makes life really lovable and gentlesomething for which a material parallel can only be found in the everlasting sombre stress of the westward winter passage round cape horn for that too is the wrestling of men with the might of their creator in a great isolation from the world without the amenities and consolations of life a lonely struggle under a sense of overmatched littleness for no reward that could be adequate but for the mere winning of a longitude yet a certain longitude once won cannot be disputed the sun and the stars and the shape of your earth are the witnesses of your gain whereas a handful of pages no matter how much you have made them your own are at best but an obscure and questionable spoil here they are failureastonishing take your choice or perhaps both or neithera mere rustle and flutter of pieces of paper settling down in the night and undistinguishable like the snowflakes of a great drift destined to melt away in the sunshine  how do you do  it was the greeting of the generals daughter i had heard nothingno rustle no footsteps i had felt only a moment before a sort of premonition of evil i had the sense of an inauspicious presencejust that much warning and no more and then came the sound of the voice and the jar as of a terrible fall from a great heighta fall let us say from the highest of the clouds floating in gentle procession over the fields in the faint westerly air of that july afternoon i picked myself up quickly of course in other words i jumped up from my chair stunned and dazed every nerve quivering with the pain of being uprooted out of one world and flung down into anotherperfectly civil  oh how do you do wont you sit down  thats what i said this horrible but i assure you perfectly true reminiscence tells you more than a whole volume of confessions a la jean jacques rousseau would do observe i didnt howl at her or start upsetting furniture or throw myself on the floor and kick or allow myself to hint in any other way at the appalling magnitude of the disaster the whole world of costaguana the country you may remember of my seaboard tale men women headlands houses mountains town campo there was not a single brick stone or grain of sand of its soil i had not placed in position with my own hands all the history geography politics finance the wealth of charles goulds silvermine and the splendour of the magnificent capataz de cargadores whose name cried out in the night dr monygham heard it pass over his headin linda violas voice dominated even after death the dark gulf containing his conquests of treasure and loveall that had come down crashing about my ears i felt i could never pick up the piecesand in that very moment i was saying wont you sit down  the sea is strong medicine behold what the quarterdeck training even in a merchant ship will do this episode should give you a new view of the english and scots seamen a muchcaricatured folk who had the last say in the formation of my character one is nothing if not modest but in this disaster i think i have done some honour to their simple teaching wont you sit down very fair very fair indeed she sat down her amused glance strayed all over the room there were pages of ms on the table and under the table a batch of typed copy on a chair single leaves had fluttered away into distant corners there were there living pages pages scored and wounded dead pages that would be burnt at the end of the daythe litter of a cruel battlefield of a long long and desperate fray long i suppose i went to bed sometimes and got up the same number of times yes i suppose i slept and ate the food put before me and talked connectedly to my household on suitable occasions but i had never been aware of the even flow of daily life made easy and noiseless for me by a silent watchful tireless affection indeed it seemed to me that i had been sitting at that table surrounded by the litter of a desperate fray for days and nights on end it seemed so because of the intense weariness of which that interruption had made me awarethe awful disenchantment of a mind realising suddenly the futility of an enormous task joined to a bodily fatigue such as no ordinary amount of fairly heavy physical labour could ever account for i have carried bags of wheat on my back bent almost double under a ships deckbeams from six in the morning till six in the evening with an hour and a half off for meals so i ought to know  and i love letters i am jealous of their honour and concerned for the dignity and comeliness of their service i was most likely the only writer that neat lady had ever caught in the exercise of his craft and it distressed me not to be able to remember when it was that i dressed myself last and how no doubt that would be all right in essentials the fortune of the house included a pair of greyblue watchful eyes that would see to that but i felt somehow as grimy as a costaguana lepero after a days fighting in the streets rumpled all over and dishevelled down to my very heels and i am afraid i blinked stupidly all this was bad for the honour of letters and the dignity of their service seen indistinctly through the dust of my collapsed universe the good lady glanced about the room with a slightly amused serenity and she was smiling what on earth was she smiling at she remarked casually  i am afraid i interrupted you  not at all  she accepted the denial in perfect good faith and it was strictly true interruptedindeed she had robbed me of at least twenty lives each infinitely more poignant and real than her own because informed with passion possessed of convictions involved in great affairs created out of my own substance for an anxiously meditated end  she remained silent for a while then said with a last glance all round at the litter of the fray  and you sit like this here writing youryour     iwhat oh yes i sit here all day  it must be perfectly delightful  i suppose that being no longer very young i might have been on the verge of having a stroke but she had left her dog in the porch and my boys dog patrolling the field in front had espied him from afar he came on straight and swift like a cannonball and the noise of the fight which burst suddenly upon our ears was more than enough to scare away a fit of apoplexy we went out hastily and separated the gallant animals afterwards i told the lady where she would find my wifejust round the corner under the trees she nodded and went off with her dog leaving me appalled before the death and devastation she had lightly madeand with the awfully instructive sound of the word delightful lingering in my ears  nevertheless later on i duly escorted her to the field gate i wanted to be civil of course what are twenty lives in a mere novel that one should be rude to a lady on their account but mainly to adopt the good sound ollendorffian style because i did not want the dog of the generals daughter to fight again encore with the faithful dog of my infant son mon petit garconwas i afraid that the dog of the generals daughter would be able to overcome vaincre the dog of my childno i was not afraid    but away with the ollendorff method however appropriate and seemingly unavoidable when i touch upon anything appertaining to the lady it is most unsuitable to the origin character and history of the dog for the dog was the gift to the child from a man for whom words had anything but an ollendorffian value a man almost childlike in the impulsive movements of his untutored genius the most singleminded of verbal impressionists using his great gifts of straight feeling and right expression with a fine sincerity and a strong if perhaps not fully conscious conviction his art did not obtain i fear all the credit its unsophisticated inspiration deserved i am alluding to the late stephen crane the author of the red badge of courage a work of imagination which found its short moment of celebrity in the last decade of the departed century other books followed not many he had not the time it was an individual and complete talent which obtained but a grudging somewhat supercilious recognition from the world at large for himself one hesitates to regret his early death like one of the men in his open boat one felt that he was of those whom fate seldom allows to make a safe landing after much toil and bitterness at the oar i confess to an abiding affection for that energetic slight fragile intensely living and transient figure he liked me even before we met on the strength of a page or two of my writing and after we had met i am glad to think he liked me still he used to point out to me with great earnestness and even with some severity that a boy ought to have a dog i suspect that he was shocked at my neglect of parental duties ultimately it was he who provided the dog shortly afterwards one day after playing with the child on the rug for an hour or so with the most intense absorption he raised his head and declared firmly i shall teach your boy to ride that was not to be he was not given the time  but here is the dogan old dog now broad and low on his bandy paws with a black head on a white body and a ridiculous black spot at the other end of him he provokes when he walks abroad smiles not altogether unkind grotesque and engaging in the whole of his appearance his usual attitudes are meek but his temperament discloses itself unexpectedly pugnacious in the presence of his kind as he lies in the firelight his head well up and a fixed faraway gaze directed at the shadows of the room he achieves a striking nobility of pose in the calm consciousness of an unstained life he has brought up one baby and now after seeing his first charge off to school he is bringing up another with the same conscientious devotion but with a more deliberate gravity of manner the sign of greater wisdom and riper experience but also of rheumatism i fear from the morning bath to the evening ceremonies of the cot you attend old friend the little twolegged creature of your adoption being yourself treated in the exercise of your duties with every possible regard with infinite consideration by every person in the houseeven as i myself am treated only you deserve it more the generals daughter would tell you that it must be perfectly delightful  aha old dog she never heard you yelp with acute pain its that poor left ear the while with incredible selfcommand you preserve a rigid immobility for fear of overturning the little twolegged creature she has never seen your resigned smile when the little twolegged creature interrogated sternly what are you doing to the good dog answers with a wide innocent stare nothing only loving him mamma dear  the generals daughter does not know the secret terms of selfimposed tasks good dog the pain that may lurk in the very rewards of rigid selfcommand but we have lived together many years we have grown older too and though our work is not quite done yet we may indulge now and then in a little introspection before the firemeditate on the art of bringing up babies and on the perfect delight of writing tales where so many lives come and go at the cost of one which slips imperceptibly away   chapter vi  in the retrospect of a life which had besides its preliminary stage of childhood and early youth two distinct developments and even two distinct elements such as earth and water for its successive scenes a certain amount of naiveness is unavoidable i am conscious of it in these pages this remark is put forward in no apologetic spirit as years go by and the number of pages grows steadily the feeling grows upon one too that one can write only for friends then why should one put them to the necessity of protesting as a friend would do that no apology is necessary or put perchance into their heads the doubt of ones discretion so much as to the care due to those friends whom a word here a line there a fortunate page of just feeling in the right place some happy simplicity or even some lucky subtlety has drawn from the great multitude of fellowbeings even as a fish is drawn from the depths of the sea fishing is notoriously i am talking now of the deep sea a matter of luck as to ones enemies those will take care of themselves  there is a gentleman for instance who metaphorically speaking jumps upon me with both feet this image has no grace but it is exceedingly apt to the occasionto the several occasions i dont know precisely how long he had been indulging in that intermittent exercise whose seasons are ruled by the custom of the publishing trade somebody pointed him out in printed shape of course to my attention some time ago and straightway i experienced a sort of reluctant affection for that robust man he leaves not a shred of my substance untrodden for the writers substance is his writing the rest of him is but a vain shadow cherished or hated on uncritical grounds not a shred yet the sentiment owned to is not a freak of affectation or perversity it has a deeper and i venture to think a more estimable origin than the caprice of emotional lawlessness it is indeed lawful in so much that it is given reluctantly for a consideration for several considerations there is that robustness for instance so often the sign of good moral balance thats a consideration it is not indeed pleasant to be stamped upon but the very thoroughness of the operation implying not only a careful reading but some real insight into work whose qualities and defects whatever they may be are not so much on the surface is something to be thankful for in view of the fact that it may happen to ones work to be condemned without being read at all this is the most fatuous adventure that can well happen to a writer venturing his soul amongst criticisms it can do one no harm of course but it is disagreeable it is disagreeable in the same way as discovering a threecardtrick man amongst a decent lot of folk in a thirdclass compartment the open impudence of the whole transaction appealing insidiously to the folly and credulity of mankind the brazen shameless patter proclaiming the fraud openly while insisting on the fairness of the game give one a feeling of sickening disgust the honest violence of a plain man playing a fair game fairlyeven if he means to knock you overmay appear shocking but it remains within the pale of decency damaging as it may be it is in no sense offensive one may well feel some regard for honesty even if practised upon ones own vile body but it is very obvious that an enemy of that sort will not be stayed by explanations or placated by apologies were i to advance the plea of youth in excuse of the naiveness to be found in these pages he would be likely to say bosh in a column and a half of fierce print yet a writer is no older than his first published book and notwithstanding the vain appearances of decay which attend us in this transitory life i stand here with the wreath of only fifteen short summers on my brow  with the remark then that at such tender age some naiveness of feeling and expression is excusable i proceed to admit that upon the whole my previous state of existence was not a good equipment for a literary life perhaps i should not have used the word literary that word presupposes an intimacy of acquaintance with letters a turn of mind and a manner of feeling to which i dare lay no claim i only love letters but the love of letters does not make a literary man any more than the love of the sea makes a seaman and it is very possible too that i love the letters in the same way a literary man may love the sea he looks at from the shorea scene of great endeavour and of great achievements changing the face of the world the great open way to all sorts of undiscovered countries no perhaps i had better say that the life at seaand i dont mean a mere taste of it but a good broad span of years something that really counts as real serviceis not upon the whole a good equipment for a writing life god forbid though that i should be thought of as denying my masters of the quarterdeck i am not capable of that sort of apostasy i have confessed my attitude of piety towards their shades in three or four tales and if any man on earth more than another needs to be true to himself as he hopes to be saved it is certainly the writer of fiction  what i meant to say simply is that the quarterdeck training does not prepare one sufficiently for the reception of literary criticism only that and no more but this defect is not without gravity if it be permissible to twist invert adapt and spoil m anatole frances definition of a good critic then let us say that the good author is he who contemplates without marked joy or excessive sorrow the adventures of his soul amongst criticisms far be from me the intention to mislead an attentive public into the belief that there is no criticism at sea that would be dishonest and even impolite everything can be found at sea according to the spirit of your queststrife peace romance naturalism of the most pronounced kind ideals boredom disgust inspirationand every conceivable opportunity including the opportunity to make a fool of yourselfexactly as in the pursuit of literature but the quarterdeck criticism is somewhat different from literary criticism this much they have in common that before the one and the other the answering back as a general rule does not pay  yes you find criticism at sea and even appreciationi tell you everything is to be found on salt watercriticism generally impromptu and always viva voce which is the outward obvious difference from the literary operation of that kind with consequent freshness and vigour which may be lacking in the printed word with appreciation which comes at the end when the critic and the criticised are about to part it is otherwise the sea appreciation of ones humble talents has the permanency of the written word seldom the charm of variety is formal in its phrasing there the literary master has the superiority though he too can in effect but sayand often says it in the very phrasei can highly recommend only usually he uses the word we there being some occult virtue in the first person plural which makes it specially fit for critical and royal declarations i have a small handful of these sea appreciations signed by various masters yellowing slowly in my writingtables lefthand drawer rustling under my reverent touch like a handful of dry leaves plucked for a tender memento from the tree of knowledge strange it seems that it is for these few bits of paper headed by the names of a few ships and signed by the names of a few scots and english shipmasters that i have faced the astonished indignations the mockeries and the reproaches of a sort hard to bear for a boy of fifteen that i have been charged with the want of patriotism the want of sense and the want of heart too that i went through agonies of selfconflict and shed secret tears not a few and had the beauties of the furca pass spoiled for me and have been called an incorrigible don quixote in allusion to the bookborn madness of the knight for that spoil they rustle those bits of papersome dozen of them in all in that faint ghostly sound there live the memories of twenty years the voices of rough men now no more the strong voice of the everlasting winds and the whisper of a mysterious spell the murmur of the great sea which must have somehow reached my inland cradle and entered my unconscious ear like that formula of mohammedan faith the mussulman father whispers into the ear of his newborn infant making him one of the faithful almost with his first breath i do not know whether i have been a good seaman but i know i have been a very faithful one and after all there is that handful of characters from various ships to prove that all these years have not been altogether a dream there they are brief and monotonous in tone but as suggestive bits of writing to me as any inspired page to be found in literature but then you see i have been called romantic well that cant be helped but stay i seem to remember that i have been called a realist also and as that charge too can be made out let us try to live up to it at whatever cost for a change with this end in view i will confide to you coyly and only because there is no one about to see my blushes by the light of the midnight lamp that these suggestive bits of quarterdeck appreciation one and all contain the words strictly sober  did i overhear a civil murmur thats very gratifying to be sure well yes it is gratifyingthank you it is at least as gratifying to be certified sober as to be certified romantic though such certificates would not qualify one for the secretaryship of a temperance association or for the post of official troubadour to some lordly democratic institution such as the london county council for instance the above prosaic reflection is put down here only in order to prove the general sobriety of my judgment in mundane affairs i make a point of it because a couple of years ago a certain short story of mine being published in a french translation a parisian critici am almost certain it was m gustave kahn in the gilblasgiving me a short notice summed up his rapid impression of the writers quality in the words un puissant reveur so be it who would cavil at the words of a friendly reader yet perhaps not such an unconditional dreamer as all that i will make bold to say that neither at sea nor ashore have i ever lost the sense of responsibility there is more than one sort of intoxication even before the most seductive reveries i have remained mindful of that sobriety of interior life that asceticism of sentiment in which alone the naked form of truth such as one conceives it such as one feels it can be rendered without shame it is but a maudlin and indecent verity that comes out through the strength of wine i have tried to be a sober worker all my lifeall my two lives i did so from taste no doubt having an instinctive horror of losing my sense of full selfpossession but also from artistic conviction yet there are so many pitfalls on each side of the true path that having gone some way and feeling a little battered and weary as a middleaged traveller will from the mere daily difficulties of the march i ask myself whether i have kept always always faithful to that sobriety wherein there is power and truth and peace  as to my seasobriety that is quite properly certified under the signmanual of several trustworthy shipmasters of some standing in their time i seem to hear your polite murmur that surely this might have been taken for granted well no it might not have been that august academical body the marine department of the board of trade takes nothing for granted in the granting of its learned degrees by its regulations issued under the first merchant shipping act the very word sober must be written or a whole sackful a ton a mountain of the most enthusiastic appreciation will avail you nothing the door of the examination rooms shall remain closed to your tears and entreaties the most fanatical advocate of temperance could not be more pitilessly fierce in his rectitude than the marine department of the board of trade as i have been face to face at various times with all the examiners of the port of london in my generation there can be no doubt as to the force and the continuity of my abstemiousness three of them were examiners in seamanship and it was my fate to be delivered into the hands of each of them at proper intervals of sea service the first of all tall spare with a perfectly white head and moustache a quiet kindly manner and an air of benign intelligence must i am forced to conclude have been unfavourably impressed by something in my appearance his old thin hands loosely clasped resting on his crossed legs he began by an elementary question in a mild voice and went on went on    it lasted for hours for hours had i been a strange microbe with potentialities of deadly mischief to the merchant service i could not have been submitted to a more microscopic examination greatly reassured by his apparent benevolence i had been at first very alert in my answers but at length the feeling of my brain getting addled crept upon me and still the passionless process went on with a sense of untold ages having been spent already on mere preliminaries then i got frightened i was not frightened of being plucked that eventuality did not even present itself to my mind it was something much more serious and weird this ancient person i said to myself terrified is so near his grave that he must have lost all notion of time he is considering this examination in terms of eternity it is all very well for him his race is run but i may find myself coming out of this room into the world of men a stranger friendless forgotten by my very landlady even were i able after this endless experience to remember the way to my hired home this statement is not so much of a verbal exaggeration as may be supposed some very queer thoughts passed through my head while i was considering my answers thoughts which had nothing to do with seamanship nor yet with anything reasonable known to this earth i verily believe that at times i was lightheaded in a sort of languid way at last there fell a silence and that too seemed to last for ages while bending over his desk the examiner wrote out my passslip slowly with a noiseless pen he extended the scrap of paper to me without a word inclined his white head gravely to my parting bow     when i got out of the room i felt limply flat like a squeezed lemon and the doorkeeper in his glass cage where i stopped to get my hat and tip him a shilling said  well i thought you were never coming out  how long have i been in there i asked faintly  he pulled out his watch  he kept you sir just under three hours i dont think this ever happened with any of the gentlemen before  it was only when i got out of the building that i began to walk on air and the human animal being averse from change and timid before the unknown i said to myself that i would not mind really being examined by the same man on a future occasion but when the time of ordeal came round again the doorkeeper let me into another room with the now familiar paraphernalia of models of ships and tackle a board for signals on the wall a big long table covered with official forms and having an unrigged mast fixed to the edge the solitary tenant was unknown to me by sight though not by reputation which was simply execrable short and sturdy as far as i could judge clad in an old brown morningsuit he sat leaning on his elbow his hand shading his eyes and half averted from the chair i was to occupy on the other side of the table he was motionless mysterious remote enigmatical with something mournful too in the pose like that statue of giuliano i think de medici shading his face on the tomb by michael angelo though of course he was far far from being beautiful he began by trying to make me talk nonsense but i had been warned of that fiendish trait and contradicted him with great assurance after a while he left off so far good but his immobility the thick elbow on the table the abrupt unhappy voice the shaded and averted face grew more and more impressive he kept inscrutably silent for a moment and then placing me in a ship of a certain size at sea under certain conditions of weather season locality c call very clear and preciseordered me to execute a certain manoeuvre before i was half through with it he did some material damage to the ship directly i had grappled with the difficulty he caused another to present itself and when that too was met he stuck another ship before me creating a very dangerous situation i felt slightly outraged by this ingenuity in piling up trouble upon a man  i wouldnt have got into that mess i suggested mildly i could have seen that ship before  he never stirred the least bit  no you couldnt the weathers thick  oh i didnt know i apologised blankly  i suppose that after all i managed to stave off the smash with sufficient approach to verisimilitude and the ghastly business went on you must understand that the scheme of the test he was applying to me was i gathered a homeward passagethe sort of passage i would not wish to my bitterest enemy that imaginary ship seemed to labour under a most comprehensive curse its no use enlarging on these neverending misfortunes suffice it to say that long before the end i would have welcomed with gratitude an opportunity to exchange into the flying dutchman finally he shoved me into the north sea i suppose and provided me with a leeshore with outlying sandbanksthe dutch coast presumably distance eight miles the evidence of such implacable animosity deprived me of speech for quite half a minute  well he saidfor our pace had been very smart indeed till then  i will have to think a little sir  doesnt look as if there were much time to think he muttered sardonically from under his hand  no sir i said with some warmth not on board a ship i could see but so many accidents have happened that i really cant remember what theres left for me to work with  still half averted and with his eyes concealed he made unexpectedly a grunting remark  youve done very well  have i the two anchors at the bow sir i asked  yes  i prepared myself then as a last hope for the ship to let them both go in the most effectual manner when his infernal system of testing resourcefulness came into play again  but theres only one cable youve lost the other  it was exasperating  then i would back them if i could and tail the heaviest hawser on board on the end of the chain before letting go and if she parted from that which is quite likely i would just do nothing she would have to go  nothing more to do eh  no sir i could do no more  he gave a bitter halflaugh  you could always say your prayers  he got up stretched himself and yawned slightly it was a sallow strong unamiable face he put me in a surly bored fashion through the usual questions as to lights and signals and i escaped from the room thankfullypassed forty minutes and again i walked on air along tower hill where so many good men had lost their heads because i suppose they were not resourceful enough to save them and in my heart of hearts i had no objection to meeting that examiner once more when the third and last ordeal became due in another year or so i even hoped i should i knew the worst of him now and forty minutes is not an unreasonable time yes i distinctly hoped    but not a bit of it when i presented myself to be examined for master the examiner who received me was short plump with a round soft face in grey fluffy whiskers and fresh loquacious lips  he commenced operations with an easygoing lets see hm suppose you tell me all you know of charterparties he kept it up in that style all through wandering off in the shape of comment into bits out of his own life then pulling himself up short and returning to the business in hand it was very interesting whats your idea of a juryrudder now he queried suddenly at the end of an instructive anecdote bearing upon a point of stowage  i warned him that i had no experience of a lost rudder at sea and gave him two classical examples of makeshifts out of a textbook in exchange he described to me a juryrudder he had invented himself years before when in command of a 3000ton steamer it was i declare the cleverest contrivance imaginable may be of use to you some day he concluded you will go into steam presently everybody goes into steam  there he was wrong i never went into steamnot really if i only live long enough i shall become a bizarre relic of a dead barbarism a sort of monstrous antiquity the only seaman of the dark ages who had never gone into steamnot really  before the examination was over he imparted to me a few interesting details of the transport service in the time of the crimean war  the use of wire rigging became general about that time too he observed i was a very young master then that was before you were born  yes sir i am of the year 1857  the mutiny year he commented as if to himself adding in a louder tone that his ship happened then to be in the gulf of bengal employed under a government charter  clearly the transport service had been the making of this examiner who so unexpectedly had given me an insight into his existence awakening in me the sense of the continuity of that sealife into which i had stepped from outside giving a touch of human intimacy to the machinery of official relations i felt adopted his experience was for me too as though he had been an ancestor  writing my long name it has twelve letters with laborious care on the slip of blue paper he remarked  you are of polish extraction  born there sir  he laid down the pen and leaned back to look at me as it were for the first time  not many of your nationality in our service i should think i never remember meeting one either before or after i left the sea dont remember ever hearing of one an inland people arent you  i said yesvery much so we were remote from the sea not only by situation but also from a complete absence of indirect association not being a commercial nation at all but purely agricultural he made then the quaint reflection that it was a long way for me to come out to begin a sealife as if sealife were not precisely a life in which one goes a long way from home  i told him smiling that no doubt i could have found a ship much nearer my native place but i had thought to myself that if i was to be a seaman then i would be a british seaman and no other it was a matter of deliberate choice  he nodded slightly at that and as he kept on looking at me interrogatively i enlarged a little confessing that i had spent a little time on the way in the mediterranean and in the west indies i did not want to present myself to the british merchant service in an altogether green state it was no use telling him that my mysterious vocation was so strong that my very wild oats had to be sown at sea it was the exact truth but he would not have understood the somewhat exceptional psychology of my seagoing i fear  i suppose youve never come across one of your countrymen at sea have you now  i admitted i never had the examiner had given himself up to the spirit of gossiping idleness for myself i was in no haste to leave that room not in the least the era of examinations was over i would never again see that friendly man who was a professional ancestor a sort of grandfather in the craft moreover i had to wait till he dismissed me and of that there was no sign as he remained silent looking at me i added  but i have heard of one some years ago he seems to have been a boy serving his time on board a liverpool ship if i am not mistaken  what was his name  i told him  how did you say that he asked puckering up his eyes at the uncouth sound  i repeated the name very distinctly  how do you spell it  i told him he moved his head at the impracticable nature of that name and observed  its quite as long as your ownisnt it  there was no hurry i had passed for master and i had all the rest of my life before me to make the best of it that seemed a long time i went leisurely through a small mental calculation and said  not quite shorter by two letters sir  is it the examiner pushed the signed blue slip across the table to me and rose from his chair somehow this seemed a very abrupt ending of our relations and i felt almost sorry to part from that excellent man who was master of a ship before the whisper of the sea had reached my cradle he offered me his hand and wished me well he even made a few steps towards the door with me and ended with goodnatured advice  i dont know what may be your plans but you ought to go into steam when a man has got his masters certificate its the proper time if i were you i would go into steam  i thanked him and shut the door behind me definitely on the era of examinations but that time i did not walk on air as on the first two occasions i walked across the hill of many beheadings with measured steps it was a fact i said to myself that i was now a british master mariner beyond a doubt it was not that i had an exaggerated sense of that very modest achievement with which however luck opportunity or any extraneous influence could have had nothing to do that fact satisfactory and obscure in itself had for me a certain ideal significance it was an answer to certain outspoken scepticism and even to some not very kind aspersions i had vindicated myself from what had been cried upon as a stupid obstinacy or a fantastic caprice i dont mean to say that a whole country had been convulsed by my desire to go to sea but for a boy between fifteen and sixteen sensitive enough in all conscience the commotion of his little world had seemed a very considerable thing indeed so considerable that absurdly enough the echoes of it linger to this day i catch myself in hours of solitude and retrospect meeting arguments and charges made thirtyfive years ago by voices now for ever still finding things to say that an assailed boy could not have found simply because of the mysteriousness of his impulses to himself i understood no more than the people who called upon me to explain myself there was no precedent i verily believe mine was the only case of a boy of my nationality and antecedents taking a so to speak standing jump out of his racial surroundings and associations for you must understand that there was no idea of any sort of career in my call of russia or germany there could be no question the nationality the antecedents made it impossible the feeling against the austrian service was not so strong and i dare say there would have been no difficulty in finding my way into the naval school at pola it would have meant six months extra grinding at german perhaps but i was not past the age of admission and in other respects i was well qualified this expedient to palliate my folly was thought ofbut not by me i must admit that in that respect my negative was accepted at once that order of feeling was comprehensible enough to the most inimical of my critics i was not called upon to offer explanations the truth is that what i had in view was not a naval career but the sea there seemed no way open to it but through france i had the language at any rate and of all the countries in europe it is with france that poland has most connection there were some facilities for having me a little looked after at first letters were being written answers were being received arrangements were being made for my departure for marseilles where an excellent fellow called solary got at in a roundabout fashion through various french channels had promised goodnaturedly to put le jeune homme in the way of getting a decent ship for his first start if he really wanted a taste of ce metier de chien  i watched all these preparations gratefully and kept my own counsel but what i told the last of my examiners was perfectly true already the determined resolve that if a seaman then an english seaman was formulated in my head though of course in the polish language i did not know six words of english and i was astute enough to understand that it was much better to say nothing of my purpose as it was i was already looked upon as partly insane at least by the more distant acquaintances the principal thing was to get away i put my trust in the goodnatured solarys very civil letter to my uncle though i was shocked a little by the phrase about the metier de chien  this solary baptistin when i beheld him in the flesh turned out a quite young man very goodlooking with a fine black short beard a fresh complexion and soft merry black eyes he was as jovial and goodnatured as any boy could desire i was still asleep in my room in a modest hotel near the quays of the old port after the fatigues of the journey via vienna zurich lyons when he burst in flinging the shutters open to the sun of provence and chiding me boisterously for lying abed how pleasantly he startled me by his noisy objurgations to be up and off instantly for a three years campaign in the south seas o magic words une campagne de trois ans dans les mers du sudthat is the french for a three years deepwater voyage  he gave me a delightful waking and his friendliness was unwearied but i fear he did not enter upon the quest for a ship for me in a very solemn spirit he had been at sea himself but had left off at the age of twentyfive finding he could earn his living on shore in a much more agreeable manner he was related to an incredible number of marseilles welltodo families of a certain class one of his uncles was a shipbroker of good standing with a large connection amongst english ships other relatives of his dealt in ships stores owned saillofts sold chains and anchors were masterstevedores caulkers shipwrights his grandfather i think was a dignitary of a kind the syndic of the pilots i made acquaintances amongst these people but mainly amongst the pilots the very first whole day i ever spent on salt water was by invitation in a big halfdecked pilotboat cruising under close reefs on the lookout in misty blowing weather for the sails of ships and the smoke of steamers rising out there beyond the slim and tall planier lighthouse cutting the line of the windswept horizon with a white perpendicular stroke they were hospitable souls these sturdy provencal seamen under the general designation of le petit ami de baptistin i was made the guest of the corporation of pilots and had the freedom of their boats night or day and many a day and a night too did i spend cruising with these rough kindly men under whose auspices my intimacy with the sea began many a time the little friend of baptistin had the hooded cloak of the mediterranean sailor thrown over him by their honest hands while dodging at night under the lee of chateau dif on the watch for the lights of ships their seatanned faces whiskered or shaved lean or full with the intent wrinkled seaeyes of the pilotbreed and here and there a thin gold hoop at the lobe of a hairy ear bent over my seainfancy the first operation of seamanship i had an opportunity of observing was the boarding of ships at sea at all times in all states of the weather they gave it to me to the full and i have been invited to sit in more than one tall dark house of the old town at their hospitable board had the bouillabaisse ladled out into a thick plate by their highvoiced broadbrowed wives talked to their daughtersthickset girls with pure profiles glorious masses of black hair arranged with complicated art dark eyes and dazzlingly white teeth  i had also other acquaintances of quite a different sort one of them madame delestang an imperious handsome lady in a statuesque style would carry me off now and then on the front seat of her carriage to the prado at the hour of fashionable airing she belonged to one of the old aristocratic families in the south in her haughty weariness she used to make me think of lady dedlock in dickenss bleak house a work of the master for which i have such an admiration or rather such an intense and unreasoning affection dating from the days of my childhood that its very weaknesses are more precious to me than the strength of other mens work i have read it innumerable times both in polish and in english i have read it only the other day and by a not very surprising inversion the lady dedlock of the book reminded me strongly of the belle madame delestang  her husband as i sat facing them both with his thin bony nose and a perfectly bloodless narrow physiognomy clamped together as it were by short formal sidewhiskers had nothing of sir leicester dedlocks grand air and courtly solemnity he belonged to the haute bourgeoisie only and was a banker with whom a modest credit had been opened for my needs he was such an ardentno such a frozenup mummified royalist that he used in current conversation turns of speech contemporary i should say with the good henri quatre and when talking of money matters reckoned not in francs like the common godless herd of postrevolutionary frenchmen but in obsolete and forgotten ecusecus of all money units in the worldas though louis quatorze were still promenading in royal splendour the gardens of versailles and monsieur de colbert busy with the direction of maritime affairs you must admit that in a banker of the nineteenth century it was a quaint idiosyncrasy luckily in the countinghouse it occupied part of the ground floor of the delestang town residence in a silent shady street the accounts were kept in modern money so that i never had any difficulty in making my wants known to the grave lowvoiced decorous legitimist i suppose clerks sitting in the perpetual gloom of heavily barred windows behind the sombre ancient counters beneath lofty ceilings with heavily moulded cornices i always felt on going out as though i had been in the temple of some very dignified but completely temporal religion and it was generally on these occasions that under the great carriage gateway lady ded i mean madame delestang catching sight of my raised hat would beckon me with an amiable imperiousness to the side of the carriage and suggest with an air of amused nonchalance venez donc faire un tour avec nous to which the husband would add an encouraging cest ca allons montez jeune homme he questioned me sometimes significantly but with perfect tact and delicacy as to the way i employed my time and never failed to express the hope that i wrote regularly to my honoured uncle i made no secret of the way i employed my time and i rather fancy that my artless tales of the pilots and so on entertained madame delestang so far as that ineffable woman could be entertained by the prattle of a youngster very full of his new experience amongst strange men and strange sensations she expressed no opinions and talked to me very little yet her portrait hangs in the gallery of my intimate memories fixed there by a short and fleeting episode one day after putting me down at the corner of a street she offered me her hand and detained me by a slight pressure for a moment while the husband sat motionless and looking straight before him she leaned forward in the carriage to say with just a shade of warning in her leisurely tone il faut cependant faire attention a ne pas gater sa vie i had never seen her face so close to mine before she made my heart beat and caused me to remain thoughtful for a whole evening certainly one must after all take care not to spoil ones life but she did not knownobody could knowhow impossible that danger seemed to me   chapter vii  can the transports of first love be calmed checked turned to a cold suspicion of the future by a grave quotation from a work on political economy i askis it conceivable is it possible would it be right with my feet on the very shores of the sea and about to embrace my blueeyed dream what could a goodnatured warning as to spoiling ones life mean to my youthful passion it was the most unexpected and the last too of the many warnings i had received it sounded to me very bizarreand uttered as it was in the very presence of my enchantress like the voice of folly the voice of ignorance but i was not so callous or so stupid as not to recognise there also the voice of kindness and then the vagueness of the warningbecause what can be the meaning of the phrase to spoil ones lifearrested ones attention by its air of wise profundity at any rate as i have said before the words of la belle madame delestang made me thoughtful for a whole evening i tried to understand and tried in vain not having any notion of life as an enterprise that could be mismanaged but i left off being thoughtful shortly before midnight at which hour haunted by no ghosts of the past and by no visions of the future i walked down the quay of the vieux port to join the pilotboat of my friends i knew where she would be waiting for her crew in the little bit of a canal behind the fort at the entrance of the harbour the deserted quays looked very white and dry in the moonlight and as if frostbound in the sharp air of that december night a prowler or two slunk by noiselessly a customhouse guard soldierlike a sword by his side paced close under the bowsprits of the long row of ships moored bows on opposite the long slightly curved continuous flat wall of the tall houses that seemed to be one immense abandoned building with innumerable windows shuttered closely only here and there a small dingy cafe for sailors cast a yellow gleam on the bluish sheen of the flagstones passing by one heard a deep murmur of voices insidenothing more how quiet everything was at the end of the quays on the last night on which i went out for a service cruise as a guest of the marseilles pilots not a footstep except my own not a sigh not a whispering echo of the usual revelry going on in the narrow unspeakable lanes of the old town reached my earand suddenly with a terrific jingling rattle of iron and glass the omnibus of the jolliette on its last journey swung round the corner of the dead wall which faces across the paved road the characteristic angular mass of the fort st jean three horses trotted abreast with the clatter of hoofs on the granite setts and the yellow uproarious machine jolted violently behind them fantastic lighted up perfectly empty and with the driver apparently asleep on his swaying perch above that amazing racket i flattened myself against the wall and gasped it was a stunning experience then after staggering on a few paces in the shadow of the fort casting a darkness more intense than that of a clouded night upon the canal i saw the tiny light of a lantern standing on the quay and became aware of muffled figures making towards it from various directions pilots of the third company hastening to embark too sleepy to be talkative they step on board in silence but a few low grunts and an enormous yawn are heard somebody even ejaculates ah coquin de sort and sighs wearily at his hard fate  the patron of the third company there were five companies of pilots at that time i believe is the brotherinlaw of my friend solary baptistin a broadshouldered deepchested man of forty with a keen frank glance which always seeks your eyes he greets me by a low hearty he lami comment va with his clipped moustache and massive open face energetic and at the same time placid in expression he is a fine specimen of the southerner of the calm type for there is such a type in which the volatile southern passion is transmuted into solid force he is fair but no one could mistake him for a man of the north even by the dim gleam of the lantern standing on the quay he is worth a dozen of your ordinary normans or bretons but then in the whole immense sweep of the mediterranean shores you could not find half a dozen men of his stamp  standing by the tiller he pulls out his watch from under a thick jacket and bends his head over it in the light cast into the boat times up his pleasant voice commands in a quiet undertone larguez a suddenly projected arm snatches the lantern off the quayand warped along by a line at first then with the regular tug of four heavy sweeps in the bow the big halfdecked boat full of men glides out of the black breathless shadow of the fort the open water of the avantport glitters under the moon as if sown over with millions of sequins and the long white breakwater shines like a thick bar of solid silver with a quick rattle of blocks and one single silky swish the sail is filled by a little breeze keen enough to have come straight down from the frozen moon and the boat after the clatter of the hauledin sweeps seems to stand at rest surrounded by a mysterious whispering so faint and unearthly that it may be the rustling of the brilliant overpowering moonrays breaking like a rainshower upon the hard smooth shadowless sea  i may well remember that last night spent with the pilots of the third company i have known the spell of moonlight since on various seas and coastscoasts of forests of rocks of sand dunesbut no magic so perfect in its revelation of unsuspected character as though one were allowed to look upon the mystic nature of material things for hours i suppose no word was spoken in that boat the pilots seated in two rows facing each other dozed with their arms folded and their chins resting upon their breasts they displayed a great variety of caps cloth wool leather peaks earflaps tassels with a picturesque round beret or two pulled down over the brows and one grandfather with a shaved bony face and a great beak of a nose had a cloak with a hood which made him look in our midst like a cowled monk being carried off goodness knows where by that silent company of seamenquiet enough to be dead  my fingers itched for the tiller and in due course my friend the patron surrendered it to me in the same spirit in which the family coachman lets a boy hold the reins on an easy bit of road there was a great solitude around us the islets ahead monte cristo and the chateau dif in full light seemed to float towards usso steady so imperceptible was the progress of our boat keep her in the furrow of the moon the patron directed me in a quiet murmur sitting down ponderously in the sternsheets and reaching for his pipe  the pilot station in weather like this was only a mile or two to the westward of the islets and presently as we approached the spot the boat we were going to relieve swam into our view suddenly on her way home cutting black and sinister into the wake of the moon under a sable wing while to them our sail must have been a vision of white and dazzling radiance without altering the course a hairsbreadth we slipped by each other within an oarslength a drawling sardonic hail came out of her instantly as if by magic our dozing pilots got on their feet in a body an incredible babel of bantering shouts burst out a jocular passionate voluble chatter which lasted till the boats were stern to stern theirs all bright now and with a shining sail to our eyes we turned all black to their vision and drawing away from them under a sable wing that extraordinary uproar died away almost as suddenly as it had begun first one had enough of it and sat down then another then three or four together and when all had left off with mutters and growling halflaughs the sound of hearty chuckling became audible persistent unnoticed the cowled grandfather was very much entertained somewhere within his hood  he had not joined in the shouting of jokes neither had he moved the least bit he had remained quietly in his place against the foot of the mast i had been given to understand long before that he had the rating of a secondclass able seaman matelot leger in the fleet which sailed from toulon for the conquest of algeria in the year of grace 1830 and indeed i had seen and examined one of the buttons of his old brown patched coat the only brass button of the miscellaneous lot flat and thin with the words equipages de ligne engraved on it that sort of button i believe went out with the last of the french bourbons i preserved it from the time of my navy service he explained nodding rapidly his frail vulturelike head it was not very likely that he had picked up that relic in the street he looked certainly old enough to have fought at trafalgaror at any rate to have played his little part there as a powdermonkey shortly after we had been introduced he had informed me in a francoprovencal jargon mumbling tremulously with his toothless jaws that when he was a shaver no higher than that he had seen the emperor napoleon returning from elba it was at night he narrated vaguely without animation at a spot between frejus and antibes in the open country a big fire had been lit at the side of the crossroads the population from several villages had collected there old and youngdown to the very children in arms because the women had refused to stay at home tall soldiers wearing high hairy caps stood in a circle facing the people silently and their stern eyes and big moustaches were enough to make everybody keep at a distance he being an impudent little shaver wriggled out of the crowd creeping on his hands and knees as near as he dared to the grenadiers legs and peeping through discovered standing perfectly still in the light of the fire a little fat fellow in a threecornered hat buttoned up in a long straight coat with a big pale face inclined on one shoulder looking something like a priest his hands were clasped behind his back    it appears that this was the emperor the ancient commented with a faint sigh he was staring from the ground with all his might when my poor father who had been searching for his boy frantically everywhere pounced upon him and hauled him away by the ear  the tale seems an authentic recollection he related it to me many times using the very same words the grandfather honoured me by a special and somewhat embarrassing predilection extremes touch he was the oldest member by a long way in that company and i was if i may say so its temporarily adopted baby he had been a pilot longer than any man in the boat could remember thirtyforty years he did not seem certain himself but it could be found out he suggested in the archives of the pilotoffice he had been pensioned off years before but he went out from force of habit and as my friend the patron of the company once confided to me in a whisper the old chap did no harm he was not in the way they treated him with rough deference one and another would address some insignificant remark to him now and again but nobody really took any notice of what he had to say he had survived his strength his usefulness his very wisdom he wore long green worsted stockings pulled up above the knee over his trousers a sort of woollen nightcap on his hairless cranium and wooden clogs on his feet without his hooded cloak he looked like a peasant half a dozen hands would be extended to help him on board but afterwards he was left pretty much to his own thoughts of course he never did any work except perhaps to cast off some rope when hailed he lancien let go the halyards there at your handor some such request of an easy kind  no one took notice in any way of the chuckling within the shadow of the hood he kept it up for a long time with intense enjoyment obviously he had preserved intact the innocence of mind which is easily amused but when his hilarity had exhausted itself he made a professional remark in a selfassertive but quavering voice  cant expect much work on a night like this  no one took it up it was a mere truism nothing under canvas could be expected to make a port on such an idle night of dreamy splendour and spiritual stillness we would have to glide idly to and fro keeping our station within the appointed bearings and unless a fresh breeze sprang up with the dawn we would land before sunrise on a small islet that within two miles of us shone like a lump of frozen moonlight to break a crust and take a pull at the wine bottle i was familiar with the procedure the stout boat emptied of her crowd would nestle her buoyant capable side against the very rocksuch is the perfectly smooth amenity of the classic sea when in a gentle mood the crust broken and the mouthful of wine swallowedit was literally no more than that with this abstemious racethe pilots would pass the time stamping their feet on the slabs of seasalted stone and blowing into their nipped fingers one or two misanthropists would sit apart perched on boulders like manlike seafowl of solitary habits the sociably disposed would gossip scandalously in little gesticulating knots and there would be perpetually one or another of my hosts taking aim at the empty horizon with the long brass tube of the telescope a heavy murderouslooking piece of collective property everlastingly changing hands with brandishing and levelling movements then about noon it was a short turn of dutythe long turn lasted twentyfour hours another boatful of pilots would relieve usand we should steer for the old phoenician port dominated watched over from the ridge of a dustgrey arid hill by the redandwhitestriped pile of the notre dame de la garde  all this came to pass as i had foreseen in the fullness of my very recent experience but also something not foreseen by me did happen something which causes me to remember my last outing with the pilots it was on this occasion that my hand touched for the first time the side of an english ship  no fresh breeze had come with the dawn only the steady little draught got a more keen edge on it as the eastern sky became bright and glassy with a clean colourless light it was while we were all ashore on the islet that a steamer was picked up by the telescope a black speck like an insect posed on the hard edge of the offing she emerged rapidly to her waterline and came on steadily a slim hull with a long streak of smoke slanting away from the rising sun we embarked in a hurry and headed the boat out for our prey but we hardly moved three miles an hour  she was a big highclass cargosteamer of a type that is to be met on the sea no more black hull with low white super structures powerfully rigged with three masts and a lot of yards on the fore two hands at her enormous wheelsteam steeringgear was not a matter of course in these daysand with them on the bridge three others bulky in thick blue jackets ruddyfaced muffled up with peaked capsi suppose all her officers there are ships i have met more than once and known well by sight whose names i have forgotten but the name of that ship seen once so many years ago in the clear flush of a cold pale sunrise i have not forgotten how could ithe first english ship on whose side i ever laid my hand the namei read it letter by letter on the bowwas james westoll not very romantic you will say the name of a very considerable wellknown and universally respected northcountry shipowner i believe james westoll what better name could an honourable hardworking ship have to me the very grouping of the letters is alive with the romantic feeling of her reality as i saw her floating motionless and borrowing an ideal grace from the austere purity of the light  we were then very near her and on a sudden impulse i volunteered to pull bow in the dinghy which shoved off at once to put the pilot on board while our boat fanned by the faint air which had attended us all through the night went on gliding gently past the black glistening length of the ship a few strokes brought us alongside and it was then that for the very first time in my life i heard myself addressed in englishthe speech of my secret choice of my future of long friendships of the deepest affections of hours of toil and hours of ease and of solitary hours too of books read of thoughts pursued of remembered emotionsof my very dreams and if after being thus fashioned by it in that part of me which cannot decay i dare not claim it aloud as my own then at any rate the speech of my children thus small events grow memorable by the passage of time as to the quality of the address itself i cannot say it was very striking too short for eloquence and devoid of all charm of tone it consisted precisely of the three words look out there growled out huskily above my head  it proceeded from a big fat fellow he had an obtrusive hairy double chin in a blue woollen shirt and roomy breeches pulled up very high even to the level of his breastbone by a pair of braces quite exposed to public view as where he stood there was no bulwark but only a rail and stanchions i was able to take in at a glance the whole of his voluminous person from his feet to the high crown of his soft black hat which sat like an absurd flanged cone on his big head the grotesque and massive space of that deck hand i suppose he was thatvery likely the lamptrimmer surprised me very much my course of reading of dreaming and longing for the sea had not prepared me for a seabrother of that sort i never met again a figure in the least like his except in the illustrations to mr ww jacobs most entertaining tales of barges and coasters but the inspired talent of mr jacobs for poking endless fun at poor innocent sailors in a prose which however extravagant in its felicitous invention is always artistically adjusted to observed truth was not yet perhaps mr jacobs himself was not yet i fancy that at most if he had made his nurse laugh it was about all he had achieved at that early date  therefore i repeat other disabilities apart i could not have been prepared for the sight of that husky old porpoise the object of his concise address was to call my attention to a rope which he incontinently flung down for me to catch i caught it though it was not really necessary the ship having no way on her by that time then everything went on very swiftly the dinghy came with a slight bump against the steamers side the pilot grabbing the rope ladder had scrambled halfway up before i knew that our task of boarding was done the harsh muffled clanging of the engineroom telegraph struck my ear through the iron plate my companion in the dinghy was urging me to shove offpush hard and when i bore against the smooth flank of the first english ship i ever touched in my life i felt it already throbbing under my open palm  her head swung a little to the west pointing towards the miniature lighthouse of the jolliette breakwater far away there hardly distinguishable against the land the dinghy danced a squashy splashy jig in the wash of the wake and turning in my seat i followed the james westoll with my eyes before she had gone in a quarter of a mile she hoisted her flag as the harbour regulations prescribe for arriving and departing ships i saw it suddenly flicker and stream out on the flagstaff the red ensign in the pellucid colourless atmosphere bathing the drab and grey masses of that southern land the livid islets the sea of pale glassy blue under the pale glassy sky of that cold sunrise it was as far as the eye could reach the only spot of ardent colourflamelike intense and presently as minute as the tiny red spark the concentrated reflection of a great fire kindles in the clear heart of a globe of crystal the red ensignthe symbolic protecting warm bit of bunting flung wide upon the seas and destined for so many years to be the only roof over my head
