97198334	wild apples   by  henry david thoreau     contents    the history of the appletree   the wild apple   the crab   how the wild apple grows   the fruit and its flavor   their beauty   the naming of them   the last gleaning   the frozenthawed apple     the history of the appletree  it is remarkable how closely the history of the appletree is connected with that of man the geologist tells us that the order of the rosaceae which includes the apple also the true grasses and the labiatae or mints were introduced only a short time previous to the appearance of man on the globe  it appears that apples made a part of the food of that unknown primitive people whose traces have lately been found at the bottom of the swiss lakes supposed to be older than the foundation of rome so old that they had no metallic implements an entire black and shrivelled crabapple has been recovered from their stores  tacitus says of the ancient germans that they satisfied their hunger with wild apples among other things  niebuhr1 observes that the words for a house a field a plough ploughing wine oil milk sheep apples and others relating to agriculture and the gentler ways of life agree in latin and greek while the latin words for all objects pertaining to war or the chase are utterly alien from the greek thus the appletree may be considered a symbol of peace no less than the olive  1 a german historical critic of ancient life  the apple was early so important and so generally distributed that its name traced to its root in many languages signifies fruit in general maelon melon in greek means an apple also the fruit of other trees also a sheep and any cattle and finally riches in general  the appletree has been celebrated by the hebrews greeks romans and scandinavians some have thought that the first human pair were tempted by its fruit goddesses are fabled to have contended for it dragons were set to watch it and heroes were employed to pluck it2  2 the greek myths especially referred to are the choice of paris and the apples of the hesperides  the tree is mentioned in at least three places in the old testament and its fruit in two or three more solomon sings as the appletree among the trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons and again stay me with flagons comfort me with apples the noblest part of mans noblest feature is named from this fruit the apple of the eye  the appletree is also mentioned by homer and herodotus ulysses saw in the glorious garden of alcinous pears and pomegranates and appletrees bearing beautiful fruit and according to homer apples were among the fruits which tantalus could not pluck the wind ever blowing their boughs away from him theophrastus knew and described the appletree as a botanist  according to the prose edda3 iduna keeps in a box the apples which the gods when they feel old age approaching have only to taste of to become young again it is in this manner that they will be kept in renovated youth until ragnarok or the destruction of the gods  3 the stories of the early scandinavians  i learn from loudon4 that the ancient welsh bards were rewarded for excelling in song by the token of the applespray and in the highlands of scotland the appletree is the badge of the clan lamont  4 an english authority on the culture of orchards and gardens  the appletree belongs chiefly to the northern temperate zone loudon says that it grows spontaneously in every part of europe except the frigid zone and throughout western asia china and japan we have also two or three varieties of the apple indigenous in north america the cultivated appletree was first introduced into this country by the earliest settlers and is thought to do as well or better here than anywhere else probably some of the varieties which are now cultivated were first introduced into britain by the romans  pliny adopting the distinction of theophrastus says of trees there are some which are altogether wild some more civilized theophrastus includes the apple among the last and indeed it is in this sense the most civilized of all trees it is as harmless as a dove as beautiful as a rose and as valuable as flocks and herds it has been longer cultivated than any other and so is more humanized and who knows but like the dog it will at length be no longer traceable to its wild original it migrates with man like the dog and horse and cow first perchance from greece to italy thence to england thence to america and our western emigrant is still marching steadily toward the setting sun with the seeds of the apple in his pocket or perhaps a few young trees strapped to his load at least a million appletrees are thus set farther westward this year than any cultivated ones grew last year consider how the blossomweek like the sabbath is thus annually spreading over the prairies for when man migrates he carries with him not only his birds quadrupeds insects vegetables and his very sward but his orchard also  the leaves and tender twigs are an agreeable food to many domestic animals as the cow horse sheep and goat and the fruit is sought after by the first as well as by the hog thus there appears to have existed a natural alliance between these animals and this tree from the first the fruit of the crab in the forests of france is said to be a great resource for the wild boar  not only the indian but many indigenous insects birds and quadrupeds welcomed the appletree to these shores the tentcaterpillar saddled her eggs on the very first twig that was formed and it has since shared her affections with the wild cherry and the cankerworm also in a measure abandoned the elm to feed on it as it grew apace the bluebird robin cherrybird kingbird and many more came with haste and built their nests and warbled in its boughs and so became orchardbirds and multiplied more than ever it was an era in the history of their race the downy woodpecker found such a savory morsel under its bark that he perforated it in a ring quite round the tree before he left ita thing which he had never done before to my knowledge it did not take the partridge long to find out how sweet its buds were and every winter eve she flew and still flies from the wood to pluck them much to the farmers sorrow the rabbit too was not slow to learn the taste of its twigs and bark and when the fruit was ripe the squirrel halfrolled halfcarried it to his hole and even the musquash crept up the bank from the brook at evening and greedily devoured it until he had worn a path in the grass there and when it was frozen and thawed the crow and the jay were glad to taste it occasionally the owl crept into the first appletree that became hollow and fairly hooted with delight finding it just the place for him so settling down into it he has remained there ever since  my theme being the wild apple i will merely glance at some of the seasons in the annual growth of the cultivated apple and pass on to my special province  the flowers of the apple are perhaps the most beautiful of any tree so copious and so delicious to both sight and scent the walker is frequently tempted to turn and linger near some more than usually handsome one whose blossoms are two thirds expanded how superior it is in these respects to the pear whose blossoms are neither colored nor fragrant  by the middle of july green apples are so large as to remind us of coddling and of the autumn the sward is commonly strewed with little ones which fall stillborn as it werenature thus thinning them for us the roman writer palladius said if apples are inclined to fall before their time a stone placed in a split root will retain them some such notion still surviving may account for some of the stones which we see placed to be overgrown in the forks of trees they have a saying in suffolk england      at michaelmas time or a little before      half an apple goes to the core  early apples begin to be ripe about the first of august but i think that none of them are so good to eat as some to smell one is worth more to scent your handkerchief with than any perfume which they sell in the shops the fragrance of some fruits is not to be forgotten along with that of flowers some gnarly apple which i pick up in the road reminds me by its fragrance of all the wealth of pomona5carrying me forward to those days when they will be collected in golden and ruddy heaps in the orchards and about the cidermills  5 the roman goddess of fruit and fruittrees  a week or two later as you are going by orchards or gardens especially in the evenings you pass through a little region possessed by the fragrance of ripe apples and thus enjoy them without price and without robbing anybody  there is thus about all natural products a certain volatile and ethereal quality which represents their highest value and which cannot be vulgarized or bought and sold no mortal has ever enjoyed the perfect flavor of any fruit and only the godlike among men begin to taste its ambrosial qualities for nectar and ambrosia are only those fine flavors of every earthly fruit which our coarse palates fail to perceivejust as we occupy the heaven of the gods without knowing it when i see a particularly mean man carrying a load of fair and fragrant early apples to market i seem to see a contest going on between him and his horse on the one side and the apples on the other and to my mind the apples always gain it pliny says that apples are the heaviest of all things and that the oxen begin to sweat at the mere sight of a load of them our driver begins to lose his load the moment he tries to transport them to where they do not belong that is to any but the most beautiful though he gets out from time to time and feels of them and thinks they are all there i see the stream of their evanescent and celestial qualities going to heaven from his cart while the pulp and skin and core only are going to market they are not apples but pomace are not these still idunas apples the taste of which keeps the gods forever young and think you that they will let loki or thjassi carry them off to jotunheim6 while they grow wrinkled and gray no for ragnarok or the destruction of the gods is not yet  6 jotunheim yertunhime in scandinavian mythology was the home of the jotun or giants loki was a descendant of the gods and a companion of the giants thjassi teeassy was a giant  there is another thinning of the fruit commonly near the end of august or in september when the ground is strewn with windfalls and this happens especially when high winds occur after rain in some orchards you may see fully three quarters of the whole crop on the ground lying in a circular form beneath the trees yet hard and greenor if it is a hillside rolled far down the hill however it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good all the country over people are busy picking up the windfalls and this will make them cheap for early applepies  in october the leaves falling the apples are more distinct on the trees i saw one year in a neighboring town some trees fuller of fruit than i remember to have ever seen before small yellow apples hanging over the road the branches were gracefully drooping with their weight like a barberrybush so that the whole tree acquired a new character even the topmost branches instead of standing erect spread and drooped in all directions and there were so many poles supporting the lower ones that they looked like pictures of baniantrees as an old english manuscript says the mo appelen the tree bereth the more sche boweth to the folk  surely the apple is the noblest of fruits let the most beautiful or the swiftest have it that should be the going price of apples  between the fifth and twentieth of october i see the barrels lie under the trees and perhaps i talk with one who is selecting some choice barrels to fulfil an order he turns a specked one over many times before he leaves it out if i were to tell what is passing in my mind i should say that every one was specked which he had handled for he rubs off all the bloom and those fugacious ethereal qualities leave it cool evenings prompt the farmers to make haste and at length i see only the ladders here and there left leaning against the trees  it would be well if we accepted these gifts with more joy and gratitude and did not think it enough simply to put a fresh load of compost about the tree some old english customs are suggestive at least i find them described chiefly in brands popular antiquities it appears that on christmas eve the farmers and their men in devonshire take a large bowl of cider with a toast in it and carrying it in state to the orchard they salute the appletrees with much ceremony in order to make them bear well the next season this salutation consists in throwing some of the cider about the roots of the tree placing bits of the toast on the branches and then encircling one of the best bearing trees in the orchard they drink the following toast three several times        heres to thee old appletree      whence thou mayst bud and whence thou mayst blow      and whence thou mayst bear apples enow         hatsfull capsfull         bushel bushel sacksfull         and my pockets full too hurra   also what was called applehowling used to be practised in various counties of england on newyears eve a troop of boys visited the different orchards and encircling the appletrees repeated the following words      stand fast root bear well top      pray god send us a good howling crop      every twig apples big      every bow apples enow   they then shout in chorus one of the boys accompanying them on a cows horn during this ceremony they rap the trees with their sticks this is called wassailing the trees and is thought by some to be a relic of the heathen sacrifice to pomona  herrick sings      wassaile the trees that they may beare      you many a plum and many a peare      for more or less fruits they will bring      as you so give them wassailing  our poets have as yet a better right to sing of cider than of wine but it behooves them to sing better than english phillips did else they will do no credit to their muse     the wild apple   so much for the more civilized appletrees urbaniores as pliny calls them i love better to go through the old orchards of ungrafted appletrees at whatever season of the yearso irregularly planted sometimes two trees standing close together and the rows so devious that you would think that they not only had grown while the owner was sleeping but had been set out by him in a somnambulic state the rows of grafted fruit will never tempt me to wander amid them like these but i now alas speak rather from memory than from any recent experience such ravages have been made  some soils like a rocky tract called the easterbrooks country in my neighborhood are so suited to the apple that it will grow faster in them without any care or if only the ground is broken up once a year than it will in many places with any amount of care the owners of this tract allow that the soil is excellent for fruit but they say that it is so rocky that they have not patience to plough it and that together with the distance is the reason why it is not cultivated there are or were recently extensive orchards there standing without order nay they spring up wild and bear well there in the midst of pines birches maples and oaks i am often surprised to see rising amid these trees the rounded tops of appletrees glowing with red or yellow fruit in harmony with the autumnal tints of the forest  going up the side of a cliff about the first of november i saw a vigorous young appletree which planted by birds or cows had shot up amid the rocks and open woods there and had now much fruit on it uninjured by the frosts when all cultivated apples were gathered it was a rank wild growth with many green leaves on it still and made an impression of thorniness the fruit was hard and green but looked as if it would be palatable in the winter some was dangling on the twigs but more halfburied in the wet leaves under the tree or rolled far down the hill amid the rocks the owner knows nothing of it the day was not observed when it first blossomed nor when it first bore fruit unless by the chickadee there was no dancing on the green beneath it in its honor and now there is no hand to pluck its fruitwhich is only gnawed by squirrels as i perceive it has done double dutynot only borne this crop but each twig has grown a foot into the air and this is such fruit bigger than many berries we must admit and carried home will be sound and palatable next spring what care i for idunas apples so long as i can get these  when i go by this shrub thus late and hardy and see its dangling fruit i respect the tree and i am grateful for natures bounty even though i cannot eat it here on this rugged and woody hillside has grown an appletree not planted by man no relic of a former orchard but a natural growth like the pines and oaks most fruits which we prize and use depend entirely on our care corn and grain potatoes peaches melons etc depend altogether on our planting but the apple emulates mans independence and enterprise it is not simply carried as i have said but like him to some extent it has migrated to this new world and is even here and there making its way amid the aboriginal trees just as the ox and dog and horse sometimes run wild and maintain themselves  even the sourest and crabbedest apple growing in the most unfavorable position suggests such thoughts as these it is so noble a fruit     the crab   nevertheless our wild apple is wild only like myself perchance who belong not to the aboriginal race here but have strayed into the woods from the cultivated stock wilder still as i have said there grows elsewhere in this country a native and aboriginal crabapple whose nature has not yet been modified by cultivation it is found from western new york to minnesota and southward michaux7 says that its ordinary height is fifteen or eighteen feet but it is sometimes found twentyfive or thirty feet high and that the large ones exactly resemble the common appletree the flowers are white mingled with rosecolor and are collected in corymbs they are remarkable for their delicious odor the fruit according to him is about an inch and a half in diameter and is intensely acid yet they make fine sweetmeats and also cider of them he concludes that if on being cultivated it does not yield new and palatable varieties it will at least be celebrated for the beauty of its flowers and for the sweetness of its perfume  7 pronounced meesho a french botanist and traveller  i never saw the crabapple till may 1861 i had heard of it through michaux but more modern botanists so far as i know have not treated it as of any peculiar importance thus it was a halffabulous tree to me i contemplated a pilgrimage to the glades a portion of pennsylvania where it was said to grow to perfection i thought of sending to a nursery for it but doubted if they had it or would distinguish it from european varieties at last i had occasion to go to minnesota and on entering michigan i began to notice from the cars a tree with handsome rosecolored flowers at first i thought it some variety of thorn but it was not long before the truth flashed on me that this was my longsought crabapple it was the prevailing flowering shrub or tree to be seen from the cars at that season of the yearabout the middle of may but the cars never stopped before one and so i was launched on the bosom of the mississippi without having touched one experiencing the fate of tantalus on arriving at st anthonys falls i was sorry to be told that i was too far north for the crabapple nevertheless i succeeded in finding it about eight miles west of the falls touched it and smelled it and secured a lingering corymb of flowers for my herbarium this must have been near its northern limit     how the wild apple grows   but though these are indigenous like the indians i doubt whether they are any hardier than those backwoodsmen among the appletrees which though descended from cultivated stocks plant themselves in distant fields and forests where the soil is favorable to them i know of no trees which have more difficulties to contend with and which more sturdily resist their foes these are the ones whose story we have to tell it oftentimes reads thus  near the beginning of may we notice little thickets of appletrees just springing up in the pastures where cattle have beenas the rocky ones of our easterbrooks country or the top of nobscot hill in sudbury one or two of these perhaps survive the drought and other accidentstheir very birthplace defending them against the encroaching grass and some other dangers at first      in two years time t had thus      reached the level of the rocks     admired the stretching world      nor feared the wandering flocks      but at this tender age      its sufferings began     there came a browsing ox      and cut it down a span  this time perhaps the ox does not notice it amid the grass but the next year when it has grown more stout he recognizes it for a fellowemigrant from the old country the flavor of whose leaves and twigs he well knows and though at first he pauses to welcome it and express his surprise and gets for answer the same cause that brought you here brought me he nevertheless browses it again reflecting it may be that he has some title to it  thus cut down annually it does not despair but putting forth two short twigs for every one cut off it spreads out low along the ground in the hollows or between the rocks growing more stout and scrubby until it forms not a tree as yet but a little pyramidal stiff twiggy mass almost as solid and impenetrable as a rock some of the densest and most impenetrable clumps of bushes that i have ever seen as well on account of the closeness and stubbornness of their branches as of their thorns have been these wildapple scrubs they are more like the scrubby fir and black spruce on which you stand and sometimes walk on the tops of mountains where cold is the demon they contend with than anything else no wonder they are prompted to grow thorns at last to defend themselves against such foes in their thorniness however there is no malice only some malic acid  the rocky pastures of the tract i have referred tofor they maintain their ground best in a rocky fieldare thickly sprinkled with these little tufts reminding you often of some rigid gray mosses or lichens and you see thousands of little trees just springing up between them with the seed still attached to them  being regularly clipped all around each year by the cows as a hedge with shears they are often of a perfect conical or pyramidal form from one to four feet high and more or less sharp as if trimmed by the gardeners art in the pastures on nobscot hill and its spurs they make fine dark shadows when the sun is low they are also an excellent covert from hawks for many small birds that roost and build in them whole flocks perch in them at night and i have seen three robins nests in one which was six feet in diameter  no doubt many of these are already old trees if you reckon from the day they were planted but infants still when you consider their development and the long life before them i counted the annual rings of some which were just one foot high and as wide as high and found that they were about twelve years old but quite sound and thrifty they were so low that they were unnoticed by the walker while many of their contemporaries from the nurseries were already bearing considerable crops but what you gain in time is perhaps in this case too lost in powerthat is in the vigor of the tree this is their pyramidal state  the cows continue to browse them thus for twenty years or more keeping them down and compelling them to spread until at last they are so broad that they become their own fence when some interior shoot which their foes cannot reach darts upward with joy for it has not forgotten its high calling and bears its own peculiar fruit in triumph  such are the tactics by which it finally defeats its bovine foes now if you have watched the progress of a particular shrub you will see that it is no longer a simple pyramid or cone but out of its apex there rises a sprig or two growing more lustily perchance than an orchardtree since the plant now devotes the whole of its repressed energy to these upright parts in a short time these become a small tree an inverted pyramid resting on the apex of the other so that the whole has now the form of a vast hourglass the spreading bottom having served its purpose finally disappears and the generous tree permits the now harmless cows to come in and stand in its shade and rub against and redden its trunk which has grown in spite of them and even to taste a part of its fruit and so disperse the seed  thus the cows create their own shade and food and the tree its hourglass being inverted lives a second life as it were  it is an important question with some nowadays whether you should trim young appletrees as high as your nose or as high as your eyes the ox trims them up as high as he can reach and that is about the right height i think  in spite of wandering kine and other adverse circumstance that despised shrub valued only by small birds as a covert and shelter from hawks has its blossomweek at last and in course of time its harvest sincere though small  by the end of some october when its leaves have fallen i frequently see such a central sprig whose progress i have watched when i thought it had forgotten its destiny as i had bearing its first crop of small green or yellow or rosy fruit which the cows cannot get at over the bushy and thorny hedge which surrounds it and i make haste to taste the new and undescribed variety we have all heard of the numerous varieties of fruit invented by van mons9 and knight10 this is the system of van cow and she has invented far more and more memorable varieties than both of them  9 a belgian chemist and horticulturist  10 an english vegetable physiologist  through what hardships it may attain to bear a sweet fruit though somewhat small it may prove equal if not superior in flavor to that which has grown in a gardenwill perchance be all the sweeter and more palatable for the very difficulties it has had to contend with who knows but this chance wild fruit planted by a cow or a bird on some remote and rocky hillside where it is as yet unobserved by man may be the choicest of all its kind and foreign potentates shall hear of it and royal societies seek to propagate it though the virtues of the perhaps truly crabbed owner of the soil may never be heard ofat least beyond the limits of his village it was thus the porter and the baldwin grew  every wildapple shrub excites our expectation thus somewhat as every wild child it is perhaps a prince in disguise what a lesson to man so are human beings referred to the highest standard the celestial fruit which they suggest and aspire to bear browsed on by fate and only the most persistent and strongest genius defends itself and prevails sends a tender scion upward at last and drops its perfect fruit on the ungrateful earth poets and philosophers and statesmen thus spring up in the country pastures and outlast the hosts of unoriginal men  such is always the pursuit of knowledge the celestial fruits the golden apples of the hesperides are ever guarded by a hundredheaded dragon which never sleeps so that it is an herculean labor to pluck them  this is one and the most remarkable way in which the wild apple is propagated but commonly it springs up at wide intervals in woods and swamps and by the sides of roads as the soil may suit it and grows with comparative rapidity those which grow in dense woods are very tall and slender i frequently pluck from these trees a perfectly mild and tamed fruit as palladius says and the ground is strewn with the fruit of an unbidden appletree  it is an old notion that if these wild trees do not bear a valuable fruit of their own they are the best stocks by which to transmit to posterity the most highly prized qualities of others however i am not in search of stocks but the wild fruit itself whose fierce gust has suffered no inteneration it is not my       highest plot    to plant the bergamot     the fruit and its flavor   the time for wild apples is the last of october and the first of november they then get to be palatable for they ripen late and they are still perhaps as beautiful as ever i make a great account of these fruits which the farmers do not think it worth the while to gatherwild flavors of the muse vivacious and inspiriting the farmer thinks that he has better in his barrels but he is mistaken unless he has a walkers appetite and imagination neither of which can he have  such as grow quite wild and are left out till the first of november i presume that the owner does not mean to gather they belong to children as wild as themselvesto certain active boys that i knowto the wildeyed woman of the fields to whom nothing comes amiss who gleans after all the worldand moreover to us walkers we have met with them and they are ours these rights long enough insisted upon have come to be an institution in some old countries where they have learned how to live i hear that the custom of grippling which may be called applegleaning is or was formerly practised in herefordshire it consists in leaving a few apples which are called the gripples on every tree after the general gathering for the boys who go with climbingpoles and bags to collect them  as for those i speak of i pluck them as a wild fruit native to this quarter of the earthfruit of old trees that have been dying ever since i was a boy and are not yet dead frequented only by the woodpecker and the squirrel deserted now by the owner who has not faith enough to look under their boughs from the appearance of the treetop at a little distance you would expect nothing but lichens to drop from it but your faith is rewarded by finding the ground strewn with spirited fruitsome of it perhaps collected at squirrelholes with the marks of their teeth by which they carried themsome containing a cricket or two silently feeding within and some especially in damp days a shelless snail the very sticks and stones lodged in the treetop might have convinced you of the savoriness of the fruit which has been so eagerly sought after in past years  i have seen no account of these among the fruits and fruittrees of america though they are more memorable to my taste than the grafted kinds more racy and wild american flavors do they possess when october and november when december and january and perhaps february and march even have assuaged them somewhat an old farmer in my neighborhood who always selects the right word says that they have a kind of bowarrow tang  apples for grafting appear to have been selected commonly not so much for their spirited flavor as for their mildness their size and bearing qualitiesnot so much for their beauty as for their fairness and soundness indeed i have no faith in the selected lists of pomological gentlemen their favorites and nonsuches and seeknofarthers when i have fruited them commonly turn out very tame and forgetable they are eaten with comparatively little zest and have no real tang nor smack to them  what if some of these wildings are acrid and puckery genuine verjuice do they not still belong to the pomaceae which are uniformly innocent and kind to our race i still begrudge them to the cidermill perhaps they are not fairly ripe yet  no wonder that these small and highcolored apples are thought to make the best cider loudon quotes from the herefordshire report that apples of a small size are always if equal in quality to be preferred to those of a larger size in order that the rind and kernel may bear the greatest proportion to the pulp which affords the weakest and most watery juice and he says that to prove this dr symonds of hereford about the year 1800 made one hogshead of cider entirely from the rinds and cores of apples and another from the pulp only when the first was found of extraordinary strength and flavor while the latter was sweet and insipid  evelyn11 says that the redstrake was the favorite ciderapple in his day and he quotes one dr newburg as saying in jersey t is a general observation as i hear that the more of red any apple has in its rind the more proper it is for this use palefaced apples they exclude as much as may be from their cidervat this opinion still prevails  11 an english writer of the seventeenth century  all apples are good in november those which the farmer leaves out as unsalable and unpalatable to those who frequent the markets are choicest fruit to the walker but it is remarkable that the wild apple which i praise as so spirited and racy when eaten in the fields or woods being brought into the house has frequently a harsh and crabbed taste the saunterers apple not even the saunterer can eat in the house the palate rejects it there as it does haws and acorns and demands a tamed one for there you miss the november air which is the sauce it is to be eaten with accordingly when tityrus seeing the lengthening shadows invites meliboeus to go home and pass the night with him he promises him mild apples and soft chestnuts i frequently pluck wild apples of so rich and spicy a flavor that i wonder all orchardists do not get a scion from that tree and i fail not to bring home my pockets full but perchance when i take one out of my desk and taste it in my chamber i find it unexpectedly crudesour enough to set a squirrels teeth on edge and make a jay scream  these apples have hung in the wind and frost and rain till they have absorbed the qualities of the weather or season and thus are highly seasoned and they pierce and sting and permeate us with their spirit they must be eaten in season accordinglythat is outofdoors  to appreciate the wild and sharp flavors of these october fruits it is necessary that you be breathing the sharp october or november air the outdoor air and exercise which the walker gets give a different tone to his palate and he craves a fruit which the sedentary would call harsh and crabbed they must be eaten in the fields when your system is all aglow with exercise when the frosty weather nips your fingers the wind rattles the bare boughs or rustles the few remaining leaves and the jay is heard screaming around what is sour in the house a bracing walk makes sweet some of these apples might be labelled to be eaten in the wind  of course no flavors are thrown away they are intended for the taste that is up to them some apples have two distinct flavors and perhaps onehalf of them must be eaten in the house the other outdoors one peter whitney wrote from northborough in 1782 for the proceedings of the boston academy describing an appletree in that town producing fruit of opposite qualities part of the same apple being frequently sour and the other sweet also some all sour and others all sweet and this diversity on all parts of the tree  there is a wild apple on nawshawtuck hill in my town which has to me a peculiarly pleasant bitter tang not perceived till it is threequarters tasted it remains on the tongue as you eat it it smells exactly like a squashbug it is a sort of triumph to eat and relish it  i hear that the fruit of a kind of plumtree in provence is called prunes sibarelles because it is impossible to whistle after having eaten them from their sourness but perhaps they were only eaten in the house and in summer and if tried outofdoors in a stinging atmosphere who knows but you could whistle an octave higher and clearer  in the fields only are the sours and bitters of nature appreciated just as the woodchopper eats his meal in a sunny glade in the middle of a winter day with content basks in a sunny ray there and dreams of summer in a degree of cold which experienced in a chamber would make a student miserable they who are at work abroad are not cold but rather it is they who sit shivering in houses as with temperatures so with flavors as with cold and heat so with sour and sweet this natural raciness the sours and bitters which the diseased palate refuses are the true condiments  let your condiments be in the condition of your senses to appreciate the flavor of these wild apples requires vigorous and healthy senses papillae12 firm and erect on the tongue and palate not easily flattened and tamed  12 a latin word accent on the second syllable meaning here the rough surface of the tongue and palate  from my experience with wild apples i can understand that there may be reason for a savages preferring many kinds of food which the civilized man rejects the former has the palate of an outdoor man it takes a savage or wild taste to appreciate a wild fruit  what a healthy outofdoor appetite it takes to relish the apple of life the apple of the world then      nor is it every apple i desire        nor that which pleases every palate best     t is not the lasting deuxan i require        nor yet the redcheeked greening i request      nor that which first beshrewed the name of wife      nor that whose beauty caused the golden strife      no no bring me an apple from the tree of life  so there is one thought for the field another for the house i would have my thoughts like wild apples to be food for walkers and will not warrant them to be palatable if tasted in the house     their beauty   almost all wild apples are handsome they cannot be too gnarly and crabbed and rusty to look at the gnarliest will have some redeeming traits even to the eye you will discover some evening redness dashed or sprinkled on some protuberance or in some cavity it is rare that the summer lets an apple go without streaking or spotting it on some part of its sphere it will have some red stains commemorating the mornings and evenings it has witnessed some dark and rusty blotches in memory of the clouds and foggy mildewy days that have passed over it and a spacious field of green reflecting the general face of naturegreen even as the fields or a yellow ground which implies a milder flavoryellow as the harvest or russet as the hills  apples these i mean unspeakably fairapples not of discord but concord yet not so rare but that the homeliest may have a share painted by the frosts some a uniform clear bright yellow or red or crimson as if their spheres had regularly revolved and enjoyed the influence of the sun on all sides alikesome with the faintest pink blush imaginablesome brindled with deep red streaks like a cow or with hundreds of fine bloodred rays running regularly from the stemdimple to the blossomend like meridional lines on a strawcolored groundsome touched with a greenish rust like a fine lichen here and there with crimson blotches or eyes more or less confluent and fiery when wetand others gnarly and freckled or peppered all over on the stem side with fine crimson spots on a white ground as if accidentally sprinkled from the brush of him who paints the autumn leaves others again are sometimes red inside perfused with a beautiful blush fairy food too beautiful to eatapple of the hesperides apple of the evening sky but like shells and pebbles on the seashore they must be seen as they sparkle amid the withering leaves in some dell in the woods in the autumnal air or as they lie in the wet grass and not when they have wilted and faded in the house     the naming of them   it would be a pleasant pastime to find suitable names for the hundred varieties which go to a single heap at the cidermill would it not tax a mans inventionno one to be named after a man and all in the lingua vernacula13 who shall stand godfather at the christening of the wild apples it would exhaust the latin and greek languages if they were used and make the lingua vernacula flag we should have to call in the sunrise and the sunset the rainbow and the autumn woods and the wild flowers and the woodpecker and the purple finch and the squirrel and the jay and the butterfly the november traveller and the truant boy to our aid  13 lingua vernacula common speech  in 1836 there were in the garden of the london horticultural society more than fourteen hundred distinct sorts but here are species which they have not in their catalogue not to mention the varieties which our crab might yield to cultivation let us enumerate a few of these i find myself compelled after all to give the latin names of some for the benefit of those who live where english is not spokenfor they are likely to have a worldwide reputation  there is first of all the woodapple malus sylvatica the bluejay apple the apple which grows in dells in the woods sylvestrivallis also in hollows in pastures campestrivallis the apple that grows in an old cellarhole malus cellaris the meadowapple the partridgeapple the truants apple cessatoris which no boy will ever go by without knocking off some however late it may be the saunterers appleyou must lose yourself before you can find the way to that the beauty of the air decks aeris decembereating the frozenthawed gelatosoluta good only in that state the concord apple possibly the same with the musketaquidensis the assabet apple the brindled apple wine of new england the chickaree apple the green apple malus viridisthis has many synonyms in an imperfect state it is the cholera morbifera aut dysenterifera puerulis dilectissima14the apple which atalanta stopped to pick up the hedgeapple malus sepium the slugapple limacea the railroadapple which perhaps came from a core thrown out of the cars the apple whose fruit we tasted in our youth our particular apple not to be found in any cataloguepedestrium solatium15 also the apple where hangs the forgotten scythe idunas apples and the apples which loki found in the wood16 and a great many more i have on my list too numerous to mentionall of them good as bodaeus exclaims referring to the cultivated kinds and adapting virgil to his case so i adapting bodaeus     not if i had a hundred tongues a hundred mouths     an iron voice could i describe all the forms     and reckon up all the names of these wild apples   14 the apple that brings the disease of cholera and of dysentery the fruit that small boys like best  15 the tramps comfort  16 see p 172 proof readers note paragraph 25     the last gleaning   by the middle of november the wild apples have lost some of their brilliancy and have chiefly fallen a great part are decayed on the ground and the sound ones are more palatable than before the note of the chickadee sounds now more distinct as you wander amid the old trees and the autumnal dandelion is halfclosed and tearful but still if you are a skilful gleaner you may get many a pocketfull even of grafted fruit long after apples are supposed to be gone outofdoors i know a bluepearmain tree growing within the edge of a swamp almost as good as wild you would not suppose that there was any fruit left there on the first survey but you must look according to system those which lie exposed are quite brown and rotten now or perchance a few still show one blooming cheek here and there amid the wet leaves nevertheless with experienced eyes i explore amid the bare alders and the huckleberrybushes and the withered sedge and in the crevices of the rocks which are full of leaves and pry under the fallen and decaying ferns which with apple and alder leaves thickly strew the ground for i know that they lie concealed fallen into hollows long since and covered up by the leaves of the tree itselfa proper kind of packing from these lurkingplaces anywhere within the circumference of the tree i draw forth the fruit all wet and glossy maybe nibbled by rabbits and hollowed out by crickets and perhaps with a leaf or two cemented to it as curzon17 an old manuscript from a monasterys mouldy cellar but still with a rich bloom on it and at least as ripe and well kept if not better than those in barrels more crisp and lively than they if these resources fail to yield anything i have learned to look between the bases of the suckers which spring thickly from some horizontal limb for now and then one lodges there or in the very midst of an alderclump where they are covered by leaves safe from cows which may have smelled them out if i am sharpset for i do not refuse the bluepearmain i fill my pockets on each side and as i retrace my steps in the frosty eve being perhaps four or five miles from home i eat one first from this side and then from that to keep my balance  17 robert curzon was a traveller who searched for old manuscripts in the monasteries of the levant see his book ancient monasteries of the east  i learn from topsells gesner whose authority appears to be albertus that the following is the way in which the hedgehog collects and carries home his apples he says his meat is apples worms or grapes when he findeth apples or grapes on the earth he rolleth himself upon them until he have filled all his prickles and then carrieth them home to his den never bearing above one in his mouth and if it fortune that one of them fall off by the way he likewise shaketh off all the residue and walloweth upon them afresh until they be all settled upon his back again so forth he goeth making a noise like a cartwheel and if he have any young ones in his nest they pull off his load wherewithal he is loaded eating thereof what they please and laying up the residue for the time to come     the frozenthawed apple   toward the end of november though some of the sound ones are yet more mellow and perhaps more edible they have generally like the leaves lost their beauty and are beginning to freeze it is fingercold and prudent farmers get in their barrelled apples and bring you the apples and cider which they have engaged for it is time to put them into the cellar perhaps a few on the ground show their red cheeks above the early snow and occasionally some even preserve their color and soundness under the snow throughout the winter but generally at the beginning of the winter they freeze hard and soon though undecayed acquire the color of a baked apple  before the end of december generally they experience their first thawing those which a month ago were sour crabbed and quite unpalatable to the civilized taste such at least as were frozen while sound let a warmer sun come to thaw them for they are extremely sensitive to its rays are found to be filled with a rich sweet cider better than any bottled cider that i know of and with which i am better acquainted than with wine all apples are good in this state and your jaws are the ciderpress others which have more substance are a sweet and luscious foodin my opinion of more worth than the pineapples which are imported from the west indies those which lately even i tasted only to repent of itfor i am semicivilizedwhich the farmer willingly left on the tree i am now glad to find have the property of hanging on like the leaves of the young oaks it is a way to keep cider sweet without boiling let the frost come to freeze them first solid as stones and then the rain or a warm winter day to thaw them and they will seem to have borrowed a flavor from heaven through the medium of the air in which they hang or perchance you find when you get home that those which rattled in your pocket have thawed and the ice is turned to cider but after the third or fourth freezing and thawing they will not be found so good  what are the imported halfripe fruits of the torrid south to this fruit matured by the cold of the frigid north these are those crabbed apples with which i cheated my companion and kept a smooth face that i might tempt him to eat now we both greedily fill our pockets with thembending to drink the cup and save our lappets from the overflowing juiceand grow more social with their wine was there one that hung so high and sheltered by the tangled branches that our sticks could not dislodge it  it is a fruit never carried to market that i am aware ofquite distinct from the apple of the markets as from dried apple and ciderand it is not every winter that produces it in perfection  hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land hath this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers  that which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten  awake ye drunkards and weep and howl all ye drinkers of wine because of the new wine for it is cut off from your mouth  for a nation is come up upon my land strong and without number whose teeth are the teeth of a lion and he hath the cheekteeth of a great lion  he hath laid my vine waste and barked my figtree he hath made it clean bare and cast it away the branches thereof are made white  be ye ashamed o ye husbandmen howl o ye vinedressers  the vine is dried up and the figtree languisheth the pomegranatetree the palm tree also and the appletree even all the trees of the field are withered because joy is withered away from the sons of men18  18 joel chapter i verses 112
