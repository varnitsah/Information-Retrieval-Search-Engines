fowler  the brandenburg countries till they become related to the hohenzollern family which now rules there have no history that has proved memorable to mankind there has indeed been a good deal written under that title but there is by no means much known and of that again there is alarmingly little that is worth knowing or remembering  pytheas the marseilles travelling commissioner looking out for new channels of trade somewhat above 2000 years ago saw the country actually lying there sailed past it occasionally landing and made report to such marseillese chamber of commerce as there then wasreport now lost all to a few indistinct and insignificant fractions memoires de lacademie des inscriptions t xix 46 xxxvii 439 c this was about the year 327 before christ while alexander of macedon was busy conquering india beyond question pytheas the first writing or civilized creature that ever saw germany gazed with his greek eyes and occasionally landed striving to speak and inquire upon those old baltic coasts north border of the now prussian kingdom and reported of it to mankind we know not what which brings home to us the fact that it existed but almost nothing more a country of lakes and woods of marshy jungles sandy wildernesses inhabited by bears otters bisons wolves wild swine and certain shaggy germans of the suevic type as good as inarticulate to pytheas after which all direct notice of it ceases for above three hundred years we can hope only that the jungles were getting cleared a little and the wild creatures hunted down that the germans were increasing in number and becoming a thought less shaggy these latter tall suevi semnones men of blond stern aspect oculi truces coerulei and great strength of bone were known to possess a formidable talent for fighting tacitus de moribus germanorum c 45 drusus germanicus it has been guessed did not like to appear personally among them some gigantic woman prophesying to him across the elbe that it might be dangerous drusus contented himself with erecting some triumphal pillar on his own safe side of the elbe to say that they were conquered  in the fourth century of our era when the german populations on impulse of certain huns expelled from the chinese frontier or for other reasons valid to themselves began flowing universally southward to take possession of the rich roman world and so continued flowing for two centuries more the old german frontiers generally and especially those northern baltic countries were left comparatively vacant so that new immigrating populations from the east all of sclavic origin easily obtained footing and supremacy there in the northern parts these immigrating sclaves were of the kind called vandals or wends they spread themselves as far west as hamburg and the ocean south also far over the elbe in some quarters while other kinds of sclaves were equally busy elsewhere with what difficulty in settling the new boundaries and what inexhaustible funds of quarrel thereon is still visible to every one though no historian was there to say the least word of it all of sclavic origin but who knows of how many kinds wends here in the north through the lausitz lusatia and as far as thuringen not to speak of polacks bohemian czechs huns bulgars and the other dim nomenclatures on the eastern frontier five hundred years of violent unrecorded fighting abstruse quarrel with their new neighbors in settling the marches many names of towns in germany ending in itz meuselwitz mollwitz or bearing the express epithet windisch wendish still give indication of those old sad circumstances as does the word slave in all our western languages meaning captured sclavonian what longdrawn echo of bitter rage and hate lies in that small etymology  these things were but they have no history why should they have any enough that in those baltic regions there are for the time year 600 and till long after charlemagne is out sclaves in place of suevi or of holstein saxons and angli that it is now shaggy wends who have the task of taming the jungles and keeping down the otters and wolves wends latterly in a waning condition much beaten upon by charlemagne and others but never yet beaten out and so it has to last century after century wends wolves wild swine all alike dumb to us dumb or sounding only one huge unutterable message seemingly of tragic import like the voice of their old forests of their old baltic seasperhaps more edifying to us so here at last is a definite date and event  ad 928 henry the fowler marching across the frozen bogs took brannibor a chief fortress of the wends kohler reichshistorie frankfurth und leipzig 1737 p 63 michaelis churund furstlichen hauser in deutschland lemgo 1759 1760 1785 i 255first mention in human speech of the place now called brandenburg bor or burg of the brenns if there ever was any tribe of brennsbrennus there as elsewhere being name for king or leader burg of the woods say otherswho as little know probably at that time a town of clay huts with dith and palisaded sodwall round it certainly a chief fortress of the wendswho must have been a good deal surprised at sight of henry on the rimy winter morning near a thousand years ago  this is the grand old henry called the fowler heinrich der vogler because he was in his vogelheerde falconry or hawkestablishment seeing his hawks fly in the upland hartz country when messengers came to tell him that the german nation through its princes and authorities assembled at fritzlar had made him king and that he would have dreadful work henceforth which he undertook and also didthis of brannibor only one small item of itwarring right manfully all his days against chaos in that country no rest for him thenceforth till he died the beginning of german kings the first or essentially the first sovereign of united germanycharlemagnes posterity to the last bastard having died out and only anarchy italian and other being now the alternative  a very high king says one whose notebooks i have got an authentically noble human figure visible still in clear outline in the gray dawn of modern history the father of whatever good has since been in germany he subdued his dukes schwaben baiern swabia bavaria and others who were getting too hereditary and inclined to disobedience he managed to get back lorraine made truce with the hungarians who were excessively invasive at that time truce with the hungarians and then having gathered strength made dreadful beating of them two beatingsone to each half for the invasive savagery had split itself for better chance of plunder first beating was at sondershausen second was at merseburg year 933which settled them considerably another beating from henrys son and they never came back beat wends before thisbrannibor through frozen bogs five years ago beat sclavic meisseners misnians bohehemian czechs and took prag wends again with huge slaughter then danes and made king worm tributary king gorm the hard our knuts or canutes greatgrandfather year 931last of all those invasive hungarians as above had sent the hungarians when they demanded tribute or blackmail of him as heretofore truce being now outa mangy hound there is your blackmail sirs make much of that  he had the image of st michael painted on his standard contrary to wont he makes or remakes markgrafs wardens of the marches to be under his dukesand not too hereditary who his markgraves were dim history counts them to the number of six kohler reichhistorie p 66 this is by no means kohlers chief book but this too is good and does in a solid effective way what it attempts he seems to me by far the best historical genius the germans have yet produced though i do not find much mention of him in their literary histories and catalogues a man of ample learning and also of strong cheerful human sense and human honesty whom it is thricepleasant to meet with in those ghastly solitudes populous chiefly with doleful creatures which take in their order  1 sleswig looking over into the scandinavian countries and the norse seakings this markgraviate did not last long under that title i guess it became stadeandditmarsch afterwards  2 soltwedelwhich grows to be markgraviate of brandenburg by and by soltwedel now called salzwedel an old town still extant sixty miles to west and north of brandenburg short way south of the elbe was as yet headquarters of this second markgraf and any warden we have at brandenburg is only a deputy of him or some other  3 meissen which we call misnia a country at that time still full of wends  4 lausitz also a very wendish country called in english maps lusatiawhich is its name in monklatin not now a spoken language did not long continue a markgraviate fell to

look after the hungarians and their valuable claims to blackmail  6 antwerp atthewharf ontwharf so to speak against the french which function soon fell obsolete  these were henrys six markgraviates as my best authority enumerates them and in this way he had militia captains ranked all round his borders against the intrusive sclavic element he fortified towns all towns are to be walled and wardedto be burgs in fact and the inhabitants burghers or men capable of defending burgs everywhere the ninth man is to serve as soldier in his town other eight in the country are to feed and support him

be forgottenhail brave henry across the nine dim centuries we salute thee still visible as a valiant son of cosmos and son of heaven beneficently sent us as a man who did in grim earnest serve god in his day and whose works accordingly bear fruit to our day and to all days  so far my rough notebooks which require again to be shut for the present not to abuse the readers patience or lead him from his road  this of markgrafs grafs of the marches marked places or boundaries was a natural invention in that state of circumstances it did not quite originate with henry but was much perfected by him he first recognizing how essential it was on all frontiers he had his graf count reeve greeve whom some think to be only grau gray or senior the hardiest wisest steelgray man he could discover stationed on the marck strenuously doing watch and ward there the post of difficulty of peril and naturally of honor too nothing of a sinecure by any means which post like every other always had a tendency to become hereditary if the kindred did not fail in fit men and hence have come the innumerable markgraves marquises and such like of modern times titles now become chimerical and more or less mendacious as most of our titles arelike so many burgs changed into boroughs and even into rotten boroughs with defensive burghers of the known sort very mournful to discover once norroy was not all pasteboard at the heart of that huge whirlwind of his with its dusty heraldries and phantasmal nomenclatures now become mendacious there lay at first always an earnest human fact henry the fowler was so happy as to have the fact without any mixture of mendacity we are in the sad reverse case reverse case not yet altogether complete but daily becoming soone of the saddest and strangest ever heard of if we thought of itbut to go on with business  markgraviates there continued to be ever aftersix in henrys timebut as to the number place arrangement of them all this varied according to circumstances outward and inward chiefly according to the regress or the reintrusion of the circumambient hostile populations and underwent many changes the seawall you build and what main floodgates you establish in it will depend on the state of the outer sea markgraf of sleswig grows into markgraf of ditmarsch and stade retiring over the elbe if norse piracy get very triumphant antwerp falls obsolete so does meissen by and by lausitz and salzwedel in the third century hence shrink both into brandenburg which was long only a subaltern station managed by deputy from one or other of these a markgraf that prospered in repelling of his wends and huns had evidently room to spread himself and could become very great and produce change in boundaries observe what oesterreich austria grew to and what brandenburg meissen too which became modern saxony a state once greater than it now is  in old books are lists of the primitive markgraves of brandenburg from henrys time downward two sets markgraves of the witekind race and of another hubner genealogische tabellen leipzig 17251728 i 172 173 a book of rare excellence in its kind but they are altogether uncertain a shadowy intermittent set of markgraves both the witekind set and the nonwitekind and truly for a couple of centuries seem none of them to have been other than subaltern deputies belonging mostly to lausitz or salzwedel of whom therefore we can say nothing here but must leave the first two hundred years in their natural gray stateperhaps sufficiently conceivable by the reader  but thus at any rate was brandenburg bot or burg of the brenns whatever these are first discovered to christendom and added to the firm land of articulate history a feat worth putting on record done by henry the fowler in the year of grace 928while among other things noticeable in this world our knuts greatgrandfather gormo durus henrys tributary was still king of denmark when harald bluetooth blaatand was still a young fellow with his

of his dominions  that henry appointed due wardenship in brannibor was in the common course sure enough some markgraf must take charge of branniborhe of the lausitz eastward for example or he of salzwedel westwardthat brannibor in time will itself be found the fit place and have its own markgraf of brandenburg this and what in the next nine centuries brandenburg will grow to henry is far from surmising brandenburg is fairly captured across the frozen bogs and has got a warden and ninthman garrison settled in it brandenburg like other things will grow to what it can  henrys son and successor if not himself is reckoned to have founded the cathedral and bishopric of brandenburghis clergy and he always longing much for the conversion of these wends and huns which indeed was as the like still is the one thing needful to rugged heathens of that kind     chapter ii  preussen saint adalbert  five hundred miles and more to the east of brandenburg lies a country then as now called preussen prussia proper inhabited by heathens where also endeavors at conversion aregoing on though without success hitherto upon which we are now called to cast a glance  it is a moory flat country full of lakes and woods like brandenburg spreading out into grassy expanses and bosky wildernesses humming with bees plenty of bog in it but plenty also of alluvial mud sand too but by no means so high a ratio of it as in brandenburg tracts of preussen are luxuriantly grassy frugiferous apt for the plough and the soil generally is reckoned fertile though lying so far northward part of the great plain or flat which stretches sloping insensibly continuously in vast expanse from the silesian mountains to the amberregions of the baltic preussen is the seaward more alluvial part of thisextending west and east on both sides of the weichsel vistula from the regions of the oder river to the main stream of the memel borderingonrussia its name signifies borrussia brussia prussia orsome say it was only on a certain inconsiderable river in those parts river reussen that it bordered and not on the great country or any part of it which now in our days is conspicuously its next neighbor who knows  in henry the fowlers time and long afterwards preussen was a vehemently heathen country the natives a miscellany of rough serbic wends letts swedish goths or dryasdust knows not whatvery probably a sprinkling of swedish goths from old time chiefly along the coasts dryasdust knows only that these preussen were a strongboned iracund herdsmanandfisher people highly averse to be interfered with in their religion especially famous otherwise through all the centuries for the amber they had been used to fish and sell in foreign parts  amber science declares is a kind of petrified resin distilled by pines that were dead before the days of adam which is now thrown up in stormy weather on that remote coast and is there fished out by the amphibious peoplewho can likewise get it by running mineshafts into the sandhills on their coastby whom it is sold into the uttermost parts of the earth arabia and beyond from a very early period of time no doubt pytheas had his eye upon this valuable product when he ventured into survey of those regionswhich are still the great mother of amber in our world by their amberfishery with the aid of dairyproduce and plenty of beef and leather these heathen preussen of uncertain miscellaneous breed contrived to support existence in a substantial manner they figure to us as an inarticulate heavyfooted rather iracund people their knowledge of christianity was trifling their aversion to knowing anything of it was great  as poland and the neighbors to the south were already christian and even the bohemian czechs were mostly converted pious wishes as to preussen we may fancy were a constant feeling but no effort hitherto if efforts were made had come to anything let some daring missionary go to preach in that country his reception is of the worst or perhaps he is met on the frontier with menaces and forbidden to preach at all except sorrow and lost labor nothing has yet proved attainable it was very dangerous to goand with what likelihood of speeding efforts we may suppose are rare but the pious wish being continual and universal efforts can never altogether cease from henry the fowlers capture of brannibor count seventy years we find henrys greatgrandson reigning as elective kaiserotto iii last of the direct saxon kaisers otto wonder of the worldand alongside of ottos great transactions which were once called mirabilia mundi and are now fallen so extinct there is the following small transaction a new attempt to preach in preussen going on which contrariwise is still worth taking notice of  about the year 997 or 996 adalbert bishop of prag a very zealous most devout man but evidently of hot temper and liable to get into quarrels had determined after many painful experiences of the perverse ungovernable nature of corrupt mankind to give up his nominally christian flock altogether to shake the dust off his feet against prag and devote himself to converting those prussian heathen who across the frontiers were living in such savagery and express bondage to the devil worshipping mere stocks and stones in this enterprise he was encouraged by the christian potentates who lay contiguous especially by the duke of poland to whom such nextneighbors for all reasons were an eyesorrow  adalbert went accordingly with staff and scrip two monks attending him into that dangerous country not in fear he a devout hightempered man verging now on fifty his hair getting gray and face marred with innumerable troubles and provocations of past time he preached zealously almost fiercelythough chiefly with his eyes and gestures i should think having no command of the language at dantzig among the swedishgoth kind of heathen he had some success or affluence of attendance not elsewhere that we hear of in the pillau region for example where he next landed an amphibious heathen lout hit him heavily across the shoulders with the flat of his oar sent the poor preacher to the ground face foremost and suddenly ended his salutary discourse for that time however he pressed forward regardless of results preaching the evangel to all creatures who were willing or unwillingand pressed at last into the sacred circuit the romova or place of oaktrees and of wooden or stone idols bangputtis patkullos and i know not what diabolic dumb blocks which it was death to enter the heathen priests as we may conceive it rushed out beckoned him with loud unintelligible bullyings and fierce gestures to begone hustled shook him shoved him as he did not go then took to confused striking struck finally a deathstroke on the head of poor adalbert so that he stretched out both his arms jesus receive me thou and fell with his face to the ground and lay dead therein the form of a crucifix say his biographers only the attendant monks escaping to tell  attendant monks or adalbert had known nothing of their being on forbidden ground their accounts of the phenomenon accordingly leave it only half explained how he was surprised by armed heathen devilsservants in his sleep was violently set upon and his beautiful bowels pulchra viscera were run through with seven spears but this of the romova or sacred bangputtis church of oaktrees perhaps chief romova of the country rashly intruded into with consequent strokes and fall in the form of a crucifix appears now to be the intelligible account

for the real manner of adalberts exitno doubt of the essential transaction or that it was a very flaming one on both sides the date given is 23d april 997 date famous in the romish calendar since  he was a czech by birth son of a heathen bohemian man of rank his name adalbert albert brightinnobleness he got at magdeburg whither he had gone to study and seek baptism where as generally elsewhere his fervent devout ways were admirable to his fellowcreatures a man of genius we may well say one of heavens bright souls born into the muddy darkness of this worldlaid hold of by a transcendent message in the due transcendent degree he entered prag as bishop not in a carriage and six but walking barefoot his contempt for earthly shadows being always extreme accordingly his quarrels with the soeculum were constant and endless his wanderings up and down and vehement arguings in this world to little visible effect lasted all his days we can perceive he was shorttempered thin of skin a violently sensitive man for example once in the bohemian solitudes on a summer afternoon in one of his thousandfold pilgrimings and wayfarings he had lain down to rest his one or two monks and he in some still glade with a stone for his pillow as was always his custom even in prag and had fallen sound asleep a bohemian shepherd chanced to pass that way warbling something on his pipe as he wended towards looking after his flock seeing the sleepers on their stone pillows the thoughtless czech mischievously blew louderstarted adalbert broad awake upon him who in the fury of the first moment shrieked deafness on thee man cruel to the human sense of hearing or words to that effect which curse like the most of adalberts was punctually fulfilled the amazed czech stood deaf as a post and went about so all his days after nay for long centuries perhaps down to the present time in remote parts no czech blows into his pipe in the woodlands without certain precautions and preliminary fuglings of a devotional nature bollandus ubi suprafrom which miracle as indeed from many other indications i infer an irritable nervoussystem in poor adalbert and find this death in the romova was probably a furious mixture of earth and heaven  at all events he lies there beautiful though bloody in the form of a crucifix zealous adalbert the hot spirit of him now at last coldand has clapt his mark upon the heathen country protesting to the last this was in the year 997 think the best  antiquaries it happened at a place called fischhausen near pillau say they on that narrow strip of country which lies between the baltic and the frische haf immense lake wash as we should say or leakage of shallow water one of two such which the baltic has spilt out of it in that quarternear the fort and haven of pillau where there has been much stir since where napoleon for one thing had some tough fighting prior to the treaty of tilsit fifty years ago the placeor if not this place then gnesen in poland the final burialplace of adalbert which is better knownhas ever since had a kind of sacredness better or worse expressed by mankind in the form of canonization endless pilgrimages rumored miracles and such like for shortly afterwards the neighboring potentate boleslaus duke of poland heartstruck at the event drew sword on these heathens and having if i remember gained some victory bargained to have the body of adalbert delivered to him at its weight in gold body all cut in pieces and nailed to poles had long ignominiously withered in the wind perhaps it was now only buried overnight for the nonce being dug up or being cut down and put into the balance it weighedless than was expected it was as light as gossamer said pious rumor had such an excellent odor tooand came for a mere nothing of gold this was adalberts first miracle after death in life he had done many hundreds of them and has done millions sincechiefly upon paralytic nervoussystems and the element of pious rumorwhich any devilsadvocate then extant may explain if he can kaiser otto wonder of the world who had known st adalbert in life and much honored him made a pilgrimage to his tomb at gnesen in the year 1000and knelt there we may believe with thoughts wondrous enough great and sad enough  there is no hope of converting preussen then it will never leave off its dire worship of satan then say not never that is a weak word st adalbert has stamped his life upon it in the form of a crucifix in lasting protest against that     chapter iii  markgraves of brandenburg  meanwhile our first enigmatic set of markgraves or deputymarkgraves at brandenburg are likewise faring ill whoever these valiant steelgray gentlemen might be which dryasdust does not the least know and only makes you more uncertain the more he pretends to tell one thing is very evident they had no peaceable possession of the place nor for above a hundred years a constant one on any terms the wends were highly disinclined to conversion and obedience once and again and still again they burst up got temporary hold of brandenburg hoping to keep it and did frightful heterodoxies there so that to our distressed imagination those poor markgraves of witekind descent our first set in brandenburg become altogether shadowy intermittent enigmatic painfully actual as they once were take one instance omitting others which happily proves to be the finish of that first shadowy line and introduces us to a new set very slightly more substantial     end of the first shadowy line  in the year 1023 near a century after henry the fowlers feat the wends bursting up in neverimagined fury get hold of brandenburg againfor the third and one would fain hope the last time the reason was words spoken by the then markgraf of brandenburg dietrich or theodoric last of the witekind markgraves who hearing that a cousin of his markgraf or deputymarkgraf like himself was about wedding his daughter to mistevoi king of the wends said too earnestly dont will you give your daughter to a dog word dog was used says my authority see michaelis chur und furstlichen hauser i 257259 pauli allgemeine preussische staatsgeschichte halle

the harlungsbergin our time marienberg pleasant hill near brandenburg with its gardens vines and whitened cottageson the top of this harlungsherg the wends set up their god triglaph a threeheaded monster of which i have seen prints beyond measure ugly something like three whalescubs combined by boiling or a triple porpoise deaddrunk for the dull eyes are inexpressible as well as the amorphous shape ugliest and stupidest of all false gods this these victorious wends set up on the harlungsberg year 1023 and worshipped after their sort benighted mortalswith joy for a time the cathedral was in ashes priests all slain or fled shadowy markgraves the like church and state lay in ashes and triglaph like a triple porpoise under the influence of laudanum stood i know not whether on his head or on his tail aloft on the harlungsberg as the supreme of this universe for the time being     second shadowy line  whereupon the ditmarschstade markgrafs as some designate them had to interfere these shadowy deputies of the witekind breed having vanished in that manner the ditmarschers recovered the place and with some fighting did in the main at least keep triglaph and the wends out of it in time coming the wends were fiercely troublesome and fought much but i think they never actually got hold of brandenburg again they were beginning to get notions of conversion well preached to and well beaten upon you cannot hold out forever even mistevoi at one time professed tendencies to christianity perhaps partly for his brides sakethe dog we may call him in a milder sense but he relapsed dreadfully after that insult and his son worse on the other hand mistevois grandson was so zealous he went about with the missionary preachers and interpreted their german into wendish oh my poor wends will you hear then will you understand this solid earth is but a shadow heaven forever or else hell forever that is the reality such difference between right and wrong no wend had heard of before quite tremendously important if trueand doubtless it impressed many there are heavy ditmarsch strokes for the unimpressible by degrees all got converted though many were killed first and one way or other the wends are preparing to efface themselves as a distinct people  this stadeandditmarsch family of anglish or saxon breed if that is an advantage seem generally to have furnished the salzwedel office as well of which brandenburg was an offshoot done by deputy usually also of their kin they lasted in brandenburg rather more than a hundred yearswith little or no bookhistory that is

adventure with ludwig the springer romantic mythic man famous in the german world over whom my readers and i must not pause at this time  in salzwedel in ditmarsch or wherever stationed they had a

heathen say the old books and pass on to another of all which there is now silence forever so many years men fought and planned and struggled there all forgotten now except by the gods and silently gave away their life before those countries could become fencible and habitable nay my friend it is our lot too and if we would win honor in this universe the rumor of histories and morning newspaperswhich have to become wholly zero one day and fall dumb as stones and which were not perhaps very wise even while speakingwill help us little     substantial markgraves glimpse of the contemporary kaisers  the ditmarschstade kindred much slain in battle with the heathen and otherwise beaten upon died out about the year 1130 earlier perhaps perhaps later for all is shadowy still and were succeeded in the salzwedel part of their function by a kindred called of ascanien and ballenstadt the ascanier or analt markgraves whose history and that of brandenburg becomes henceforth articulate to us a history not doubtful or shadowy any longer but ascertainable if reckoned worth ascertaining who succeeded in ditmarsch let us by no means inquire the empire itself was in some disorder at this time more abstruse of aspect than usual and these northern markgrafs already become important people and deep in general politics had their own share in the confusion that was going  it was about this same time that a second line of kaisers had died out the frankish or salic line who had succeeded to the saxon of henry the fowlers blood for the empire too though elective had always a tendency to become hereditary and go in lines if the last kaiser left a son not unfit who so likely as the son but he needed to be fit otherwise it would not answerotherwise it might be worse

before long his very son going against him and came almost to actual want of bread had not the bishop of liege been good to him nay after death he lay four years waiting vainly even for burialbut indeed cared little about that  certainly this son of his kaiser henry v does not shine in filial piety but probably the poor lad himself was hard bested he also came to die ad 1125 still little over forty and was the last of the frankish kaisers he left the reichsinsignien crown sceptre and coronation gear to his widow and young friedrich of hohenstauffen a sisters son of hishoping the said friedrich might partly by that help follow as kaiser which friedrich could not do being wheedled both the widow and he out of their insignia under false pretences and otherwise left in the lurch not friedrich but one lothar a stirring man who had grown potent in the saxon countries was elected kaiser in the end after waiting till lothar was done friedrichs race did succeed and with

forgotten that the widow we here speak of kaiser henry vs widow who brought no heir to henry v was our english henry beauclercs daughtergranddaughter therefore of william conquerorthe same who having in 1127 the second year of her widowhood married godefroi count of anjou produced our henry ii and our plantagenets and thereby through her victorious controversies with king stephen that noble peer whose breeches stood him so cheap became very celebrated as the empress maud in our old historybooks mathildis dowager of kaiser henry v to whom he gave his reichsinsignia at dying she is the empress maud of english books and relates herself in this manner to the hohenstauffen dynasty and intricate german vicissitudes be thankful for any hook whatever on which to hang half an acre of thrums in fixed position out of your way the smallest flintspark in a world all black and unrememberable will be welcome  and so we return to brandenburg and the ascanien and ballenstadt series of markgraves     chapter iv  albert the bear  this ascanien happily has nothing to do with brute of troy or the pious aeneass son it is simply the name of a most ancient castle etymology unknown to me ruins still dimly traceable on the north slope of the hartz mountains short way from ascherslebenthe castle and town of aschersleben are so to speak a second edition of ascanien ballenstadt is still older ballenstadt was of age in charlemagnes time and is still a respectable little town in that upland range of country the kindred called grafs and ultimately herzogs dukes of ascanien and ballenstadt are very famous in old german history especially down from this date some reckon that they had intermittently been markgrafs in their region long before this which is conceivable enough at all events it is very plain they did now attain the office in salzwedel straightway shifting it to brandenburg and held it continuously it and much else that lay adjacent for centuries in a highly conspicuous manner  in brandenburg they lasted for about two hundred years in their saxon dignities the younger branch of them did not die out and give place to the wettins that now are for five hundred nay they have still their representatives on the earth leopold of anhaltdessau celebrated old dessauer come of the junior branches is lineal head of the kin in friedrich wilhelms time while our little fritzchen lies asleep in his cradle at berlin and a certain prince of anhaltzerbst colonel in the prussian army authentic prince but with purse much shorter than pedigree will have a daughter by and by who will go to russia and become almost too conspicuous as catharine ii there  brandenburg now as afterwards says one of my old papers was officially reckoned saxon part of the big duchy of saxony where certain famed billungs lineage of an old count billung connected or not with billingsgate in our country i do not know had long borne sway of which big old billungs i will say nothing at allthis only that they died out and a certain albert count of ascanien and ballenstadt say of anhalt in modern terms whose mother was one of their daughters came in for the northern part of their inheritance he made a clutch at the southern too but did not long retain that being a man very swift and very sharp at once nimble and strong in the huge scramble that there then wasuncle billung dead without heirs a salic line of emperors going or gone out and a hohenstauffen not yet come inhe made a rich game of it for himself the rather as lothar the intermediate kaiser was his cousin and there were other good cards which he played well  this is he they call albert the bear albrecht der bar first of the ascanien markgraves of brandenburgfirst wholly definite markgraf of brandenburg that there is once a very shining figure in the world though now fallen dim enough again it is evident he had a quick eye as well as a strong hand and could pick what way was straightest among crooked things he got the northern part of what is still called saxony and kept it in his family got the brandenburg countries withal got the lausitz was the shining figure and great man of the north in his day the markgrafdom of salzwedel which soon became of brandenburg he very naturally acquired ad 1142 or earlier very naturally considering what saxon and other honors and possessions he had already got hold of  we can only say it was the luckiest of events for brandenburg and the beginning of all the better destinies it has had a conspicuous country ever since in the world and which grows ever more so in our late times  he had many wars inextricable coil of claimings quarrellings and agreeings fought muchfought in italy too against the pagans saracens that is cousin to one kaiser the lothar above named then a chief stay of the hohenstauffen of the two hohenstauffens who followed a restless muchmanaging widewarring man he stood true by the great barbarossa second of the hohenstauffen greatest of all the kaisers which was a luck for him and perhaps a merit he kept well with three kaisers in his time had great quarrels with henry the lion about that billung saxon heritage henry carrying off the better part of it from albert except that same henry head of the guelphs or welfs who had not alberts talent though wider lands than albert there was no german prince so important in that time  he transferred the markgrafdom to brandenburg probably as more central in his wide lands salzwedel is henceforth the led markgrafdom or marck and soon falls out of notice in the world salzwedel is called henceforth ever since the old marck alte marck altmarck  the brandenburg countries getting the name of new marck modern neumark modern middlemarck in which stands brandenburg itself in our time uckermarck outside marckword ucker is still seen in ukraine for instance these are posterior divisions fallen upon as brandenburg under albert chiefly enlarged itself and needed new official parcellings into departments  under albert the markgrafdom had risen to be an electorate withal the markgraf of brandenburg was now furthermore the kurfurst of brandenburg officially archtreasurer of the holy roman empire and one of the seven who have a right which became about this time an exclusive one for those seven to choose to kieren the romish kaiser and who are therefore called kur princes kurfurste or electors as the highest dignity except the kaisers own in reference to which abstruse matter likely to concern us somewhat will the uninstructed english reader consent to the following excerpt slightly elucidatory of kurfursts and their function  furst prince i suppose is equivalent originally to our noun of number first the old verb kieren participle erkoren still in use not to mention valkyr and other instances is essentially the same word as our choose being written kiesen as well as kieren nay say the etymologists it is also written kussen to kissto choose with such emphasis and is not likely to fall obsolete in that formthe other six electoral dignitaries who grew to eight by degrees and may be worth noting once by the readers of this book are  1 three

far as an indignant kaiser could and the vote and kur of pfalz was given to his cousin of baiern bavariaso far as an indignant kaiser could however at the peace of westphalia 1648 it was found incompetent to any kaiser to abrogate pfulz or the like of pfalz a kurfurst of the empire so after jargon inconceivable it was settled that pfalz must be reinstated though with territories much clipped and at the bottom of the list not the top as formerly and that baiern who could not stand to be balked after twenty years possession must be made eighth elector the ninth we saw year 1692 was gentleman ernst of hanover there never was any tenth and the holy romische reich which was a grand object once but had gone about in a superannuated and plainly crazy state for some centuries back was at last put out of pain by napoleon 6th august 1806 and allowed to cease from this world ms penes me  none of alberts wars are so comfortable to reflect on as those he had with the anarchic wends whom he now fairly beat to powder and either swept away or else damped down into christianity and keeping of the peace swept them away otherwise peopling their lands extensively with colonists from holland whom an inroad of the sea had rendered homeless there which surely was a useful exchange nothing better is known to me of albert the bear than this his introducing large numbers of dutch netherlanders into those countries men thrown out of work who already knew how to deal with bog and sand by mixing and delving and who first taught brandenburg what greenness and cowpasture was the wends in presence of such things could not but consent more and more to efface themselveseither to become german and grow milk and cheese in the dutch manner or to disappear from the world  the wendish princes had a taste for german wives in which just taste the albert genealogy was extremely willing to indulge them affinities produce inheritances by proper marriagecontracts you can settle on what side the most contingent inheritance shall at length fall dim but pretty certain lies a time coming when the wendish princes also shall have effaced themselves and all shall be germanbrandenburgish not wendish any morethe actual inhabitants of brandenburg therefore are either come of dutch bogfarmers or are simple lower saxons anglosaxon if you like that better plattteutsch of the common type an unexceptionable breed of people streaks of wendish population extruded gradually into the remoter quagmires and more inaccessible less valuable sedgy moors and seastrands are scattered about mecklenburg which still subsists separately after a sort is reckoned peculiarly wendish in mecklenburg pommern pommerellen little pomerania are still to be seen physiognomies of a wendish or vandalic type more of cheek than there ought to be and less of brow otherwise good enough physiognomies of their kind but the general mass tempered with such admixtures is of the plattdeutsch saxon or even anglish character we are familiar with here at home a patient stout people meaning considerable things and very incapable of speaking what it means  albert was a fine tall figure himself der schone albert the handsome was his name as often as albert the bear that latter epithet he got not from his looks or qualities but merely from his heraldic cognizance a bear on his shield as was then the mode of names surnames being scant and not yet fixedly in existence thus too his contemporaries henry the lion of saxony and welfdom william the lion of scotland were not either of them specially leonine men nor had the plantagenets or geoffrey of anjou any connection with the plant of broom except wearing a twig of it in their caps on occasion men are glad to get some designation for a grand albert they are often speaking of which shall distinguish him from the many small ones albert the bear der bar will do as well as another  it was this one first that made brandenburg peaceable and notable we might call him the second founder of brandenburg he in the middle of the twelfth century completed for it what henry the fowler had begun early in the tenth after two hundred and fifty years of barking and worrying the wends are now finally reduced to silence their anarchy well buried and wholesome dutch cabbage planted over it albert did several great things in the world but this for posterity remains his memorable feat not done quite easily but done big destinies of nations or of persons are not founded gratis in this world he had a sore toilsome time of it coercing warring managing among his fellowcreatures while his days work lastedfifty years or so for it began early he died in his castle of ballenstadt peaceably among the hartz mountains at last in the year 1170 age about sixtyfive it was in the time while thomas a becket was roving about the world coming home excommunicative and finally getting killed in canterbury cathedralwhile abbot samson still a poor little brown boy came over from norfolk holding by his mothers hand to st edmundsbury having seen santanas s with outspread wings fearfully busy in this world      chapter v  conrad of hohenzollern and kaiser barbarossa  it was in those same years that a stout young fellow conrad by name far off in the southern parts of germany set out from the old castle of hohenzollern where he was but junior and had small outlooks upon a very great errand in the world from hohenzollern bound now towards gelnhausen kaiserslautern or whatever temporary lodging the great kaiser barbarossa might be known to have who was a wandering man his business lying everywhere over half the world and needing the masters eye conrads purpose is to find barbarossa and seek fortune under him  this is a very indisputable event of those same years the exact date the figure circumstances of it were most likely never written anywhere but on conrads own brain and are now rubbed out forevermore but the event itself is certain and of the highest concernment to this narrative somewhere about the year 1170 likeliest a few years before that rentsch brandenburgischer cederhein baireuth 1682 pp 273276see also johann

constance and its lake but well aloft near the springs of the danube its back leaning on the black forest it is perhaps definable as the southern summit of that same huge old hercynian wood which is

fanciful dryasdust doing a little etymology will tell you the name zollern is equivalent to tollery or place of tolls whereby hohenzollern comes to mean the high or upper tolleryand gives one the notion of antique pedlers climbing painfully out of italy and the swiss valleys thus far unstrapping their packhorses here and chaffering in unknown dialect about toll poor soulsit may be so but we do not know nor shall it concern us this only is known that a human kindred probably of some talent for coercing anarchy and guiding mankind had centuries ago built its burg there and done that function in a small but creditable way ever sincekindred possibly enough derivable from thassilo charlemagne king dagobert and other kings but certainly from adam and the almighty maker who had given it those qualitiesand that conrad a junior member of the same now goes forth from it in the way we see why should a young fellow that has capabilities thought conrad stay at home in hungry idleness with no estate but his javelin and buff jerkin and no employment but his hawks when there is a wide opulent world waiting only to be conquered this was conrads thought and it proved to be a very just one  it was now the flowertime of the romish kaisership of germany about the middle or noon of barbarossa himself second of the hohenstauffens and greatest of all the kaisers of that or any other house kaiser fallen unintelligible to most modern readers and wholly unknown which is a pity no king so furnished out with apparatus and arena with personal faculty to rule and scene to do it in has appeared elsewhere a magnificent magnanimous man holding the reins of the world not quite in the imaginary sense scourging anarchy down and urging noble effort up really on a grand scale a terror to evildoers and a praise to welldoers in this world probably beyond what was ever seen since whom also we salute across the centuries as a choice beneficence of heaven encamped on the plain of roncaglia when he entered italy as he too often had occasion to do his shield was hung out on a high mast over his tent and it meant in those old days ho every one that has suffered wrong here is a kaiser come to judge you as he shall answer it to his master and men gathered round him and actually found some justiceif they could discern it when found which they could not always do neither was the justice capable of being perfect always a fearfully difficult function that of friedrich redbeard but an inexorably indispensable one in this worldthough sometimes dispensed with to the huge joy of anarchy which sings hallelujah through all its newspapers for a season  kaiser friedrich had immense difficulties with his popes with his milanese and the likebesieged milan six times over among other anarchieshad indeed a heavyladen hard time of it his task being great and the greatest he made gebhardus the anarchic governor of milan lie chained under his table like a dog for three days for the man was in earnest in that earnest timeand let us say they are but paltry shammen who are not so in any time paltry and far worse than paltry however high their plumes may be of whom the sick world anarchy both vocal and silent having now swoln rather high is everywhere getting wearygebhardus the anarchic governor lay three days under the kaisers table as it would be well if every anarchic governor of the soft type and of the hard were made to do on occasion asking himself in terrible earnest am i a dog then alas am not i a dog those were serious old times  on the other hand kaiser friedrich had his tourneys his

this was the kaiser to whom conrad addressed himself and he did it with success which may be taken as a kind of testimonial to the worth of the young man details we have absolutely none but there is no doubt that conrad recommended himself to kaiser redbeard nor any that the kaiser was a judge of men very earnest to discern mens worth and capabilities having unspeakable need of worth instead of unworth in those under him we may conclude he had found capabilities in conrad found that the young fellow did effective services as the occasion rose and knew how to work in a swift resolute judicious and exact manner promotion was not likely on other terms still less high promotion  one thing farther is known significant for his successes conrad found favor with the heiress of the vohburg family desirable young heiress and got her to wife the vohburg family now much forgotten everywhere and never heard of in england before had long been of supreme importance of immense possessions and opulent in territories and we need not add in honors and offices in those franconian nurnberg regions and was now gone to this one girl i know not that she had much inheritance after all the vast vohburg properties lapsing all to the kaiser when the male heirs were out but she had pretensions tacit claims in particular the vohburgs had long been habitual or in effect hereditary burggrafs of nurnberg and if conrad had the talent for that office he now in preference to others might have a chance for it sure enough he got it took root in it he and his and in the course of centuries branched up from it high and wide over the adjoining countries waxing towards still higher destinies that is the epitome of conrads history history now become very great but then no bigger than its neighbors and very meagrely recorded of which the reflective reader is to make what he can  there is nothing clearly known of conrad more than these three facts that he was a cadet of hohenzollern whose fathers name and some forefathers names are definitely known in the family archives but do not concern us that he married the heiress of the vohburgs whose history is on record in like manner and that he was appointed burggraf of nurnberg year not precisely knownbut before 1170 as would seem in a reichstag diet of the empire held at regensburg in or about 1170 he formally complains he and certain others all stanch kaisers friends for in fact it was with the kaisers knowledge or at his instigation of henry the lions high procedures and malpractices of henrys league with the pope league with the king of denmark and so forth the said henry having indeed fallen into opposition to a dangerous degreeand signs himself burggraf of nurnberg say the old chronicles rentsch p 276 who cites aventinus trittheim c the old document itself has long since perished i conclude but the chronicles may be accepted as reporters of so conspicuous a thing which was the beginning of long strife in germany and proved the ruin of henry the lion supreme welf grown overbigand cost our english henry ii whose daughter he had married a world of trouble and expense we may remark withal conrad therefore is already burggraf of nurnberg and a man of mark in 1170 and his marriage still more his first sally from the paternal castle to seek his fortune must all be dated earlier  more is not known of conrad except indeed that he did not perish in barbarossas grand final crusade for the antiquaries have again found him signed to some contract or otherwise insignificant document ad 1200 which is proof positive that he did not die in the crusade and proof probable that he was not of itfew hardly any of those stalwart 150000 champions of the cross having ever got home again conrad by this time might have sons come to age fitter for arms and fatigues than he and indeed at nurnberg in deutschland generally as official prince of the empire and man of weight and judgment conrads services might be still more useful and the kaisers interests might require him rather to stay at home in that juncture burggraf of nurnberg he continued to be he and his descendants first in a selective then at length in a directly hereditary way century after century and so long as that office lasted in nurnberg which it did there much longer than in other imperial freecities a comes de zolre of conrads producing was always the man thenceforth  their acts in that station and capacity as burggraves and princes of the empire were once conspicuous enough in german history and indeed are only so dim now because the history itself is and was always dim to us on this side of the sea they did strenuous work in their day and occasionally towered up though little driven by the poor wish of towering or shining without need into the high places of public history they rest now from their labors conrad and his successors in long series in the old monastery of heilsbronn between nurnberg and anspach with tombs to many of them which were very legible for slight biographic purposes in my poor friend rentschs time a hundred and fifty years ago and may perhaps still have some quasiuse as sepulchral brasses to another class of persons one or two of those old buried figures more peculiarly important for our little friend now sleeping in his cradle yonder we must endeavor as the narrative proceeds to resuscitate a little and render visible for moments     of the hohenzollern burggraves generally  as to the office it was more important than perhaps the reader imagines we already saw conrad first burggraf among the magnates of the country denouncing henry the lion every burggraf of nurnberg is in virtue of his office prince of the empire if a man happened to have talent of his own and solid resources of his own which are always on the growing hand with this family here is a basis from which he may go far enough burggraf of nurnberg that means again graf judge defender manager greeve of the kaisers burg or castlein a word kaisers representative and alter egoin the old imperial freetown of nurnberg with much adjacent very complex territory also to administer for the kaiser a flourishing extensive city this old nurnberg with valuable adjacent territory civic and imperial intricately intermixed full of commercial industries opulences not without democratic tendencies nay it is almost in some senses the london and middlesex of the germany that then was if we will consider it  this is a place to give a man chances and try what stuff is in him the office involves a talent for governing as well as for judging talent for fighting also in cases of extremity and what is still better a talent for avoiding to fight none but a man of competent superior parts can do that function i suppose no imbecile could have existed many months in it in the old earnest times conrad and his succeeding hohenzollerns proved very capable to do it as would seem and grew and spread in it waxing bigger and bigger from their first planting there by kaiser barbarossa a successful judge of men and ever since that time from about the year 1170 down to the year 1815when so much was changed owing to another temporary kaiser of new type napoleon his namethe hohenzollerns have had a footing in frankenland and done sovereignty in and round nurnberg with an enlarging territory in that region territory at last of large compass which under the names margrafdom of anspach and of baireuth or in general margrafdom of culmbach which includes both has become familiar in history  for the house went on steadily increasing as it were from the first day the hohenzollerns being always of a growing gaining natureas men are that live conformably to the laws of this universe and of their place therein which as will appear from good study of their old records though idle rumor grounded on no study sometimes says the contrary these hohenzollerns eminently were a thrifty steadfast diligent clearsighted stouthearted line of men of loyal nature withal and even to be called just and pious sometimes to a notable degree men not given to fighting where it could be avoided yet with a good swift stroke in them where it could not princely people after their sort with a high not an ostentatious turn of mind they for most part go upon solid prudence if possible are anxious to reach the goal without treading on any one are peaceable as i often say and by no means quarrelsome in aspect and demeanor yet there is generally in the hohenzollerns a very fierce flash of anger capable of blazing out in cases of urgency this latter also is one of the most constant features i have noted in the long series of them that they grew in frankenland year after year and century after century while it was their fortune to last alive and active there is no miracle on such terms  their old big castle of plassenburg now a penitentiary with treadmill and the other furnishings still stands on its height near culmbach looking down over the pleasant meeting of the red and white mayn rivers and of their fruitful valleys awakening many thoughts in the traveller anspach schloss and still more baireuth schloss mansion one day of our little wilhelmina of berlin fritzkins sister now prattling there in so old a way where notabilities have been one and another which jean paul too saw daily in his walks while alive and looking skyward these and many other castles and things belonging now wholly to bavaria will continue memorable for hohenzollern history  the family did its due share sometimes an excessive one in religious beneficences and foundations which was not quite left off in recent times though much altering its figure erlangen university for example was of wilhelminas doing erlangen universityand also an operahouse of excessive size in baireuth such was poor wilhelminas sad figure of religion in the old days their largest bequest that i recollect was to the teutsche ritter order of teutonic knights very celebrated in those days junior branches from hohenzollern as from other families sought a career in that chivalrous devout brotherhood now and then one pious burggraf had three sons at once in it he a very bequeathing herr otherwise settled one of his mansions virnsperg with rents and incomings on the order which accordingly had thenceforth a comthurei commandery in that country comthurei of virnsperg the name of it the date of donation is ad 1294 and two of the old herrs three ritter sons we can remark were successively comthurs

now say a word     chapter vi  the teutsch ritters or teutonic order  barbarossas army of crusaders did not come home again any more than barbarossa they were stronger than turk or saracen but not than hunger and disease leaders did not know then as our little friend at berlin came to know that an army like a serpent goes upon its belly after fine fighting and considerable victories the end of this crusade was it took to besieging acre and in reality lay perishing as of murrain on the beach at acre without shelter without medicine without food not even richard coeurdelion and his best prowess and help could avert such issue from it  richards crusade fell in with the fagend of barbarossas and it was richard chiefly that managed to take acreat least so richard flattered himself when he pulled poor leopold of austrias standard from the towers and trailed it through the gutters your standard you have taken acre which turned out ill for richard afterwards and duke leopold has a bad name among us in consequence much worse than he deserves leopold had stuff in him too he died for example in this manner falling with his horse i think in some siege or other he had got his leg hurt which hindered him in fighting leg could not be cured cut it off then said leopold this also the leech could not do durst not and would not so that leopold was come quite to a halt leopold ordered out two squires put his thigh upon a block the sharp edge of an axe at the right point across his thigh squire first hold you that axe steady squire second smite you on it with forgehammer with all your strength heavy enough squire second struck heavy enough and the leg flew off but leopold took inflammation died in a day or two as the leech had predicted that is a fact to be found in current authors quite exact or not quite that surgical operation mentzel geschichte der deutschen stuttgard and tubingen 1837 p 309 such a man cannot have his flag trailed through the gutters by any coeurdelionbut we

none a company of pious soulscompassionate lubeck shipcaptains diligently forwarding it and one walpot von bassenheim a citizen of bremen taking the leadformed themselves into a union for succor of the sick and dying set up canvas tents medicinal assuagements from the lubeck shipstores and did what utmost was in them silently in the name of mercy and heaven this walpot as not by birth a nobleman says one of the old chroniclers but his deeds were noble this pious little union proved unconsciously the beginning of a great thing finding its work prosper here and gain favor the little union took vows on itself strict chivalry forms and decided to become permanent knights hospitallers of our dear lady of mount zion that or something equivalent was their first title under walpot their first grandmaster which soon grew to be german order of st mary teutsche ritter of the marieorden or for shortness teutsches ritterthum under which name it played a great part in the world for above three centuries to come and eclipsed in importance both the templars and hospitallers of st john  this was the era of chivalry orders and gelubde time for bodies of men uniting themselves by a sacred vow gelubdewhich word and thing have passed over to us in a singularly dwindled condition club we now call it and the vow if sacred does not aim very high templars and hospitallers were already famous

teutsch order moves to venice  the teutsch ritters earned character in palestine and began to get bequests and recognition but did not long continue there like their two rival orders it was not in palestine whether the orders might be aware of it or not that their work could now lie pious pilgrims certainly there still are in great numbers to these you shall do the sacred rites but these under a saladin bound by his word need little protection by the sword and as for crusading in the armed fashion that has fallen visibly into the decline after barbarossa coeurdelion and philippe auguste have tried it with such failure what wise man will be in haste to try it again zealous popes continue to stir up crusades but the secular powers are not in earnest as formerly secular powers when they do go take constantinople conquer sicily never take or conquer anything in palestine the teutsch order helps valiantly in palestine or would help but what is the use of helping the teutsch order has already possessions in europe by pious bequest and otherwise all its main interests lie there in fine after less than thirty years hermann von der salza a new sagacious teutschmeister or hochmeister

12101239 he is mostly to be found there and not at acre or jerusalem  he is very great with the busy kaiser friedrich ii barbarossas grandson who has the usual quarrels with the pope and is glad of such a negotiator statesman as well as armed monk the usual quarrels this great kaiser had all along and some unusual normans ousted from sicily who used to be so papal a kaiser not gone on the crusade as he had vowed kaiser at last suspected of freethinking evenin which matters hermann much serves the kaiser sometimes he is appointed arbiter between the pope and kaiserdoes not give it in the kaisers favor but against him where he thinks the kaiser is wrong he is reckoned the first great hochmeister this hermann von der salza a thuringer by birth who is fourth in the series of masters perhaps the greatest to be found there at all though many were considerable it is evident that no man of his time was busier in important public affairs or with better acceptance than hermann his order both pope and emperor so favoring the master of it was in a vigorous state of growth all this while hermann well proving that he could help it better at venice than at acre  but if the crusades are endedas indeed it turned out only one other worth speaking of st louiss having in earnest come to effect or rather to miserable noneffect and that not yet for fifty yearsif the crusades are ended and the teutsch order increases always in possessions and finds less and less work what probably will become of the teutsch order grow fat become luxurious incredulous dissolute insolent and need to be burnt out of the way that was the course of the templars and their sad end they began poorest of the poor two knights to one horse as their seal bore and they at last took fire on very opposite accounts to carouse like a templar that had become a proverb among men that was the way to produce combustion spontaneous or other whereas their fellow hospitallers of st john chancing upon new work antiturk garrisonduty so we may call it successively in cyprus rhodes malta for a series of ages and doing it well managed to escape the like as did the teutsch order in a still more conspicuous manner     teutsch order itself goes to preussen  ever since st adalbert fell massacred in prussia stamping himself as a crucifix on that heathen soil there have been attempts at conversion going on by the christian neighbors dukes of poland and others intermittent fits of fighting and preaching for the last two hundred years with extremely small result body of st adalbert was got at light weight and the poor man canonized there is even a titular bishop of prussia and pilgrimages wander to the shrine of adalbert in poland reminding you of prussia in a tragic manner but what avails it missionaries when they set foot in the country are killed or flung out again the bishop of prussia is titular merely lives in liefland livonia properly bishop of riga among the bremen tradingsettlers and converted lieflanders there which is the only safe placeif even that were safe without aid of armed men such as he has there even now he keeps his schwertbruder brothers of the sword a small order of knights recently got up by him for express behoof of liefland itself and these fighting their best are sometimes troublesome to the bishop and do not much prosper upon heathendom or gain popularity and resources in the christian world no hope in the schwertbruder for prussiaand in massacred missionaries what hope the prussian population continues heathen untamable to gospel and law and after two centuries of effort little or no real progress has been made  but now in these circumstances in the year 1226 the titular bishop of prussia having well considered the matter and arranged it with the polish authorities opens a communication with hermann von der salza at venice on the subject crusading is over in the east illustrious hochmeister no duty for a teutsch order there at present what is the use of crusading far off in the east when heathenism and the kingdom of satan hangs on our own borders close at hand in the north let the teutsch order come to preussen head a crusade there the land is fruitful flows really with milk and honey not to speak of amber and was once called the terrestrial paradiseby i forget whom voigt if he had an index knows in fact it is clear the land should belong to christ and if the christian teutsch ritterdom could conquer it from satanas for themselves it would be well for all parties hermann a man of sagacious clear head listens attentively the notion is perhaps not quite new to him at all events he takes up the notion negotiates upon it with titular bishop with pope kaiser duke of poland teutsch order and in brief about two years afterwards ad 1228 having done the negotiatings to the last item he produces his actual teutsch ritters ready on prussian ground  year 1225 thinks dryasdust after a struggle place where proves also at length

themselves on this hand and that and begin their great task in the name of heaven we may still say in a true sense as they every ritter of them to the heart felt it to be in all manner of senses  the prussians were a fierce fighting people fanatically antichristian the teutsch ritters had a perilous neverresting time of it especially for the first fifty years they built and burnt innumerable stockades for and against built wooden forts which are now stone towns they fought much and prevalently galloped desperately to and fro ever on the alert in peaceabler ulterior times they fenced in the nogat and the weichsel with dams whereby unlimited quagmire might become grassy meadowas it continues to this day marienburg marys burg still a town of importance in that same grassy region with its grand stone schloss still visible and even habitable this was at length their headquarter but how many burgs of wood and stone they built in different parts what revolts surprisals furious fights in woody boggy places they had no man has counted their life read in dryasdusts newest chaotic books which are of endless length among other ill qualities is like a dim nightmare of unintelligible

professor little studious of abridgment does not say  but always some preaching by zealous monks accompanied the chivalrous fighting and colonists came in from germany trickling in or at times streaming victorious ritterdom offers terms to the beaten heathen terms not of tolerant nature but which will be punctually kept by ritterdom when the flame of revolt or general conspiracy burnt up again too extensively there was a new crusade proclaimed in germany and christendom and the hochmeister at marburg or elsewhere and all his marshals and ministers were busygenerally with effect high

ottocar voigt iii 8087 with his extensive farshining chivalry conquered samland in a month tore up the romova where adalbert had been massacred and burnt it from the face of the earth a certain fortress was founded at that time in ottocars presence and in honor of him they named it kings fortress konigsberg it is now grown a bigdomed metropolitan citywhere we of this narrative lately saw a coronation going on and sophie charlotte furtively taking a pinch of snuff among king ottocars esquires or subaltern junior officials on this occasion is one rudolf heir of a poor swiss lordship and

for him this ottocar having flown too high and melted his wings at the sun in a sad way as we shall see elsewhere  none of the orders rose so high as the teutonic in favor with mankind it had by degrees landed possessions far and wide over germany and beyond i know not how many dozens of balleys rich bailliwicks each again with its dozens of comthureis commanderies or subordinate groups of estates and baillies and commanders to matchand was thought to deserve favor from above valiant servants these to whom heaven had vouchsafed great labors and unspeakable blessings in some fifty or fiftythree years they had got prussian heathenism brought to the ground and they endeavored to tie it well down there by bargain and arrangement but it would not yet lie quiet nor for a century to come being still secretly heathen revolting conspiring ever again ever on weaker terms till the satanic element had burnt itself out and conversion and composure could ensue  conversion and complete conquest once come there was a happy time for prussia ploughshare instead of sword busy seahavens german towns getting built churches everywhere rising grass growing and peaceable cows where formerly had been quagmire and snakes and for the order a happy time a rich not a happy the order was victorious livonian swordbrothers knights of dobryn minor orders and authorities all round were long since subordinated to it or incorporated with it livonia courland lithuania are all got tamed under its influence or tied down and evidently tamable but it was in these times that the order got into its wider troubles outward and inward quarrels jealousies with christian neighbors poland pommern who did not love it and for causewider troubles and by no means so evidently useful to mankind the orders wages in this world flowed higher than ever only perhaps its work was beginning to run low but we will not anticipate  on the whole this teutsch ritterdom for the first century and more was a grand phenomenon and flamed like a bright blessed beacon through the night of things in those northern countries for above a century we perceive it was the rallying place of all brave men who had a career to seek on terms other than vulgar the noble soul aiming beyond money and sensible to more than hunger in this world had a beacon burning as we say if the night chanced to overtake it and the earth to grow too intricate as is not uncommon better than the career of stumporatory i should fancy and its hesperides apples golden and of gilt horsedung better than puddling away ones poor spiritual gift of

von thuringens biography as a sample of the old ways of proceeding conrad succeeded hermann von der salza as grandmaster and his history is memorable as a teutonic knight     the stuff teutsch ritters were made of conrad of thuringen saint elizabeth town of marburg  conrad younger brother of the landgraf of thuringenwhich prince lived chiefly in the wartburg romantic old hillcastle now a weimareisenach property and showplace then an abode of very earnest peoplewas probably a childinarms in that same wartburg while richard coeurdelion was getting home from palestine and into troubles by the road this will date conrad for us his worthy elder brother was husband of the lady since called saint elizabeth a very pious but also very fanciful young womanand i always guess his going on the crusade where he died straightway was partly the fruit of the life she led him lodging beggars sometimes in his very bed continually breaking his nights rest for prayer and devotional exercise of undue length weeping one moment then smiling in joy the next meandering about capricious melodious weak at the will of devout whim mainly however that does not concern us many lives of the saint see in particular libellus de dictis quatuor ancillarum cthat is report of the evidence got from elizabeths four maids by an official person devilsadvocate or whatever he was missioned by the pope to question them when her canonization came to be talked of a curious piecein meuckenii scriptores rexum germanicarum lipsia 17281730 ii dd where also are other details sure enough her poor landgraf went crusading year 1227 kaiser friedrich iis crusade who could not put it off longer poor landgraf fell ill by the road at brindisi and diednot to be driven farther by any cause  conrad left guardian to his deceased brothers children had at first much quarrel with saint elizabeth though he afterwards took far other thoughts meanwhile he had his own apanage landgraf by rank he too and had troubles enough with that of itself for instance once the archbishop of an mainz being in debt laid a heavy tax on all abbeys under him on reichartsbronn an abbey of conrads among others dont pay it said conrad to the abbot abbot refused accordingly but was put under ban by the popeobliged to comply and even to be whipt thrice before the money could be accepted two whippings at erfurt from the archbishop there had been and a third was just going on there one morning when conrad travelling that way accidentally stept in to matins conrad flames into a blazing whirlwind at the phenomenon disclosed whip my abbot and he is to pay thenarchbishop of beelzebuband took the poor archbishop by the rochets and spun him hither and thither nay was for cutting him in two had hot friends hysterically busied themselves and got the sword detained in its scabbard and the archbishop away here is a fine coil like to be for conrad  another soon follows from a quarrel he had with fritzlar imperial freetown in those parts perhaps a little stiff upon its privileges and high towards a landgraf conrad marches one morning year 1232 upon insolent fritzlar burns the environs but on looking practically at the ramparts of the place thinks they are too high and turns to go home again whereupon the idle women of fritzlar who are upon the ramparts gazing in fear and hope burst into shrill universal jubilation of voiceand even into gestures and liberties with their dress which are not describable in history conrad suddenly once more all flame whirls round storms the ramparts slays what he meets plunders fritzlar with a will and leaves it blazing in a general fire which had broken out in the business here is a pair of coils for conrad the like of which can issue only in papal ban or worse  conrad is grim and obstinate under these aspects but secretly feels himself very wicked knows not well what will come of it sauntering one day in his outer courts he notices a certain female beggar necessitous female of loose life who tremulously solicits charity of him necessitous female gets some fraction of coin but along with it bullying rebuke in very liberal measure and goes away weeping bitterly and murmuring about want that drove me to those courses conrad retires into himself what is her real sin perhaps to mine conrad lies awake all that night mopes about in intricate darkness days and nights rises one morning an altered man he makes pilgrimage to gladbach barefoot kneels down at the churchdoor of fritzlar with bare back and a bundle of rods beside him whip me good injured christians for the love of jesusin brief reconciles himself to christian mankind the pope included takes the teutschritter vows upon him ad 1234 voigt ii 375423 and hastens off to preussen there to spend himself life and lifes resources thenceforth faithfully till he die the one course left for conrad which he follows with a great strong stepwith a thought still audible to me it was of such stuff that teutsch ritters were then made ritters evidently capable of something  saint elizabeth who went to live at marburg in hessencassel after her husbands death and soon died there in a most melodiously pious sort ad 1231 age 24 made the teutsch order guardian of her son it was from her and the grandmastership of conrad that marburg became such a metropolis of the order the grandmasters often residing there many of them coveting burial there and much business bearing date of the place a place still notable to the ingenuous tourist who knows his whereabout philip the magnanimous luthers friend memorable to some as philip with the two wives lived there in that old castlewhich is now a kind of correctionhouse and garrison idle blue uniforms strolling about and unlovely physiognomies with a jingle of iron at their ankleswhere luther has debated with the zwinglian sacramenters and others and much has happened in its time saint elizabeth and her miracles considerable surely of their kind were the first origin of marburg as a town a mere castle with adjoining hamlet before that  strange gray old silent town rich in so many memories it stands there straggling up its rocky hilledge towards its old castles and edifices on the top in a not unpicturesque manner flanked by the river lahn and its fertile plains very silent except for the delirious screech at rare intervals of a railway train passing that way from frankfurtonmayn to cassel church of st elizabethhigh grand church built by conrad our hochmeister in reverence of his once terrestrial sisterinlawstands conspicuous in the plain below where the town is just ending st elizabeths shrine was once there and pilgrims wending to it from all lands conrad himself is buried there as are many hochmeisters their names and shields of arms hermanns foremost though hermanns dust is not there are carved carefully kept legible on the shafts of the gothic archesfrom floor to groin long rows of themand produce with the other tombs tombpaintings by durer and the like thoughts impressive almost to pain st elizabeths loculus was put into its shrine here by kaiser friedrich ii and all manner of princes and grandees of the empire one million two hundred thousand people looking on say the old records perhaps not quite exact in their arithmetic philip the magnanimous wishing to stop pilgrimages nowhither buried the loculus away it was never known where under the floor of that church somewhere as is likeliest enough now of marburg and of its teutsch ritters too  they had one or two memorable hochmeisters and teutschmeisters whom we have not named here nor shall in our excellent kohlers muntzbelustigungen nurnberg 1729 et seqq ii 382 v 102 viii 380 c are valuable glimpses into the teutonic orderas into hundreds of other things the special book upon it is voigts often cited here nine heavy volumes grounded on faithful reading but with a fatal defect of almost every other quality there is one hochmeister somewhere about the fiftieth on the list and properly the last real hochmeister albert of hohenzollernculmbach by name who will be very memorable to us by and by  or will the reader care to know how culmbach came into the possession of the hohenzollerns burggraves of nurnberg the story may be illustrative and will not occupy us long     chapter vii  margraviate of culmbach baireuth anspach  in the year 1248 in his castle of plassenburgwhich is now a correctionhouse looking down upon the junction of the red and white maynotto duke of meran a very great potentate more like a king than a duke was suddenly clutched hold of by a certain wedded gentleman name not given one of his domestics or dependents whom he had enraged beyond forgiveness signally violating the seventh commandment at his expense and was by the said wedded gentleman there and then cut down and done to death lamentably killed jammerlich erstochen says old rentsch p 293

voigtlandvoigtland that is baillieland wide country between nurnberg and the fichtelwald why specially so called dryasdust dimly explains deducing it from certain counts von reuss those strange reusses who always call themselves henry and now amount to henry the eightieth and odd with sidebranches likewise called henry whose nomenclature is the despair of mankind and worse than that of the

slain duke got plassenburg and most of the voigtland a tyrolese magnate whose wife was an aunt of the dukes laid hold of the tyrol and transmitted it to daughters and their spousesthe finish of which line we shall see by and byin short there was much property in a disposable condition the hohenzollern burggraf of nurnberg who had married a younger sister of the dukes two years before this accident managed to get at least baireuth and some adjacencies big orlamunde who had not much better right taking the lions share this of baireuth proved a notable possession to the hohenzollern family it was conrad the first burggrafs greatgrandson friedrich counted friedrich iii among the burggraves who made the acquisition in this manner ad 1248  onolzbach onzbach or brook now called anspach they got some fourscore years after by purchase and hard money down 24000 pounds of farthings whatever that may be ad 1331 stadt anspach by j b fischer anspach 1786 p 196 which proved a notable twin possession of the family and then in some seven years more ad 1338 the big orlamunde people having at length as was too usual fallen considerably insolvent sold plassenburg castle itself the plassenburg with its town of culmbach and dependencies to the hohenzollern burggraves rentsch p 157 who had always ready money about them who in this way got most of the voigtland with a fine fortress into hand and had independently of nurnberg and its imperial properties an important princely territory of their own margraviate or principality of culmbach plassenburg being only the castle was the general title but more frequently in later times being oftenest split in two between brothers unacquainted with primogeniture there were two margraviates made of it one of baireuth called also margraviate on the hill and one of anspach margraviate under the hill of which in their modern designations we shall by and by hear more than enough  thus are the hohenzollern growing and never declining by these few instances judge of many of their hard labors and the storms they had to keep under control we could also say something how the two young sons of the burggraf once riding out with their tutor a big hound of theirs in one of the streets of nurnberg accidentally tore a child and there arose wild motherswail and all the scythesmiths turned out firebreathing deaf to a poor tutors pleadings and explainings and how the tutor who had ridden forth in calm humor with two princes came galloping home with only onethe smiths having driven another into boggy ground and there caught and killed him rentsch p 306 date not given guess about 1270 with the burggrafs commentary on that sad proceeding the same friedrich iii who had married merans sister and the amends exacted by him strict and severe not passionate or inhuman or again how the nurnbergers once in the burggrafs absence built a ringwall round his castle entrance and exit now to depend on the nurnbergers withal and how the burggraf did not fly out into battle in consequence but remedied it by imperturbable countenance and power of driving with enough of the like sort which readers can conceive     burggraf friedrich iii and the anarchy of nineteen years  this same friedrich iii greatgrandson of conrad the first burggraf was he that got the burggraviate made hereditary in his family ad 1273 which thereby rose to the fixed rank of princes among other advantages it was gaining nor did this acquisition come gratis at all but as the fruit of good service adroitly done service of endless importance as it proved friedrichs

country came to pay that visit late in the night 1st or 2d of october 1273 to his cousin rudolf lord of hapsburg under the walls of basel a notable scene in history rudolf was besieging basel being in some feud with the bishop there of which friedrich and another had been proposed as umpires and friedrich now waited on his cousin in this hasty mannernot about the basel feud but on a far higher quite unexpected errandto say that he rudolf was elected kaiser and that better times for the holy roman empire were now probable with heavens help rentsch pp 299 285 298 we call him cousin though what the kindred actually was a kindred by mothers remains except the general fact of it disputable by dryasdust the actual visit under the walls of basel is by some considered romantic but that rudolf tough steelgray man besieging basel on his own quarrel on the terms just stated was altogether unexpectedly apprised of this great news and that cousin friedrich of nurnberg had mainly contributed to such issue is beyond question kohler pp 249 251 the event was salutary like life instead of death to anarchic germany and did eminent honor to friedrichs judgment in men  richard of

no objection to give it up said so to the popewho was himself anxious for a settled kaiser the supplies of papal german cash having run almost dry during these troubles whereupon ensued earnest consultations among leading german men diet of the empire sternly practical we may well perceive and with a minimum of talk the pope too being held rather well at a distance the result of which was what we see 29th september 1273 mainly due to friedrich of nurnberg say all historians conjoining with him the then archbishop of mainz who is officially president elector literally convener of electors they two did it archbishop of mainz had himself a pleasant accidental acquaintance with rudolfa nights lodging once at hapsburg with escort over the hills in dangerous circumstancesand might the more readily be made to understand what qualities the man now had and how in justness of insight toughness of character and general strength of bridlehand this actually might be the adequate man     kaiser rudolf and burggraf friedrich iii  last time we saw rudolf near thirty years ago he was some equerry or subaltern dignitary among the ritters of king ottocar doing a crusade against the prussian heathen and seeing his master found konigsberg in that country changed times now ottocar king of bohemia who by the strong hand mainly and money to richard of cornwall in the late troubles has become duke of austria and much else had himself expected the kaisership and of all astonished men king ottocar was probably the most astonished at the choice made a dread sovereign fierce and terribly opulent and every way resplendent to such degree and this threadbare swiss gentlemanatarms once my domestic as ottocar loved to term it preferred to me flat insanity king ottocar thought refused to acknowledge such a kaiser would not in the least give up his unjust properties or even do homage for them or the others  but there also rudolf contrived to be ready for him rudolf invaded his rich austrian territories smote down vienna and all resistance that there was 1276 kohler p 253 forced ottocar to beg pardon and peace no pardon nor any speech of peace till you first do homage for all those lands of yours whatever we may find them to be ottocar was very loath but could not help himself ottocar quitted prag with a resplendent retinue to come into the danube country and do homage to my domestic that once was he bargained that the sad ceremony should be at least private on an island in the danube between the two retinues or armies and in a tent so that only official select persons might see it the island is called camberg near vienna i conclude in the middle of the donau river there ottocar accordingly knelt he in great pomp of tailorage rudolf in mere buff jerkin practical leather and ironhide it charitable canvas from all but a few alas precisely at this moment the treacherous canvas rushes downhung so on purpose thinks ottocar and it is a tent indeed but a tent without walls and all the world sees me in this scandalous plight  ottocar rode home in deep gloom his poor wife too upbraided him he straightway rallied into war again rudolf again very ready to meet him rudolf met him friedrich of nurnberg there among the rest under the reichsbanner on the marchfeld by the donau modern wagram near by and entirely beat and even slew and ruined

glad but of these there is an heir of ottocars left these will require time and luck  prosperous though toilsome days for rudolf who proved an excellent bit of stuff for a kaiser and found no rest proving what stuff he was in which prosperities as indeed he continued to do in the perils and toils burggraf friedrich iii of nurnberg naturally partook hence and not gratis at all the hereditary burggrafdom and many other favors and accessions he got for he continued rudolfs steady helper friend and firstman in all things to the very end evidently one of the most important men in germany and

have said nothing of the ascanier markgraves electors of brandenburg all this while nor in these limits can we now or henceforth say almost anything a proud enough valiant and diligent line of markgraves who had much fighting and other struggle in the worldsteadily enlarging their border upon the wends to the north and adjusting it with mixed success against the wettin gentlemen who are markgraves farther east in the lausitz now who bound us to the south too meissen misnia and who in fact came in for the whole of modern saxony in the end much fighting too there was with the archbishops of magdeburg now that the wends are down standing quarrel there on the small scale like that of kaiser and pope on the great such quarrel as is to be seen in all places and on all manner of scales in that era of the christian world  none of our markgraves rose to the height of their progenitor albert the bear nor indeed except massed up as alberts line and with a history ever more condensing itself almost to the form of label can they pretend to memorability with us what can dryasdust himself do with them that wholesome dutch cabbages continued to be more and more planted and peatmire blending itself with waste sand became available for christian mankindintrusive chaos and especially divine triglaph and his ferocities being well held aloofthis after all is the real history of our markgraves and of this by the nature of the case dryasdust can say nothing new mark which once meant brandenburg at large is getting subdivided into midmark into uckermark closest to the wends and in old mark and new much is spreading much getting planted and founded in the course of centuries there will grow gradually to be seven cities and as many towns says one old jubilant topographer as there are days in the yearstruggling to count up 365 of them     of berlin city  in the year guessed to be 1240 one ascanier markgraf fortifies berlin that is first makes berlin a german burg and inhabited outpost in those partsthe very name some think means little rampart wehrlin built there on the banks of the spree against the wends and peopled with dutch of which latter fact it seems the old dialect of the place yields traces nicolai beschreibung der koniglichen residenzstadte berlin und potsdam berlin 1786 i pp 16 17 of einleitung nicolai rejects the wehrlin etymology admits that the name was evidently appellative not proper the berlin to the berlin finds in the world two objects one of them at halle still called the berlin and thinks it must have meant in some language of extinct mortals wild pasturegroundthe scrubs as we should call itpossible perhaps likely how it rose afterwards to be chosen for metropolis one cannot say except that it had a central situation for the now widened principalities of brandenburg the place otherwise is sandy by nature sand and swamp the constituents of it and stands on a sluggish river the color of oil wendish fishermen had founded some first nucleus of it long before and called their fishinghamlet coln which is said to be the general wendish title for places founded on piles a needful method where your basis is swamp at all events coln still designates the oldest quarter in berlin and coln on the spree cologne or coln on the rhine being very different continued almost to modern times to be the official name of the capital  how the dutch and wends agreed together within their rampart inclusive of both is not said the river lay between they had two languages peace was necessary it is probable they were long rather on a taciturn footing but in the oily river you do catch various fish coln amid its quagmires and straggling sluggish waters can be rendered very strong some husbandry wet or dry is possible to diligent dutchmen there is room for trade also spree havel elbe is a direct waterroad to hamburg and the ocean by the oder which is not very far you communicate with the baltic on this hand and with poland and the uttermost parts of silesia on that enough berlin grows becomes in about 300 years for one reason and another capital city of the country of these many countries the markgraves or electors after quitting brandenburg did not come immediately to berlin their next residence was tangermunde mouth of the tanger where little tanger issues into elbe a much grassier place than berlin and which stands on a hill clayandsand hill likewise advantageous for strength that berlin should have grown after it once became capital is not a mystery it has quadrupled itself and more within the last hundred years and i think doubled itself within the last thirty     markgraf otto iv or otto with the arrow  one ascanier markgraf and one only otto iv by title was a poet withal had an actual habit of doing verse there are certain socalled poems of his still extant read by dryasdust with such enthusiasm as he can get up in the old collection of minnesingers made by manesse the zurich burgermeister while the matter was much fresher than it now is rudiger von manesse who fought the austrians too made his sammlung collection in the latter half of the fourteenth century it was printed after many narrow risks of destruction in the interim in 1758bodmer and breitinger editingat zurich 2 vols 4to madrigals all minnesongs describing the passion of love how otto felt under itwell and also ill with little peculiarity of symptom as appears one of his lines is        ich wunsch ich were tot                 i wish that i were dead  the others shall remain safe in manesses collection  this same markgraf

head and is called otto mit dem pfoile otto sagittarius or otto with the arrow in consequence a markgraf who writes madrigals who does sieges with an arrow in his head who lies in a wooden cage jeered by the magdeburgers and proposes such a cone of ducats i thought him the memorablest of those forgotten markgraves and that his jolting lifepilgrimage might stand as the general sample multiply a year

markgraf a kurfurst or elector of the empire and always rather on the increase than otherwise but the territories were apt to be much split up to younger sons two or more markgraves at once the eldest for elector with other arrangements which seldom answer they had also fallen into the habit of borrowing money pawning redeeming a good deal with teutsch ritters and others then they puddled considerablyand to their loss seldom choosing the side that proved winnerin the general broils of the reich which at that time as we have seen was unusually anarchic none of the successfulest of markgraves latterly but they were regretted beyond measure in comparison with the next set that came as we shall see     chapter ix  burggraf friedrich iv  brandenburg and the hohenzollern family of nurnberg have hitherto no mutual acquaintanceship whatever they go each its own course wide enough apart in the worldlittle dreaming that they are to meet by and by and coalesce wed for better and

rudolfs successful friend was again a notable increaser of his house which finally under his greatgrandson named friedrich vi attained the electoral height of which there was already some hint well

the wont had been in such cases where the sons were willing and of good likelihood after such a spell of anarchy parties still ran higher than usual in the holy roman empire and wideyawning splits

did sit steady once in for the third time the hapsburgers got themselves elected as they still called it time after time always electedwith but one poor exception which will much concern my readers by

shadow of a saddle so to speak and are kaisers of austria at this hour steady enough of seat at last after many vain trials  for during those hundred and fifty yearsamong those six intercalary kaisers

king of bohemia and ludwig the bavarian with a contested election is kaiser  henry vii having thus perished suddenly his son johann scarcely yet come of age could not follow him as kaiser according to the fathers thought though in due time he prosecuted his advancement otherwise to good purpose and proved a very stirring man in the world by his fathers appointment to whom as kaiser the chance had fallen he was already king of bohemia strong in his right and in the favor of the natives though a titular competitor henry of the tyrol beaten off by the late kaiser was still extant whom however and all other perils johann contrived to weather growing up to be a farsighted stouthearted man and potent bohemian king widely renowned in his day he had a son and then two grandsons who were successively kaisers after a sort making up the luxemburg four we spoke of he did crusades one or more for the teutsch ritters in a shining mannerunhappily with loss of an eye nay ultimately by the aid of quack oculists with loss of both eyes an ambitious man not to be quelled by blindness man with much negotiation in him with a heavy stroke of fight too and temper nothing loath at it of which we shall see some glimpse by and by  the pity was for the reich if not for him he could not himself become kaiser perhaps we had not then seen henry viis fine enterprises like a fleet of halfbuilt ships go mostly to planks again on the waste sea had his son followed him but there was on the contrary a contested election austria in again as usual and again unsuccessful the late kaisers austrian

since known there an elder brother was out of spite as men thought decidedly against ludwig  in the eighth year came a fight that proved decisive fight at muhldorf on the inn 23th september 1322far down in those danube countries beyond where marlborough ever was where there has been much fighting first and last burggraf friedrich was conspicuously there a very great battle say the old bookssays hormayr in a new readable book hormayr oesterreichischer plutarch ii 3137 giving minute account of it ludwig rather held aloof rearward committed his business to the hohenzollern burggraf and to one schweppermann aided by a noble lord called rindsmaul cowmouth no less and by others experienced in such work friedrich the hapsburger der schone duke of austria and selfstyled kaiser a gallant handsome man breathed mere martial fury they say he knew that his brother leopold was on march with a reinforcement to him from the strasburg quarter and might arrive any moment but he could not waitperhaps afraid ludwig might runhe rashly determined to beat ludwig without reinforcement our rugged fervid hormayr though imitating tacitus and johannes von muller overmuch will instruct fully any modern that is curious about this big battle what furious charging worrying how it lasted ten hours how the blazing handsome friedrich stormed about and slew above fifty with his own hand to us this is the interesting point at one turn of the battle tenth hour of it now ending and the tug of war still desperate there arose a cry of joy over all the austrian ranks help coming helpand friedrich noticed a body of horse in austrian cognizance such the cunning of a certain man coming in upon his rear austrians and friedrich never doubted but it was brother leopold just getting on the ground and rushed forward doubly fierce doubly fierce and were doubly astonished when it plunged in upon them sharpedged as burggraf friedrich of nurnbergand quite ruined austrian friedrich austrian friedrich

magic kohler p 288to no purpose to deliver him and his poor spanish wife cried her eyes too literally outsight gone in sad fact  ludwig the bavarian reigned thenceforththough never on easy terms how grateful to friedrich of nurnberg we need not say for one thing he gave him all the austrian prisoners whom friedrich judiciously generous dismissed without ransom except that they should be feudally subject to him henceforth this is the third hohenzollern whom we mark as a conspicuous acquirer in the hohenzollern family this friedrich iv builder of the second story of the house if conrad original burggraf founded the house then figuratively speaking the able friedrich iii who was rudolf of hapsburgs friend built it one story high and here is a new friedrich his son who has added a second story

in such a welter with their spencers and their gavestons eight years after bannockburn and fourandtwenty before crecy that will date it for english readers  kaiser ludwig reigned some twentyfive years more in a busy and even strenuous but not a successful way he had good windfalls too for example brandenburg as we shall see he made friends reconciled himself to his brother kurpfalz and junior cousinry there settling handsomely and with finality the debatable points between them enemies too he made especially johann the luxemburger king of bohemia on what ground will be seen shortly who became at last inveterate to a high degree but there was one supremely sore element in his lot a pope at avignon to whom he could by no method make himself agreeable pope who put him under ban not long after that muhldorf victory and kept him so inexorable let poor ludwig turn as he might ludwigs german princes stood true to him declared in solemn diet the popes ban to be mere spent shot of no avail in imperial politics ludwig went vigorously to italy tried setting up a pope of his own but that did not answer nor of course tend to mollify the holiness at avignon  in fine ludwig had to carry this cross on his back in a sorrowful manner all his days the pope at last finding johann of bohemia in a duly irritated state persuaded him into setting up an antikaiserjohanns second son as antikaiserwho though of little account and called pfaffenkaiser parsons kaiser by the public might have brought new troubles had that lasted we shall see some ultimate glimpses of it farther on

late times the successfulest markgraves territories much split up among younger sons joint markgraves reigning which seldom answers yet to the last they always made stout fight for themselves walked the stage in a high manner and surely might be said to quit it creditably leaving such a brandenburg behind them chiefly of their making during the two centuries that had been given them before the night came  there were plenty of ascanier cousins still extant in those parts saxon dignitaries anhalt dignitaries lineal descendants of albert the bear to some of whom in usual times alberts inheritance would naturally have been granted but the times were of battle uncertainty contested election and the ascaniers i perceive had rather taken friedrich of austrias side which proved the losing one kaiser ludwig der baier would appoint none of these antikaiser friedrichs appointments if he made any could be only nominal in those distant northern parts ludwig after his victory of muhldorf preferred to consider the electorate of brandenburg as lapsed lying vacant ungoverned these three years and now become the kaisers again kaiser in consequence gave it to his son whose name also is ludwig the date of the investiture is 1323 year after that victory of muhldorf a date unfortunate to brandenburg we come now into a line of bavarian markgraves and then of luxemburg ones both of which are of fatal significance to brandenburg  the ascanier cousins high saxon dignitaries some of them gloomed mere disappointment and protested hard but could not mend the matter now or afterwards their line went out in saxony too in course of time gave place to the wettins who are still there the ascanier had to be content with the more pristine state of acquisitionshigh pedigrees old castles of ascanien and ballenstadt territories of anhalt or what else they hadand never rose again to the lost height though the race still lives and has qualities besides its pedigree we said the old dessauer leopold prince of anhaltdessau was the head of it in friedrich wilhelms time and to this day he has descendants catharine ii of russia was of anhaltzerbst a junior branch albert the bear if that is of any use to him has still occasionally notable representatives  ludwig junior kaiser ludwig the bavarians eldest son was still under age when appointed kurfurst of brandenburg in 1323 of course he had a stateholder viceregent statthalter then and afterwards in occasional absences of his a series of such kaisers councillors burggraf friedrich iv among them had to take some thought of brandenburg in its new posture who these brandenburg statthalters were is heartily indifferent even to dryasdustexcept that one of them for some time was a hohenzollern which circumstance dryasdust marks with the due note of admiration what he did there dryasdust admits is not written anywheregood we will hope and not evilbut only the diploma nominating him of date 1346 not in ludwigs minority but many years after that ended rentsch p 323 now exists by way of record a difficult problem he like the other regents and viceregents must have had little dreaming that it was intrinsically for a grandson of his own and long line of grandsons the name of this temporary statthalter the first hohenzollern who had ever the least concern with brandenburg is burggraf johann ii eldest son of our distinguished muhldorf friend friedrich iv and grandfather through another friedrich of burggraf friedrich viwhich last gentleman as will be seen did doubtless reap the sowings good and bad of all manner of men in brandenburg the same johann ii it was who purchased plassenburg castle and territory cheap for money down where the family afterwards had its chief residence hof town and territory

aboutwatchdogs of the gods apt sometimes to run into hunting instead of wardingwe will say nothing more of ludwig the baier or his posterity at present we will glance across to preussen and see for one moment what the teutsch ritters are doing in their new century it is the year 1330 johann ii at nurnberg as yet only coming to be burggraf by no means yet administering in brandenburg and ludwig junior seven years old in his new dignity there  the teutsch ritters after infinite travail have subdued heathen preussen colonized the country with industrious german immigrants banked the weichsel and the nogat subduing their quagmires into meadows and their waste streams into deep shipcourses towns are built konigsberg king ottocars town thoren thorn city of the gates with many others so that the wild population and the tame now lived tolerably together under gospel and lubeck law and all was ploughing and trading and a rich country which had made the teutsch ritters rich and victoriously at their ease in comparison but along with riches and the ease of victory the common bad consequences had ensued ritters given up to luxuries to secular ambitions ritters no longer clad in austere mail and prayer ritters given up to wantonness of mind and conduct solemnly vowing and quietly not doing without remorse or consciousness of wrong daily eating forbidden fruit ritters swelling more and more into the fattedox condition for whom there is but one doom how far they had carried it here is one symptom that may teach us  in the year 1330 one werner von orseln was grandmaster of these ritters the grandmaster who is still usually the best man they can get and who by theory is sacred to them as a grandlama or pope among cardinallamas or as an abbot to his monksgrandmaster werner we say had lain down in marienburg one afternoon of this year 1330 to take his siesta and was dreaming peaceably after a moderate repast when a certain devilridden mortal johann von endorf one of his ritters long grumbling about severity want of promotion and the like rushed in upon the good old man ran him through dead for a ducat voigt iv 474 482and consummated a parricide at which the very

eldest son having come of years the tutors or statthalters went homenot wanted except in cases of occasional absence henceforthand the young man endeavored to manage on his own strength his success was but indifferent he held on however for a space of twenty years better or worse he helped king edward iii at the siege of cambray ad 1339 michaelis i 279 whose french politics were often connected with the kaisers it is certain kurfurst ludwig served personally with 600 horse on good payment i conclude at that siege of cambrayand probably saw the actual black prince and sometimes dined with him as english readers can imagine in brandenburg he had many checks and difficult passages but was never quite beaten out which it was easy to have been  a man of some ability as we can gather though not of enough he played his game with resolution not without skill but from the first the cards were against him his fathers affairs going mostly ill were no help to his which of themselves went not well the brandenburgers mindful of their old ascanier sovereigns were ill affected to ludwig and the new bavarian sort the anhalt cousinry gloomed irreconcilable were never idle digging pitfalls raising troubles from them and others kurfurst ludwig had troubles enough which were fronted by him really not amiss which we wholly or all but wholly omit in this place     a resuscitated ascanier the false waldemar  the wickedest and worst trouble of their raising was that of the resuscitated waldemar ad 1345 false waldemar as he is now called in brandenburg books waldemar was the last or as good as the last of the ascanier markgraves and he two years before ludwig ever saw those countries died in his bed twentyfive good years ago and was buried and seemingly ended but no after twentyfive years waldemar reappears not buried or dead only shamburied shamdead have been in the holy land all this while doing pilgrimage and penance and am come to claim my own againwhich strangers are much misusing michaelis i 279  perkin warbeck postmortem richard ii dimitri of russia martin guerre of the causes celebres it is a common story in the world and needs no commentary now postmortem waldemar it is said was a millers man of the name of jakob rehback who used to be about the real waldemar in a menial capacity and had some resemblance to him he showed signets recounted experiences which had belonged to the real waldemar many believed in his pretension and took arms to assert it the reich being in much internal battle at the time poor kaiser ludwig with his avignon popes and angry kings johann wading in deep waters especially the disaffected cousinry or princes of anhalt believed and battled for postmortem waldemar who were thought to have got him up from the first kurfurst ludwig had four or five most sad years with himall the worse when the pfaffenkaiser king johanns son came on the stage in the course of them ad 1346 and kaiser ludwig yielding not indeed to him but to death vanished from it two years after elected 1314 muhldorf and election complete 1322 died 1347 age 60 leaving kurfurst ludwig to his own shifts with the pfaffenkaiser whom he could not now hinder from succeeding to the reich he tried hard set up he and others an antikaiser gunther of schwartzburg temporary antikaiser whom english readers can forget again he bustled battled negotiated up and down and ran across at one time to preussen to the teutsch ritterspresumably to borrow moneybut it all would not do the pfaffenkaiser carried it in the diet and out of the diet karl iv by title a sorry enough kaiser and by nature an enemy of ludwigs  it was in this whirl of intricate misventures that kurfurst ludwig had to deal with his false waldemar conjured from the deeps upon him like a new goblin where already there were plenty in the dance round poor ludwig of which nearly inextricable goblindance threatening brandenburg for one thing with annihilation and yet leading brandenburg abstrusely towards new birth and higher destinieshow will it be possible without raising new ghosts in a sense to give readers any intelligible notionhere flickering on the edge of conflagration after duty done is a poor note which perhaps the reader had better at the risk of superfluity still in part take along with him  kaiser henry vii who died of sacramental wine first of the luxemburg kaisers left johann still a boy of fifteen who could not become the second of them but did in time produce the second who again produced the third and fourth  johann was already king of bohemia the important young gentleman ottocars grandson whom we saw murdered at olmutz none yet knows by whom had left that throne vacant and it lapsed to the kaiser who the nation also favoring duly put in his son johann there was a competitor duke of the tyrol who claimed on loose grounds my wife was aunt of the young murdered king said he wherefore kaiser and johann after him rebutted this competitor but he long gave some trouble having great wealth and means he produced a daughter margaret heiress of the tyrolwith a terrible mouth to her face and none of the gentlest hearts in her bodythat was perhaps his principal feat in the world he died 1331 had styled himself king of bohemia for twenty yearsever since 1308but in the last two years of his life he gave it up and ceased from troubling having come to a beautiful agreement with johann  johann namely wedded his eldest son to this competitors fine daughter with the mouth year 1329 in this manner do not bohemia and the tyrol come together in my blood and in yours and both of us are made men said the two contracting partiesalas no the competitor duke father of the bride died some two years after probably with diminished hopes of it and king johann lived to see the hope expire dismally altogether there came no children there came noin fact margaret after a dozen years of wedlock in unpleasant circumstances broke it off as if by explosion took herself and her tyrol irrevocably over to kaiser ludwig quite away from king johannwho his hopes of the tyrol expiring in such dismal manner was thenceforth the bitter enemy of ludwig and what held of him  tyrol explosion was in 1342 and now keeping these preliminary dates and outlines in mind we shall understand the bigmouthed lady better and the consequences of her in the world     margaret with the pouchmouth  what principally raised this dance of the devils round poor ludwig i perceive was a marriage he had made three years before waldemar emerged of which were it only for the sake of the brides name some mention is permissible margaret of the tyrol commonly called by contemporaries and posterity maultasche mouthpoke pocketmouth she was the bridemarriage done at innspruck 1342 under furtherance of father ludwig the kaisersuch a mouth as we can fancy and a character corresponding to it this which seemed to the two ludwigs a very conquest of the goldenfleece under conditions proved the beginning of their worst days to both of them  not a lovely bride at all this maultasche who is verging now towards middle life withal and has had enough to cross her in the world was already married thirteen years ago not wisely nor by any means too well a terrible dragon of a woman has been in nameless domestic quarrels in wars and sieges with rebellious vassals claps you an iron cap on her head and takes the field when need is furious shebear of the tyrol but she has immense possessions if wanting in female charms she came by mothers from that duke of meran whom we saw get his death for cause in the plassenburg a hundred years ago antes p102 her ancestor was husband to an aunt of that homicided duke from him principally from him she inherits the tyrol carinthia styria is herself an only child the last of a line hugest heiress now going so that in spite of the mouth and humor she has not wanted for wooersespecially prudent fathers wooing her for their sons  in her fathers lifetime johann king of bohemia always awake to such symptoms of things and having very peculiar interests in this case courted and got her for his crownprince as we just saw a youth of great outlooks outlooks towards kaisership itself perhaps to whom she was wedded thirteen years ago and duly brought the tyrol for heritage but with the worst results heritage namely could not be had without strife with austria which likewise had claims far worse the marriage itself went awry johanns crownprince was a softnatured herr say the books why bring your big shebear into a poor deers den enough the marriage came to nothing except to huge brawlings far enough away from us and margaret pouchmouth has now divorced her bohemian crownprince as a nullity and again weds on similar terms kaiser ludwigs son our brandenburg kurfurstwho hopes possibly that he now may succeed as kaiser on the strength of his father and of the tyrol which turned out far otherwise  the marriage was done in the church of innspruck 10th february 1342 for we love to be particular kaiser ludwig happy man and many princes of the empire looking on little thinking what a coil it would prove at the high altar she stript off her veil symbol of wifehood or widowhood and put on a jungfernkranz maidensgarland symbolically testifying how happy ludwig junior still was they had a son by and by but their course otherwise and indeed thiswise too was much checkered  king johann seeing the tyrol gone in this manner gloomed terribly upon his crownprince flung him aside as a nullity go to moravia out of sight on an apanage you be crownprince no longerand took to fighting kaiser ludwig colleagued diligently with the hostile pope with the king of france intrigued and colleagued far and wide swearing by every method everlasting enmity to kaiser ludwig and set up his son karl as pfaffenkaiser nay perhaps he was at the bottom of postobit waldemar too in brief he raised he mainly this devilsdance in which kaiser ludwig having died poor kurfurst ludwig with maultasche hanging on him is sometimes near his wits end  johanns poor crownprince finding matters take this turn retired into mahren moravia as bidden margrave of mahren and peaceably adjusted himself to his character of nullity and to the loss of maultaschechose for the rest a new princess in wedlock with more moderate dimensions of mouth and did produce sons and daughters on a fresh score produced among others one jobst his successor in the apanage or margrafdom who as jobst or jodocus of mahren made some noise for himself in the next generation and will turn up again in reference to brandenburg in this history  as for margaret pouchmouth she with her new husband as with her old continued to have troubles pretty much as the sparks fly upwards she had fierce siegings after this and explosive procedureslittle short of monk schwartz who was just inventing gunpowder at the time we cannot hope she lived in elysian harmony with kurfurst ludwigthe reverse in fact and oftenest with the whole breadth of germany between them he in brandenburg she in the tyrol nor did ludwig junior ever come to be kaiser as his father and she had hoped on the contrary king johann of bohemias peopleit was they that next got the kaisership and kept it a new provocation to maultasche  ludwig and she had a son as we said prince of the tyrol and appendages titular margraf of mahren and much else by nature but alas he died about ten a precocious boyfancy the wild weeping of a maternal shebear and the father had already died in 1361 died kurfurst ludwig 1363 the boy 1366 maultasche herself a malicious world whispering that perhaps she poisoned them both the proud woman now old too pursed her big coarse lips together at such rumor and her big coarse soulin a gloomy scorn appealing beyond the world in a sorrow that the world knew not of she solemnly settled her tyrol and appendages upon the austrian archdukes who were children of her mothers sister whom she even installed into the actual government to make matters surer this done she retired to vienna on a pension from them there to meditate and pray a little before death came as it did now in a short year or two tyrol and the appendages continue with austria from that hour to this margarets little boy having died  margaret of the pouchmouth rugged dragoonmajor of a woman with occasional steel cap on her head and capable of swearing terribly in flanders or elsewhere remains in some measure memorable to me compared with pompadour duchess of cleveland of kendal and other highrouged unfortunate females whom it is not proper to speak of without necessity though it is often donemaultasche rises to the rank of historical she brought the tyrol and appendages permanently to austria was near leading brandenburg to annihilation raising such a goblindance round ludwig and it yet did abstrusely lead brandenburg towards a far other goal which likewise has proved permanent for it    chapter xii  brandenburg in kaiser karls time end of the bavarian kurfursts  kaiser ludwig died in 1347 while the false waldemar was still busy we saw karl iv johann of bohemias second son come to the kaisership thereupon johanns eldest nullity being omitted this fourth karlother three karls are of the charlemagne set karl the bald the fat and such like and lie under our horizon while charles fifth is of a still other set and known to everybodythis karl iv is the kaiser who discovered the well of karlsbad bath of karl known to tourists of this day and made the golden bull which i forbid all englishmen to take for an agricultural prize animal the thing being far other as is known to several  there is little farther to be said of karl in reichshistory an unesteemed creature who strove to make his time peaceable in this world by giving from the holy roman empire with both hands to every bullbeggar or readypayer who applied sad sign what the roman empire had come and was coming to the kaisers shield set up aloft in the roncalic plain in barbarossas time intimated and in earnest too ho every one that has suffered wrongintimates now ho every one that can bully me or has money in his pocket unadmiring posterity has confirmed the nickname of this karl iv and calls him pfaffenkaiser he kept mainly at prag ready for receipt of cash and holding well out of harms way in younger years he had been much about the french court in italy he had suffered troubles almost assassinations much blown to and fro poor light wretch on the chaotic winds of his timesteering towards no star  johann king of bohemia did not live to see karl an acknowledged kaiser old johann blind for some time back had perished two years before that eventbequeathing a heraldic symbol to the worlds history and to englands if nothing more poor man he had crusaded in preussen in a brilliant manner being fond of fighting he wrung silesia gradually by purchase and entreaty pretio ac prece from the polish king 13271341 kohler p 302 joined it firmly to bohemia and germanyunconsciously waiting for what higher destinies silesia might have for maultasche and the tyrol he brought sad woes on brandenburg and yet was unconsciously leading brandenburg by abstruse courses whither it had to go a restless ostentatious fargrasping stronghanded man who kept the world in a stir wherever he was all which has proved voiceless in the worlds memory while the casual shadow of a feather he once wore has proved vocal there worlds memory is very whimsical now and then  being much implicated with the king of france who with the pope was his chief stay in these final antiludwig operations johannin 1346 pfaffenkaiser karl just set on foothad led his chivalry into france to help against the english edwards who were then very intrusive there johann was blind but he had good ideas in war at the battle of crecy 24th august 1346 he advised we know not what but he actually fought though stoneblind tied his bridle to that of the knight next him and charged inlike an old blind warhorse kindling madly at the sound of the trumpetand was there by some english lance or yew laid low they found him on that field of carnage field of honor too in a sort his old blind face looking very blindly to the stars on his shield was blazoned a plume of three ostrichfeathers with ich dien i serve written underwith which emblem every english reader is familiar ever since this editor himself in very tender years noticed it on the britannic majestys wardrums and had to inquire of children of a larger growth what the meaning might be  that is all i had to say of king johann and his ich dien of the luxemburg kaisers four in number two sons of karl still to come who except him of the sacramental wine with ich dien for son are good for little and deserve no memory from mankind except as they may stick not easily extricable to the history of nobler menof them also i could wish to be silent but must not must at least explain how they came in as luxemburg kurfursts in brandenburg and how they went out leaving brandenburg not annihilated but very near it     end of resuscitated waldemar kurfurst ludwig sells out  imaginary waldemar being still busy in brandenburg it was natural for kaiser karl to find him genuine and keep up that goblindance round poor kurfurst ludwig the late kaisers son by no means a lover of karls considerable support was managed to be raised for waldemar kaiser karl regularly infeoffed him as real kurfurst so far as parchment could do it and in case of his decease says karls diploma farther the princes of anhalt shall succeedludwig in any case is to be zero henceforth war followed or what they called war much confused invading bickering and throttling for two years to come most of the towns declared for waldemar and their old anhalt line of margraves ludwig and the bavarian sort are clearly not popular here ludwig held out strenuously however would not be beaten he had the king of denmark for brotherinlaw had connections in the reich perhaps still better he had the reichsinsignia lately his fathers still in hand he stood obstinate siege from the kaisers people and the anhalters shoutedin denmark to help started an antikaiser as we saidtemporary antikaiser gunther of schwartzburg whom the reader can forget a second timein brief ludwig contrived to bring kaiser karl and imaginary waldemar with his anhalters to a quietus and negotiation and to get brandenburg cleared of them year 1349 they went their ways and that devilsdance which had raged five years and more round ludwig was fairly got laid or lulled again  imaginary waldemar after some farther ineffectual wrigglings retired altogether into private life at the court of dessau and happily died before long died at the court of dessau the anhalt cousins treating him to the last as head representative of albert the bear and real prince waldemar for which they had their reasons portraits of this false waldemar still turn up in the german printshops in kloss vaterlandische gemalde ii 29 a sorry compilation above referred to without value except for the old excerpts c there is a copy of it and represent a very absurd fellow much muffled in drapery mouth partially open eyes wholly and widely sonever yet recovered from his astonishment at himself and things in general how it fared with poor brandenburg in these chaotic throttlings and vicissitudes under the bavarian kurfursts we can too well imagine and that is little to what lies ahead for it  however in that same year 1349 temporary quietus having come kurfurst ludwig weary of the matter gave it over to his brother have not i an opulent maultasche gorgonwife susceptible to kindness in the tyrol have not i in the reich elsewhere resources appliances thought kurfurst ludwig and gave the thing over to his next brother brother whose name also is ludwig as their fathers also had been three ludwigs at once for our dear germans shine in nomenclature ludwig the roman this new onethe elder brother our acquaintance being ludwig simply distinguishable too as kurfurst ludwig or even as ludwig senior at this stage of the affair kurfurst ludwig therefore year 1349 washes his hands of brandenburg while the quietus lasts retaining only the electorship and title and goes his ways resolving to take his ease in bavaria and the tyrol thenceforth how it fared with him there with his loving gorgon and him we will not ask farther they had always separate houses to fly to in case of extremity they held out better or worse twelve years more and ludwig left his little boy still surviving him in 1361     second and then third and last of the bavarian kurfursts in brandenburg  in brandenburg the new markgraf ludwig who we say is called the roman ludwig der romer having been in rome to distinguish him continued warring with the anarchies fifteen years in a rather tough manner without much victory on either sidemade his peace with kaiser karl however delivering up the reichsinsignia and tried to put down the domestic robbers who had got on foot many of them persons of quality michaelis i 282 till he also died childless ad 1365 having been kurfurst too since his brothers death for some four years  whereupon brandenburg electorship and all titles with it came to otto third son of kaiser ludwig who is happily the last of these bavarian electors they were an unlucky set of sovereigns not hitherto without desert and the unlucky country suffered much under them by far the unluckiest and by far the worst was this otto a dissolute drinking entirely worthless herr under whom for eight years confusion went worse confounded as if plain chaos were coming and brandenburg and otto grew tired of each other to the last degree  in which state of matters ad 1373 kaiser karl offered otto a trifle of ready money to take himself away otto accepted greedily sold his electorate and big mark of brandenburg to kaiser karl for an old song200000 thalers about 30000 pounds and only half of it ever paid michaelis i 283withdrew to his schloss of wolfstein in bavaria and there on the strength of that or other sums rolled deep as possible in every sort of debauchery and so in few years puddled himself to death foully ending the bavarian set of kurfursts they had lasted fifty years with endless trouble to the country and to themselves and with such mutual profit as we have seen     chapter xiii  luxemburg kurfursts in brandenburg  if brandenburg suffered much under the bavarian kurfursts for fifty years it was worse and approached to the state of worst under the luxemburgers who lasted for some forty more ninety years of anarchy in all which at length brought it to great need of help from the fates  karl iv made his eldest boy wenzel still only about twelve elector of brandenburg 1373 born 1361 wenzel shall be kaiser and king of bohemia one day thinks karlwhich actually came to pass and little to wenzels profit by and by in the mean while karl accompanied him to brandenburg which country karl liked much at the money and indeed ever after in his old days he seemed rather to busy himself with it he assembled some kind of stande states twice over got the country incorporated with bohemia by them and made tight and handy so far brandenburg shall rest from its woes and be a silent portion of bohemia henceforth thinks karlif the heavens so please karl a futile kaiser would fain have done something to encourage trade in brandenburg though one sees not what it was he did if anything he built the schloss of tangermunde and oftenest lived there in time coming a quieter place than even prag for him in short he appears to have fancied his cheap purchase and to have cheered his poor old futile life with it as with one thing that had been successful poor old creature he had been a kaiser on false terms ho every one that dare bully me or that has money in his pocketa kaiser that could not but be futile in five years time he died king of bohemia 1346 on his fathers death kaiser acknowledged on ludwig the baiers death 1347 died 1378 age 62 and doubtless was regretted in brandenburg and even in the reich in comparison with what came next  in brandenburg he left instead of one indifferent or even bad governor steadily tied to the place and in earnest to make the best of it a fluctuating series of governors holding loose and not in earnest which was infinitely worse these did not try to govern it sent it to the pawnbroker to a fluctuating series of pawnbrokers under whom for the next fiveandthirty years brandenburg tasted all the fruits of nongovernment that is to say anarchy or government by the pawnbroker and sank faster and faster towards annihilation as it seemed that was its fate under the luxemburg kurfursts who made even the bavarian and all others be regretted  one thing kaiser karl did which ultimately proved the saving of brandenburg made friendship with the hohenzollern burggraves these johann ii temporary stutthalter johann and his brother who were coregents in the family domain when karl first made appearancehad stood true to kaiser ludwig and his son so long as that play lasted at all nay one of these burggraves was talked of as kaiser after ludwigs death but had the wisdom not to try kaiser ludwig being dead they still would not recognize the pfaffenkaiser karl but held gloomily out so that karl had to march in force into the nurnberg country and by great promises by considerable gifts and the example of the other princes of the empire halloweve 1347 on the field of nurnberg agreement was come to rentsch p 326 brought them over to do homage  after which their progress and that of their successor johanns son friedrich v in the grace of karl was something extraordinary karl gave his daughter to this friedrich vs eldest son appointed a daughter of friedrichs for his own second prince the famed sigismund famed that is to bewhich latter match did not take effect owing to changed outlooks after karls death nay there is a deed still extant about marrying children not yet born karl to produce a princess within five years and burggraf friedrich v a prince for that purpose rentsch p 336 but the burggraf never had another prince though karl produced the due princess and was ready for his share unless indeed this strange eagerlooking document not dated in the old books may itself relate to the above wedding which did come to passyears before that karl had made his muchesteemed burggraf friedrich v captaingeneral of the reich imperial vicar substitute if need were and much besides nay had given him the landgraviate of elsass alsaceso far as lay with him to giveof which valuable country this friedrich had actual possession so long as the kaiser lived best of men thought the poor light kaiser never saw such a man  which proved a salutary thought after all the man had a little boy fritz not the betrothed to karls princess still chasing butterflies at culmbach when karl died in this boy lie new destinies for brandenburg towards him and not towards annihilation are karl and the luxemburg kurfursts and pawnbrokers unconsciously guiding it     chapter xiv  burggraf friedrich vi  karl left three young sons wenzel sigismund johann and also a certain nephew much older all of whom now more or less concern us in this unfortunate history  wenzel the eldest son heritable kurfurst of brandenburg as well as king of bohemia was as yet only seventeen who nevertheless got to be kaiser 1378 on his fathers deathand went widely astray poor soul the nephew was no other than margrave jobst of moravia son of maultasches late nullity there now in the vigor of his years and a stirring man to him for a time the chief management in brandenburg fell in these circumstances wenzel still a minor and already kaiser and king of bohemia gave up brandenburg to his two younger brothers most of it to sigismund with a cutting for johann to help their apanages and applied his own powers to govern the holy roman empire at that early stage of life  to govern the holy roman empire poor soulor rather to drink beer and dance with the girls in which if defective in other things wenzel had an eminent talent he was one of the worst kaisers and the least victorious on record he would attend to nothing in the reich the prag white beer and girls of various complexion being much preferable as he was heard to say he had to fling his poor queens confessor into the river

ruinous extent  he ended by apoplexy or sudden spasm of the heart terrible zisca as it were killing him at secondhand for zisca stout and furious blind of one eye and at last of both a kind of human

having given it up in time never did any ill to that poor country     sigismund is kurfurst of brandenburg but is king of hungary also  the real kurfurst of brandenburg all this while was sigismund wenzels next brother under tutelage of cousin jobst or otherwisereal and yet imaginary for he never himself governed but always had jobst of mahren or some other in his place there sigismund as above said was to have married a daughter of burggraf friedrich v and he was himself as was the young lady well inclined to this arrangement but the old people being dead and some offer of a kings daughter turning up for sigismund sigismund broke off and took the kings daughter king of hungarysnot without regret then and afterwards as is believed at any rate the hungarian charmer proved a wife of small merit and a hungarian successor she had was a wife of light conduct even hungarian charmers and hungarian affairs were much other than a comfort to sigismund  as for the disappointed princess burggraf friedrichs daughter she said nothing that we hear silently became a nun an abbess and through a long life looked out with her thoughts to herself upon the loud whirlwind of things where sigismund oftenest like an imponderous rag of conspicuous color was riding and tossing her two brothers also joint burggraves after their fathers death seemed to have reconciled themselves without difficulty the elder of them was already sigismunds brotherinlaw married to sigismunds and wenzels sisterby such predestination as we saw burggraf johann iii was the name of this one a stout fighter and manager for many years much liked and looked to by sigismund as indeed were both the brothers for that matter always together or in succession a kind of righthand to sigismund friedrich the younger burggraf and ultimately the survivor and inheritor johann having left no sons is the famed burggraf friedrich vi the last and notablest of all the burggraves a man of distinguished importance extrinsic and intrinsic chief or among the very chief of german public men in his timeand memorable to posterity and to this history on still other grounds but let us not anticipate  sigismund if apanaged with brandenburg alone and wedded to his first love not a kings daughter might have done tolerably well therebetter than wenzel with the empire and bohemia did but delusive fortune threw her golden apple at sigismund too and he in the wide high world had to play strange pranks his fatherinlaw died in hungary sigismunds first wife his only child fatherinlaw bequeathed hungary to sigismund 1387 sigismunds age then twenty who plunged into a strange sea thereby got troubles without number beatings not a fewand had even to take boat and sail for his life down to constantinople at one time in which sad adventure burggraf johann escorted him and as it were tore him out by the hair of the head these troubles and adventures lasted many years in the course of which sigismund trying all manner of friends and expedients found in the burggraves of nurnberg johann and friedrich with their talents possessions and resources the main or almost only sure support he got  no end of troubles to sigismund and to brandenburg through him from this sublime hungarian legacy like a remote fabulous goldenfleece which you have to go and conquer first and which is worth little when conquered before ever setting out ad 1387 sigismund saw too clearly he would have cash to raise an operation he had never done with all his life afterwards he pawned brandenburg to cousin jobst of mahren got 20000 bohemian guldeni guess a most slender sum if dryasdust would but interpret it this was the beginning of pawnings to brandenburg of which when will the end be jobst thereby came into brandenburg on his

of six hundred swinei have seen by reading in those old books certain noble gentlemen of putlitz i think driving them openly captured by the stronger hand and have heard the short querulous squeak of the bristly creatures what is the use of being a pig at all if i am to be stolen in this way and surreptitiously made into ham pigs do continue to be bred in brandenburg but it is under such discouragements agriculture trade wellbeing and welldoing of any kind it is not encouragement they are meeting here probably few countries not even ireland have a worse outlook unless help come pauli i 541612 michaelis i 283285 jobst came back in 1398 after eight years absence but no help came with jobst the neumark part of brandenburg which was brother johanns portion had fallen home to sigismund brother johann having died but sigismund far from redeeming old pawntickets with the newmark pawned the newmark toothe second pawnage of brandenburg pawned the newmark to the teutsch ritters for 63000 hungarian gold gulden i think about 30000 pounds and gave no part of it to jobst had not nearly enough for himself and his hungarian occasions  seeing which and hearing such squeak of pigs surreptitiously driven with little but discordant sights and sounds everywhere jobst became disgusted with the matter and resolved to wash his hands of it at least to have his money out of it again having sold what of the domains he could to persons of quality at an uncommonly easy rate and so pocketed what ready cash there was among them he made over his pawnticket or properly he himself repawned brandenburg to the saxon potentate a speculative moneyed man markgraf of meissen wilhelm the rich so called pawned it to wilhelm the richsum not named and went home to moravia there to wait events this is the third brandenburg pawning let us hope there may be a fourth and last     brandenburg in the hands of the pawnbrokers rupert of the pfalz is kaiser  and so we have now reached that point in brandenburg history when if some help do not come brandenburg will not long be a country but will either get dissipated in pieces and stuck to the edge of others where some government is or else go waste again and fall to the bisons and wild bears  who now is kurfurst of brandenburg might be a question i unquestionably sigismund would answer with astonishment soft your hungarian majesty thinks jobst till my cash is paid may it not probably be another this question has its interest the electors just now ad 1400 are about deposing wenzel must choose some better kaiser if they wanted another scion of the house of luxemburg a mature old gentleman of sixty full of plans plausibilities pretensionsjobst is their man jobst and sigismund were of one mind as to wenzels going at least sigismund voted clearly so and jobst said nothing counter but the kurfursts did not think of jobst for successor after some stumbling they fixed upon rupert kurpfalz elector palatine ruprecht von der pfalz as kaiser  rupert of the pfalz proved a highly respectable kaiser lasted for ten years 14001410 with honor to himself and the reich a strong heart strong head but short of means he chastised petty mutiny with vigor could not bring down the milanese visconti who had perched themselves so high on money paid to wenzel could not heal the schism of the church double or triple pope romeavignon affair or awaken the reich to a sense of its old dignity and present loose condition in the late loose times as antiquaries remark kohler p 334 who quotes schilter most members of the empire petty princes even and imperial towns had been struggling to set up for themselves and were now concerned chiefly to become sovereign in their own territories and schilter informs us it was about this period that most of them attained such rather unblessed consummation rupert of himself not able to help it with all his willingness the people called him rupert klemm rupert smithsvice from his resolute ways which nicknamegiven him not in hatred but partly in satirical goodwillis itself a kind of history from historians of the reich he deserves honorable regretful mention  he had for empress

again had a grandson made in his own likeness only still more of iron in his compositionenough now of rupert smithsvice who died in 1410 and left the reich again vacant  ruperts funeral is hardly done when over in preussen far off in the memel region place called tannenberg where there is still a churchyard to be seen if little more the teutsch ritters had unexpectedly a terrible defeat consummation of their polish miscellaneous quarrels of long standing and the end of their high courses in this world a ruined teutsch ritterdom as good as ruined ever henceforth kaiser rupert died 18th may and on the 15th july within two months was fought that dreadful battle of tannenbergpoland and polish king with miscellany of savage tartars and revolted prussians versus teutsch ritterdom all in a very high mood of mutual rage the very elements wild thunder tempest and raindeluges playing chorus to them on the occasion voigt vii 82 busching erdbeschreibung hamburg 1770 ii 1038 ritterdom fought lionlike but with insufficient strategic and other wisdom and was driven nearly distracted to see its pride tripped into the ditch by such a set vacant reich could not in the least attend to it nor can we farther at present     sigismund with a struggle becomes kaiser  jobst and sigismund were competitors for the kaisership wenzel too striking in with claims for reinstatement the house of luxemburg divided against itself wenzel finding reinstatement not to be thought of threw his weight such as it was into the scale of cousin jobst remembering angrily how brother sigismund voted in the deposition case ten years ago the contest was vehement and like to be lengthy jobst though he had made over his pawnticket claimed to be elector of brandenburg and voted for himself the like with still more emphasis did sigismund or burggraf friedrich acting for him sigismund sure is kurbrandenburg though under pawn argued friedrichand i almost guess though that is not said produced from his own purse at some stage of the business the actual money for jobst to close his brandenburg pretension  both were elected majority contested in this manner and old jobst then above seventy was like to have given much trouble but happily in three months he died jodocus barbatus 21st july 1411 and sigismund became indisputable jobst was the son of maultasches nullity him too in an involuntary sort she was the cause of in his day jobst made much noise in the world but did little or no good in it he was thought a great man says one satirical old chronicler and there was nothing great about him but the beard  the cause of sigismunds success with the electors says kohler or of his having any party among them was the faithful and unwearied diligence which had been used for him by the abovenamed burggraf friedrich vi of nurnberg who took extreme pains to forward sigismund to the empire pleading that sigismund and wenzel would be sure to agree well henceforth and that sigismund having already such extensive territories hungary brandenburg and so forth by inheritance would not be so exact about the reichstolls and other imperial incomes this same friedrich also when the election fell out doubtful was sigismunds best support in germany nay almost his righthand through whom he did whatever was done kohler p 337  sigismund is kaiser then in spite of wenzel king of hungary after unheardof troubles and adventures ending some years ago in a kind of peace and conquest he has long been king of bohemia too he at last became having survived wenzel who was childless kaiser of the holy roman empire and so much else is not sigismund now a great man truly the loom he weaves upon in this world is very large but the weaver was of headlong highpacing flimsy nature and both warp and woof were gone dreadfully entangled  this is the kaiser sigismund who held the council of constance and blushed visibly when huss about to die alluded to the letter of safeconduct granted him which was issuing in such fashion 15th june 1415 sigismund blushed but could not conveniently mend the matterso many matters pressing on him just now as they perpetually did and had done an alwayshoping neverresting unsuccessful vain and empty kaiser specious speculative given to eloquence diplomacy and the windy instead of the solid artsalways short of money for one thing he roamed about and talked eloquentlyaiming high and generally missinghow he went to conquer hungary and had to float down the donau instead with an attendant or two in a most private manner and take refuge with the grand turk this we have seen and this is a general emblem of him hungary and even the reich have at length become his but have brought small triumph in any kind and instead of ready money debt on debt his majesty has no money and his majestys occasions need it more and more  he is now ad 1414 holding this council of constance by way of healing the church which is sick of three simultaneous popes and of much else he finds the problem difficult finds he will have to run into spain to persuade a refractory pope there if eloquence can as it cannot all which requires money money at opening of the council he officiated as deacon actually did some kind of litanying with a surplice over him 25th december 1414 kohler p 340 though kaiser and king of the romans but this passage of his opening speech is what i recollect best of him there right reverend fathers date operam ut illa nefanda schisma eradicetur exclaims sigismund intent on having the bohemian schism well dealt withwhich he reckons to be of the feminine gender to which a cardinal mildly remarking domine schisma est generis neutrius schisma is neuter your majestysigismund loftily replies ego sum rex romanus et super grammaticam i am king of the romans and above grammar wolfgang mentzel geschichte der deutschen i 477 for which reason i call him in my notebooks sigismund super grammaticam to distinguish him in the imbroglio of kaisers     brandenburg is pawned for the last time  how jobsts pawnticket was settled i never clearly heard but can guess it was by burggraf friedrichs advancing the money in the pinch above indicated or paying it afterwards to jobsts heirs whoever they were thus much is certain burggraf friedrich these three years and more ever since 8th july 1411 holds sigismunds deed of acknowledgment for 100000 gulden lent at various times and has likewise got the electorate of brandenburg in pledge for that sum and does himself administer the said electorate till he be paid this is the important news but this is not all  the new journey into spain requires new moneys this council itself with such a pomp as suited sigismund has cost him endless moneys brandenburg torn to ruins in the way we saw is a sorrowful matter and except the title of it as a feather in ones cap is worth nothing to sigismund and he is still short of money and will forever be why could not he give up brandenburg altogether since instead of paying he is still making new loans from burggraf friedrich and the hope of ever paying were mere lunacy sigismund revolves these sad thoughts too amid his worldwide diplomacies and efforts to heal the church pledged for 100000 gulden sadly ruminates sigismund and 50000 more borrowed since by little and little and more ever needed especially for this grand spanish journey these were sigismunds sad thoughtsadvance me in a round sum 250000 gulden more said he to burggraf friedrich 250000 more for my manifold occasions in this timethat will be 400000 in whole rentsch pp 75 357and take the electorate of brandenburg to yourself land titles sovereign electorship and all and make me rid of it that was the settlement adopted in sigismunds apartment at constance on the 30th of april 1415 signed sealed and ratifiedand the money paid a very notable event in worldhistory virtually completed on the day we mention  the ceremony of investiture did not take place till two years afterwards when the spanish journey had proved fruitless when much else of fruitless had come and gone and kaiser and council were probablymore at leisure for such a thing done at length it was by kaiser sigismund in utmost gala with the grandees of the empire assisting and august members of the council and world in general looking on in the big square or marketplace of constance 17th april 1417is to be found described in rentsch from nauclerus and the old newsmongers of the time very grand indeed much processioning on horseback under powerful trumpetpeals and flourishes much stately kneeling stately rising stepping backwards done well zierlich on the kurfursts part liberal expenditure of cloth and pomp in short above 100000 people looking on from roofs and windows pauli allgemeine preussische staatsgeschichte ii 14 rentsch pp 7678 and kaiser sigismund in all his glory sigismund was on a high platform in the marketplace with stairs to it and from it the illustrious kaiserred as a flamingo with scarlet mantle and crown of golda treat to the eyes of simple mankind  what sum of modern money in real purchasing power this 400000 hungarian gold gulden is i have inquired in the likely quarters without result and it is probable no man exactly knows the latest existing representative of the ancient gold gulden is the ducat worth generally about a halfsovereign in english taking the sum at that latest rate it amounts to 200000 pounds and the reader can use that as a note of memory for the saleprice of brandenburg with all its lands and honorsmultiplying it perhaps by four or six to bring out its effective amount in current coin dogcheap it must be owned for size and capability but in the most waste condition full of mutiny injustice anarchy and highway robbery a purchase that might have proved dear enough to another man than burggraf friedrich  but so at any rate moribund brandenburg has got its hohenzollern kurfurst and started on a new career it little dreamt ofand we can now right willingly quit sigismund and the reichshistory leave kaiser sigismund to sink or swim at his own will henceforth his grand feat in life the wonder of his generation was this same council of constance which proved entirely a failure one of the largest windeggs ever dropped with noise and travail in this world two hundred thousand human creatures reckoned and reckoning themselves the elixir of the intellect and dignity of europe two hundred thousand nay some counting the lower menials and numerous unfortunate females say four hundred thousandwere got congregated into that little swiss town and there as an ecumenic council or solemnly distilled elixir of what pious intellect and valor could be scraped together in the world they labored with all their select might for four years space that was the council of constance and except this transfer of brandenburg to friedrich of hohenzollern resulting from said council in the quite reverse and involuntary way one sees not what good result it had  they did indeed burn huss but that could not be called a beneficial incident that seemed to sigismund and the council a most small and insignificant one and it kindled bohemia and kindled rhinoceros zisca into neverimagined flame of vengeance brought mere disaster disgrace and defeat on defeat to sigismund and kept his hands full for the rest of his life however small he had thought it as for the sublime four years deliberations and debates of this sanhedrim of the universeeloquent debates conducted we may say under such extent of wig as was never seen before or sincethey have fallen wholly to the domain of dryasdust and amount for mankind at this time to zero plus the burning of huss on the whole burggraf friedrichs electorship and the first hohenzollern to brandenburg is the one good result  adieu then to sigismund let us leave him at this his culminating point in the marketplace of constance red as a flamingo doing one act of importance though unconsciously and against his willi subjoin here for refreshment of the readers memory a synopsis or bare arithmetical list of those intercalary nonhapsburg kaisers
